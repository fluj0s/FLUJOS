scientology definitions i ot and clear defined lecture given on 29 november 1966 thank you thank you i like you too well i thought id better show face for any americans that hear that tape thats face but over here in england were down in the south country you know and they have peculiar accents the accent of sussex now is getting more and more american well whats the date audience twentynine november ad 16 twentynine nov ad 16 saint hill special briefing course and lecture one of the things thats very interesting is do you know that we now have majority of the major executives of scientology clear pretty good huh boy that took some doing too in the first place these people you know are the busiest of the people we just had swarm in here from washington and i made crack in bulletin or cable or something of the sort i think it was public statement wasnt it and it said to the effect that well it was wonder washington was doing so badly because so far we hadnt heard of any enthusiasm for getting clear in their top bracket and so forth well quite few of them were on the clearing course and they promptly went and got their emeters and audited literally day and night day and night day and night and couple of them showed up the other day three of them as matter of fact and they were clear but its pretty remarkable for somebody who is working twentyfour hours day to audit five more or something like that but thats very good so the trend i first noticed was the statistics of divisions which were headed by executives were in just about the same state as the state of the executive who was in charge of that division this was quite interesting it was rough coordination but it nevertheless was factual one so the executives who were worse off you see further on downnot worse off but further on down the release list they would have the lower statistics and those who were more progressed on up the line would have the better statistic it was quite interesting there was coordination between these two and since this feat of the major executives of scientology are now clear and so forth statistics are starting to take off and are starting to do very very well and this shows tremendous forecast for the general future of scientology and further than that and beyond that it shows tremendous forecast for different future for this planet actually of course i dont say that we will have to work at it and do it all by next year and neither do i say it will take the fifteen hundred years to fail taken by some organizations i didnt mention any names at all okay now this lecture begins series of lectures and i see the d of twhere is the exec sec so we can file an ethics chitactually didnt get the word out fast enough to the students because i expected stack of cards up here that high but next lecture well have them all right i wontim not giving any ethics chits just public announcements now we have many times tried to put together dictionary for scientology and although we make some progress in doing it it all requires certain amount of effort and action from myself thats all right come up tone again and the and next time get an announcement out faster so theevery time we try to do this dictionary project it requires some work from because the words are not always totally defined in books and so on so i sit down with tremendous administrative backlogor my administration is seldom backlogged so that would be fibbut tremendous administrative line to get through my research to do with everything else to do and so on and i just dont do it so we dont have our major dictionary but anyway we will have one of these days but we have certain words which perhaps students fall across common as well as esoteric words and if for the next few lectures if you get out stack of cards cardsdont write them all on list of paperlegibly thats the biggest gae there is is an illegible auditor poor old case supervisor sitting there iyou know i finally si finally solved all this ive got very powerful magnifying glass that has builtin crystal ball but if you will legibly write these words particularly those you honestly are curious about or you think other people have been curious about and hand them in to the lrh communicator saint hilllrh communicator saint hill will collect these things and he will pass them over to the lrh aide and you can give fistfuls of them and we will try to get through all of these things and probably not very exciting going over lot of words of this particular character the truth of the matter is the definitions and meanings of scientology have not from the most basic values on up ever completely been covered so you might get an entirely new insight into the whole thing so anyway i will try to make it exciting ill try to tell jokesget joe miller joke bookand try not to make it too dull but we will go over this and maybe amongst us we can dig up all the basic simple words you know i dont want the complicated words we can forget those we can just draw line through them in the text you know but its the basic simple words theres probablyi dont know what the vocabulary of scientology is but it probably doesnt exceed five hundred words or its about the same as basic english but there are lot of fringe words which you possibly think are scientology which arent you know like esoteric you know merely means exotically strange but i probably also in doing this exercise should get myself my historical dictionary and i probably ought to sit up here and go through the thing somewhat exhaustively for clarification of these things i got an historical dictionary i got childs dictionary ive got an oxford abridged dictionary now the oxford abridged dictionary couldnt be carried across the room by strong porter so god help us if we ever got hold of their full edition i probably should get hold of skeats i thinkthats not something you trapshoot thats something that gives the derivation of words and how they got that way but regardless of all of that i think it might be very beneficial as runovera general runover of scientology see im doing so much research on things i cant talk about that i had to find something you see that i could talk about and the something i can talk about is in actual fact words and definitions and i see staring in the face the first word to be defined which i will take up with you now without further preamble or preludethat means something that goes before preamble is that part of the constitution which the people found most desirable in the united states and which is not part of the enforceable law of the constitution i always got big kick out of that you know they told everybody that the preamble of the constitution and people more or less think its law life liberty and the pursuit of happiness and the declaration of independence and all of this sort of thingall of the things that were good you know in the constitution and really were hot and so forth one of the first actions of the supreme court was to say they werent part of law not enforceable the government cannot be forced to deliver the pursuit of happiness or the happiness of anybody and boy do they carry that out it isnt that the us government is worse than the english government its that were in england and the english government you see would be insulted and the us government cant get at now if i were lecturing in washington at this particular time i would have to take the english government you see over the rolly coasters i will give lecture sometime on the subject of can one get along with government you know they used to say you can do business with hitler and then you cant do business with hitler well can you do business with government interesting and challenging question of course we all know the answer and that brings us up to word number one as i said and that is ot now why that is the first word on the list i dont know since its the toppest word that would have to be defined operating thetan now i have to write an essay on that subject for auditor 19 which is almost ready to go to press but has one little column missing and so forth so if i defined that now i would spend all my enthusiasm for defining it in that auditor so operating operating simply means to operate or manipulate or handle you operate an emeter you operate car you operate steam engine railway locomotive ship you see operate and that is that one also oneself can operate he can fly around and do this and that he himself is operative in other words he is able to operate the word has been appropriated by the medical profession as method of torture under law but that is not part of the definition in psychiatry its legalized euthanasia which means mercy killing only i dont think you can even call that mercy killingprefrontal lobotomies and transorbital leukotomies and that sort of thing that they do in psychiatry its just outright murder anyway this word operating it merely means to manipulate handle operate and thetan of course is the greek word theta the greek word theta traditionally amongst the greek philosophers unless my memory fails was the symbol the letter of the alphabet which was used to determine thought it was their letter of the alphabet for thought that is not original with us the word theta but under ordinary its like in mathematical equation youve got x c always means constant in mathematical equation well greek philosopher when he was talking and he included the idea or live thought or something like that then he used this word theta which is circle with bar across it now in entering lot of scientology terminology is engineering in derivation or manipulation or handling and the modern way of making something into noun would be to add an n to it you make an adjective with anicic something like thatbut you add an n to something and you have noun the trouble in scientology has been that we did not dare usemostly because the phenomena themselves didnt exist in other mental studies and other religious studiesactually there was phenomenon they didnt know the phenomenon so of course they could have name for what they didnt know so there was whole field there where you had to have nomenclature well it isnt in human experience and it isnt in the traditional fields but in this particular case this letter theta is in the traditional field and its in the traditional field of greek philosophy and by it however we have altered its meaning we mean life unit we mean being an individual who is alive and who is capable of thinking and i think you may find that some of the greek philosophers also gave it that designation when they said thoughtthat was the thought in person as opposed to his body the idea by the way that there is spirit inhabiting the body is the oldest traditional concept of man not the newest the johnnycome lately one is that all men are rats and perhaps that was based on experience with other psychologists yeah you dont need joe millers joke book i cani can get these in but you better get one i might slip up one day so we have thetan which means the being now the being or life unit is the individual who inhabits the clay i wouldnt call it common clay because look at marilyn monroe you know who inherits thethe being inherits this stuff and mushes moves it around in other words it gets body and moves it around now to that degree anybody who can move is reallyis really operating as thetan see anybody who can move is doing that but that isnt what we mean we mean somebody who can operate without body and that means somebody who can not only operate bodies who can operate without body and that was its original meaning now the definition of an operating thetan is beingand this gives us our extreme specialized definitionand that means being who is cause over thought life matter energy space and time cause over it by cause in this effect we mean the communication formula of cause distance effect an individual who is cause is being source of action or impulse and so on now therefore we mean by this somebody who can operate without the encumbrances of the common clay now this is different than clear as we will go into when we get to clear but its quite different than clear because actually there are degrees not of ot but degrees of condition of thetan as ive just said every thetan is unless hes knocked flat outyou know unless hes been eating some of the recent food preservativesthis fellow is operating to some degree even if hes just an effect you see heshe still can put out an impulse see hes mostly effect but he can put out little bit of an impulse see well actually that would be an interiorized thetan who was very wog and the word wog of course is in essence worthy oriental gentleman as been defined by the royal air force theres nothing derogatory in being called wog as matter of fact that was the source of general order issued in egypt on the complaint of the egyptian government the air force officers were calling egyptians wogs so the commanding officer defined it and he said well wog that means worthy oriental gentleman and insisted his officers use it those were in the days when the empire wasnt dead anyway this means common ordinary runofthemill gardenvariety humanoid and gardenvariety humanoid means person who has human characteristics by which we definenot that he is human in his treatment of thingshe isnt its simply that he is bodyhe is body when you get way downhill you get person who is body he isnt there as spirit at all spirit is dead into the mest of theyou know theits dead into the matter energy space and time and it itself isnt alive the matter energy space and time is animate do you see he isnt there at all he doesnt know hes there you see nothing hes you know wog all right naturally hell develop philosophy that says everything is matter including himself see now that isnt the bottom end of the scale i couldnt really tell you where the bottom end of the scale is havent been down therelately at least the bottom end of the scale however would have in it as scalethere would be psychotic neurotic the person who was just totally motionless all the time didnt even know they were mest you know psychiatrist commissar other undesirable things insect is above those thats way upscale now where weve got the idea of gradientsa little more of something little more of somethingor when we see that something can be more and more and higher and higher and so on up scale wed see that in measuring this scale we get the top end of it there isat the top end why we have actually not ot that is not the top end of the scale and boy that baffled you didnt it at the top end of the scale would be the lower harmonic of the boti mean on the lower harmonic youd have the bottom of the scale and thats always true by harmonic we mean it repeats characteristic top end of the scale would be thetan who didnt have to operate see he didnt have to at all hed be in total almost unattainable absolute dont you see but he theoretically would be in state where he was so serene calm disassociated with the physical universe that he wasnt even in it he wasnt even in the time stream he had nothing to do with anything and so forth now that would be the theoretical top of the scale and that would be thetan who did not have to operate now as you see person with present time problem is not over the present time problem as long as he has to do something about it have youdid you ever notice that by the way when person has problem you think youve gotten rid of the problem but he says well i can take care of that now i can go out and see you know you havent gotten rid of the problem yet hes got to do something about it do you see very often preclears of very inexperienced auditors go springing out of the chair after having had problem handled to go handle the problem and you notice that the preclear doesnthas to still handle the problem you have not handled it as problem thats pretty remarkable but that lays in stricture on it of fantastically thorough handling of the problem its almost unimaginably thorough handling of the problem not to have himnot to have severe problem if guy has severe problem thats actually in the universe its in present time right now and the handling of that problem would have to be so good on the auditors part that he didnt have to do anything about it and what do you know if heif the auditor does this its strange phenomenon that the problem thereafter cannot affect the pc this is one of the goofinesses in other words man makes himself the subject of effect you know he actually elects to get his brains blown out in some way or another he does even if it was only being there and communicating see he was there and visible so he got his brains blown out do you see well to that degree why he was the effect of something now an individual at the bottom of this scale that leads up to ot and through ot of course is the effect of everything he can cause nothing now the individual at the total top of the scale would be potentially able to cause everything and anythinglife thought matter energy space and timeand would not have to cause anything would be under compulsion of causing anything he would however be in nogames condition and one of the characteristics of the thetan the idiot is he likes to have game going so just below this point of theoretical absolute of thetan who didnt have to operate you would have an operating thetan and he could operate and would operate do you understand even if it was only building his own universe and doing something hell mess around see its one of those characteristics basic and native characteristics of thetanhe messes around he can actually not do it but he gets bored after youve sat around while being totally serene and totally benign and totally you consider that youre being much too absolute and you decide to go out and put strange and unfamiliar mockup in the middle of somebody elses universe you know you go out and see what will happen but todaytoday we have different being than the theoretical state of the individual who existed at the beginning of the universe that individual was totally potential and had experience he could totally potentially have all experience but he didnt have any he potentially could know everything but he distupid as well i wouldnt go on do you understand so hed soak himself down scale and he finally got to state where he couldnt regulate his own state and then he was in trouble and he went right on down the scale and he fell out the bottom now when you put somebody back to the level of operating thetan youre putting somebody back there who is different than any being who has ever been on the track where there is never really been one on the trackbecause hes operating with experience now before there has never been in the history of the universe anything more than released ot so we must get the difference between clear ot and released ot so there are two different types of ot now fellow whos released ot is just temporarily up and feeling high and great but he can fall on his head clear ot particularly because of experience and so forth it would be very very difficult indeedif at all possibleto make him fall on his head so the way we use ot is we really mean clear ot thats what we really mean when we say were going for ot all right we mean clear ot and so therefore you must always be careful to use the word release ahead of an ot who is simply an exterior so you see youd say oh well i dont let somebody jump out of aout of level iii session or something where theyve all of sudden gone and find themselves as tall as the empire state building and are walking around with their feet in the atlantic being lord of all they survey and so forth this person is not an ot this person is released ot the funny part of it is he may stay that way for centuries he may stay that way for five minutes but do not send to find for whom the bell tolls the rest of his bank sooner or later is going to catch up with him now therefore when you make person who is exterior and conceives himself to be powerful on the lower levelswhich you very often will doyou are making released ot and the definition is of course somebody who is exterior he is temporarily exterior now there is whole line which parallels the line of clearing so there are two lines involved here theres the line of how much less bank does fellow have see its less and less bankthe person is going clearer and clearerand how much is he out of his bank so you can release person out of his bank the bank still exists you see and that is release but the individual actually with less and less bank eventually becomes clear which is bank and compulsion to make bank and that is clear do you follow well these states are actually not as absolute as you would imagine but the whole subject of exterior is another linethe subject of exterior you know you can take almost any human being with some techniques that we had back in 1952 you can bang almost anybody out of his head and he at that moment will exhibit the characteristics of thetan exteriora being not influenced by body so when we say thetan exterior we simply mean being who is not influenced by body thats all we mean hes out of his body its an interesting side commentary on some past mental studies and so forth that they considered this an insane condition ive conducted research across this line as matter of fact by taking an insane person and exteriorizing him you instantly have sane person so that real exteriorization is quite phenomenal the only trouble is its very temporary and if you do it very often to the individual or if he bangs back into the bodysome of them last three days some of them last three months you know some of them last three hundred years as ive got some evidence but the point im making here is that its simply an exterior being you know the change of state is the lack of influence of the body that is what brings about the change of state now body can influence person so much that an individual exhibiting neurotic circumstances or characteristics in body will not exhibit them out of body but at the same time he occasionally because they are his aberrations not the aberrations of the body you exteriorize somebody and he will still have his aberrations hell still have some aberrations when he gets outside hell be able to handle them better but he still has some aberrations particularly physical ones you say well what is he doing outside with physical aberration well its hilarious when you try to cure somebodys cough by curing his body ailments that when you exteriorize him you find out that it is the thetan whos coughing hell be out there twelve feet back of his head going cough cough cough cough hell be the first one that recognizes it hell say oh i always thought it was the body coughing its ho ho but it would have been very very very careless observation if not criminal misreporting to say that person extthat exteriorization only exists amongst the insane you recognize that as suppressive statement to prevent people from exteriorizing that they knew about it and didnt investigate it any better than that is also very bad commentary but of course they had technology by which it could be done now actually gautama siddhartha in 523 bc was exteriorizing people and he was banging them out of their head left and right and they were making state called bodhi from which you get the word buddha now anybody who exteriorizes is buddha in scientology we can make buddha in thirty seconds see our technology on this is better which is quite startling in itself the lamas further extension of buddhism tried to develop practices which assisted exteriorization and those developments did exist and they did assist exteriorization and that is the basic goal of the lama also now when he doesnt make it and cant get out of his head then he talks about benign conduct do you understand he wasnt able in actual fact to attain bodhi which is exteriorization so he redefines the word bodhi as somebody who is calm and benign and serene im not now talking now out of knowledge of the current texts of buddhism im telling you the hot dope very very difficult to exteriorize some peopleso difficult to exteriorize them that they think they are body now some people who dont think they are body are also difficult to exteriorize because of the mental masses and so forth which pin them into the body you can cheer up now golly i didnt know my postulates were getting that bad you know and this is very uncertain procedureexteriorizing somebody but buddha worked on it long while and its uncertain and difficult to do some people cant do it at all and so on well what prevents person from exteriorizing is the mental mass called mind and this is the composite of his own pictures and aberrations and these pin him to the body do you see so some people have more in restimulation than others and so theyre much harder to exteriorize than others and because theyre still able to develop this and it can still come in contact with the body they snap back in with the greatest of ease and they cant operate outside you get this difference they cant operate outside they need body to drive car now thetan exterior then is lower state and perfectly valid scientology statethetan exteriorand that is below the level of operating thetan and this what gives the word operating thetan its substance and definition thetan exterior is in actual fact somebody whos simply outside his body now it doesnt matter whether he has body or not if hes outside of body hes thetan exterior so that everybody sooner or later is thetan exterior he kicks the bucket and he has to be thetan exterior to go pick up another body do you see it doesnt matter whether he was knowing or unknowing or otherwise youll find out that its mostly the worry about getting body that makes those periods very very unhappy as matter of fact person is quite often very well off during those periods except hes so worried he isnt talking to anybody and things areyou know he doesnt really get chance to find out if he can go very long without food you know and kool cigarettes or cocacolas you know lrh smooked kool butso then this state is common to mankind but he has very low reality on it and he doesnt think hes ever lived before because he identifies himself thoroughly with the body he is in he identifies himself so thoroughly with it that he says he himself doesnt exist well this is the total of suppression and invalidation isnt it fellow must have been suppressed and invalidated to the last nth to believe he didnt exist but the body did right now an operating thetan is thetan exterior who can have but doesnt have to have body in order to control or operate thought life matter energy space and time so its okay for him to be exterior now itsits almost in the past the state of release made this very complex so that somebody would bang out of his head suddenlyyou know somebody would knock the body off or something like thatand hed be out of his head bang you see there hed be see out of his head also in english you know is suppressive definition of cliché means somebody who is crazy not accidental that was knowing suppression so this fellow finds himself outside see and he cant do thing he can just about you know reactively go around and find the maternity ward of another hospital you know terrible you know he can barely get from the accident ward to the maternity ward you know total state of unknowing ness power of choice you know chooses any child at random doesnt do security check on the parents all he can do is crawl down the hall and get to the maternity ward you know and find out nyeaaa well thats good then now through some change or experience or some factor in life why few hundred years lateryou know hes been many times exterior but justoh one day why hebang and hes out of his body and he quote brings his fist you know he hasnt got one now you know down on the nearest table and says damn it that was mistake his fist doesnt go through the table and all of sudden with great mysteriousness he finds out that he has somehow or other regained through some way he doesnt quite know how he gets quite excited about it by the way he can write the only operating textbook that he has had has been ghost stories so he quite commonly goes and haunts castle thats what he thinks hes supposed to do now or something like that he hasnt had any games manual you see its fact see hewell now hes an operating thetan just like that you know he could pick up an automobile and pack it down the street well this happens very rarely indeed its every few trillenia but its happened sometimes it scares him so thoroughly that he promptly drops the ability before he hurts himself you see but he does this and he knows hes like this he knows hes like this and maybe hell go along for several hundred years in this kind of state of operation he gets into duel somebody kills the body and he gets outside the body and he picks up the sword and just cuts the other fellow into small mincemeat and you have these periods when witchcraft and that sort of thing are so well advertised you know then roman catholic churches not to name any organizations rise up in order to put it down funny things happen funny things well these are sufficiently rare and far apart and the people who observe them are usually so frightened that nobody credits them and so on because that is very rare state now you get the idea there are even two states of being more or less aware of yourself exterior fellow can be very aware of himself he can go running around and try talking to his friends and so forth and to hang around for two or three years and admire things and so forth whereas he actually in actual fact cant move anything and cant talk to anybody now you get an incident of this character fellow is swarming up scaling ladderattack on castle see now according to his reality he gets up to the top of the ladder he dodges bunch of greek fire that hits him in the teeth see and he throws that aside and he goes on up the ladder and he gets to the top of the ladder and he gets onto the battlement and hes got his broadsword and hes just hewing about him left and right till all of sudden he realizes that this thing he sees as broadsword is going through everybody but theyre not paying any attention to it and he looks over the battlement and he looks down into the moat and there was his recent body hes been dead for several minutes but in the enthusiasm of carrying on he hasnt noticed now most anybody sooner or later has had an experience of that its terribly embarrassing one feels very silly you know its like the girl doesnt know her slip is showing he hasnt noticed hes lost his body so that would be thetan exterior and this fellow might stay exterior for some time in very knowing state but this is only knowing state and he cant operate and he cant move anything and this makes him very upset indeed so he gets upset after while with the state of being exterior and goes and finds another body now buddha was interested in curing the deathbirth cycle why did you keep having to come back and pick up body why did you keep having to come back and pick up body what was all this about and he was trying to knock that out and some other people added the idea of nirvana and you became nothing and so forth afterwards that was added bywith trimmings but it was just to knock off this thing of having to pick up another body and another identity all the time and mess it up like that that was the aim and goal of buddhism it didnt have the aim and goal that the fellow ought to be able to operate to that degree we have enormously exceeded any limits ever put in this direction before now suleiman is one of the characters of arab famenot solomon only he might be for all i knowyou read about him in the arabian nights and he put all the jinns in bottles and threw themwith brass stoppersand threw them in the ocean well i dont know what he didprobably ran an implant stationbut he and the catholic church have had actually periods of being extremely active in knocking out any possibility that any thetan would ever come uphill far enough to be an operating thetan people become terrified of these beings your biggest forward menace in scientology is that the world becomes too terrified of an operating thetan man is basically good an aberrated operating thetan can exist just by the accidental combination of being outside and find out that he could move mest that he could make sound that he could do things do you understand just by that alone but this character is very aberrated very very very aberrated in that condition and hes liable to do most anything because he in actual fact is operating automatically he can do these things without knowing how he does them hes not able to control them do you understand its like some characters see around them things move thats poltergeist known to some students of this it means simply the ability tothe spiritual movement of things you know poltergeist phenomena its very automatic and he takes this on he loses it hes in an unknowing state so he really is not an operating thetan at all hes just released ot you got it accidentally momentarily released ot now those beings can be upsetting because theyre doing what theyre doing without knowing what theyre doing you know theyre sort of higherscale wog amongst thetans you know well our definition of an operating thetan i wish to bring again to your attention is that of clear operating thetan he would know what he was doing he would know why he was doing it and he would be able to do that now he being basically good responds to fairly decent impulses and never destroys cities unless an ethics order has been issued against them one of the rules now previously individuals who got into released state of operating thetan had one with whom to associate with anybody who went thetan exterior he didnt have any hope of anything else and it was pretty shut track so the game of be body became an extremely active and functional game and this became all actually theres reason to believe that an operating thetan couldnt mock up body whole cloth because how else do you think youve got body see so that gives you some kind of an essay and definitiona cyclopediac look at the subject of ot which probably is very pertinent to it and id rather have classification on this i can tell you now and describe to you the definition of clear because this is another state you understand this one about ot now dont you hes clear who can operate like billyo and so lets define this word clear so that weve got these two words at least adjacent in the lineup cleara clear is thetan without bank now he doesnt have to be in body or out of bodythere are such conditions imposed on itjust has to be without bank and the source of the bank is the being himself he is making himself the unknowing and unwilling effect of his own bank and he is causing himself to receive unwillingly and unknowingly the effect of his own bank all of which is very complex and you can state that theoretically and maybe one person in every eight million would say oh is that what im doing and would promptly cease to do it but im afraid the rest of them have to go through the course anyway the individual compulsively makes up pictures and thats pretty well covered in dianetics and any severe experience an individual has had is covered with pictures now when an individual gets very very bad oft he longer has pictures all he has is blankedout picture that is to say he has black mass which covers up the picture or he has some action of pressure which crowds the picture back into oblivion you see its really there but its not there do you understand and he cant have pictures now down below that an individual will just have pictures on automatic and theyre so automatic that they go flickityflickflick you actually cant audit him through an engram at all because he couldnt stay in one point of time long enough to regard the situation heshed be sort of looking at motion picture screen gone mad you see which is showing everything and anything to him and it goes thrrrrrrrr and brrrrrrrrr and they change and you try to tell him to look at something and so on whats that and he gets twenty more like them you get the idea and he cant even explain to you what hes looking at but he knows hes looking at something well now wed normally call that bank and that is taken from an electronic computer the word bank an electronic computer has bank and cards have been made up and they normally are put into file system and this file system is called the bank and then the machine itself pulls out of this card system certain data cards and puts them into operation or computation in the machine in order to solve problems and so on for instance data bank on insurance policies you feed the name john doe into it or you feed number into it that will give you john doe and it all of sudden goes whirrclank and gives you all the john does which are in the bankmeaning the data bank and itll feed you all of those and itll actually go ahead and do things with those for you but mainly it feeds you something from the bank datum or it feeds you picture or it feeds you card or it feeds you something now the bodybound thetan particularly is peculiarly affected in this direction and he operates very thoroughly on bank now there is such thing as crazy thetan there is really such thing as crazy thetan there is thetan who is mocking up craziness that he is the effect of now that opens the door very hopefully if it werent this way why there would be hope at all and when people try to tell you that there is such thing as insanity or disease or predisposition or something like this entirely independent of any causethe being is just that way see well of course thats stupid suppressive statement anyhow it means the person making it himself cannot conceivehes so low on the scale that he cant even conceive the idea that something is cause so if there is anything wrong with thetan its the fact he does this but he does this automatically he does not know how he is doing it he does not know what he is doing usually and he does not see the things which are affecting him its very strange experience to somebody to say look around you and what we got some old process look around you shut your eyes you know look around you what do you see some guy merely sees his pink eyelids but if you keep it up for while why he eventually oh thats what youre talking about you know if hes rather bad off youll have to go on and on and on with this and so forth you say well shut your eyes well look out in front of you what do you see well i dont see anything so forth of course theres nothing there and that is of course what he is saying all the time to himself about it and he just hands you the dramatization see nothing there i dont see anything theres nothing different than the usual and what are you talking about and you say wait minute wait minute wuwu wuwu wuwuwu you said nothing different than the usual what is usually there oh well this is probably the first time he himself has ever recognized it see oh yeah well theres window well what about this window well theres window i always have window out in front he never really realized it before but you know its always there you know theres window out in front of yeah always there huh what do you know so thats what you were talking about why didnt you say you could tell him well i didnt know that you had window oh is that so everybody doesnt have window what do you you can get in the most marvelous conversations with this if somebody is unable to see picture conceive of the idea of pictures or masses in the mind and so on and you box it around however hell always come up with it after while and if you were to run process if you wanted to get his bank rolling you can do the weirdest things you can say well all right now what part of the window could you be responsible for and you run little process on him you can do this to some engineer that comes in to fix the tv set he doesnt even have to be insession youll get all kinds of remarkable things i ran it one day on somebody who wanted an explanation what do you mean by bank what do you mean by mind he was being rather challenging about the whole thing and so forth and i said well i said what are you looking at you know oh well im looking at you and i said i said you know in your mind what do you look at nothing never look at thing and so on and so on and so onexcept that ball of smoke and i said what ball of smoke well the one i always see out there and so forth naturally well i didnt bridge him over into an explanation or anything like that i just merely gave him the auditing command what part of that ball of smoke could you be responsible for knowing very well what was going to happen the ball of smoke promptly went off became an atomic explosion first time there had ever been any variation in this that he could ever remember he had an atomic explosion stop dead he was on lookout station somewhere up on mountain and that atomic explosion was his city and so just by this well he sees car and he sees this and he sees that and all of sudden he got the full physical response of being in an automobile and going over swerving road and he topped the rise and got down out of sight of the thing and seemed to be little bit calmer so i knocked it off id moved his position he was always different after that he was in different part of the track of course and hed erased little bit of it and he knew little bit more about himself and he said thats what you mean about mind thats what you mean about pictures so forth yes sir boy he said that sure was real he said you know he says ive been looking at that thing he said ive got an idea ive been looking at that thing for thousands of years and this guy knew nothing about anything and there was guy who in actual fact couldnt see pictures didnt have pictures didnt have mind or anything of the sortoh you mean that ball of smoke well now an individual can have everything so notised and be so blind that he doesnt even know hes got mind and that is actually below being able to see one but he can come up to the level of being able to see it and he not only can come up to the level of being able to see he can come up to the level of not having it at all and its value is exactly zero because all the masses do is not furnish you with data as they seem to do but charge the area of the data up so that you cant directly recall it so you try to recall it and you get hit in the teeth by the picture and you think the picture is giving you the data so therefore you mustnt get rid of the picture because if you got rid of the picture then you wouldnt have the data well of course this is silly because if you didnt have the picture you could recall it all you could recall it very easily without consequences clear is not thendoesnt have mind in that he is not the effect of this picture mechanism he doesnt have masses and pictures knocking him about now this doesnt say that clear in body wont get sick because theres such things as bacteria viri word i invented just now doctors call it virus but i dont know i dont think theyre singular if they exist at all theyre viri so the whole upshot of the situation is that there are influences because ina clear isif you ever noticed i dont know if youve ever looked around and noticed but there are some walls and floor and ceiling and rain and body and these things are still around and if you try to pick up tenton safe with body i think youd probably get rupture its not very strong instrument and furthermore its made out of cells that are susceptible to various things and its probably not very well built anyhow and it probably has got all of its cogwheels out of gear over the period of years so to measure clear by his health of course is plain idiocy see because were talking about the individual nevertheless clears are far more healthy and theres lot of things on health side of the picture as far as body health is concerned all their chronic psychosomatic illnesses have vanished and their various aberrations about this that and the other thing have gone in other words itswhat youre talking about is the absence of mind now in view of the fact that the mind does more than its share of pinning somebody down inside of body it follows that when an individual is clear he can more easily become exterior and when he becomes exterior hes clear exterior now he may be only clear exteriorthat would be another type of or state of beingness you see he may only be clear exterior but as clear exterior he would not be able to talk you know babies have to learn how to walk if you ever noticed that see so this guy is clear and he gets rathergreat you know now he starts diffidently trying to walk and now what hes actually trying to do is walk up scale toward ot but not having bank or an impulse to make bank and that sort of thing then he doesnt go snapping in all the time and you have stable stateand this is stable state now the task of moving person from clear to ot is proofing him up getting him into such state that he even if he made bank he wouldnt be affected by it so in actual sober factin actual sober fact when you say clear ot youre saying something else youre saying proofedup being who wont hit the banana peel because thats the way we hit the action of ot we dont just say oh well wheeeeeee he just got through picking up the empire state building so all right hes ot were concerned with his interrelationship between matter energy space and time and thought life and so forthhis relationships with these things because after guy is exterior in the physical universe he looks around and what do you know what does he see whats the first thing he starts looking at physical universe of course well whats he doing in something so you see in actual fact exteriorization could probably be practiced that you could probably exteriorize clear exterioryou know person who is clear and who slides out of his skulland you could probably fix him up so that he could exteriorize from the universe and you probably even could get an auditing command that would probably do it and i probably can tell you what the auditing command is as matter of fact i see reason not to tell you since nobody is interested in it or would use it and so forth and its not part of the ot course see it would be just like 1952 the command that puts people exterior bang it would be the same command exactly which would be try not to be outside the physical universe you know so you could probably move somebody out of the physical universe as an exterior you could probably take clear exterior and you could probably exteriorize him from the universe too but again this would be situation where you were just merely making an exterior and it would undoubtedly be completely unstable because in actual fact this person is not at cause over life thought matter energy space and time hes not at cause over this stuff he is still very much the effect of this stuff and as long as he is thoroughly the effect of this stuff all the way up the line why of course he cannot exteriorize from the stuff theres lot to know about this its very complex it lookssounds awfully awfully simple when i tell it to you this straight and actually would seem to be very simple and seem to be straightforward but its something like saying to somebody you can come back in the universe now an individualan individual who is cause over something or can be cause over something is not necessarily total and absolute effect of it dont you see that doesnt mean he doesnt have to have anything to do with it just because you can fix car is reason why you cant enjoy car do you follow as far as the technology is concerned though you say to this fellow hes knight hes going out in the jousting and theres the big lists down there and you say now joesir joenow joe all youve got to do sir joe is go down there and just take that stick and just shove the champion of europe out of his saddle and youll be champion of europe now you go do that joe you see thats apparently very simple action theres apparently nothing much to this and itd only be damn fool though who would do just that because he might accomplish it once but the next time he would probably get the other fellows stick through him theres lot to know about jousting terrific amount to know about it its very complex subject indeed and whereas all you have to do is stick your spear in the certain strategic spot so as to notno just all you have to do is hit the other fellow with your spear so as to knock him out of the saddle and you win see well all right but now your trouble begins hes been trained not to be hit he is also trying to hit you and between these two factors the action of trying to do something to him can become very very dicey indeed and if any of you have ever seen gout of dust going up on either side of your ears seen through small slits with occasionally the columnous leg of horse acting as bar across your field of vision you will know what i mean now man previously in his previous philosophic studies simply saidit wasnt that he didnt know that you could be exteriorbut he simply said well im going into state of total serenity and benignity and withdraw up to the top of the mountain and abandon the body and so forth and meditate theres nothing to this then he sees that dust coming up on either side of his head he says my god what happened well the adversary in this case is all of the complexity of wisdom of the ages carefully suppressed and combined to keep somebody from doing it truth of the matter is its absolutely impossible to make clear its absolutely impossible to make an ot weve now made hundred and forty clears and were well on the way to making tremendous number of ots but theres lot of blood sweat and tears goes into it see its not mild operation as the clearing course supervisors can tell you there are probably people lying out right now watching that dust curl up into the air around and thinking my god i will never make it because life is quite an adversary and the bank is quite an adversary and you shouldnt ever underevaluate these things and therefore you cant really overvalue the state of clear it has never been achieved before now fellow accidentally one fine day would shift in his bank or differently handle his bank or something like this and he would find himself temporarily or momentarily without bank just like thatwhile exteriorand momentarily be without those things which prevented him from making himself visible and handling himself and momentarily then he would be an ot he would be clear ot but hes actually only released ot you understand so hes clear he thinks he has got all the abilities of clear ot see all of sudden hehes getting out of the coffin you know and he throws the lid open mourners scatter in all directions hes never read an employment handbook for this particular thing so he goes and finds himself castle and slams the doors endlessly he has ball he doesnt know what to do with himself and one day he slams the door on his beam and it hurts like the mischief and suddenly mysteriously hes not clear ot hes released ot hes just thetan exterior hes crawling down to the maternity ward to pick up body man gets very suspicious of these states well the reason hes suspicious of themany state which occurs suddenly accidentally and miraculously is state that the individual doesnt understand in the least do you see therefore hes the effect of the state now the individual starts walking uphill and he takes this by gradients and theres probably greater distance between clear and ot than there actually is between wog and clear theres probably greater distance it isnt necessarily that the distance is huge or enormous or anything like that i say theres great distance in it because what hes doing is walking upstairs and hes integrating all of his experience against this thing were getting this strange being who isnt just suddenly allpowerful or something of the sort were getting this being who is allpowerful and still can fix the kids electric train do you see and who still knows that if you make entries in ink for jewish employer you get in trouble in the field of accounting you see and he knows all about life you know he knows this whole pattern out here of the causes and effects of various things and how theyre interwoven and what happens and what doesnt happenhe knows all these things by experience without suffering from the experience he yet has the experience so he experiences everything that he wants to experience and doesnt have to experience things that he doesnt want to have experience he is in actual fact walking miracle who is himself comprehending all the miracles so its quite remarkable and these states have existed so therefore its very possible for you to read some place or another about somebody whos been an exterior and so forth and say oh well yes scientology existed before you yourself have been exterior id say in the nottoodistant future at some time or another you will know by the count and number the number of times youve been released you just lost body and you were on mountainside and thunder and lightning opened up and you hadnt had time to pick another body and you got hit in the skull by lightning and you suddenly found it didnt hurt and you said i didnt like that so you threw an equally large shaft of lightning back at the lightning you say i did that what am i doing goodness i can do that and like prizefighter that knows not his own strength goes out and starts knocking out every man that comes along see and then with that equal speed one day one is getting the lightning coming down from the sky and in fit he throws back the lightning and nothing happens hes been perfectly able to talk to joe you see something that came on unknowingly went off unknowingly so knowing and willing cause is part of the definition of ot and total absence of bank is the definition of clear so as you move from clear to ot why all additional automaticities and miraculous changes of state and that sort of thing these come under your control and position one right after the other and you gradually get to point where you could turn these things on and off you see you could be the storm or the sunset you know you would know what you were doing it wouldnt all be an accidental action now anyway thatsgives you some kind of an insight perhapsi hopeinto these various states and how they happen and how they dont happen and how they go upside down and backwards and all that and i think they look so sad that you had better probably get two of those joe miller joke books now you expected to hear tremendous number of words defined but you actually were asking one definition there which follows the other definition there its actually the highest target at which one is shooting so it actually has never been completely discussed or defined before for general public issue so i thought i had better tell you something about it i hope its been of some slight value if it crosses up your own reality in any way shape or form by all means dont change your own reality on the matter just run your auditing sessions okay well i hope youll find that of some benefit thank you very much thank you
