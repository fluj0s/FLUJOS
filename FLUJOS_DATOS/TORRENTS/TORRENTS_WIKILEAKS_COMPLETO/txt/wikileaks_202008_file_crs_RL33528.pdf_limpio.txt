sector some legislative activity beginning in the 104 th congress has been directed at eliminating or significantly curtailing many of these federal efforts although this approach has not been adopted the budgets for several programs have declined questions have been raised concerning the proper role of the federal government in chnology development and the competitiveness of us industry as the

over the past 25 years this approach has invo lved both direct measures that concern budget outlays and the provision of services by government agencies such as the advanced technology program atp and the manufacturing extension pa rtnership mep of the national institute of standards and technology and indirect measures that include financial incentives and legal changes many of these efforts however have been revisited since the 104 th congress given the then republican majoritys statements in favor of indirect strategies such as tax policies intellectual property right protection and antitrust laws to promote technological advancement increased government support for basic research and decreased direct federal funding for private sector technology initiatives these concerns were reflected in situation where beginning in fy2000 the original housepassed appropriation bills did not include funding for atp in addition the presidents fy2003 budget for the first time requested significant reduction in support for mep based on the idea that all manufacturing extension centers operating more than six years should continue without federal funding while program was eliminated until the advanced technology program was replaced by the technology innovation program several have been financed at reduced levels pl 1105 enacted in the 110 th congress provided fy2007 appropriations of 1046 million for mep and 79 million for tp the presidents fy2008 budget proposed significant decrease in support for manufacturing extension to 463 million and did not include funding for tp the initial appropriations legislation that passed the house hr 3093 would have provided 1088 million for mep and 931 million for tp the senatepassed version of hr 3093 would have funded mep at 110 million and tp at 100 million 308 million of which was to be directed to unrelated programs in other agencies the final fy2008 appropriations legislation pl 110 161 provides 896 million for mep and replaces tp with the technology innovation program tip which is funded at 652 million with an additional 5 million from fy2007 atp unobligated balances pl 11069 the america competes act authorizes funding for nist programs through fy2010 and creates various new initiatives within the laboratory designed to improve us innovation and competitiveness the administrations original fy2009 budget request provided 4 million to close out the federal portion of the mep program and contained support for tip on june 6 2008 the president submitted series of amendments to his budget one of which reduced the amount for the mep program to 2 million the fy2009 appropriations bill ordered reported from the house committee on appropriations would finance mep at 112 million while support for tip would total 652 million s 3182 as reported by the senate committee on appropriations provides 110 million for manufacturing extension and 65 million for tip several of the actions detailed in the american competitiveness initiative announced by the president in the 2006 state of the union address were included in bills introduced in the first session of the 110 th congress the aci proposed various innovationrelated activities including increased basic research funding making permanent the research and experimentation tax credit which was extended through the end of 2007 by pl 109432 and improved math and science education s 833 the competitiveness through education technology and enterprise act of 2007 would make the research tax credit permanent as does

concern m ounted over the economic strength of the nation and over competition from abroad for the united states to be competitive in the world economy us companies must be able to engage in trade retain market shares and offer high quality products processes and services while the nation maintains economic growth and high standard of living technological advancement is important because the commercialization of inventions provides ec onomic benefits from the sale of new products or services from new ways to provide service or from new processes that increase productivity and efficiency it is widely accepted that technological progress is responsible for up to onehalf the growth of the us economy and is one pr incipal driving force in longterm growth and increases in living standards technological advances can further economic growth because they contribute to the creation of new goods new services new jobs and new capita l the application of technology can improve productivity and the quality of products it can expand the range of services that can be offered as well as extend the geographic distribution of these services the development and use of technology also plays major role in determining patterns of international trade by affecting the comparative advantages of industrial sectors since technological progress is not necessarily determined by economic conditionsit also can be influenced by advances in science the organization and management of firms government activity or serendipityit can have effects on trade independent of shifts in macroeconomic factors new technologies also can help compensate for possible disadvantages in the cost of capital and labor faced by firms g8g142g141g142g155g138g149g561g20g152g149g142g561 in the recent past american companies faced incr eased competitive pressures in the international marketplace from firms based in countries where governments actively promote commercial technological development and application in th united states the generation of technology for the commercial marketplace is primarily private sector activity the federal government traditionally becomes involved only for certain limited purposes typically these are activities which have been determined to be necessary for the national good but which cannot or will not be supported by industry

g345g561to date the us government has funded research and development rd to meet the mission requirements of the federal departments and agencies it also finances efforts in areas where there is an identified need for research primarily basic research not being performed in the private sector federal support reflects consensus that basic research is critical because it is the foundation for many new innovations however any returns created by this activity are generally long term sometimes not marketable and not always evident yet the rate of return to society as whole generated by investments in research is significantly larger than the benefits that can be captured by the firm doing the work 1 many past government activities to increase basic research were based on linear model of innovation this theory viewed technological advancement as series of sequential steps starting with idea origination and moving through basic research applied research development commercialization and diffusion into the economy increases in federal funds in the basic research stage were expected to result in concomitant increases in new products and processes however this linear concept is longer considered valid innovations often occur that do not require basic or applied research or development in fact most innovations are incremental improvements to existing products or processes in certain areas such as biotechnology the distinctions between basic research and commercialization are small and shrinking in others the differentiation between basic and applied research is artificial the critical factor is the commercialization of the technology economic benefits accrue only when technology or technique is brought to the marketplace where it can be sold to generate income or applied to increase productivity yet while the united states has strong basic research enterprise foreign firms appear equally if not more adept at taking the results of these scientific efforts and making commercially viable products often us companies are competing in the global marketplace against goods and services developed by foreign industries from research performed in the united states thus there has been increased congressional interest in mechanisms to accelerate the development and commercialization processes in the private sector the development of governmental effort to facilitate technological advance has been particularly difficult because of the absence of consensus on the need for an articulated policy technology demonstration and commercialization have traditionally been considered private sector functions in the united states while over the years there have been various programs and policies such as tax credits technology transfer to industry and patents the approach had been ad hoc and uncoordinated much of the progra m development was based upon what individual committees judged appropriate for the agencies over which they have jurisdiction despite the importance of technology to the economy technology related considerations often have not been integrated into economic decisions there have been attempts to provide central focus for governmental activity in technology matters pl 100519 created within the departme nt of commerce technology administration headed by new under secretary for technology this office was abolished as of

g346g561integration at all policy levels however technological issues and responsibilities remain shared among many departments and agencies this diffused focus has sometimes resulted in actions which if not at cross purposes may not have accounted for the impact of policies or practices in one area on other parts of the process technol ogy issues involve components which operate both separately and in concert while diffused approach can offer varied responses to varied issues the importance of interrelationships may be underestimated and their usefulness may suffer several times congress has examined the idea of an industrial policy to develop coordinated approach on issues of economic growth and industrial competitiveness technological advance is both one aspect of this and an altogether separate consideration in looking at the development of an identified policy for industrial competitivene ss advocates argue that such an effort could ameliorate much of the uncertainty with which the private sector perceives future government actions some commentators have argued that consideration and delineation of national objectives could encourage industry to engage in more longt erm planning with regard to rd and to make decisions as to the best allocation of resources such technology policy could generate greater consistency in government activities because technological development involves numerous risks efforts to minimize uncertainty regarding federal programs and policies may help alleviate some of the disincentives perceived by industry the development of technology policy however is contentious issue there is widespread resistance to what could be and has been called national planning due variously to doubts as to its efficacy to fear of adverse effects on our market system to political beliefs about government intervention in our economic system and to the current emphasis on shortterm returns in both the political and economic arenas opponents of national industrial policy may see this approach as government interference in the marketplace to pick winners and losers instead it is argued measures that would occasion better investment environment for industry to expand innovationrelated efforts would be preferable to government decisionmaking in technological advancement consideration of what constitutes government pol icy both in terms of the industrial policy and technology policy covers broad range of ideas from laissezfaire to special government incentives to target specific hightechnology highgrowth industries suggestions have been made for the creation of federal mechanisms to identify and support strategic industries and technologies various federal agencies and private sector groups have developed critical technology lists however others maintain that such targeting is an unwanted and unwarranted interference in the private sector which will cause unnecessary dislocations in the marketplace or misallocation of resources from their perspective the government does not have the knowledge or expertise to make businessrelated decisions instead they argue the appropriate role for government is to encourage innovative activities in all industries and to keep market related decisionmaking within the business community that has ultimate responsibility for commercialization and where such decisions have traditionally been made the relationship between government and industry often is major factor affecting innovation and the environment within which technological development takes place this relationship can be adversarial with the government acting to regulate or restrain the business community rather than to facilitate its positive contributions to the nation however this may be changing as the benefits of industrygovernment cooperation become more apparent there are an increasing number of areas where the traditional distinctions between public and private sector functions and responsibilities are becoming blurred many assumptions have been questioned particularly in light of the increased internationalization of the us economy the business sector is longer

g347g561viewed in an exclusively domestic context the economy of the united states is often tied to the economies of other nations the technological superiority long held by the united states in many areas has been challenged by other industrialized countries in which economic social and political policies and practices foster gove rnmentindustry cooperation in technological development major divergence from the past was evident in the approach taken by the former clinton administration articulated in two reports issued in february 1993 vision of change for america and technology for america s economic growth new direction to build economic strength 2 the proposal called for national commitment to and strategy for technological advancement as part of defined national economic policy this detailed strategy offered policy agenda for economic growth in the united states of which technological development and industrial competitiveness were critical components in articulating national technology policy the approach initially recommended and subsequently followed by the clinton administration provided wide range of options while for the most part reflecting then current trends in congressional ef forts to facilitate industrial advancement this policy backed by congressional legislation increased federal coordination and augmented direct government spending for technological development while many past activities focused primarily on research the new initiatives shifted the emphasis toward development of new products processes and services by the private sector for the commercial marketplace in addition significant number of the proposals aimed to increase both government and private sector support for rd leading to the commercialization of technology this approach has been questioned by recent congresses and by the current bush administration instead policies appear more supportive of indirect strategies such as tax incentives intellectual property protection and antitrust laws to promote technology advancement increased government support for basic research and decreased direct federal funding for private sector technology activities in the 2006 state of the union address president bush announced the american competitiveness initiative to facilitate innovation and provide our nations children firm grounding in math and science to achieve these goals the president has called for doubling over the next 10 years the amount of federal funding for basic research particularly in the national science foundation the office of science in the department of energy and in the core programs of the national institute of stan dards and technology department of commerce in addition the initiative would increase the number of math and science teachers and make the research and experiment tax credit permanent despite the continuing debate on what is the appropriate role of government and what constitutes suitable government technology development policy it remains an undisputed fact that what the government does or does not do affects the private sector and the marketplace the various rules regulations and other

initiatives have reflected trend toward expanding the governments role beyond traditional funding of missionoriented rd and basic research toward the facilitation of technological advancement to meet other critical national needs including the economic growth that flows from new commercialization and use of technologies and techniques in the private sector an overview of recent legislation shows federal efforts aimed at 1 encouraging industry to spend more on rd 2 assisting small hightechnology businesses 3 promoting joint research activities between companies 4 fo stering cooperative work between industry and universities 5 facilitating the transfer of technology from the federal laboratories to the private sector and 6 providing incentives for quality improvements these efforts tend toward removing barriers to technology development in the private sector thereby permitting market forces to operate and providing incentives to encourage increased private sector rd activities while most focus primarily on research some also involve policies and programs associated with technology development and commercialization

supplanted industry as the primary source of funding for basic research in universities it also became the principal determinant of the type and direction of the research performed in academia this resulted in disconnect between the university and industrial communities the separation and isolation of the parties involved in the innovation process is thought by many observers to be barrier to technological progress the difficulties in moving an idea from the concept stage to commercial product or process may be compounded when several entities are involved legislation to stimulate cooperative efforts among those involved in technology development has been viewed as one way to promote innovation and facilitate the international competitiveness of us industry several laws have attempted to encourage industryuniversity cooperation title ii of the economic recovery tax act of 1981 pl 9734 provided in part 25 tax credit for 65 of all company payments to universities for the performance of basic research firms were also permitted larger tax deduction for charitable contributions of equipment used in scientific research at academic institutions the tax reform act of 1986 pl 99514 kept this latter provision but reduced the credit for university basic research to 20 of all corporate expenditures for this over the sum of fixed research floor plus any decrease in nonresearch giving the 1981 act also provided an increased charitable deduction for donations of new equipment by manufacturer to an institution of higher educati on this equipment must be used for research or research training for physical or biological sciences within the united states the tax deduction is equal to the manufacturers cost plus onehalf the difference between the manufacturers cost and the market value as long as it does not exceed twice the cost basis these provisions were extended through july 1995 by the omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1993 but then expired until restored by the passage of pl 104188 pl 105277 and pl 106170 as noted above hr 6111 passed by both the house and senate during the 109 th congress and awaiting the presidents signature extended the

another approach to encouraging the commercialization of technology involves the transfer of technology from federal laboratories and contractors to the private sector where commercialization can proceed because the federal laboratory system has extensive science and technology resources and expertise developed in pursuit of mission responsibilities it is potential source of new ideas and

inventedhere syndrome and perhaps more significantly the ambiguities associated with obtaining title to or exclusive license to federally owned patents also contribute to the low level of commercialization over the years several governmental efforts have been undertaken to augment industrys awareness of federal rd resources the federal laboratory consortium for technology transfer was created in 1972 from department of defense program to assist in transferring technology from the federal government to state and local governments and the private sector to expand on the work of the federal laboratory consortium and to provide added emphasis on the commercialization of government technology congress passed pl 96480 the stevensonwydler technology innovation act of 1980 prior to this law technology transfer was not an explicit mandate of the federal departments and agencies with the exception of the national aeronautics and space administration to provide legitimacy to the numerous technology activities of the government congress with strong bipartisan support enacted pl 96480 which explicitly states that the federal government has the responsibility to ensure the full use of the results of the nations federal investment in research and development section 11 of the law created system within the federal government to identify and disseminate information and expertise on what technologies or techniques ar available for transfer offices of research and technology applications were established in each federal laboratory to distinguish technologies and ideas with potential applications in other settings several amendments to the stevensonwydler technology innovation act have been enacted to provide additional incentives for the commercialization of technology pl 99502 the federal technology transfer act authorizes activities designed to encourage industry universities and federal laboratories to work cooperatively it also establishes incentives for federal laboratory employees to promote the commercialization of the results of federally funded research and development the law amends pl 96480 to allow governmentowned governmentoperated

the granting of licenses for subject inventions this has the potential of effecting greater interaction between laboratories and industry in the transfer of technology royalties on these inventions are also permitted to go back to the laboratory contractor to be used for additional rd awards to individual laboratory inventors or education while there is cap on the amount of the royalty returning directly to the lab in order not to disrupt the agencys mission requirements and congressionally mandated rd agenda the establishment of discretionary funds gives contractoroperated laboratories added incentive to encourage technology transfer under pl 98620 private companies regardless of size are allowed to obtain exclusive licenses for the life of the patent prior restrictions allowed large firms use of exclusive license for only 5 of the 17 years now 20 years of the life of the patent this was expected to encourage improved technology transfer from the federal laboratories or the universities in the case of university operated gocos to large corporations which often have the resources necessary for development and commercialization activities in addition the law permits gocos those operated by universities or nonprofit institutions to retain title to inventions made in the laboratory within certain defined limitations those laboratories operated by large companies are not included in this provision pl 106404 the technology transfer commercialization act altered practices concerning patents held by the government to make it easier for federal agencies to license such inventions the law amends the stevensonwydler technology innovation act and the bayhdole act to decrease the time delays associated with obtaining an exclusive or partially exclusive license previously agencies were required to publicize the availability of technologies for three months using the federal register and then provide an additional 60 day notice of intent to license by an interested company under this legislation the time period was shortened to 15 days in recognition of the ability of the internet to offer widespread notification and the necessity of time constraints faced by industry in commercialization activities certain rights are retained by the government the bill also allows licenses for existing governmentowned inventions to be included in cradas the omnibus trade and competitiveness act pl 100418 mandated the creation of program of regional centers to assist small manufacturing companies to use knowledge and technology developed under the auspices of the national institute of standards and technology and other federal agencies federal funding for the centers is matched by nonfederal sources including state and local governments and industry originally seven regional centers for the transfer of manufacturing technology were selected the initial program was expanded in 1994 to create the manufacturing extension partnership mep to meet new and growing needs of the community in more varied approach the partnership involves both large centers and smaller more dispersed organizations sometimes affiliated with larger centers as well as the nist state technology extension program which provides states with grants to develop the infrastructure necessary to transfer technology from the federal government to the private sector an effort which was also mandated by pl 100418 and program which electronically ties the disparate parties together along with other federal state local and academic technology transfer organizations there are now centers in all 50 states and puerto rico since the manufacturing extension activity was created in 1989 awards made by nist have resulted in the creation of approximately 350 regional offices it should be noted that the department of defense also funded 36 centers through its technology rein vestment project trp in fy1994 and fy1995

g343g348g561antitrust arrangements supporters of indirect approaches argue that the market is superior to government in deciding which technologies are worthy of investment mechanisms that enhance the markets opportunities and abilities to make such choices are preferred advocates further state that dependency on agency discretion to assist one technology in preference to another will inevitably be subjected to political pressures from entrenched interests proponents of direct government assistance maintain conversely that indirect methods can be wasteful and ineffective and that they can compromise other goals of public policy in the hope of stimulating innovative performance advocates of direct approaches argue that it is important to put the countrys scarce resources to work on those technologies that have the greatest promise as determined by industry and supported by its willingness to match federal funding in the past while republicans tended to prefer reliance on free market investment competition and indirect support by government participants in the debates generally did not make definite or exclusionary choices between the two approaches nor consistently favor one over the other for example some proponents of stronger direct role for the government in innovation are also supporters of enhanced tax preferences for rd spending an indirect mechanism opponents of direct federal support for specific projects eg sema tech flat panel displays may nevertheless back similar activities focused on more general areas such as manufacturing or information technology however beginning with the 104 th congress legislators directed many of their efforts toward eliminating or curtailing some of the programs that previously had enjoyed bipartisan support initiatives to terminate the advanced technology program funding for flat panel displays and agricultural extension reflected concern about the role of government in developing commercial technologies the then republican leadership stated that the government should directly support basic science while leaving technology development to the private sector instead of federal funding changes to the tax laws proponents argue will provide the capital resources and incentives necessary for industry to further invest in rd many of the same issues were considered in subsequent congresses while funding for several programs decreased support for most ongoing activities continued how the debate over federal funding evolves in the 110 th congress may serve to redefine thinking about the governments efforts
