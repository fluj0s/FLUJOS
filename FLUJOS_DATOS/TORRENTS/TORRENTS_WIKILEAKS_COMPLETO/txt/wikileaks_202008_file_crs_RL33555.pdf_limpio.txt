raphael perl specialist in international affairs foreign affairs defense and trade divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33555trends in terrorism 2006 summary on april 28 2006 the department of stat sent to congress its annual report on global terrorism country reports on global terrorism 2005 the 262page report provides an annua l strategic assessment of trends in terrorism and the evolving nature of the terrorist threat coupled with detailed info rmation on antiterror cooperation by nations worldwide the re port and underlying data portray threat from radical jihadists that is becoming more widespread diffuse and increasingly homegrown often with lack of formal operational connection with qaeda ideological leaders such as osama bin laden or ayman zawahiri three trends in terrorism are identified in the department of state report which are independently reflected in the work of analysts elsewhere first is the emergence of so called micro actors in part spurred by us successes in isolating or killing much of qaedas leadership the resu lt is an qaeda with more subdued although arguably s till significant operational role but assuming more of an ideological motivational and propaga nda role second is the trend toward sophistication ie terrorists exploiting th global flow of information finance and ideas to their benefit often through the internet third is an increasing overlap of terrorist activity with international crime which may expose the terrorists to broad range of law enforcement countermeasures the report notes an overall increase in suicide bombings especially in iraq where terror incidents accounted for almost third of all terror incidents globally in 2005 and more than half of terror rela ted deaths worldwide however some observers suggest that much of what the re port characterizes as terrorist incidents in iraq would be better categorized as insurgent activity and also to some degree as criminal activity the report suggests that ac tive direct state sponsorship of terror is declining with the notable exceptions of iran and perhaps to some degree syria emerging trends that may require enhanced policy focus for the 110th congress are 1 attacks that aim to cause economic damage such as attacks on transportation infrastructure tourism and oil installa tions 2 the growing number of unattributed terrorist attacks and 3 the growing power and influence of radical islamist political parties in foreign nations recent suggestions that qaeda remains operationally active are of growing concern as well the state department report suggests an immediate future with larger number of smaller attacks less meticulously planned and local rather than transnational in scope if so some adjustment in implementation of united states antiterror strategy and tactics to reflect more international law enforcement oriented approach such as that envisioned in the february 2003 national strategy for combating terrorism may be warranted as the global economic political nd technological landscapes evolve data being collected to identify and track terrorism may need to change this report will not be

patte rns of global terrorism report trends state sponsors and related issues both by raphael perl 2 for discussion of issues involved in measuring terrorist capabilities and government countermeasures s ee crs report rl33160trends in terrorism 2006 background purpose and scope of report this report summarizes and discusses trends in terrorism as identified in recent analyses by the state department the na tional counter terrorism center nctc and independent analysts po tential issues for congress arising out of these analyses are identified and discussed as well this report is one of several related crs reports discussing issues related to trends in terrorism1 selection of additional crs reports addressing terrorism issues of likely to be of concern to the 110th congress is found at the conclusion of this report definition of trends for the purposes of this report trends in terrorism can be defined as changes in the type number and lethality of terrorist attacks modus operandi attitudes of terrorist groups and other fact ors over time changes in terrorist infrastructure such as those related to command and control capabilities recruiting and financing are often considered particularly meaningful what are the capabilities of terrorist group to inflict serious damage are they increasing or decreasing for example large number of terrorist groups might be seeking to acquire nuclear chemical or biological explosive device but may lack the resources or capability to achieve this objective and the technical expertis to employ such technology 2 in what ways are terrorist capabilities and expertise changing relevant as well is whether the leader ship of particular terrorist group or network is being weakened is its recruitme nt base network or target list growing and is the number of defectors from its ra nks increasing or decreasing to what degree may an organization be changing its role from an operational one to an ideologicalinspirational one have the intentions or ideology of movement or group changed and if so are they more or less radical more or less focused on causing widespread damage are they becoming increasingly involved in criminal activities or seeking to cause violence for its own sake also relevant are changes in levels of popular and g overnment support for specifi c terrorist organizations httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33555crs2 3 insight into this phenomenon comes from media report of document reportedly contained on computer chip found june 7 2006 on the body of abu musab zarqawi the jordanian born qaeda leader in iraq the document is said to list number of allied successes against terrorist activity including ma ssive arrests tightening financial outlets confiscating weapons and ammunition and media campaign ccessful in portraying terrorism as harmful to the population and in magnifying the terrorists mistakes need is cited for counteractions designed to improve the image of the terrorist resistance increase its number of supporters and exploit so cial ethnic and class divisions within the society and between it and the allies building the groups own armaments industry is cited as revised goal as well see papers reveal weakening terror group by rowan scarborough the washington times june 16 2006 p1 4 for example in the one percent doctrine deep inside americas pursuit of its enemies since 911 ron suskind reports that qaedas l eadership called off planned gas attack continuedimportance of trends identifying trends as indicators of terrorist activity can assist policymakers in number of areas including 1 prioritizing counterterror resources 2 targeting terrorists and terrorist activity with the intention of preventing attacks and 3 showing antiterror progress where it has been achieved in addition to trends influencing g overnment responses government anti terrorism strategies and tactics may also affect terrorism trends3 for example hardening us government physical infrast ructure overseas or in the united states might cause terrorists to shift the focus of attacks to softer nongovernment targets or to employ new explosion delivery met hods such as improvised explosive devices ieds or to deploy suicide bombers likewise better systems to evaluate the authenticity and content of travel entry docum ents at lawful us ports of entry might prompt terrorists to switch from the legal entry tactics employed by the 911 hijackers to crossing the us border at unsecured locations trends in terrorism may also be influen ced by responses perceived by terrorists as directly related to advancing their cause or detracting from it such as the number of governments that embrace ppeasement policies and the amount of media coverage the terrorists receive related issue is how us policies and actions affect trends in terrorists popular support and recruiting has the us intervention in iraq for example led to the demotiva tion detention or killin g of more terrorists than the number of individuals it may have radicalized in areas important to us interests around the world some analysts question whether the dive rse nature of individual terrorists and terrorist networks which often seek to cultivate surprise allows for meaningful trend analysis others point out the potential pitfall of using past trends as predictors of future activity such as assuming that because particular activity has not been observed for long period of time there is concomitant threat the absence of violent conflict or even decreases in terrorist activity may simply mean that terrorists are focusing attention on economic political or social spheres or just that they are in planning or waiting period4 another potential pitfall is to project trends inhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33555crs3 4 continued on the new york subway system in 2003 speculation being that it was not deemed spectacular enough see book argues qa eda planned nyc gas attack reuters dispatch of june 17 2006 and book excerpt in time p 2735 june 26 2006 calling off planned attack if true may suggest the pres ence of trend of avoiding smalltomedium incidents in the united states or conversely concentrating on megaattack that would dwarf the incidents of 911 in terms of horror casualties and economic damage common pitfall of those seeking to identify or enumerate trends is an overreliance on quantitative indicators at the expense of their qualitative significance for example single large scale attack causing many casualties could have major impact far more than dozen relatively small attacks moreover single qualitatively creativediffere nt incident may prove to be the beginning of trend by triggering wave of copycat followon terror incidents with resultant change in terrorists strategy weapons tactics and targets see for example hamas trying to add toxic chemicals to bombs by amos harel httpwwwhaaretzcom israeli daily june 6 2006 citing israeli security sources 5 an example of such efforts is the recent upgrading by the national counter terrorism center nctc of its collection methodologie s to support the state departments annual report on terrorism and the changes in format and content of the report currently titled country reports on terrorism 2005 see crs report rl32417 the department of states patterns of global rrorism report trends stat sponsors and related issues by raphael perla linear fashion such projections can miss qualitative changes in modus operandi particularly those that m ove to new types of terror trends are usually identified by the ex ecutive branch and independent analysts on the basis of empirical data collected by public and private sources as the global economic political and technological landscap evolves and as terrorists may seek to surprise and attack through more flui d organizational structures and in innovative ways data being collected to identify and track terrorism may need to change hence one challenge facing the counterterro rism community is how to facilitate incorporation of new data i ndicative of new trends while maintaining the continuity of earlier data where relevant5 another challenge is how to anticipate sinister trends and prevent them before th ey materialize such antic ipation supported by accurate intelligence is widely regarded as central to an effective policy of deterrence and preemption markedly different pictures can be presented depending on what one chooses to include in data relating to terrorism for example some would argue that the iraq casualties which are largely the product of sectarian violence rampant criminal activity and home grown insurgency gro ssly distort the global terrorism picture and perhaps should not be attributed to rrorist activity according to nctc data outside of iraq the total number of incide nts with ten or more deaths remained at approximately the 20032004 leve l 70 per year this suggests that excluding iraq the number of higher casualty terror attacks remains relatively stable httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33555crs4 6 httpwwwstategovsctrlscrtc17689htm see also testimony of

global terrorism 2005 6 statistical data on terrorist incidents which form the basi s for the reports analysis are provided by the newly created national count er terrorism center nctc7 the 262page report provides an annual strategic ssessment of trends in terrori sm and the evolving nature of the terrorist threat coupled with tailed information on antiterror cooperation by nations worldwide the report focuses on trends related to 1 state sponsors of terrorism 2 foreign terrorist organizations 3 the terrorist situation in individual countries including those that provide safe haven fo r terrorists 4 potential terrorist acquisition of w eapons of mass destruction wmd and 5 us anti terrorism coalition building efforts and coope rative endeavors within its discussion of policies intended to shap trends in desired dir ection the report emphasizes building international will nd capacity for counterterrori sm including the issue of countering terrorism on the economic front the report and underlying data portray threat from radical jihadists which is becoming more widespread diffuse po ssibly more deadly and increasingly homegrown often with lack of apparent formal operational connection with qaeda ideological leaders although perhaps inspired by them or assisted through training this homegrown phenomenon of looser and more local networks was manifest in the may 2003 restaurant hotel and jewish cultural center bombings in morocco the 2004 attacks on madrids trains the july 7 and july 21 2005 terrorist attacks on londons transit system and more recently after the reports release in the june 2 2006 arrests of 12 men and 5 juveniles in onta rio canada on bombing conspiracyrelated charges8 this emergence of globa lhomegrown terror movement has lent itself to the characterizati on of terrorism as glocal phenomenon five major trends in the evolution of terrorism are included in the state department reporthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33555crs5 9 see crs report rl32759 qaeda statements and evolving ideology by christopher m blanchard 10 this lack of regular communication should not be construed as implying that such relationships are necessarily casual 11 many experts are concerned about the vuln erability of global infrastructures to attacks by cyberterrorists see crs report rl32114 computer attack and cyberterrorism vulnerabilities and policy issues for congress by clay wilson some speculate that qaedalinked terrorists attach numerological sign ificance to the selection of dates for terror attacks for example some suggest one possibility would be that massive cyberattack might occur on the date 411 the phone number commonly dialed for information for discussion of the overall issue of technology and terrorism see the future of terrorism by the editors of discover v 27 no7 july 2006 p 324276 12 see for example terrorists turn to the web as base of operations by steve coll and susan b glasser washington post aug7 2005 p a1 and terror on the internet the new arena the new challenges by gabriel weimann united states institute for peace washington dc 2006 309 p more microactors the report depicts the emergence of microactors as having been spurred by the widespread us of the internet militant preachers and the impact of arabic language television coupled with us and allied successes in capturing isolating and killing much of qaedas leadership in afghanistan thereby reducing its centralized command and control capability the result according to the report is an qaeda s een to be assuming more of an ideological motivational propaganda role nd reduced operational role9 the report views the operational component of the movement as increasingly being assumed by small autonomous cells and individuals often homegrown with resultant diversity in identity profiles structures motives and tactics such operational cells may be new to the terrorism landscape may be technologically savvy and small decentralized and w ithout regular communication with other groups or cells10 these characteristics make their actions extremely difficult to detect or counter as result according to the report growing percentage of future terrorist attacks may be carried out by microactors using traditional bombs and bullets rather than more lethal weapons increased sophistication increasingly according to the report terrorists are seen as exploiting the global movement of information finance and ideas to their benefit they are also seen as improving their technological sophistication across many areas of operational planning co mmunications targeting and propaganda11 according to some observers terrorism has become web directed phenomenon12 overlap with international crime the report describes growing overlap between terrorism and interna tional crime such trend to the extent that terrorists do indeed use the same supply transpor t and moneymoving networks used by criminal groups creates major vulnerab ility that can be exploited by law enforcement authorities the more terrori sts engage in nonterror forms of criminal activity the more likely they are to show up on the law enforcement radar screen andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33555crs6 13 reportedly criminal activity financed in part the 2004 madrid bombings drug trafficking and the 2005 london bombings credit card fraud 14 although the total number of suicide bombing s increased in 2005 is not fully clear that the ratio of suicide bombings to other forms of attacks has increased concomitantly 15 nctc data indicate that iraq accounted fo r almost 30 of worldwide terrorist attacks in 2005 and 55 of the fatalities moreover attacks on noncombatants in iraq also increased significantly last year 16 nations on the state departments legisl atively mandated list of state sponsors of terrorism are cuba iran north korea s udan and syria libya was certified by the secretary of state as being eligible for removal from the list on may 12 2006 see presidential determination 200614 may 12 2006 which went into effect june 28 2006 httpwwwwh itehousegovnewsrel eases200605200605155html 17 as in preceding years the report cites iran as the most active state supporter of terrorism and states that its islamic revolutionary guard corps and ministry of intelligence and security were directly involved in the planning and execution of terrorist acts that included providing lebanese hizballah and palestinian terrorist groups with extensive funding training and weapons the revolutionary guar d it is asserted was increasingly involved in supplying lethal assistance to iraqi militant groups with the effect of destabilizing iraq also addressed was irans continued developmen t of nuclear program and that iran is also capable of producing biological and chemical agents or weapons iran the report states could support terrorist organizations seek ing to acquire wmd the report does not specifically address growing concerns among some experts that iran might use surrogate organizations with broad networ ks eg hizballah as delivery vehicles for dirty bombs for the enriched radioactive material generated by its nuclear research the report also does not discuss irans allegedly active role in trai ning and equipping insurgents in iraq see june 22 2006 press conference of defens secretary donald rumsfieldthe more likely they are to be subject to arrest and prosecution under far reaching umbrella of general criminal statutes and more specific terror related laws as well13 increase in suicide bomb ingslinks between us iraqi operations and global terror also cited in the report are an increase in suicide bombings14 and strong connection between the ongoing unrest in iraq and the broader war on terrorism terror incidents in iraq accordin g to the report accounted for almost third of all terror incident s globally in 2005 and more th an half of all the terror related deaths worldwide there is concern that iraq will become an exporter of seasoned terrorists weapons and shared t actics especially the use of improvised explosive devices ieds with spillover not only into the neighboring gulf nations but to europe and other regions as well15 decline in st atesponsored terrorism16 aside from iran and perhaps to some degree syria the report suggests that with few notable exceptions active state sponsorship of terror is dec lining the report continues to list iran as the most active state sponsor of terrorism17 as in previous years syria is cited for providing political and material support presuma bly weapons to both hizballah and palestinian terrorist groups which also enjoy sanctuary in syria cuba and north korea are primarily cited for lack of anti terror cooperation and past involvement in terrorist incidents thereby possibly sugge sting trend of less active support for terrorism than in previous decades httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33555crs7 18 see for example terrorists killed more than 14500 people in 2005 report says bloomberg april 28 2006 citing public comments by russell travers deputy director at the nctc note that nctc data come from variety of open and closed sources both us and foreign public sector and private ctoracademia including efforts at rigorous tracking of incidents by us embassy personne l stationed overseas however it has always been difficult to pin down details of attacks in v illages in rural areas such as those of algeria or egypt for example where the press and local government reporting of incidents may be incomplete and sketchythe report says that the saudi government carried out numerous operations resulting in the capture or killing of all 26 wanted terrorists publicized in december 2003 state announcement the report cites close cooperation with pakistans security services and notes that pakistan captured or killed hundreds of terrorists significantly increasing the effectivene ss of its counterterro rism operation and stresses that president musharraf has declared jihad on extremism and promised to close down extremist institutions some observers might argue however that the report tends to mute criticism of nations of strategic importance to the united states such as pakistan and saudi arabia that arguably could do much more to curb terror echoing language of previous years versions of the report the 2006 edition states that libya and sudan continued to take significan t steps to cooperate in the global war on terror although specific ex amples of cooperation are cited for each of the two nations the report which was drafted and went to press early in 2006 otherwise contained little to suppor t speculation that libya would be subsequently proposed for removal fro m the us list of state sponsors of international terrorism 2005 nctc statistical data beginning with data collected in 2005 the nctc substantially revised its methodology for reporting incidents and in creased the priority and number of personnel assigned to compiling data on rrorism incidents and trends leading to what administration officials characteriz as more accurate and comprehensive reporting these methodological changes cont ributed to significant increase in the reported number of rrorism incidents18 data released by the nctc concurren tly with the depar tment of states 2006 terror report indicate the following in 2005 the nctc lists roughly 40000 individuals wounded or k illed in terrorist incidents as compared to 9300 the previous year and 4271 in 2003 reported terrorrelated deat hs in 2005 numbered 14602 as compared to 1907 deaths in 2004 and 625 in 2003 the report placed the number of total reported terrorist attacks in 2005 at 11111 as compared to 3168 in 2004 and 208 in 2003 foiled attacks are not included in the data reported other highlights of the nctcs data includehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33555crs8 19 violent jihad in the netherlands current tr ends in the islamist terrorist threat httpenglishnctbnlimagesviolent20jihad20in20the20netherlands202006_ tcm127112471pdf 20 when discussing attacks aimed to cause econom ic damage analysts often cite as examples attacks on oil related targets such as planned attacks on saudi oil installations in february and march 2006 the october 2002 attack on the fren ch supertanker limberg in the straits of hormuz off the yemeni coast and likelihood of future attacks on oil installations in the persian gulf and possibly in nigeria also notable and well documented are attacks aimed at damaging tourism eg bali luxor and those disrupting transportation infrastructure madrid london and plots foiled in july 2006 reportedly aimed at the holland tunnel in new york armed attacks and bombings account ed for the vast majority of fatalities in 2005 of the 11111 attacks reported 6000 or roughly 54 were against facilities and resulted in casualties of the approximately 40000 persons worldwide killed or wounded at least 10 to 15 thousand were mus lim with approxima tely 80 mosques being attacked in most cases by muslim extremists with high percentage of these incidents occurring in iraq approximately 6600 police 1000 ch ildren 300 government officials 170 clergyreligious figures 140 teach ers and 100 journa lists were killed or wounded by terrorists in 2005 trends reported by other sources trends in terrorist activity have been the subject of analysis by many other organizations and analysts in many instances such independent analysis is consistent with the trends identified by the state department in its recent report in some instances the emergence of additional tre nds is also suggested for example 2006 report by the netherlands central intelligence and security services cites trends of increasing home grown terrorism decentralization and implantation of international jihad radicalization and emergence of local networks and incitement of jihad through the internet to include self radicalization possibly of lone operating terrorists19 multiauthored 2005 study by the rand corporation finds increased focus on soft civilianfocused targets ongoing emphasis on economic attacks 20 continued

weimann united states institute for peace washington dc 2006 309 p the possibility of future attacks from the far right anarchists and radical environmentalists21 trends noted by others include decreases in the average age of terrorist recruits greater organizationaloperati onal roles for women and non muslims potentially more terrorist acts rooted in backlash against theimpact of globalization more nearsimultaneous coordinated attacks with followup attackson first responders potentially wider use by criminals of terroristtype tactics more terrorists acts that remain unclaimed by those committing them and an overall rise in the number of terrorist attacks potentiallyencompassing acts rooted in variety of causes and committed by growing diversity of groups and individuals 22 some of the core terrorismenabling factors that these sources view as contributing to and facilitating many of the trends highlighted by the department of state and others include weak legal and law enforcement systems in some countries that enable terrorist and criminal networks to operate with relative ease expanded instant and often re latively anonymous or secure communications and networking channe ls offered to terrorists by the internet23 and the potential for spillover of battlefield skills technology and ordnance from iraq httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33555crs10 24 the nctc uses definition of terrorism fo r its 2005 data collection that is significantly broader and includes acts of terror which form erly might have been excluded because they were not considered truly international or that may have previously been excluded because the victims might have not have been defined as noncombatants see nctc report on incidents of terrorism 2005 and nctc country reports on terrorism 2005 statistical annex the revisedbroader definition of terrorism used by the nctc is premeditated politically motivated violence perpetrated against noncombatant targets in past years the report did not attempt to fully tally terrorist attacks that killed only the citizens of the country in which the attack took place this was partly due to difficulties with the resources available to obtain accurate information on ttacks that occurred in rural areas of some countries or where the united states did not see itself directly affected by the violence however some observers argue that this resulte d in not providing sufficiently full picture of the terrorist situation especially when major attack might have had important political consequences such as affecting peace talks or other developments in conjunction with the release of the 2006 state department report rep henry waxman ranking minority member of the house government reform committee released 4page critique titled the bush administrations data on global terrorism in 2005 which expressed concerns about the meaning of the upsurge in incidents and the role of iraq in the upswing 25 note that in many ways this is evidence of success in implementing the priorities set by the september 2002 national security strategy of the united states which states our priority will be first to disrupt and destroy rrorist organizations of global reach and attack their leadership command control and comm unications material support and finances httpwwwwhitehousegovnscnss3html contrast the new march 2006 national security strategy of the united states which continuedissues for the 110th congress consistencycompatibility and significance of data one important issue raised by the depa rtment of state report is whether data released by the nctc concomitantly w ith the 2006 terror report can be used to support categorical assessments of trends in terrorist activity since both the methodology for comp iling such data and the resources devoted to the data have significantly changed over time24 others might argue that in longterm struggle against terror it may not be critical whethe r terrorist incidents are up or down within particular timeframe in th view of these observers what might be more critical is the need to recognize that terror remain s an evolving widespread ongoing deadly and sustained threat that must be addre ssed on many fronts and even if the data should indicate downturns in rrorist incidents policymaker s need to beware false sense of complacency or victory weakened qaeda controversial and politically volatile issue raised by the department of state report is to what extent qaeda has been weakened operationally in the wake of capture and killing of substantial number of its leaders and operatives25 thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33555crs11 25 continued emphasizes that terrorism remains global th reat because of transnational inspiration diffusion of tactics and localized cells that require shortterm and longterm responses terrorist networks today are more dispersed and less centralized they are more reliant on smaller cells inspired by common ideology and less directed by central command structure from the beginning the war on rror has been both battle of arms and battle of ideas fight against the terrorists and against their murderous ideology in the short run the fight involves using military force and other instruments of national power to kill or capture the terrorists deny them safe haven or control of any nation prevent them from gaining access to wmd and cut off their sources of support in the long run winning the war on terror means winning the battle of id eas for it is ideas that can turn the disenchanted into murderers w illing to kill innocent victims httpwwwwhitehousegovnscnss2006section iiihtml 26 see for example alqaeda still in business by peter bergen washington post july 2 2006 pb1 historical da ta appear to indicate that qaeda has an established pattern of lying low between largescale attacks as reflected by seemingly inactive periods between terror incidents in the 1990s according to terrorism analyst alexis debat qaedas leadership has never made empty threats which suggests that while on the run it is still connected to its foot soldiers from bin ladens call on attacking the west in 2002 to ayman zawahiris condemnation of pervez musharraf in 2003 which led to two unsuccessful assassination attempts on the pakist ani president it seems that every warning formulated in these tapes was followed by ac tion there is also some evidence that the leaders of qaeda remain in close touc h with their operational commanders the interrogation of one of them abu faraj libbi shortly after his arrest in march 2005 established that he was in regular if indi rect touch with ayman zawahiri moreover pakistani intelligence sources tell abc news that one of the suicide bombers in the july 7 2005 terrorist attacks in london personally spen t three days with ayman zawahiri in pakistans tribal areas in january 2005 see abcnewscom january 2006 terrorism column under the title qaeda social club see also comments of peter bergen that qaeda is not feeling the heat of th war on terror cnn 360 degree report ticking time bomb by anderson cooper july 6 2006 27 for example if one gives credence to reporting in the one percent doctrine op cit footnote 4 the qaeda leader ship was both quite informed about plans in 2003 to release hydrogen cyanide gas in the new york subway system and quite capable of calling it off arguably because some future megaattack designed to top that of 911 was in the pipelinecommon perception correct or not is that qaedas command and control capabilities have been weakened to the point that the network is unwilling or unable to conduct operations thereby prompting an evolution in qaedas role to one of ideological inspiration and guidance an alternate perspective is that resilient and adaptive qaeda is planning the next megaattacks and not wanting to get involved on the operational leve l in smaller scale attacks until execution of its next major operation26 under such mindset involveme nt in operations before the next megaattack is simply not goal topping the destruction and economic damage of 911 is moreover the terrorists may cal culate that operationa l involvement prior to the next megaattack could compromise both the megaattack and the organization as well risk they may not want to take27 an exception however would appear to be ongoing operational engagement in afghanistan pakistan and iraqhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33555crs12 28 this is not to say that the state partment report does not address such groups individually at

not sufficiently emphasized in the state department report is the overall growth in numbers and political influence of radical islamist fundamentalis t political parties throughout the world some of which reportedly serve or might serve as fronts for terrorist activity even if not actively serving as fronts for terrorist activity some are concerned that the actions and agendas of such groups could facilitate creation of political climate in their home countries which views terrorism as politically acceptable tactic and which might make their home countries appear as an attractive location for active terrorist groups to establish secure base examples of such groups cited by scholars and the media include the justice and prosperity party and the muja heddin council mmi in indonesia the

democratic processes presents major policy dilemmas for the united states since it pits us s upport for democracy di rectly against americas commitment to aggressively combat terrorism adequacy of international antiterror cooperation another potential issue related to the state department report involves the adequacy of international antiterrorism cooperation an avowed core component of us antiterror strategy whereas the state departments country reports on terrorism report provides substantive indepth data and analysis on levels of anti terrorism cooperation with i ndividual countries on an i ndividual basis as well as cooperative efforts underway using intern ational or regional organizations some argue that it does not collectively link such levels of cooperation or lack thereof to any overall trend or trends in the aggregate are levels of foreign nation support or buyin for us countert error policy and programs increasing or decreasing critics suggest any effort to plot trends in inte rnational cooperation would be quite speculative and prone to stress quantitative factors such as the number of countries meeting certain coope rative levels rather than the relative importance of each countrys cooperation to united states strategic goals and objectives what are the trends related to schools teaching radical jihadism schools for youth in countries where ther is teaching of radical jihadism and affiliated intolerance and tred may serve as breeding ground for terrorist ideology and proterrorist sentiment madrasas religious schools often backed by saudi money are often perceived to encourage militancy and are particular concern inhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33555crs14 30 see pakistani religious schools face scrutin by riaz khan ap dispatch of july 19 2005

national academies press washi ngton dc 2002 p 515 pakistan especially in areas along the afghanistan border30 therefore it would seem important to have be tter understanding of trends concerning these schools and their curricula terror groups evolving into criminal groups the overlap of terrorist activity with international crime presented by the department of states repor t suggests yet another challenge for consideration to what degree if at all will terrorist or ganizations increasingly morph into criminal networks motivated by profit rather than ideology it might be at some later point in time some terrorist groups would shy away from terrorism which is generally not considered good for criminal business activity this is in line with thinking that engaging in criminal activity especially the lucrative illicit drug trade can become selfperpetuating as such criminal activity often becomes institutionalized making it difficult for groups to disengage themselves 31 classic example involves the socalled revolutionary armed forces of colombia farc which initially provided hired protection to coca leaf gr owers and processors and subsequently moved into coca cultivation and processing notwithstanding more likely scenario appears to be that microterror actors will remain terror focused but will increasingly turn to crime to finance terror resource allocation between larger and smaller attacks both the department of states tren d analysis and that of nongovernment specialists paint picture of jihadistins pired terror groups consumed by the desire to inflict major physical and economic damage with little ideological or moral constraints on mass casualty ttacks some in these groups appear to be actively seeking the material technology and skills to carry out such attacks and indeed may already possess them on the other hand th number of daytoday lowtech terror attacks using more traditional bombs and bullets appears to be dramatically rising in frequency and cannot be downplayed this situation might pose challenge in allocating resources should anti terrorism efforts and res ources worldwide concentrate on preventing or mitigating the growing phenomenon of daytoday relatively low impact and low casualty terrorist attacks or should they centrate on preventing or mitigating possible catastrophic damage masscasualty attacks on scale heretofore not experienced but which may not be imminent are there measures which could negatively impact on both types of terrorist interest and activityhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33555crs15 32 see terrorism future tactics stra tegy and stealth by peter probst in hiimpact terrorism proceedings of russian american workshop national research council national academies press washington dc 2002 p 260267 33 see foreign policy terrorism tally not that useless by corine hegland national journal may 14 2005 note however that in some cases there may be conflicting claims of credit and it is not always possible to defi nitively sort them out when group is cited by the nctc as the culprit rather than competing terrorist group this does not necessarily reflect the best consensus of the intelligen ce community as nctc statistical reporting is not designed to confirm the accuracy of perp etrator claims and public allegations against groupsresponding to unclaimedanonymous terrorism another potential issue is how to re spond to the growing number of terrorist attacks that are unattributed or claimed in manner in which the true identity of their perpetrators is masked such trend might suggest that increasingly the goal of terrorist attacks is to inflict as much da mage on the enemy as possible without linking attacks to specific goals such as the release of prisoners and with little importance given to gaining publicity for the specific group inflicting the damage terrorists may believe that recruitment and popular s upport for terrorism will increase after each successful attack and that it is relatively immaterial for the perpetrating group to publically identify itself moreover not revealing or masking the real identity of the perpetrating group makes it more di fficult for law enforcement or retaliatory operations to effectively target them in some instances it may not even be possible to determine if particular event is an act of terror for example is particular train wreck an explosion at chemical plant forest fire an increase in computer viruses or an outbreak of bse or west nile virus the result of negligen ce an act of terror or an act of god although there may not yet be sufficient data to confirm ch trend towards anonymous terror attacks some homed in on the phenomenon of stealth terrorism as early as june of 1991 when it was discussed at joint american academy of sciencerussian academy of scien ce workshop on highimpact terrorism32 more recently research conducted by the national journal which was largely based on state department data f ound that in 2001 about 20 of the attacks in the governments database were not claimed by any terrorist organization in 2002 it was 40 in 2003 it was slightly more than half and in 2004 more than 70 of attacks carried claim of responsibility33 if validated such trend would have direct impact on antiterror policies since current doctrines of deterrence of and retaliation for terrorist acts are predicated on 1 identifying acts of terrorism and 2 identifying those who commit them some implications for us policy looking at nctc data in the aggregat one might reasonably conclude that terrorists are becoming less constrained and more indiscriminate in their targeting thereby inflicting casualties on broader range of potential targets and victimshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33555crs16

that terrorists interact with the criminal underworld for logistical support services or to the extent that they bypass criminal groups and engage in other illegal activities themselves their exposure and vulner ability to law enforcem ent activity increases as well much is being done to assist domestic law enforcement and security forces and institutions in foreign nations especially traini ng of

national strategy see httpwwwwhitehousegovnewsreleases200510 200510063html an nctc coordinated intera gency national implementation plan nip for the national strategy for comb ating terrorism is reportedly in final stages of review and approval moreover the state departments country reports on terrorism 2005 argues that the threat from small terrorist groups or lone terrorists is rising in frequency as is the potential for these microactors to inflict deadly harm and costly economic damage this finding appears consistent with ot her research and analyses if the trend continues the immediate future is likely to bring larger number of smaller attacks less meticulously planne d and local rather than transna tional in scope on the other hand an increasing number of such att acks could fail through lack of skill or equipment34 of growing concern is what many see as trend by terrorists to launch near simultaneous multiple attacks aimed at causing economic damage such as attacks on transportation tourism nd oil related targets and infrastructures for example in february 2006 saudi security forces thwart ed suicide attack at an oil processing facility in the eastern part of that nation an qaeda affiliate d website subsequently claimed responsibility wave of arrests in the saudi arabia in late march 2006 reportedly thwarted s econd refinery attack35 if terrorist acts are becoming more th product of localized micro actors it raises the question of whether united stat antiterror strategy and tactics should reflect more international lawenforcemen t oriented approach such an approach was envisioned in the february 2003 national strategy for combating terrorism 36 for example the inclusion of the drug enforcement administrations office of national security intelligence as member of the intelligence community will put in place new structures to share information on the ties between international terrorism and international drug traffi cking increased sharing and cooperation between the law enforcement and the intelligence communities could well lead to disrupting some of the ties between rrorist and criminal groups potentially defunding some

exercises the creation of bilateral or multilateral law enforcement task forces staff exchanges of detailees among foreign nd domestic law enforcement agencies and expansion of socalled rule of law programs some observers call for more vigorous focused and better funded public diplomacy initia tives to counter terrorist efforts to generate popular support and gain recruits37 collection and analysis of data which may reveal trends over time might also be strengthened some might argue that it could serve united states and allied interests to see more data analyzed and exchanged on terrorist motivations tactics and organizations by wide range of ins titutions in the public and private sector greater participation in th is process by industry g overnments and academia might prove fruitful however compiling and sharing the data on timely basis may present yet another daunting challenge 38 most agree that the evidence shows that terrorists are seeking to kill as many people as possible and concentrating on hitting economic targets such as support infrastructure and tourism rather than seeking to achieve immediate political objectives such as gaining the release of prisoners if correct this might argue for hardening targets improving the technol ogy and placement of detection equipment and generally beefingup the nations ability to respond to large scale disasters whether caused by acts of god or acts of terror39 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33555crs18 for additional reading crs report rs21937 911 terrorism global economic costs by dick k nanto crs report rl32759 qaeda
