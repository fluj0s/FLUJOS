monuc procurement staff members but stated that the process in which contracts were awarded seem to impli cate system of bribery and favors granted since often times the cont racts awarded did not make economic sense for monuc356 company representative 2 then explained th at monuc was renting barges for transport at fixed price of approximately us30000 to us40000 per month which did not make sense since many of the boats were left at the port unused for months at time 357 in addition the boats rented were overpowered for the cargo they were transporting and therefore cost the organisation more than us2000 per ton for transport while the going rate for transportation was us115 per ton 358 company representative 2 would only meet with the task force investigators to discuss monucs inefficiency but was not willing to meet to discuss the issue of bribes 261 although company representative 2 would not confirm whether tfce had paid any money for their contracts the task force was able to interview confidential witness cw4 who contradicted company representative 2 and admitted that tfce had in fact paid repeated bribes to procurement staff members of monuc in the period of 2000

according to cw4 company representative 2 said he was not willing to make the payments and that they would find way to get the contract without paying the bribes cw4 then informed the monuc staff member that tfce was not willing to make cash payments but could give the pr ocurement staff benefits such as car rentals or money for travel and accommodations360 cw4 did not state whether this offer

know who had negotiated these prices or why this was the case383 281 staff member 14 stated that subject 4 upon arrival at the mission was not yet fluent in english and used to complain that he signed contracts and documents prepared by subject 3 that he should not have si gned because they could cause him problems384 282 subject 2 in his interview of 15 ma 2007 confirmed the information provided by staff member 14385 he stated that the first portfolio that caught his attention when he arrived at the mission was case file name d annotation for the lcc for the lease of additional pushers the case officer responsib for the lease of the boats was subject 3 who in the past had made number of parate awards although the total amount had long since passed the threshol d of lcc approval and thus needed hcc approval he then decided to rotate the case officer and withdrew subj ect 3 from the boat contracts because the review of the files had shown th at she had not handled the case properly and in accordance with the procurement rules and regulations for example potential vendors were selected by word of mouth as some contracts had been awarded in 2001 or early 2002 advertisements were announced either in the local newspapers or on the procurement website and one kn ew how the vendors were chosen386 the selection process itself was flawed as the scope of work was extremely vague and did not describe the minimum performance specific ations necessary for proper technical evaluation technical evaluations were not conducted on each boat and each solicitation was done in different manner for each of the contract awards387 283 staff member 5 former monuc procurement officer further reported an incident in which he was involved in proc urement exercise for pushers and barges in

and his explanations without merit as such denials are belied by overwhelming evidence to the contrary including forensic evidence gathered on his computer subject 1s inconsistent and false statements as well as contrary statements provided by plethora of witnesses more fully described in the report in that regard the task force finds subject 1 made misleading and false materi statements to the task force namely i when questioned about solic itation of bribes of ekima subject 1 initially stated that he never dealt with company repr esentative 10 the owner of ekima and then later conceded that such interaction was possibility records re flect however that subject 1 was unequivocally the case officer on three separate ekima contracts and clearly solicited bribes from the company as confirmed by company officials such statements by company officials are corrobor ated by other evidence and other similar episodes reported by other vendors and the fact that such statements are inherently credible as there is identified motive for ch officials to offer false statements about such incidents to the contrary subj ect 1s false exculpatory statements are uncorroborated lack any

contradicted by electronic evidence gathered from subject 1s computer which reflects that payments were made to two united nations vendors uac and panache after presented with such evidence subject 1 described the payments as repayments for l oans extended by these two companies the task force does not find these representati ons credible either in light of the circumstances more clearly set forth herein an d the fact that the payments were without interest and without any supporting document ation and were purportedly made two years after the event vi as result of the foregoing the task force finds that subject 1 made knowingly false misleading and inaccurate material statements to task force investigators as reflected above 330 as result of subject 1s scheme to solicit bribes and kickbacks from united nations vendors in exchange fo r favourable treatment and othe r efforts on behalf of such companies and their officials subject 1 seve rely corrupted the procurement exercises in connection with the award of th contracts completely undermined the integrity of the bidding exercises and contributed substantia lly to the poor reputation of the missions procurement service and the damage to the organisations reputati on as whole in the mission as result of subject 1s acts as well as the acts of the other procurement officials described herein it is evident that goods and services were and continue to be routinely procured for the organisation without the use of fair transparent objective and truly competitive process and through brib ery kickbacks corrupt and illegal acts subject 1s acts over the course of at least the past twenty years have perpetuated the stark and clear reality that vendors are requir ed to pay sums of money to united nations officials to secure contracts with th organisation in this mission 331 based upon these findings it is evident th at subject 1s illegal conduct also resulted in substantial financial losses to th organisation as the co sts of bribes granted are generally not borne by the company maki ng the payments but are included in the contract prices offered to and paid by the organisation from 2006 to 2007 alone oios

purchase orders totaling more than us62 million have been issued by subject 1 although the task force is unable to quantify the full extent of the loss caused to the organisation by subject 1s illegal

united nations procurement official in monuc in that he solicited received and accepted ms of money in 2005 from maison mukoie fils vendor doing bus iness with the organisation although subject 2 characterised the receipt of the sum of money as loan he conceded that he received the money to purchase car that he could not otherwis afford to buy with available funds company offi cials confirmed the payment to subject 2 even if the money was subsequently paid back to comp any representative 4 subject 2 received clear and tangible benefit since the payments were made without interest and repayment terms even subject 2 himself admitted that he would have been charged ten percent commission if he sought to secure loan from the local congolese bank such conduct even accepting subject 2s ultimate explanation contravenes the organisations procurement and financial rules governing conduct with vendors 338 the task force further finds that subject 2 made false statements to the task force about the circumstances of his interaction with maison mukoie fils and the receipt and repayment of the money falsely asserting that he had not recei ved anything of value from vendor greater than us20 this stat ement was materially false in that the evidence including subject 2s own statements as well as electronic evidence retrieved from subject 2s computer reveals clea r evidence that subject 2 made us7000 payment to mmf after presented with such evidence subject 2 conceded that he had received us7000 from the company in augus t 2005 subject 2 acknowledged that the principal of the
