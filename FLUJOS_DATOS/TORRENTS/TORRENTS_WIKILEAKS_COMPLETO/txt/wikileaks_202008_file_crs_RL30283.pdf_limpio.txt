suggests there is relatively small and dwindling number of workers available to fill jobs this has prompted some analysts t speculate that we are running out of workers to perpetuate the nations now longest peacetime expansion in the postwar period the unemployment rate does not tell the whole story about how much labo r remains available to meet employer demand however as defined by the bls the unemployment rate is the fraction of the ci vilian noninstitutional population age 16 or older who were not employed during the week in which the current populatio n survey is conducted and who sought work in the prior 4week period this measure understates the potential supply of labor because it captures neither the hidde n unemployed nor the under employed the inclusion of these two groups provides more c omplete tale of the amount of untapped labor in the population and on explanati on for the inflation rates failure to accelerate thus far in response to seeming dearth of workers the hidden unemployed unlike the officially unemployed are not in the labor force the notion underlying the concept of the hidden unemployed is that although these persons are less firmly attached to the labor market than are those officiall counted as unemployed they too desire and are available for employment and have searched for jobs in the nottoodistantpast and consequently they should b considered part of the current supply of labor in july 1999 there were somewha t over 11 million marginally attached persons if they were added to the officia l count of unemployed persons in that month slightly above 63 million it would have raised the potential supply of labor by 18 to nearly 75 million individuals and the unemployment rate from 45 the official not seasonally adjusted unemployment rate in july 1999 to 52 in addition there were ove r 35 million employed persons who would have preferr ed to supply more hours of labor to employers in july 1999 if these underemployed or partially employed persons were included with fully unemployed workers the size of the untapped labor supply would have been 56 larger or nearly 99 million and if marginally attached as well as underemploye d persons were added to the unemployed the number of individua ls potentially available to meet employer demand would have been 74 larger or almost 11 million th inclusion of both these groups would have produced unemployment rate of 77 compared to julys official unemployment rate of 4 5 just such comparisons might have underpinned federal reserve board chairman alan greenspans

small and dwindling number of workers ready to fil l already existing or new positions this has prompted some analysts to speculate that we are running out of workers to perpetuate the now longest peacetime expansion in the postwar period the unemployment rate following the end of the 19901991 recession in march the unemployment rate took an unusual course to begin with it actually rose from 68 at the bottom of the recession to the 7 range from october 1991 th rough june 1993 see table 1 the unemployment rate then fell below what many economists consider to be ful l employment rate or the nonaccelerating inflation rate of unemployment nairu between september 1994 and june 1997 the unemploym ent rate was in the 5 range before dropping into the 4 range where it remains to date what has man observers perplexed is that even at such low level by historical standards th seeming scarcity of workers has not yet exerted much upward pressure on th inflation rate the unemployment rate does not tell the whole story about how much labo r remains available to meet employer demand however as defined by the bls the unemployment rate is the fraction of the ci vilian noninstitutional

board chairman alan greenspan spoke of the strong demand for labo r reducing the pool of available workers this pool is not limited to already active jobseekers but also includes individu als who would like to work but havent recently looked for jobs and individuals who would like to work longer hours than they ar presently marginally attached persons what distinguishes the socalled hidden unemployed from the officiall unemployed group is that the former are not in the labor force the notio nhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30283crs3 castillo monica d persons outside the labor force who want

httpstatsblsgovproghomehtm castillo persons outside the labor force who want job 3underlying the concept of hidden unemployment is that although these persons are less firmly attached to the labor market than are persons officially counted s unemployed they too desire and are available for employment and have searched for jobs in the not toodistant past and consequently they should be considered part of the current supply of labor since 1967 the bls has asked cps respondents who are not in the labor force about whether they want job with the m ajor revision of the cps in 1994 the bls definition of individuals outside the labor force w ho would like to work has changed1 currently the hidden unemployed or marginally attached group is composed f individuals in the civilian noninstitutional population age 16 or older who 1 desire jobs 2 are available to work and 3 have engaged in job search in the past 12 month period as noted above to be considered unem ployed an individual must have searched for work in the 4week period preceding the survey week from 7 to 10 or 48 to 62 million of those who w ere not in the labor force between 1994 and 1998 also reported that they wanted job much smalle r2 number who indicated that they desired employment met the two other criteria fo r classification as marginally attached persons 1118 million although the hidden unemployed are small group when compared to the official count of unemploye d persons 11 millio n and 63 million respectively in july 1999 their addition to the unemployed members of the labor force raised the untapped pool of workers by 18 to almost 75 million individuals in that month people with marginal attachment to the labor force offer various reasons for failing to have recently sought emp loyment the bls categorizes these as economic reasons eg thinks work is available could not find work lacks schooling r training and discrimination including employer thinks person is too old and s noneconomic reasons eg childcare and transportation problems famil respons ibilities attending school or training and poor health persons within th margina lly attached group who offer economic reasons typically are referred to s discouraged workers in july 1999 they totaled 290000 or about onefourth f the larger group it typical ly was assumed that discouraged workers would be more likely tha n other marginally attached persons to enter the labor force in fullemploymen t economy such as currently is being experienced according to recent analysis however discourage d workers in 1994 exhibited weaker labor force attachment and jobholding in 1995 than other marginally attached persons perhaps because th formers reasons for nonparticipation and nonemployment were more intransigent3httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30283crs4 monthly data for the marginally attached group are not available on seasonally adjusted4 basis it is expected that seasonal adjustment will come later when bls has more experience with the new seri until such time comparisons should be made for the same month year overyea r rather than within the same year monthtomonth when monthly data for th marginally attached group are used in conju nction with other labor force series not seasonally adjusted data for the latter should be used as wellas shown in table 2 marginally attached indivi duals numbered slightly over 13 million on average in 1998 and they shrank furth er through the first 7 months of 1999 to somewhat mor than 11 million presumably their ranks have dwindled because favorable economic conditions enticed them to more actively seek jobs and thereby enable the labor force to continue to grow between july 1994 and july 1999 th number of marginally attached individuals declined by 711000 over the sam period the size of the labor force swelled by 83 million at most then marginally4 attached persons might have allowed the labor force to be onetenth larger than i t otherwise would have been over the past 5 years table 2 the number of marginally attached persons numbers in thousands 1994 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 january 2120 1783 1737 1615 1479 1358 february 1951 1721 1838

peoples desire and availability for fulltime jobs were inferred from 19947 onward cps respondents have been asked explicitly about their desire and availability fo r fulltime work the reduced number of involuntary part timers results almost entirely from the direct question about desire for fulltime work the question on availability has littl affect nardone thomas parttime employment reasons demographics and trends journal of labor research v 16 3 summer 1995 p 289involuntary parttime workers the vast majority of parttime workers more than four out of five want to be employed fewer than 35 hours per week they are referred to as voluntary part timers the remaining workers employed between 1 and 34 hours week want t work longer hours they are referred to as involuntary parttimers the partiall employed or unde remployed or persons employed parttime for economic reasons5 although this group has increased as share of total parttimers in recent decades cyclically induced fluctuations aside involuntary parttime workers remain smal l share of the labor force in 1998 for example persons employed parttime fo r economic reasons comprised less than 3 of the civilian labor force6 just as the unemployment rate continued to rise for some time after the end of the recession in march 1991 so too did this measure the number of person s involuntarily employe d parttime did not start to decrease until 1994 although some of the decline from 65 million in 1993 to 46 million in 1994 is due to the revision of the cps that began in that year7 the extent of underemployment has continued to s hrink since 1994 with the rate of decrease picking up substantially in the late 1990s see table 3 in 1995 the number of workers involuntarily employed parttime dropped by 33 and in 1996 by 35 in 1997 the pace quickened to 57 and in 1998 the extent f underemployment dr opped by 99 this trend likely is related to the initially weak recovery in the labor market from the 19901991 recession and mo re rapid job growth later in the decade most recently there were over 35 million workers who would have preferred to supply more hours of labor to employers if these underemployed workers were included with fully unemployed workers the size of the poten tial labor supply would have been 56 larger or nearly 99 million rather than 63 million workers and if marginally attached as well as underemployed persons almost 47 million wer added to t he unemployed the amount of untapped labor available to meet employer demand would have been 74 larger or almost 11 million

concluding remarks the preceding ana lysis implies that we are not yet close to running out of labor to fill newly created and already existing jobs in the st ill expanding us economy by adding to the numb er of unemployed workers those persons who indicated that they are marginally attached to the labor force and those employed individuals wh reported that they preferred to work more hours than they are currently the untapped pool of workers in july 1999 was 10989000 rather than 6319000 based on these additions the unem ployment rate might be more nearly 77 than 45 the official unemployment rate in july 1999 just such comparison might have underpinned chairman greenspans observation while testifying before the joint economi c commit tee in june of this year that labor market tightness has not as yet put th current expansion at risk rather than shortage of labor per what might well produce more rapid wage and price increases in the coming months is mismatc h between the skills possessed by available workers and the skills demanded b employers for the available jobs
