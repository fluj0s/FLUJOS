of the senate the senate conducts executive business only after it has resolved into executive session senate rule xxix is concerned with executive sessions rule xxx discusses proceedings on treaties this report1 is one of series of crs reports on aspects of the legislative process for more information on legislative process see httpwwwcrsgovproductsguides guidehomeshtml when the president submits treaty to the senate the treaty and any supporting materials are referred to the committee on foreign relations paragraph 3 of senate rule xxix requires that all treaties and all remarks votes and proceedings thereon shall also be kept secret until the senate shall by their resolution take off the injunction of secrecy at the time the treaty is referred to committee the senate typically agrees by unanimous consent to remove the injunction of secrecy see senator orrin g hatch removal of injunction of secrecy treaty document 1082 congressional record daily edition vol 149 february 11 2003 p s2227 the foreign relations committee has the options of ordering the treaty reported back to the senatefavorably unfavorably or without recommendationor of declining to act on the treaty if the committee votes to report treaty it is placed on the senates executive calendar and must lie over on this calendar for one day before floor consideration the senate may waive this layover requirement by unanimous consent when the senate is prepared to consider the treaty the majority leader typically makes non debatable motion in legislative session that the senate go into executive session for the purpose of considering that treaty if the senate already is in executive session or if the senate agrees simply to resolve into executive session without the purpose for doing so being specified in the motion then motion made in executive session to proceed to any but the first item listed on the executive calendar is debatable once in executive session the senate first considers the text of the treaty itself just as it would consider the text of bill in legislative session the treaty is amendable and it is open for amendment at any point with any amendments proposed by the foreign relations committee being considered first when there is further debate or amendment the senate does not vote on approving the treaty instead the senate takes up resolution of ratification by which the senate formally gives its advice and consent empowering the president to proceed with the ratification of the treaty this resolution typically states resolved twothirds of the senators present concurring therein that the senate advise and consent to the ratification of the treaty in question when the resolution of ratification is presented to the senate it incorporates any amendments to the treaty that the senate had approved one day is to elapse between the time the senate completes action on the treaty itself and the time it begins consideration of the resolution of ratification although this requirement also is frequently waived by unanimous consent after the senate has begun considering this resolution amendments proposing to change the text of the treaty itself longer are in order however senators may amend the resolution of ratification by attaching to it reservations declarations 1 this report was written by paul s rundquist formerly specialist in american national

implementation of the treaty again the senate first considers any reservation or other proposition that the foreign relations committee has reported the final vote on agreeing to the resolution of ratification with whatever reservations or other propositions may have been attached to it requires vote of twothirds of the senators present and voting quorum being present twothirds vo also is required to agree to motion to postpone indefinitely further consideration of the treaty and accompanying resolution because adopting that motion has the effect of disposing of the treaty permanently all other motions including those proposing treaty amendments or reservations require only simple majority votes treaties resolutions of ratification reservations and other propositions are all debatable under the normal rules of the senate and are subject to the senates cloture rule rule xxii when cloture is invoked on resolution of ratification action on all amendments and reservations must be completed before vote on ratification under the rules 30hour time limit frequently the senate agrees by unanimous consent to dispense with consideration of the treaty itself and proceeds immediately to consider the resolution of ratification treaties unlike bills and other legislative measures remain before the senate from one congress to the next until they are disposed of or withdrawn by the president paragraph 2 of rule xxx states in part that all proceedings on treaties shall terminate with the congress and they shall be resumed at the commencement of the next congress as if proceedings had previously been had thereon thus if the foreign relations committee fails to report treaty before the end of congress the treaty remains before the committee during the next congress if the committee has reported treaty but the senate has not completed floor consideration of it when the congress ends the treaty is recommitted to the committee and the committee must report it again before the senate may consider it on the floor for additional information see riddick s senate procedure pp 832842 and 12941310 and treaties and other international agreements the role of the
