from ben santer santer1llnlgov to tim osborn tosbornueaacuk subject re update on response to douglass et date thu 10 jan 2008 130028 0800 replyto santer1llnlgov cc philip d jones pjonesueaacuk xflowed dear tim thanks very much for your email i greatly appreciate the additional information that youve given i am bit conflicted about what we should do ijc published paper with egregious statistical errors douglass et was essentially commentary on work by myself and colleagues work that had been previously published in science in 2005 and in chapter 5 of the first us ccsp report in 2006 to my knowledge none of the authors or coauthors of the santer et science paper or of ccsp 11 chapter 5 were used as reviewers of douglass et i am assuming that when he submitted his paper to ijc douglass specifically requested that certain scientists should be excluded from the review process such an approach is not defensible for paper which is largely comment on previouslypublished work it would be fair and reasonable to give ijc the opportunity to set the record straight and correct the harm they have done by publication of douglass et i use the word harm advisedly the author and coauthors of the douglass et ijc paper are using this paper to argue that nature not co2 rules the climate and that the findings of douglass et invalidate the discernible human influence conclusions of previous national and international scientific assessments quick publication of response to douglass et in ijc would go some way towards setting the record straight i am troubled however by the very real possibility that douglass et will have the last word on this subject in my opinion based on many years of interaction with these guys neither douglass christy or singer are capable of admitting that their paper contained serious scientific errors their last word will be an attempt to obfuscate rather than illuminate they are not interested in improving our scientific understanding of the nature and causes of recent changes in atmospheric temperature they are solely interested in advancing their own agendas it is telling and troubling that douglass et ignored radiosonde data showing substantial warming of the tropical troposphere data that were in accord with model results even though such data were in their possession such behaviour constitutes intellectual dishonesty i strongly believe that leaving these guys the last word is inherently unfair if ijc are interested in publishing our contribution i believe its fair to ask for the following 1 our paper should be regarded as an independent contribution not as comment on douglass et this seems reasonable given i the substantial amount of new work that we have done and ii the fact that the douglass et paper was not regarded as comment on santer et 2005 or on chapter 5 of the 2006 ccsp report even though douglass et clearly was comment on these two publications 2 if ijc agrees to 1 then douglass et should have the opportunity to respond to our contribution and we should be given the chance to reply any response and reply should be published sidebyside in the same issue of ijc id be grateful if you and phil could provide with some guidance on 1 and 2 and on whether you think we should submit to ijc feel free to forward my email to glenn mcgregor with best regards ben tim osborn wrote at 0352 10012008 ben santer wrote much as i would like to see highprofile rebuttal of douglass et in journal like science or nature its unlikely that either journal will publish such rebuttal so what are our options personally id vote for grl i think that it is important to publish an expeditious response to the statistical flaws in douglass et in theory grl should be able to give us the desired fast turnaround time why not go for publication of response in ijc according to phil this option would probably take too long id be interested to hear any other thoughts you might have on publication options hi ben and phil as you may know phil certainly knows im on the editorial board of ijc phil is right that it can be rather slow though faster than certain other climate journals nevertheless ijc really is the preferred place to publish though downside is that douglass et may have the opportunity to have response considered to accompany any comment i just contacted the editor glenn mcgregor to see what he can do he promises to do everything he can to achieve quick turnaround time he didnt quantify this and he will also ask the publishers for priority in terms of getting the paper online asap after the authors have received proofs he genuinely seems keen to correct the scientific record as quickly as possible he also said and please treat this in confidence which is why i emailed to you and phil only that he may be able to hold back the hardcopy ie the printpaper version appearance of douglass et possibly so that any accepted santer et comment could appear alongside it presumably depends on speed of the review process if this does persuade you to go with ijc glenn suggested that i could help because he is in kathmandu at present with achieving the quick turnaround time by identifying in advance reviewers who are both suitable and available obviously one reviewer could be someone who is already familiar with this discussion because that would enable fast review ie someone on the email list youve been using though i dont know which of these people you will be asking to be coauthors and hence which wont be available as possible reviewers for objectivity the other reviewer would need to be independent but you could still suggest suitable names well thats my thoughts let know what you decide cheers tim dr timothy j osborn academic fellow climatic research unit school of
