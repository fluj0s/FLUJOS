minister jeanlouis borloo told the ambassador that the key to advancing climate negotiations is to drop the notion of legally binding treaty in favor of system of national commitments he also argued that it would be up to small group of eight or ten heads of state and their sherpas to negotiate implementation of the copenhagen accord borloo attributed the european obsession with legally binding treaties to its postwar history and experience in creating the eu by progressively ceding sovereignty via treaty the key to reaching this kind of deal would be credible action on tradable quotas forests and finance including innovative financing mechanisms the copenhagen accord was not failure but allowing the means to become the ends was trap end summary 2 c ambassador rivkin called on minister of state for sustainable development jeanlouis borloo on february 11 to review the copenhagen conference and next steps on the accord they had last met on the eve of the conference reftel borloo expressed in several different ways the idea that copenhagen had gone off track because its approach had been too western and too european major emerging countries were not prepared to cede sovereignty to treaty while eu members saw this as both normal and essential borloo observed that copenhagen had in fact established possible global deal on emissions reductions by the united states china and europe we will not get beyond this balance at the next conference of the parties cop in cancun he said 3 c borloo insisted that unfccc cop negotiators did not have the ability to close deal after years of ongoing negotiations it was now up to the major heads of state he suggested group of eight or ten germany and france for europe the united states china india brazil algeria and ethiopia and possibly south africa once these leaders working through their sherpas or personal representatives agree on an implementation plan for copenhagen it will be largely acceptable to and accepted by the rest of the world and can then be returned to forum to be finalized borloo dismissed the role of spain as the current eu presidency country saying that spain has exceeded its kyoto protocol targets by 50 percent and is mired by its internal economic situation the united nations also did not have any leadership capacity to advance the negotiations he said 4 c borloo argued that the key to implementing the equilibrium revealed at copenhagen was an arrangement that would be voluntary but also automatic in implementation and would include tradable emissions quotas with linked carbon markets forestry mechanism redd plus and financing including innovative financing and fast start mechanism he commented that china would agree to such system as far preferable to us and eu carbon border tax or tariff arrangement 5 c borloo thought that adhesion to the copenhagen accord would be more than adequate to establish its acceptance and he expected most of africa and three quarters of the island states to sign on he relayed that france continues to advocate adhesion and said that he personally was travelling and meeting with key country counterparts including china and india 6 c comment borloo conveyed strategic view of these negotiations that has changed significantly we note especially his assessment that legally binding instrument is not only unnecessary but also impossible he stressed that unlike some europeans the french understood the usg position and had not been critical of the united states at copenhagen in fact he said the success of the copenhagen accord for the usg had been the direct engagement of president obama end comment 7 u borloo also passed letter from himself on behalf of the french people to secretary of energy chu expressing condolences for the loss of life at the kleen energy power plant in middletown connecticut and expressing his wish that those injured in the explosion recover quickly the embassy has faxed the letter to the department of energy rivkin
