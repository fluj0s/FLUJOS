from phil jones pjonesueaacuk to mannpsuedu subject re thompson et paper date thu may 22 092852 2008 cc gavin schmidt gschmidtgissnasagov mike gavin ok as long as youre not critical and remember the embargo ill expect nature will be sending the paper around later today to the press embargoed till the middle of next week attached is the pdf this is the final one bar page and volume numbers also attached is our latest draft press release this is likely ok except for the last paragraph which were still working on there will also be news and views item from dick reynolds and nature news piece from quirin schiermeier i dont have either of these i did speak to quirin on tuesday and hes also spoke to dave and john it took while to explain the significance of the paper i hope to get these later two items before i might have to do any interviews early next week we have bank holiday on monday in the uk the press release will go out jointly from the met office and uea not sure exactly when potentially the key issue is the final nature sentence which alludes to the probable underestimation of ssts in the last few years drifters now measuring ssts dominate by over 2 to 1 cf ships drifters likely measure ssts about 01 to 02 deg c cooler than ships so we could be underestimating ssts and hence global t i hope dick will discuss this more it also means that the 196190 average sst that people use to forcecouple with models is slightly too warm shipbased ssts are in decline lots of issues related to the shipping companies wanting the locations of the ships kept secret also some minor issues of piracy as well you might want to talk to scott woodruff more about this bit of background loads more uk ww2 logs have been digitized and these will be going or have gone into icoads these logs cover the ww2 years as well as the late 1940s up to about 1950 it seems that all of these require bucket corrections my guess will be that the period from 194549 will get raised by up to 03 deg c for the ssts so about 02 for the combined in digitizing they have concentrated on the south atlanticindian ocean log books 1httpbrohanorghadobsdigitised_obsdocs and click on sst to see some comparisons the periods mentioned here dont seem quite right as more later 1940s logs have also been digitized there are more log books to digitize for ww2 they have done about half of those not already done if anyone wonders where all the rn ships came from many of those in the s atlanticindian oceans were originally us ships the uk got these through the churchillroosevelt deal in 193940 occasionally some ships needed repairs and the uk didnt have the major parts so this will explain the voyages of few south of oz and nz across the pacific to seattle and then back into the fray icoads are looking into project to adjustcorrect all their log books also attaching ppt from scott woodruff scott knows who signed this if you want to look through anything then email i have another paper just accepted in jgr coming out on chinese temps and urbanization this will also likely cause stir ill send you copy when i get the proofs from agu some of the paper relates to the 1990 paper and the fraud allegation against weichyung wang remind on this in few weeks if you hear nothing cheers phil ps crutyndall won silver medal for our garden at the chelsea flower show the theme of the show this year was the changing climate and how it affects gardening clare goodess was at the garden on tuesday she said she never stopped for her 4 hour stint of talking to the public only one skeptic she met the environment minister she was talking about the high and low emissions garden the minister phil woolas seemed to think that the emissions related to the ability of the plants to extract co2 from the atmosphere hed also not heard of the uhi still lots of education needed pps our web server has found this piece of garbage so wrong it is unbelievable that tim ball wrote decent paper in climate since ad 1500 i sometimes wish id never said this about the land stations in an email referring to alex von storch just shows how up to date he is 2httpcanadafreepresscomindexphparticle3151 at 2012 21052008 michael mann wrote hi phil gavin and i have been discussing we think it will be important for us to do something on the thompson et paper as soon as it appears since its likely that naysayers are going to do their best to put contrarian slant on this in the blogosphere would you mind giving us an advance copy we promise to fully respect natures embargo ie we wouldnt post any article until the paper goes public and we dont expect to in any way be critical of the paper we simply want to do our best to help make sure that the right message is emphasized thanks in advance for any help mike
