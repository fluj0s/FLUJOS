of terrorist attacks upon the united states hereafter the 911 report was published in july 2004 and included numerous recommendations to enhance among other measures terrorism information1 and intelligence sharing across the federal government as well as between the federal government and stat and local governments the primary interest of these changes was to deter detect and ultimately prevent terrorist attacks such as that which took place on september 11 2001 on december 17 2004 congress passed the intelligence reform and terrorism prevention act of 2004 irtpa pl 108458 the law included many of the initiatives outlined in the 911 report including the codification of the director of national intelligence position and the establishment of national counter terrorism center the law also created an information sharing environment ise led by program manager to facilitate the means for sharing terro rism information among all appropriate federal state local and tribal entities and the private s ector through the use of policy guidelines and technologies2 while the irtpa directed substantial changes in the intelligence community it was perceived that from an

enhancement although the provisions are not identical much of the responsibility for the initiatives under the bills would be implemented either by the secretary of homeland security or by the dhs chief intelligence officer position also currently assigned the title of assistant secretary for intelligence and analysis as explained below hr 1 recommends that the existing position of assistant secretary for intelligence and analysis be changed to an under secretary for intelligence and analysis s 4 makes such change and th erefore refers to either the secretary of dhs andor the chief intelligence officer sometimes in consultation with other governmental officials as being res ponsible for implementing the initiatives at the most aggregate level the bills would require the secretary of dhs to integrate and standardize the information of the intelligence components of the department into partment information sharing environment8 such an integration would be administered by the under secretary for intelligence and analysis hr 1 or the chief intelligence officer s 4 the two bills define dhs intelligence component similarly as any directorate ag ency or element of the department that gathers receives analyzes produces or disseminates homeland security information furthermore each of the bills would require the secretary s 4 or the under secretary for intelligence and analysis hr 1 to enhance the homeland security advisory system9 whichhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34061crs5 10 as terms of art warning and alert terms are often used interchangeably at the most basic level the difference between the two terms turns on at least the following three factors 1 accuracy and validityreliability of the intelligence 2 extent to which intelligence indicates that threat is immine nt and 3 extent and specificity of federally recommended remedial actions to combat the th reat if the terms are viewed on spectrum with the far left being advisory and the far ri ght being warning it could be argued that as information or intelligence moves from left to right the confidence in the intelligence may become greater the threat may become more imminent and the security recommendations from the federal government may become more specific shall among other functions provide in each warning or alert10 specific information and advice on appropria protective measures and countermeas ures that may be taken in response to the threat or risk furthermore th responsible dhs official shall whenever possible limit the scop of each advisory or warning to specific region locality or ec onomic sector believed to be at risk unique to hr 1 is pr oposal which would stipulate that the under secretary for intelligence and analysis shall not in issuing any advisory or alert

be used by terrorist against the united states moreover the bill proposes eliminating the twoyear tenure fo r the ises program manager by making it permanent s 4s proposed lang uage would amend section 1016 of the intelligence reform and terrorism preven tion act of 2004 pl 108458 to read the individual designated as the prog ram manager shall serve as the program manager until removed from serv ice and replaced by the president s 4 would also authorize 30 million for each of fis cal years 2008 and 2009 for the ise program manager to hire not more than 40 fulltime employees to assist the program manager in numerous informationsharing functions in two other unique measures s 4 would require the secretary and chief intelligence officer to 1 develop intelligence training curriculum for state local and tribal officials and 2 develop financial and other incentives for employees to share information dhs advisory system with respect to the homeland security advisory system the bills would provide greater congressional direction to the secretary in the administration of this progra m by responding to oftenhear d criticisms directed at the system and the department by first responde rs state and local w enforcement and some private sector entities the sections of the bills which would require the department to provide enhanced advi ce regarding protective measures and countermeasures may prove difficult to implement if enacted as some might question whether the depar tment has in each situation sufficient understanding of the ground truth or current risk prof ile in order to recommend such measures state and local authorities may be more familiar with the resources they have at their disposal to take protective actions against any potential threat if dhs has any specific information about the types of threat directed against particular asset this information could prove highly usef ul if provided to first responders before emphasis added the threat is imminent with regard to the geographic scope of warnings the measures outlined in the bills appear to be consistent with ongoing efforts between the fbi and dhs to provide ch targeted warnings to conserve first responder resources11 definition of dhs intelligence component with respect to the definition of what constitutes dhs intelligence component hr 1s proposed definition codifies activities as intelligence related in manner that appears to go beyond how the department has defined its intelligence enterp rise it stipulates that dhs intelligence component is defined as any directorate agency or element of the department that gathers recei ves analyzes produces or disseminates homeland security information12 according to the dhs intelligence enterprise strategic plan january 2006 the dhs intelligence enterprise includes all those component organizations within th department that have activities producing emphasis added raw inform ation intelligencere lated information andor finishedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34061crs7 13 see crs report rl33858 the department of homeland securitys risk assessment methodology evolution issu and options for congress by todd masse john rollins and siobhan oneilintelligence such an extension be yond production may expand the universe of entities within the department that are considered by the office of intelligence and analysis as part of the intelligence enterprise integration and standardiz ation of dhs intelligence it would appear that given the current state of homeland security intelligence within the department these measures might facilitate more co rporate approach to intelligence at dhs according to dhs management directive 8110 intelligence integration and management january 2006 the chief intelligen ce officer does not have 1 formal budget formulation and execution author ity over the dhs intelligence elements outside of the largely hea dquartersbased office of intelligence and analysis 2 an established and integrated management information system into which all dhs collected intelligence and information is entered or 3 the ultimate authority to recruit and select the leaders of the dhs intelligence components in the absence of these three tools it could be argued that developing sense of what the department knows collectively and perhaps more im portantly what it doe snt know could be problematic moreover recent crs research has indicated that at least with respect to risk assessment and how such assessments flow through the homeland security grant program state and local threat information is not considered in any meaningful and systematic manner13 feedback provided to state local and private sector partners could go long way toward build ing goodwill and more ffectively targeting their information and intelligence collection activities program manager ise term func tions and additional resources given the complexities of the functions ssociated with this position and the long term nature of enhancing intelligence and information sharing across all levels of government it would seem reasonable th at the program manager position be permanent position uncertainty of the pe rmanence of this position might undermine the development of new culture within the intelligence community based on sharing institutional knowledge and the building of broadbased relationships to implement the ises implementation plan published in november 2006 it also appears that s 4 would provide the ise program manager with additional powers to identify and resolve information sharin g disputes between federal departments agencies and components how this w ill be implemented in practice is an open question when possible differences on info rmationsharing issues are raised for example between the fbi and dhs the authority of the ise program manager to direct each or both of these agencies to change their internal informationsharing practices is questionable are the ise program managers authorities commensurate with the positions responsibilities homeland security informationsharing partnerships each of the bills would require the secretary in consultation with the ise program manager the attorney general and others according to s 4 provisions to establish state local and regional information fusion center initiative tohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34061crs8 14 see state local and regional information fusion center initiative in s 4 rs title i section 206 while hr 1 rfs title vii s ection 732 also requires concept of operations for the fusion center initiative it is limited to privacy and civil liberties impact assessmentestablish partnerships with state local and regional fusion centers through this dhs initiative the secretary would carry out 13 functions including but not limited to 1 coordinating with the principal official of each fusion center and the official designated as the state homeland security advisor 2 providing dhs operational and intelligence advice and assistance to th centers 3 conducting tabletop and live training exercises to regularly assess the capability of individual and regional networks 4 provide analy tic and reporting advice and assistance to the centers and 5 review homeland security information gathered by state local and regional fusion centers and incorporate relevant informa tion with homeland security information of the department both bills would require the secretary to draft fusion center concept of operations report to be submitted by the secretary to the house and senate homeland security committees such report would include clear articulation of the purposes goals and specific objectives for which the pr ogram is being developed identify stakeholders in the prog ram and provide an assessment of their needs contain developed set of quantitative metrics to measure to the extent possible program output and include privacy and civil liberties impact assessment14 each of the bills would also establish homeland security information sharingfellows program for the purpose of detailing state local and tribal law enforcement officers and intelligence analysts to the department emphasis added to participate in the work of the office of intelligence and analysis unique house provisions with respect to the aforementioned homeland security information sharing fellows program hr 1 would condition participation in the program on the agreement of the state local or tribal entity to continue to pay the individuals salary and benefits during the peri od for which the individual is detailed however it would also provide for s tipend to cover the individuals reasonable living expenses during the pe riod for which they are detailed to the office of intelligence and analysis subject to the availability of appropriations unique senate provisions s 4 would provide that the chief intelligence officer may to the extent practicable assign officers and intelligence analysts from dhs intelligence elemen ts to state local and regional fusion centers s 4 also proposes requirement that before being assigned to fusion center dhs intelligence analysts must undergo analysis privacy and civil liberties training moreover s 4 outlines the responsibilities of dhs intelligence analysts detailed to state local and regional fusion centers and would require that these individuals havehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34061crs9 15 see testimony of charles allen dhs chief intelligence officer before the senate select committee on intelligence january 25 2007access to all relevant fede ral databases and in formation systems consistent with any policies guidelines procedures instru ctions or standards established by the president or as appropriate the progra m manager of the information sharing environment for the implementation and management of that environment s 4 would authorize to be ppropriated 10 million for each of fiscal years 2008 through 2012 for the fusion center initiative for hiring officers and intelligence analysts to replace officers and intelligence analysts who are assigned to fusion centers finally s 4 proposes the crea tion of the rural policing ins titute which would develop expert training programs designed to addr ess the needs of rural law enforcement agencies regarding combating methamphetamine addiction and distribution domestic violence law forcement response s related to school shootings and other topics to some extent these legislative initiatives would codify nascent yet ongoing activities in the department currently there exists within dhs state and local fusion center program office which performs some of the missions outlined in these bills for example the office is res ponsible for recruiting from both within dhs and externally intelligence analysts and intelligence liaison officers to be detailed to state local and regional fu sion centers dhs currently has 15 such intelligence personnel assigned to fusion cen ters according to charles allen dhs chief intelligence officer by the end of fy2008 dhs plans to embed intelligence officers in more than 35 fusion centers15 however codification of this initiative may provide sense of greater congressional s upport for and direction to such program under s 4 dhs personnel eligible to be assigned to fusion centers in consultation with the respective compone nt head under the proposed fusion center initiative would include the following office of intelligence and analysis or its successor office of infrastructure protection transportation security administration united states customs and border protection united states coast guard and other components of the department as determined by the secretary this s 4 proposal does not specify whether the eligible individuals from the aforementioned dhs components must be fe deral employees or whether contractors serving in these entities may also be eligible this could have implications for the extent to which the dhs individuals ma be granted access to statewide criminal intelligence and information systems resident in most fusion centers homeland security intellig ence offices reorganization hr 1 would amend the homeland secu rity act of 2002 6 usc 121 by replacing the directorate of information analysis and infrastructure protection with proposed office of intelligence and analysis moreover the underhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34061crs10 16 see dhs management directive 8110 intelligence integration and management january 30 2006secretary for information analysis and infrastructure protection would be replaced with an under secretary for intelligence nd analysis the responsibilities of the under secretary for intelligence and analysis would be adjusted with new statutory responsibilities including 1 coordina ting and enhancing integration among intelligence components of the department 2 establishing structure and process to support the mission and goals of the depar tment and 3 ensuring that unclassified reports based on open source informa tion are produced and disseminated contemporaneously with reports or analytic products concerning the same or similar information that the under secretary for intelligence and analysis produces and disseminates in classified format the bill also propos the under secretary for intelligence and analysis establish an internal continuity of operations plan the bill would also codify for the first time the responsibilities of the intelligence components of the department including to ensure that duties related to the acquisition analysis and dissemination of homeland security in formation are carried out effectively and efficiently in support of the under secretary for intelligence and analysis finally the bill would also codify an office of infrastructure protection which would be headed by an assistant secretary for infrastructure protection and would enumerate the proposed responsibilities of the assistant secretary s 4 does not have comparable provision to certain extent these hr 1 measures would codify existing practices and positions within the department secretar chertoffs second stage review of the department made numerous changes in the dhs intelligence structure for example the erstwhile directorate of information analysis and infrastructure protection was disbanded and the office of informati on analysis was renamed the office of intelligence and analysis and became stand alone entity the office of infrastructure protection was placed within the directorate for preparedness the assistant secretary for intelligence analysis was also provided the title of the departments chief intelligence officer16 with respect to the responsibilities of the dhs intelligence components those proposed in hr 1 are largely consistent with those outlined in dhs management directive 8110 intelligence integration and management january 2006 under existing law and internal dhs regulation it appears that the dhs chief intelligence officer continues to have budget execu tion authority with respect to the dhs intelligence com ponents under the aforementioned dhs management directive the chief intelligence officer provides written performance objectives to the heads of the dhs intelligence components and subsequen tly provides input and feedback to the component rating official for the components accomplis hment of those objectives moreover the chief intelligence officer an alyzes workforce requirements for intelligence functional personne l to establish recommende d staffing and resource level parameters and gu idelines for each component to c onsider in short the chief intelligence officer while

2006 report and those in s 4 pertaining to the potential codification of such body are largely consistent historically there has been some leve l of distrust between some federal agencies and some state and local governmental entities engaged in law enforcement and homeland security activities it could be argued that part of this distrust may be result of lack of mutual understanding with respect to the inherent limitations of intelligence with federal officials not unde rstanding entirely the demands of state and local consumers of intelligence and state and local officials believing that the federal government possesses specific intelligence which they refuse to share in this context programs such as the itacg that involve an exchange of personnel may be positive insofar as they allow for enhanced mutual understanding of the true role intelligence can play in countering terrorism
