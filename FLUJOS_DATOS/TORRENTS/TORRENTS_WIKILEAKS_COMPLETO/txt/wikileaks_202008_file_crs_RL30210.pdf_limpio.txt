adequacy of th presidents budget for military c onstruction needs and the necessity for congressional addons especially for guard and reserve projects in recent years congress s pointed out that the pentagon has not funded nor planned adequately for militar construction the administration has asked the congress to approve an unusual fundin g mechanism for the fy2000 military construction program in order to fit its defense budget request within the caps set on total discretionary spending in the budge t enforceme nt act of 1997 for fy2000 the administration has requested budge t authority of

in fy2001 in this advanc appropriations proposal congress would approve the 31 billion now for th fy2000 program which would be spent and scored in fy2001 adding the spli t fy2000 request with the

the defense authorization and appropriations bills intertwine this repo rt highlights salient parts of the authorization bill along with the military construction appropriation process the separate military construction appropriations bill dates to the late 1950 s when large defense buildup occurred in response t intercontinental ballistic missile threats and the soviet launch of sputnik defense construction spending soared as facilities were h ardened missile silos were constructed and other infrastructure was built the appropriations committees established milit ary construction subcommittees to deal with this new level of activity consequently the separate militar construction bill was created the first standalone military construction bill was in fy1959 pl 85852 previously military construction funding was provide d through annual defense appropriations or supplemental appropriations bills military construction appropriations are the major but not the sole source f funds for facility investments by the military services and defense agencies th defense appropriations bill provides some funds for real property maintenance i n operation and maintenance accounts in

the fy200 0 military construction budget request the defense departments fy200 03 military construction budget plan includes 85 billion worth of projects but th administration is requesting only 54 billion in appropriations the remaining 31 billion is requested as advance appropriations to be scored as new budget authority in fy2001 this 31 billion is money that normally would not be necessary for the approved projects until after the initial year of availability typically militar construction funds are available for obligation for five years and only part of th money is obligated in the initial year of availability the defense departments normal practice know n as the full funding policy4 has been to request all of th funding needed for each military construction project in single annual appropriation thoug h some projects have occasionally been funded increme ntally the request to provide split funding for fy2000 projects is not change in policy but onetime exercise done only because of budget rules th intent is to reduce requested budget author ity in fy2000 when caps on discretionary funding will remain in place and restore the funding in fy2001 when presumably the caps will be adjusted upward the administration took this unusual step to help the dod fund 126 billion in additions to the fy2000 budget compared to last years plan for fy2000 th 126 billion in added defense programs for readiness and modernization lead to an increase of only 41 billion in the defense budget topline the remaining 8 5 billion in added programs is offset by 1 38 billion in inflation and fuel pric savings 2 16 billion in proposed rescissions of prior yea r funds and 3 31 billion from fy2000 military construction programs split funding proposal some observers believe that the house and senate will look for alternatives to the administrations proposal in order to fully fund the fy2000 military construction program because advance appropriations commits future funding it also limit s congressional discretion on those budget items in the future in the fy1999 military construction budget debate the defens appropriations and authorization committees rejected an army proposal for advance appropriations to fund several large military construction projects during the hearings on the fy2000 military construction plan members of the house armed services committee and the

the american taxpayer more money as contractors may assume more risk associated with building mili tary facilities for dod potentially increasing construction costs over the longer term although the dod states that the advance procurement is onetime budget fix the committees are wary that partial f unding could become regular pattern in future military construction budgets pa rtial funding the committees fear could compound what they see as the problem of chronic underfunding of the military constructio n program longterm pl anning for military construction throughout the 1990s the congres s and administration have debated about whether military constructio n funding and longterm planning are adequate members of gress have complained that poor planning and insufficient funding on the pentagons part has made it difficult for the congress to insure that added military construction projects meet pressin g priorities the department of defense uses formal process called the planning programming and budgeting system ppbs to create its budget for congress the5 ppbs pro cess is also used to prepare dods internal longterm financial plan the longterm plan extends over sixyear period and is known as the future year s defense plan fydp in the 1990s congress has criticized t he pentagons longterm planning for military construction in hearings on the fy2000 military construction request legislators expressed continuing concern over military construction pl anning and the sufficiency of funding rep joel hefley chair of the military installations and fac ilities subcommittee of the house armed services committee argued at hearing on march 16 1999 that the fy2000 budget request like the previous fy199799 reques ts continues the poor planning and downward trend for military construction budgets for the fy1997 2000 military construction requests the administration requested fewer funds than it had programmed in its budget assumptions in the previous years fydp thi s mismatch between plans and funding was cited in the congressional criticism of the pentagons military construction planning since fydp and requested amoun t decreases each year for military construction mr hefley states that he is finding i t difficult to take pentagon future plans for military construction seriously tha t sentiment was echoed by the senate appropriations military constructio n subcommittee chair sen conrad burns who expressed dismay at the lack f longterm planning seen in the fy2000 military construction proposal implementation of the privatiza tion of

continuing problem of military family housing he stated that approximatel twothirds of dods nearly 300000 family housing units need extensive renovation or replacement yim also testified that fixing this problem using only traditiona l military construction methods would take 30 years and cost as much as 16 billion recognizi ng the severity of this problem four years ago congress passed th military housing privatization initiative in the fy1996 defense authorization ac t pl 104106 this gave the pentagon new authorities to obtain private secto r financing and expertise for military housing the authorities are guarantees both loan and rental conveyance or lease of existing property and facilities differential lease payments investments both limited partnerships and stockbond ownership and direct loans the legislation enables the new authorities to be us ed individually or in combination6 the department of defenses housing revitalization support office hrso i s coordinati ng the implementation of the new authorities for each of the services 7 hrso is staffed with 16 fulltime housing and real estate experts from each of th services and the office f secretary of defense along with consultant support the pentagon estimates that with these authorities defense dollars can be leveraged t build three times the amount of housing units financed the traditional way new policies and procedures in the services and dod were needed t implement the privatization initiative new mindset of how to work wit h commerc ial realestate practices and practitioners had to be formed for example office of management and budget had to determine rules approved in june 1997 to account for government obligations with each of the authorities also th pentagon needed to develop loan and loan guarantee concepts into actual documents that the private financial community would trust for investment grade financing which took some time progress with the privatization initiative has been slow rep joel hefley chair of the military installations and facilities subcommitt ee of the house armed services committee stated in march 9 1999 hearing that the congre ss has been disappointed in the pace of privatization implementation especially as the expiration date f february 10 2001 for the fiveyear test period of these authorities approaches the general accounting office

privatization off to slow start and8 continued management attention needed gao report num ber nsiad98178 july 19981998 initial evaluation of lifecycle costs of privatized housing versus traditional8 military housing showed potential savings of onl about 10 or less the proposed longterm time horizo ns for some privatization projects of 50 years or more brought up concerns that the housing might be not needed in the that far into future also the gao pointed out the continuing weakness in the pentagon planning for militar housing gao stated that housing requirements are not integrated with particula r facilities and community needs that the plans underutilize the use of local housing and that there is poor communication b etween offices responsible for housing allowances and military housing construction gao recommended that comprehensive bette r integrated plans could help maximize the privatization initiative while minimizing total housing costs rep hefley also raised serious policy issue i n the pentagons current approach to the implementation of its military family housing privatization program h expressed concern that the military departments particularly in the army and th navy were placing virtually all of t heir hopes for improving military family housing on privatization without being certain that it would work in all locations rep hefley pointed out that privatization was only one tool along with regular militar construction funds which could ameliorate family housing problems history and context the funding pattern for military construction budgets in recent years the congress has added significant amounts to annual administration militar construction budget requests this has been recurring pattern in the 1990s th president proposes what the congress calls an inadequate military constructio n budget especially for guard and reserve nee ds the congress then adds funding for military construction with some attention to guard and reserve projects fo r example congress added 479 million in fy1996 850 million in fy1997 80 0 million in fy1998 and 875 millio n in fy1999 to the military construction accounts congressional additi ons to the military construction budget have been common and controversial throughout the 1990s three themes explain the pattern f recurring congressional additions first some members of the military construction subcom mittees have believed that military construction has been chronicall underfunde d this theme was echoed in recent hearings on the fy2000 budget and the fy1999 and fy1998 report s from the house appropriations committee and the defense authorizing committees cond often congress has different priorities than the administration as reflected in frequent congressional cuts to oversea s construction reques ts and contributions to the nato security investment program third other members of congress as senator bond commented during the floo r debate on fy1996 military construction appropriations believe that the pentago n counts on congress t add money to guard and reserve programs in recent years congre ss has added large amounts for national guard and reserve constructio n projects including peak amount of 4018 million in fy1995 see table 4 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30210crs9 debate over congressional additions to the mil itary construction budget involves several overlapping issues military construction proponents including facilit advocates in the military services argue that military facilities have bee n systematica lly underfunded for many years even some say in the midst of th buildup of the early to mid1980s this line of argument was prominent durin g house appropriatio ns committee markup of the fy1996 military construction bill some complained that the funding level was up 28 from the prior year while others defended the increase as necessary to make up for previous shortfalls in funding for new construction and maintenance the fy1996 enacted amount for militar construction peaked that ye ar at 112 billion the house report on the fy1997 bill hrept 104591 cited dod backlog of deferred maintenance an d repair for family housing alone that totaled over 45 billion dollars dod facility managers have not met their goal to allocate 3 of the plan t replacement value of dod facilities for annual construction and maintenance called real property maintenance at the pentagon although this 3 goal is below th average for public fac ilities nationwide actual dod funding has typically run at 1 to 2 of plant replacement value for example the air force testified on march 16 1999 to the house armed services subcommittee for military installations an d facilities that the air force could budget only 1 for real property maintenance this is why facility proponents welcome any congressional additions finally congressional military construction subcommittees authorization s well as appropriations subcommittees have frequently taken issue wit h administration military construction priorities in the early 1990s for example the committees frequently reduced amounts requested for construction overseas on the grounds that troop levels abroad should be reduced and that allied burdensharin g contribu tions should increase and reallocated the funds to domestic projects i n addition congressional committees have added unrequested funds for quality of life improvements ch as day care centers and barracks renovation the congress has argued that the military services have tended to neglect these areas in favor f warfighting investments the debate over added projects since the congress has added significant amounts to military construction budget s over the last 10 years congressional debate has centered on how to prioritize worthy additional projects in 1994 the senate debate on the military construction appropriations bil l focused the amount of congressional additions to the request despite constraints on overall defense spending senator mcc ain in particular objected to the provision of substantial amounts for projects that the administration had not requested h argued that such projects largely repr esented pork barrel spending and came at the expense of higher priority defense programs in senate floor consideration of th military construction bill that year the managers accepted mccain amendment that called for criteria to be applied to additional projects his amendment included provision that any added project should be on the military lists of critical ye t unbudgeted projects the mccain amendment was not incorporated into the fina l conference version of the bill however and the conference agreement provided over 900 million for unrequested construction projectshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30210crs10 sense of the senate prov ision is provision that requires approval by the senate but9 is not formally p art of the bill and therefore does not have the force of law this type f provision expresses the sense of the senate on policy issues there can also be similar sense of the house and sense of the congress provisionsthe national defense aut horization act for fy1995 pl 103337 however incorporated senator mccains criteria as sense of the senate provision9 providing that the unrequested projects should be 1 essential to the dods national security mission 2 not inconsistent with the base realignment and closure act 3 in the services future years defense plan see above 4 executable in the year they are authorized and appropriated and 5 offset by reductions in other defense accounts through advice from th secretary of defense since the 104 congress the house military construction authorizing an dth appropr iations committees have also used similar criteria in collaboration with th pentagon to add projects to the mil itary construction budget each potential project needs to pass the following criteria similar to the mccain criteria is the projec t essential to the dod mission consistent with brac plans in the future year s defense plan and executable in the coming fiscal year if the project can mee t those criteria the military construction authorizing and appropriations committee s may add the project debate over congressionallyadded projects continues in debate on the fy1999 military construction appropriations conference report senator mccain continued to discuss projects added by congress he noted t hat the congress added 148 domestic projects in all at cost of n early 977 million senator mccain presented his list of questionable projects in the congressi onal record in letter to the president and on his web page httpwwwsenategovmccainmilcnf99htm major funding trends the administration has proposed to split funding for fy2000 militar construction projects between the fy2000 and the fy2001 budgets the budge t request for fy2000 is 54 billion with an additional 31 billion in an advanc appropriations for future costs in fy2001 adding the fy2000 request with th advance appropriations request brings the total value of the proposed fy200 0 military construction program to 85 billion this total
