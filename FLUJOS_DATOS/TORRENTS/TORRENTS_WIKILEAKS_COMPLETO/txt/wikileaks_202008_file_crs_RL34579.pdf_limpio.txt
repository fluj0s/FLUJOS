cycle technologies outlook and policy options summary current us nuclear energy policy fo cuses on the nearterm construction of improved versions of existing nuclear power plants all of todays us nuclear plants are light water reactors lwrs which are cooled by ordinary water under current policy the highly radioactive spent nuclear fuel from lwrs is to be permanently disposed of in deep underground repository the bush administration is also promotin g an aggressive us effort to move beyond lwr technology into advanced react ors and fuel cycles specifically the global nuclear energy partnership gnep under the department of energy doe is developing advanced reprocessing or recycling technologies to extract plutonium and uranium from spent nuclear fuel as well as an advanced reactor that could fully destroy longlived radioactive isotopes does generation iv nuclear energy systems initiative is developing other adva nced reactor technologies that could be safer than lwrs and produce hightem perature heat to make hydrogen does advanced nuclear technology progra ms date back to the early years of the atomic energy commission in the 1940s and 1950s in partic ular it was widely believed that breeder reactors desi gned to produce maximum amounts of plutonium from natural uranium would be necessary for providing sufficient fuel for large commercial nuclear power industr early research was also conducted on wide variety of other power reactor concepts some of which are still under active consideration although l ong goal of nuclear power proponents the reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel is also seen as weapons proliferation ri sk because plutonium extracted for new reactor fuel can also be used for nuclear weapons therefore primary goal of us advanced fuel cycle programs including gnep has been to develop recycling technologies that would not pr oduce pure plutonium that could easily be diverted for weapons use the prolifer ation resistance of these technologies is subject to considerable debate much of the current policy debate over advanced nuclear t echnologies is being conducted in the appr opriations process for fy 2009 the house appropriations committee recommended further funding for gnep although it increased funding for the generation iv program typically the senate is more supportive of gnep and reprocessi ng technologies recent industry studies conducted fo r the gnep program conclude that advanced nuclear technolog ies will require many decad of governmentsupported development before they reach the current stage of

nuclear plants worldwide use light wate r reactor lwr technology that was initially developed for naval propulsion cooled by ordinary water lwrs in the early years were widely considered to be an inter im technology that would pave the way for advanced nuclear concepts after the ear ly 1960s the federal government focused most of its nuclear power research and development efforts on breeder reactors and high temperature reactors that could use uranium resources far more efficiently and potentially operate more safely than lwrs however four decades later lwrs continue to dominate the nuclear power industry and are the only technology curren tly being considered for new generation of us commercial reactors federal licen applications for as many as 30 new lwrs have been recently announced the proposed new nuclear power plants would begin coming on line around 2016 and opera for 60 years or longer under that scenario lwrs appear likely to dominate the nuclear power industry for decades to come if the next generation of nuclear power plants consists of lwrs what is the potential role of advanced nuc lear reactor and fuel cycle technologies do current plans for new generation of lwrs rais potential problems that advanced nuclear technologies could or should address can new fuel cy cle technologies reduce the risk of nuclear weapons proliferation what is the appropria time frame for the commercial deployment of new nuclear technology this report provides background and analysis to help congress address those questions prominent among the policy issues currently before congress is the direction of the existing nuclear energy programs in the us department of energy doe doe administers programs to encourage nearter m construction of new lwrs such as the nuclear power 2010 program which is paying half the cost of licensing and firstof akind engineering for new us lwr designs and loan guarantees for new reactors now under consideration by us utilities does global nuclear energy partnership gnep is developing advanced fuel cycl technologies that are intended to allow greater worldwide use of nuclear power without increased weapons proliferation risks advanced nuclear reactors that could increase efficiency and safety are being developed by does generation iv prog ram which is looking beyond todays generation iii light water r eactors the priority given to these options depends not only on the characteristics of existing and advanced nuclear technologies but on the role that nuclear power is expected to play in addressing nationa l energy and environmental goals for example if nuclear energy is seen as key element in global climate change policyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34579crs2 1 actinides consist of actinium and heavier elements in the periodic tablebecause of its low carbon dioxide emissions the deployment of advanced reactor and fuel cycle technologies could be considered to be more urgent than if nuclear power is expected to have limited longterm ro because of econo mic nonproliferation and safety concerns nuclear technology overview as their name implies light water reactors use ordinary water for cooling the reactor core and moderating or slowing the neutrons in nuclear chain reaction the slower neutrons called th ermal neutrons are highly efficient in causing fission splitting of nuclei in certa in isotopes of heavy elements such as uranium 235 and plutonium 239 pu239 therefore smalle r percentage of those isotopes is needed in nuclear fuel to sustain nuclear chain reaction in which neutrons released by fissioned nuclei then induce fission in other nuclei and so forth the downside is that thermal neutrons cannot efficiently induce fission in more than few specific isotopes natural uranium has too low concentr ation of u235 07 to fuel an lwr the remainder is u238 so the u235 concentration must be increased enriched to between 3 and 5 in the reactor th u235 fissions releasing energy neutrons and fission products highly radioactive fra gments of u235 nucle i some neutrons are also absorbed by u238 nuclei to cr eate pu239 which itself may then fission after several years in an lwr fuel assemblies will build up too many neutronabsorbing fission products and beco too depleted in fissile u235 to efficiently sustain nucl ear chain reaction at that point the assemblies are considered spent nuclear fuel and removed from the reactor lwr spent fuel typically contains about 1 u235 1 plutonium 4 fission products and the remainder u238 under current policy the spen t fuel is to be disposed of as waste although only tiny fraction of the original natural uranium has been used long lived plutonium and other actinides1 in the spent fuel pose longterm hazard that greatly increases the complexity of finding suitable disposal site reprocessing or recycling of spent nuclear fuel for use in fast reactors in which the neutrons are not slowed is intended to address some of the shortcomings of the lwr oncethrough fuel cycle fast neutrons are less effective in inducing fission than thermal neutrons but can induce fission in all actinides including all plutonium isotopes therefore nuclear fuel for fast reactor must have higher proportion of fissionable isotopes th an thermal reactor to sustain chain reaction but larger number of different isotopes can constitute that fissionable proportion fast reactors ability to fission all ac tinides makes it theoretically possible to repeatedly separate those materials from sp ent fuel and feed them back into the reactor until they are entirely fissioned fast reactors are also ideal for breeding thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34579crs3 2 world nuclear association processing of used nuclear fuel for

markets march 2007maximum amount of pu239 from u238 even tually converting virtually all of natural uranium to useable nuclear fuel current reprocessing programs are ge nerally viewed by their proponents as interim steps toward commercial nuclear fuel cycle based on fast reactors because the benefits of limited recy cling with lwrs are modest commercialscale spent fuel reprocessing is curre ntly conducted in france br itain and russia the pu239 they produce is blended with uranium to make mixedoxide mox fuel in which the pu239 largely substitutes for u235 tw french reprocessing plants at hague can each reprocess up to 800 metric tons of spent fuel per year while britains thorp facility at sellafield has capacity of 900 metric tons per year russia has 400ton plant at ozersk and japan is building an 800ton plant at rokkasho to succeed 90ton demonstration facility at tokai mura britain and france also have older plants to reprocess gascooled r eactor fuel and india has 275ton plant2 about 200 metric tons of mox fuel is used annually about 2 of new nuclear fuel3 equivalent to about 2000 metr ic tons of mined uranium4 while long goal of nuclear power pr oponents the reprocessing or recycling of spent nuclear fuel is so seen as weapons prolif eration risk because plutonium extracted for new reactor fuel can also be used for nuclear weapons therefore primary goal of us advanced fuel cy cle programs including gnep has been to develop recycling technologies that woul d not produce pure plutonium that could easily be diverted for weapons use the proliferation resistance of these technologies is subject to considerable debate removing uranium from spent nuclear fuel through reprocessing would eliminate most of the volume of radioactive material requiring disposal in deep geologic repository in addition the re moval of plutonium and conversion to shorterlived fission products would eliminate most of the longterm post1000 years radioactivity in nuclear waste but the waste resulting from reprocessing would have nearly the same shortterm radioactivity and heat as the original spent fuel because the reprocessing waste cons ists primarily of fission products which generate most of the radioactivity and heat in spent fuel because heat is the main limiting factor on repository capacity conven tional reprocessing would not provide major disposal benefits in the near term doe is addressing that problem with proposal to further separate the primary heatgenerating fission products cesium 137 and strontium 90 from high level waste for separate storage and decay over several hundred years that proposal would greatly increase repository capacity althoug h it would require an alternative secure storage system for the cesium and str ontium that has yet to be designed httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34579crs4 safety and efficiency are other areas in which improvements have long been envisioned over lwr technology the prima ry safety vulnerability of lwrs is lossofcoolant accident in which the water level in the reactor falls below the nuclear fuel when the water is lost the chain reaction stops because the neutrons are longer moderated but the heat of radioactive decay continues and will quickly melt the nuclear fuel as occurre d during the 1979 three mile island accident does generation iv program is focusing on high temperature gascooled reactors that would use fuel whose melting point w ould be higher than the maximum reactor temperature the high operating temperature of such reactors would also result in greater fuel efficiency and the potential for costeffective production of hydrogen which could be used as nonpolluting transportation fuel however the commercial viability of generation iv reactor s remains uncertain doe advanced nuclear programs does advanced nuclear technology progra ms date back to the early years of the atomic energy commission in the 1940s and 1950s in partic ular it was widely believed that breeder

were halted by president carter in 1977 because of the nuclear proliferation issues noted above upon taking office in 1981 president reag an reversed the carter policy and restarted preparations for crbr but c ongress eliminated further funding for the project in 1983 doe then turned to an alternative technology based on work carried out at experimental breeder reactor ii ebrii which used metal fuel that could be recycled through pyroprocessing melting and electrochemical separation rather than with the aqueous waterbased pure x process supporters of this program called the integral faster reactor ifr and the advanced liquid metal reactor almr contended that pyroprocessing would not produce pure plutonium product and could be carried out at sma ll scale at reactor sites reducing weapons proliferation risks the clinton administration however moved in 1993 to terminate does advanced reactor programs including shut down of ebrii congress agreed to the proposed phaseout but continued funding fo r pyroprocessing technology as way to treat ebrii spent fuel for eventual disposal current program the george w bush administration made energy policy high priority and placed particular emphasis on nuclear energy the national energy policy development nepd gr oup headed by vice president cheney recommended in may 2001 that nuclear power be expanded in the united states and that reprocessing once again become in tegral to the us nuclear program the nepd group recommends that in the context of developing advanced nuclear fuel cycles nd next generation technologies for nuclear energy the united states should reexamine its policies to allow for research development and deployment of fuel conditioning methods such as py roprocessing that reduce waste streams and enhance proliferation resistance in doing so the united states will continue to discourage the accumulation of separated plutonium worldwide the united states should also consider technologies in collaboration with international partners with highly developed fuel cycles and record of close c ooperation to develop reprocessing and fuel treatment technologies that are cleaner more efficient less wasteintensive and more proliferationresistant5 the bush administrations first major step toward implementing those recommendations was to announce the dvanced fuel cycle initiative in 2003 afci

feehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34579crs11 policy implications for congress and other federal policymaker s issues posed by current gnep and gen iv proposals are similar to those of th past several decades the fundamental policy question is whether the government should encourage the expansion of nuclear power the industry has long contended that new commercial reactors will not be constructed without increased government incentives or s ubsidies after the initial federal push to commercialize nuclear pow er in the 1950s nd 1960s g overnment support waned to the point where nuclear phaseout seemed possible but nuclear power proponents now contend th at dramatic growth will be needed with federal support to meet future energy dema nd in carbonconstrained environment such highgrowth scenarios must ove rcome many of the same perceived challenges that faced the optimistic initia l expectations for nuclear power if dramatic growth were to finally occur could light water reactors meet the challenge or is transition to advanced nuclear technologies necessary and if new technologies w ill be needed how urgently must the federal government move forward as in the early years of the nuclear power program primary concern with renewed nuclear power growth is longt erm fuel supply since lwrs can extract energy from only fraction of natural uranium during the past two decades of slowed us and world nuclear power expa nsion the only problem with uranium was oversupply and chronically low prices supply has since tightened but uranium production capacity is expanding rapidly in response whether increased exploration activity will result in higher worldwide resource estimates will have important implications for this issue the longproposed solution to the fuel problem replacing lwrs with fast breeder reactors raises the nuclear wea pons proliferation issue lwr spent fuel is highly resistant to proliferation at least for the first 100 years although the technology requires uranium enrichment facilities that may pose their own risks gneps goal of expanding nuclear power while limiting the proliferation of fuel cycle facilities is widely shared but the success of the programs current approach remains uncertain nuclear waste management has also been longstanding problem in the united states and the world the oncethrough lwr fuel cycle requires extremely long term isolation of plutonium and other long lived radionuclides reprocessing could potentially shorten the disposal horizon and make siting easier for waste repositories but if longterm isolation is determined to be feasible the waste disposal benefits of reprocessing may become less significant other anticipated benefits of advanced reactor technologies over lwrs include improved safety lower costs and hightem perature heat production for hydrogen and other industrial purposes lwr technol ogy has improved steadily in safety particularly in its vulnerab ility to lossofcoolant accidents and the projected risks of the latest designs have been reduced one to two orders of ma gnitude below that of existing reactors proposed generation iv designs are intended to virtually eliminatehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34579crs12 the major risk factors inherent in lwrs although they may have other safety risks that have yet to be as fully quantified new lwr designs are also intended to reduce costs from those incurred by existing reactors but cost estimates have r ecently escalated along with those of all competing power systems generation iv reactors are projected by their designers to reduce both construction nd operating costs but these projections have yet to be demonstrated lwrs are limited to relativ ely lowtemperature opera tion so hightemperature gas reactors could be the most practi cal technology for nuclear generation of hydrogen as transportation fuel if hydr ogen were to become major transportation fuel which remains far from certain nuclear power could begin to play significant role in replacing petroleum however more commercial attention has recently been focused on batterybased electric vehicle systems which could be recharged by lwrs recent us nuclear energy policy has focused primarily on large government incentives for privatesector construction of new lwrs such as loan guarantees tax credits and regulatory risk insurance imposition of federal controls on carbon dioxide emissions would provide add itional powerful incentives for lwr construction as shown by the industr studies described above the advanced nuclear technologies under development by gnep and gen iv will require many years of governmentsupported development before they reach the current stage of lwrs the bush administration has renewe d the federal research effort on these technologies so now the question before congress is whether the time has come to move to the next more expensive development stages
