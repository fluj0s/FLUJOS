the congress and legislative process government and finance division the legislative process on the house floor an introduction summary with very few exceptions the house determines and enforces its own procedures for considering legislation on the floor its standing rules include several alternative sets of procedures for acting on individual bills and resolutions the choices made among these procedures usually depend on how important and controversial each measure is in general though all these procedures permit majority of members to work their will without excessive delay the house passes many bills by motions to suspend the rules with limited debate and floor amendments with the support of at least twothirds of the members voting most major bills first are considered in committee of the whole before being passed by simple majority vote of the house the committee of the whole is governed by more flexible procedures than the basic rules of the house under which majority can vote to pass bill after only one hour of debate and with floor amendments the rules committee is instrumental in recommending procedures for considering major bills and may propose restrictions on the floor amendments that members can offer the daily order of business on the house floor is governed by standing rules that make certain matters and actions privileged for consideration and by house decisions to grant other individual bills privileged access to the floor usually upon recommendation of the rules committee although quorum is supposed to be present on the floor when the house is conducting business the house assumes quorum is present unless quorum call or electronically recorded vote demonstrates that it is not however the standing rules preclude quorum calls at most times other than when the house is voting questions are first decided by voice vote though any member then may demand division vote before the final result of voice or division vote is announced members can secure an electronicallyrecorded vote instead if enough members desire it or if quorum is not present in the house contents introduction 1 the nature of the rules 1 the

introduction complicated body of rules precedents and practices governs the legislative process on the floor of the house of representatives the official manual of house rules is more than thousand pages long and is supplemented by more than 25 volumes of precedents with more volumes to be published in coming years yet there are two reasons why gaining fundamental understanding of the houses legislative procedures is not as difficult as the sheer number and size of these documents might suggest1 first the ways in which the house applies its rules are largely predictable at least in comparison with the senate some rules certainly are more complex and more difficult to interpret than others but the house does tend to follow similar procedures under similar circumstances even the ways in which the house frequently waives supplants or supplements its regular rules with special temporary procedures generally fall into limited number of recognizable patterns second underlying most of the rules that representatives may invoke and the procedures the house may follow is fundamentally important premise that majority of members ultimately should be able to work their will on the floor while house rules generally do recognize the importance of permitting any minority partisan or bipartisan to present its views and sometimes to propose its alternatives the rules do not enable that minority to filibuster or use other devices to prevent the majority from prevailing without undue delay2 this principle provides an underlying coherence to the various specific procedures that are discussed briefly in this report the nature of the rules article i of the constitution imposes few restrictions on house and senate procedures for example requirements affecting quorums and roll call votes but otherwise the constitution authorizes each house of congress to determine for itself the rules of its proceedings article 1 section 5 1 this report was written by stanley bach former senior specialist in the legislative process at crs the listed author updated the report and can respond to inquiries on the subject 2 this premise is not characteristic of senate rules and procedures and this difference most clearly distinguishes between the general approaches that the two chambers traditionally have taken to the legislative process crs2 this grant of authority has several important implications first the house can amend its rules unilaterally it need not consult with either the senate or the president second the house is free to suspend waive or ignore its rules whenever it chooses to do so by and large the speaker or whatever representative is presiding usually does not enforce the rules at his or her own initiative instead members must protect their own rights and interests by making points of order whenever they believe that the rules are about to be violated in addition house rules include several formal procedures for waiving or suspending certain other rules and almost any rule can be waived by unanimous consent thus the requirements and restrictions discussed in this report generally apply only if the house chooses to enforce them the house and the committee of the whole actually much of the legislative process on the floor occurs not in the house but in committee of the house known as the committee of the whole formally the committee of the whole house on the state of the union every representative is member of the committee of the whole and it is in this committee meeting in the house chamber that most major bills usually are debated and amended before being passed or defeated by the house itself most bills first are referred to considered in and reported by standing committee of the house before coming to the floor in much the same way once bills do reach the floor many of them then are referred to second committee the committee of the whole for further debate and for the consideration of amendments the speaker presides over meetings of the house but not over meetings of the committee of the whole instead she appoints another member of the majority party to serve as the chair of the committee of the whole during the time the committee is considering particular bill or resolution in addition the rules that apply in committee of the whole are somewhat different from those that govern meetings of the house itself the major differences are discussed in the following sections of this report in general the combined effect of these differences is to make the procedures in committee of the whole especially the procedures for offering and debating amendments considerably more flexible than those of the house limitations on debate if for other reason than the size of its membership the house has found it necessary to limit the opportunities for each representative to participate in floor deliberations whenever member is recognized to speak on the floor there always is time limit on his or her right to debate the rules of the house never permit representative to hold the floor for more than one hour under some parliamentary circumstances there are more stringent limits with members being allowed to speak for more than 5 20 or 30 minutes furthermore house rules sometimes impose limit on how long the entire membership of the house may debate motion or measure many bills and crs3 resolutions for instance are considered under set of procedures called suspension of the rules discussed later in this report that limits all debate on measure to maximum of 40 minutes under other conditions when there is such time limit imposed by the rules the house and to some extent the committee of the whole as well can impose one by simple majority vote these debate limitations and debatelimiting devices generally prevent minority of the house from using opportunities for delay to thwart the will of the majority house rules also limit debate in other important respects first all debate on the floor must be germane to whatever legislative business the house is conducting representatives may speak on other subjects only in oneminute speeches made at the beginning of each days session special order speeches occurring after the house has completed its legislative business for the day and during morning hour debates that are scheduled on certain days of the week second all debate on the floor must be consistent with certain rules of courtesy and decorum for example member should not question or criticize the motives of colleague four modes of consideration there is one single set of procedures that the house always follows when it considers public bill or resolution on the floor instead there are four main modes of consideration or different sets of procedural rules that the house uses in some cases house rules require that certain kinds of bills be considered in certain ways by various means however the house chooses to use whichever mode of consideration is most appropriate for given bill which of these modes the house uses depends on such factors as the importance and potential cost of the bill and the amount of controversy over it among members the differences among these sets of procedures rest largely on the balance that each strikes between the opportunities for members to debate and propose amendments on the one hand and the ability of the house to act promptly on the other under suspension of the rules the house frequently resorts to set of procedures that enables it to act quickly on bills that enjoy overwhelming but not unanimous support although this set is called suspension of the rules clause 1 of rule xv provides for these procedures as an alternative to the other modes of consideration the essential components of suspension of the rules are 1 40minute limit on debate 2 prohibition against floor amendments and 3 twothirds vote of those present and voting for passage on every monday tuesday and wednesday and often during the closing days of session the speaker may if he chooses recognize members to move to suspend the rules and pass particular bill or take some other action such as agreeing to the senates amendments to house bill once such motion is made the motion and the bill itself together are debatable for maximum of 40 minutes half of the time is controlled by the representative making the motion often the chair of the committee with jurisdiction over the bill the other half usually is controlled by the ranking minority member of the committee or sometimes the subcommittee of crs4 jurisdiction especially when he or she opposes the motion the motion may propose to pass the bill with certain amendments but member may propose an amendment from the floor during the debate the two members who control the time yield parts of it to other members who wish to speak once the 40 minutes is either used or yielded back single vote occurs on suspending the rules and simultaneously passing the bill if twothirds of the members present vote aye the motion is agreed to and the bill is passed if the motion fails the house may debate the bill again at another time perhaps under another mode of consideration that permits floor amendments and more debate and that requires only simple majority vote for passage the house frequently considers several suspension motions on the same day which could result in series of electronically recorded votes taking place at 40 minute intervals if such votes are requested for the convenience of the house therefore clause 8 of rule xx permits the speaker to postpone electronic votes that members have demanded on motions to suspend the rules until later time on the same day or the following day when the votes do take place they are clustered occurring one after the other without intervening debate in the house under the hour rule one of the ironies of the legislative process on the house floor is that the house does relatively little business under the basic rules of the house instead most of the debate and votes on amendments to major bills occur in committee of the whole this is largely because of the rule that generally governs debate in the house itself the rule controlling debate during meetings of the house as opposed to meetings of the committee of the whole is clause 2 of rule xvii which states in part that member delegate or resident commissioner may not occupy more than one hour in debate on question in the house in theory this rule permits each representative to speak for as much as an hour on each bill on each amendment to each bill and on each of the countless debatable motions that members could offer thus there could be more than four hundred hours of debate on each such question situation that would make it virtually impossible for the house to function effectively in practice however this hour rule usually means that each measure considered in the house is debated by all members for more than total of only one hour before the house votes on passing it the reason for this dramatic difference between the rule in theory and the rule in practice lies in the consequences of motion to order what is called the previous question when bill or resolution is called up for consideration in the house and therefore under the hour rule the speaker recognizes the majority floor manager to control the first hour of debate the majority floor manager usually is the chair of the committee or subcommittee with jurisdiction over the measure and most often supports its passage without amendment this member will yield part of his or her time to other members and may allocate control of half of the hour to the minority floor manager usually the ranking minority member of the committee or crs5 subcommittee however the majority floor manager almost always yields to other representatives for purposes of debate only thus other member may propose an amendment or make any motion during that hour during the first hour of debate or at its conclusion the majority floor manager invariably moves the previous question this nondebatable motion asks the house if it is ready to vote on passing the bill if majority votes for the motion more debate on the bill is in order nor can any amendments to it be offered after disposing of the motion the house usually votes immediately on whether to pass the bill only if the house votes not to order the previous question can debate on the bill continue into second hour during which the bill may be amended thus members who want to amend the measure first must convince the house to vote against ordering the previous question if they are successful then the member controlling the second hour of debate may propose an amendment however it is very unusual for the house not to vote for the previous question so the house disposes of most measures considered in the house under the hour rule after more than one hour of debate and with opportunity for amendment from the floor these are not very flexible and accommodating procedural ground rules for the house to follow in considering most legislation debate on bill usually is limited to one hour and only one or two members control this time before an amendment to the bill can even be considered the house first must vote against motion to order the previous question for these reasons most major bills are not considered in the house under the hour rule instead they are considered under third and more complicated mode of consideration set of procedures involving the committee of the whole in committee of the whole and the house clause 3 of rule xviii requires that most bills affecting federal taxes and spending be considered in committee of the whole before the house votes on passing them most other major bills also are considered in this way most commonly the house adopts resolution reported by the rules committee that authorizes the speaker to declare the house resolved into committee of the whole to consider particular bill general debate there are two distinct stages to consideration in committee of the whole first there is period for general debate which routinely is limited to an hour3 each of the floor managers usually controls half the time yielding parts of it to other members who want to participate in the debate during general debate the two floor managers and other members discuss the bill the conditions prompting the committee to recommend it and the merits of its provisions members may describe and explain the reasons for the amendments that they intend to offer but amendments can actually be proposed at this time during or after general debate 3 the length of general debate on bill is determined either by unanimous consent or by adoption of procedural resolution reported by the committee on rules that typically affects various aspects of the procedures for considering that bill these resolutions are discussed in the section of this report on the rules committee and special rules crs6 the majority floor manager may move that the committee rise in other words that the committee transform itself back into the house when the house agrees to this motion it may resolve into committee of the whole again at another time to resume consideration of the bill alternatively the committee of the whole may proceed immediately from general debate to the next stage of consideration the amending process amending process the committee of the whole usually considers bill for amendment section by section or in the case of appropriations measures paragraph by paragraph amendments to each section or of the bill are in order after the part they would amend has been read or designated and before the next section is read or designated alternatively the bill may be open to amendment at any point usually by unanimous consent the first amendments considered to each part of the bill are those if any recommended by the committee that reported it thereafter members of the committee usually are recognized before other representatives to offer their own amendments all amendments must be germane to the text they would amend germaneness is subject matter standard more stringent than one of relevancy and reflects complex set of criteria that have developed by precedent over the years the committee of the whole only votes on amendments it does not vote directly on the bill as whole and like the standing committees of the house the committee of the whole does not actually amend the bill it only votes to recommend amendments to the house the motion to order the previous question may not be made in committee of the whole so members usually may offer whatever germane amendments they wish unless prevented from doing so by the terms of special rule after voting on the last amendment to the last portion of the bill the committee rises and reports the bill back to the house with whatever amendments it has agreed to an amendment to bill is firstdegree amendment after such an amendment is offered but before the committee votes on it another member usually may offer perfecting amendment to make some change in the first degree amendment perfecting amendment to firstdegree amendment is seconddegree amendment after debate the committee first votes on the seconddegree perfecting amendment and then on the firstdegree amendment as it may have been amended clause 6 of rule xvi also provides that member may offer substitute for the firstdegree amendment before or after perfecting amendment is offered and this substitute may also be amended although full discussion of these possibilities is beyond the scope of this report it is important to note that the amending process can become complicated with members proposing several competing policy choices before the committee of the whole votes on any of them debate on amendments in committee of the whole is governed by the five minute rule not the hour rule that governs debate in the house the member offering each amendment or the majority floor manager in the case of committee amendment first is recognized to speak for five minutes then member opposed to the amendment may claim five minutes for debate other members also may speak for five minutes each by offering motion to strike the last word technically this motion is an amendment that proposes to strike out the last word of crs7 the amendment being debated but it is pro forma amendment that is offered merely to secure time for debate and so is not voted on when the five minutes expire in this way each representative may speak for five minutes on each amendment however majority of the members can vote or agree by unanimous consent to end the debate on an amendment immediately or at some specified time final passage when the committee finally rises and reports the bill back to the house the house proceeds to vote on the amendments the committee has adopted it usually approves all these amendments by one voice vote though members can demand separate votes on any or all of them as matter of right after formal and routine stage called third reading and engrossment when only the title of the bill is read there is then an opportunity for member virtually always from the minority party to offer motion to recommit the bill to committee if the house agrees to simple or straight motion to recommit which only proposes to return the bill to committee the bill is taken from the floor and returned to committee while in theory the committee might rereport the bill in practice the adoption of straight motion to recommit is often characterized as effectively killing the bill alternately motions to recommit frequently include instructions that the committee report the bill back to the house with an amendment that is stated in the motion such motions to recommit with amendatory instructions could direct the committee to report the measure back forthwith if the house agrees to such motion it then immediately votes on the amendment itself so motion to recommit with instructions of this type is really final opportunity to amend the bill before the house votes on whether to pass it on the other hand the adoption of motion to recommit with instructions that direct committee to report measure back to the house promptly or take any action other than to report back forthwith such as to hold additional hearings results in the measure being taken from the house floor before final passage and like straight motion to recommit is often characterized as killing the bill thus this complicated mode of consideration which the house uses to consider most major bills begins in the house with decision to resolve into committee of the whole to consider particular bill general debate and the amending process take place in committee of the whole but ultimately it is the house that formally amends and then passes or rejects the bill in the house as in committee of the whole fourth mode of consideration which the house does not use very often is hybrid form that combines features of the procedures that apply in the house under the hour rule and those that apply in the committee of the whole this set of procedures known as the house meeting as in committee of the whole has evolved by precedent and house rules explicitly define its elements it may be used to consider private bills and it was used routinely although only by unanimous consent to consider bills reported by the committee on the district of columbia before the house abolished that committee in 1995 measure considered in this way is debated under the fiveminute rule the hour rule does not apply nor is there period for general debate the majority floor crs8 manager secures time to make his opening statement on the bill by moving to strike the last word that is the last word of the bill all other members who want their own time to speak use the same device the bill is open to amendment at any point it is not read for amendment as are bills being amended under the fiveminute rule in committee of the whole but like procedures in the house under the hour rule the majority floor manager may move the previous question on an individual amendment or on the bill and all amendments to it votes on amendments are final because they occur in the house itself after acting on the last amendment and ordering the bill engrossed and read the third time by title only the house votes on final passage the calendars and the order of business when house committee reports public bill or resolution that had been referred to it the measure is placed on the house calendar or the union calendar in general tax authorization and appropriations bills are placed on the union calendar all others go to the house calendar in effect the calendars are catalogues of measures that have been approved with or without proposed amendments by one or more house committees and now are available for consideration on the floor4 because it would be impractical or undesirable for the house to take up measures in the chronological order in which they are reported and placed on one of the calendars there must be some procedures for deciding the order in which measures are to be brought from the calendars to the house floor in other words procedures for determining the order of business clause 1 of rule xiv lists the daily order of business on the floor beginning with the opening prayer the approval of the journal which is the official record of house proceedings required by the constitution and the pledge of allegiance apart from these routine matters however the house never follows the order of business laid out in this rule instead certain measures and actions are privileged meaning that they may interrupt the regular order of business in practice all the legislative business that the house conducts comes to the floor by interrupting the order of business under rule xiv either by unanimous consent or under the provisions of another house rule every bill and resolution that cannot be considered by unanimous consent must become privileged business if it is going to reach the floor at all measures considered under some of the modes of consideration discussed above are privileged on certain days for example on any monday tuesday or wednesday the speaker can recognize members to move to suspend the rules and pass bills as has been noted suspension motions are privileged on those days and so the bills they involve may be considered private bills are privileged for consideration on the first and third tuesdays of each month under clause 5 of rule xv clause 4 of the same rule makes bills relating to the district of columbia if 4 committees also may report measures unfavorably or without recommendation but they rarely do so instead committees usually do not report the bills and resolutions they do not approve crs9 reported by the committee on oversight and government reform in order on the second and fourth mondays in addition clause 5a of rule xiii grants certain committees the right to report certain kinds of measures at any time meaning that those measures may be called up on the floor as privileged business whenever another matter is not already pending these privileged measures include general appropriations bills from the appropriations committee budget resolutions and reconciliation bills from the budget committee resolutions to fund house committees from the committee on house administration and measures changing house rules from the rules committee however most major bills do not fall into one of these categories nor do they usually enjoy enough support to pass under suspension of the rules another approach is necessary for them to become privileged for floor action this approach is based on the rules committees jurisdiction over measures affecting the order of business on the floor the rules committee and special rules clause 1m of rule x authorizes the rules committee to report resolutions affecting the order of business such resolution which is called rule or special rule usually proposes to make bill in order for floor consideration so that it can be debated amended and passed or defeated by simple majority vote in effect each special rule recommends to the house that it take from the union or house calendar measure that is not otherwise privileged business and bring it to the floor out of its order on that calendar typically such resolution begins by providing that at any time after its adoption the speaker may declare the house resolved into the committee of the whole for the consideration of that bill because the special rule itself is privileged under clause 5a of rule xiii the house can debate and vote on it promptly if the house accepts the rules committees recommendation it proceeds to consider the bill itself one fundamental purpose of most special rules therefore is to make another measure privileged so that it may interrupt the regular order of business their other fundamental purpose is to set special procedural ground rules for considering that measure these ground rules may either supplement or supplant the standing rules of the house for example the special rule typically sets the length of time for general debate in committee of the whole and specifies which members are to control that time in addition the special rule normally includes provisions that expedite final house action on the bill after the amending process in committee of the whole has been completed special rules also may waive points of order that members otherwise could make against consideration of the bill against one of its provisions or against an amendment to be offered to it the most controversial provisions of special rules affect the amendments that members can offer to the bill that the resolution makes in order an open rule permits representatives to propose any amendment that meets the normal requirements of house rules and precedents for example the requirement that each amendment must be germane at the other extreme closed rule prohibits crs10 all amendments except perhaps for committee amendments and pro forma amendments to strike the last word offered only for purposes of debate the rules committee also has proposed variety of restrictive special rules most often called structured or modified open rules that either permit only certain amendments or require members to preprint their amendments in the congressional record before they can be considered on the floor these provisions are very important because they can prevent representatives from offering amendments as alternatives to provisions of the bill thereby limiting the policy choices that the house can make however like other committees the rules committee only makes recommendations to the house members debate each of its procedural resolutions in the house under the hour rule and then vote to adopt or reject it if the house votes against ordering the previous question on special rule member may offer an amendment to it proposing to change the conditions under which the bill itself is to be considered because the adoption of special rule is often viewed as party loyalty vote however such development is exceedingly rare all the same it is important to remember that while the rules committee is instrumental in helping the house formulate its order of business and in setting appropriate ground rules for considering each bill the house retains ultimate control over what it does when and how senate amendments and conference reports before any bill can become law both the house and the senate must pass it and the two houses must agree on each and every one of its provisions this basic constitutional requirement means that the house must have procedures to respond when the house and senate pass different versions of the same bill for example the house may pass senate bill with house amendments or the senate may pass house bill with senate amendments and then send its amendments to the house in either case the two houses must resolve their differences over these amendments before the legislative process is completed there are essentially two ways to approach this stage of the process either 1 by dealing with the amendments individually through process of exchanging amendments between the chambers with the bill being sent back and forth between the house and senate or 2 by dealing with the amendments collectively through conference committee of representatives and senators who negotiate series of compromises and concessions that are compiled in conference report that the two houses can vote to accept because the process of resolving differences between the houses can be quite complicated only some of its basic elements are summarized here the house normally considers senate amendments to house bill by unanimous consent or by suspension of the rules the house may accept the amendments concur in them or amend them concur in them with house amendments alternatively the committee with jurisdiction over the bill may authorize its chair to move that the house disagree to the senates amendments and send them to conference committee when the house amends and passes senate crs11 bill it may request conference with the senate immediately or it may simply send its amendments to the senate in the hope that the senate will accept them if the senate refuses to do so it may request conference with the house instead on the other hand if the house and senate can reach agreement by proposing amendments to each others positions the bill can be sent to the president for his signature or veto without the need to create conference committee if the house and senate agree to send their versions of the bill to conference committee the speaker appoints the house conferees these conferees usually are drawn from the standing committee or committees with jurisdiction over the bill although the speaker may appoint some other representatives as well when the house and senate conferees meet they are to deal only with provisions of the bill on which the two houses disagree they should not insert new provisions or change provisions that both houses already have approved furthermore as the conferees resolve each provision or amendment in disagreement they should accept the house position the senate position or compromise between them like almost all other house rules the rules limiting the authority of conferees are enforced only if members make points of order at the appropriate time the house also may adopt special rule reported by the rules committee waiving points of order against conference report to complete their work successfully majority of the house conferees and majority of the senate conferees must sign report that recommends all the agreements they have reached5 the conferees also sign joint explanatory statement that describes the original house and senate positions and the conferees recommendations and which is the functional equivalent of committee report after representatives have had three days to examine conference report it is privileged for floor consideration it may be called up at any time that the house is not already considering something else the report may be debated in the house under the hour rule so the vote almost always occurs after more than one hour of debate amendments to the report are in order in practice however the house almost always considers conference reports under the terms of special rule which waives points of order against the report and its consideration the conference report is proposed package settlement of number of disagreements so the house and senate may accept it or reject it but they may not change it6 if the two houses agree to the report by simple majority vote all their 5 there are other procedures for the conferees to follow if they cannot reach full agreement or if they want to propose something that is not within the scope of the differences between the original house and senate positions 6 however the first house to consider conference report also has the option of recommitting it to the conference committee in the hope that the conferees can reach different and more acceptable agreement house rules also include provisions for voting separately on conference report provisions originating in the senate that would not have been germane if offered as house floor amendments to the bill but these are often dealt with instead by waiver in special rule crs12 differences have been resolved and the bill is then enrolled or reprinted for formal presentation to the president in rare instances conferees cannot reach agreement on one or more of the amendments in conference or they may reach an agreement that they cannot include in their conference report because their proposal exceeds the scope of the differences between the house and senate positions and thus violates the rules governing the content of conference reports in either case the conferees may report back to the two houses with an amendment or amendments in disagreement after acting on the conference report dealing collectively with all the other amendments that were sent to conference the house acts on each of the amendments in disagreement by considering motions such as motion to accept the senates amendment or motion to amend it with new house amendment the senate takes similar action until the disagreements on these amendments are resolved or until the two houses agree to create new conference committee only to address the remaining amendments that are still in disagreement the bill cannot become law until the two houses resolve all the differences between their positions voting and quorum procedures whenever representatives vote on the floor there first is voice vote in which the members in favor of the bill amendment or motion vote aye in unison followed by those voting before the speaker or the chair of the committee of the whole announces the result any representative can demand division vote in which the members in favor stand up to be counted again followed by those opposed but before the result of either voice vote or division vote is announced member may try to require another vote in which everyones position is recorded publicly this vote is taken by using the houses electronic voting system in committee of the whole an electronic vote is ordered when 25 members request it in the house such vote occurs when demanded by at least onefifth of the members present alternatively any member can demand an electronically recorded vote in the house if quorum of the membership is not present on the floor when the voice or division vote takes place the constitution requires that quorum must be present on the floor when the house is conducting business in the house quorum is majority of the representatives in committee of the whole it is only 100 members however the house traditionally has assumed that quorum is always present unless member makes point of order that it is not the rules restrict when members can make such points of order and they occur most often when the house or the committee of the whole is voting in the house for example representative can object to voice or division vote on the grounds that quorum is not present and make that point of order if quorum is not present the speaker automatically orders an electronically recorded vote during which members record their presence on the floor by casting their votes the issue is decided and quorum is established at the same time voice or division vote is valid even if less than quorum participates in the vote so crs13 long as one makes point of order that quorum is not present for this reason members can continue to meet in their committees or fulfill their other responsibilities off the floor when the house is doing business that does not involve publicly recorded votes the daily order of business after the opening prayer on each day the speaker announces his approval of the journal of the previous days proceedings member may require recorded vote on agreeing to the speakers approval of the journal not because of any question about the accuracy of the journal but to determine which representatives may not be in the capitol or the house office buildings that day following the pledge of allegiance some members then ask unanimous consent to address the house for one minute each on whatever subjects they wish including subjects unrelated to the scheduled legislative business of the day generally speaking to the extent possible the majority party leaders and the committee chairmen arrange the legislative schedule for each week in advance during the last floor session of the week the majority leader normally announces the expected schedule for the coming week in wrapup colloquy with minority party leader changes in the schedule may be announced as they are made to be considered bill or resolution must enjoy the privilege to interrupt the regular order of business various kinds of legislative business are privileged however so the speaker enjoys considerable discretion in deciding the order in which privileged matters should be considered and therefore the order in which she recognizes members to call them up on the floor on the other hand the speakers discretion is limited by rules such as the ones that set aside specific days for considering certain kinds of business such as bills concerning the district of columbia as each item of business is completed the speaker anticipates which member should be seeking recognition to call up the next bill or resolution if another representative requests to be recognized instead the speaker may ask for what purpose does the gentleman rise and she may decline to recognize that member if he wants the house to consider another privileged bill motion or conference report if bill is to be considered in committee of the whole the majority party leaders and the committee chair may decide in advance whether the committee should only complete general debate on that day or whether to proceed with the amending process as well the ability to set the houses floor schedule is one of the primary powers and responsibilities of the majority party leaders though they often consult with the minority party leaders on rare occasion however majority of the members have voted against special rule and therefore against considering bill even when the speaker and his leadership colleagues wish the house to debate and pass it at the end of legislative business on most days some members address the house for as much as an hour each on subjects of their choice these special order speeches are arranged in advance by unanimous consent and organized by the parties in this way representatives can comment at length on current national and crs14 international issues and discuss bills that have not yet reached the house floor the house often adjourns by late afternoon although it may remain in session throughout the evening when an emergency arises or when the end of the annual session or some other deadline approaches sources of additional information the house rules for each congress are published in volume often called the house manual but officially entitled constitution jeffersons manual and rules of the house of representatives new edition of this collection is published each congress the precedents of the house established through 1935 have been compiled in the 11volume set of hinds and cannons precedents of the house of representatives more
