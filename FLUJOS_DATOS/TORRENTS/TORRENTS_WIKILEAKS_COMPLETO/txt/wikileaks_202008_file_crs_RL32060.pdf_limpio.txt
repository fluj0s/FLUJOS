wto doha development round of multilateral trade negotiations the negotiations which were launched at the 4th wto ministerial in 2001 at doha qatar have been characterized by persistent differences between the united states the european union and developing countries on major issues such as agriculture industrial tariffs and nontariff barriers services and trade remedies depending on the outcome some us industries may gain access to foreign markets and others may see increased competition from imports likewise some us wo rkers may be helped through increased access to foreign markets but others may be hurt by import competition the negotiating impasse put negotiators beyond the reach of agreement under us trade promotion authority tpa which expired on july 1 2007 with the deadline passed the parties are now attempting to make progress in the negotiations in the hope that the 110 th congress will extend tpa during the second half of 2007 the chairmen of the agriculture industrial and rules negotiating groups released new draft texts and revisions to those texts have been made in the course of 2008 yet trade ministers again failed to reach breakthrough at an eight day negotiating ministerial held in geneva in july 2008 agriculture has become the linchpin of the doha development agenda us goals are substantial reduction of tradedistorting domestic support elimination of export subsidies and improved market access some had looked to potential doha round agreement to curb tradedistorting domestic support as catalyst to change us farm subsidies in the 2007 farm bill but this source of pressure for change dissipated with the continued doha impasse in addition members of congress likely will carefully scrutinize any agreement that may require changes to us trade remedy laws three issues are among the most important to developing countries in addition to concessions on agriculture one issue now resolved pertained to compulsory licensing of medicines and patent protection second deals with review of provisions giving special and differential treatment to developing countries third addresses problems that developing countries are having

wto is the principal international organization governing world trade it has 152 member countries representing over 95 of world trade it was established in 1995 as successor institution to the general agreement on tariffs and trade ga tt the gatt was postworld war ii institution intended to promote nondiscrimination in trade among countries with the view that open trade was crucial for economic stability and peace decisions within the wto are made by member countries not wto staff1 and they are made by consensus not formal vote highlevel policy decisions are made by the ministerial conference which is the body of political representatives trade ministers from each member country the ministerial conference must meet at least every two years operational decisions are made by the general council which consists of representative from each member country the general council meets monthly and the chair rotates annually among national representatives the united states was an original signatory to the gatt and leading proponent of the ga tts tradeliberalizing principles it continues to be among the countries urging further discussions on opening markets to trade although decisions in the wto are made by consensus the united states has highly influential role shaping decisions in the institution befitting its status as the largest trading nation in the world periodically member countries agree to hold negotiations to revise existing rules or establish new ones these periodic negotiations are commonly called rounds the broader the negotiations the greater the possible tradeoffs and thus theoretically the greater the potential economic benefits to countries the multilateral negotiations are especially important to developing countries which might otherwise be left out of more selective agreements it must be remembered however that trade liberalization also results in job losses and other economic dislocations as well

that mee ting they agreed to undertake new round of multilateral trade negotiations2 before the doha ministerial negotiations had already been underway on trade in agriculture and trade in services these ongoing negotiations had been required under the last round of multilateral trade negotiations the uruguay round 19861994 however some countries including the united states wanted to expand the agriculture and services talks to allow trade offs and thus achieve greater trade liberalization 1 the wto staff is based in geneva and numbers about 625 with budget of approximately 152 million in 2007 the organization is headed by directorgeneral currently pascal lamy of france 2 for information on the results of the doha ministerial conference see crs report rl31206 the wto doha ministerial

the doha ministerial the united states had been attacked by terrorists on september 11 2001 some government officials called for greater political cohesion and saw the trade negotiations as means toward that end some officials thought that new round of multilateral trade negotiations could help world economy weakened by recession and terrorismrelated uncertainty according to the wto the year 2001 showed the lowest growth in output in more than two decades and world trade actually contracted that year3 in addition countries increasingly have been seeking bilateral or regional trade agreements as of november 1 2007 385 regional trade agreements have been notified to the ga ttwto 197 of which are currently in force4 there is disagreement on whether these more limited trade agreements help or hurt the multilateral system some experts say that regional agreements are easier to negotiate allow greater degree of liberalization and thus are effective in opening markets others however argue that the regional agreements violate the general nondiscrimination principle of the wto which allows some exceptions deny benefits to many poor countries that are often not party to the arrangements and distract resources away from the wto negotiations 5 with the backdrop of sagging world economy terrorist action and growing number of regional trade arrangements trade ministers met in doha at that meeting they adopted three documents that provided guidance for future actions the ministerial declaration includes preamble and work program for the new round and for other future action this declaration folded the ongoing negotiations in agriculture and services into broader agenda that agenda includes industrial tariffs topics of interest to developing countries changes to wto rules and other provisions the declaration on the trips agreement and public health presents political interpretation of the wto agreement on traderelated intellectual property rights trips 6 document on implementationrelated issues and concerns includes numerous decisions of interest to developing countries7 especially worth noting is how the role of developing countries changed at the doha ministerial since the beginning of the gatt the major deci sionmakers were almost exclusively developed countries at the preceding ministerial conference seattle 1999 developing countries became more forceful in demanding that their interests be addressed some developing countries insisted that they would not support another round of multilateral negotiations unless they realized some concessions upfront and the agenda included their interests because of the greater influence of developing countries in setting the plan of action at doha the new round became known as the doha

be held in 2003 would take stock of progress provide any necessary political guidance and take decisions as necessary and that negotiations would be concluded not later than january 1 2005 with the exception of actions on the dispute settlement understanding trade ministers agreed that the outcome of the negotiations would be single undertaking which means that nothing is finally agreed until everything is agreed thus countries agreed they would reach single comprehensive agreement containing balance of concessions at the end of the negotiations

negotiations have proceeded at slow pace and have been characterized by lack of progress on significant issues and persistent disagreement on nearly every aspect of the agenda few issues have been resolved notably in agriculture however the first order of business for the round the negotiation of modalities or the methods and formulas by which negotiations are conducted still remain elusive four years after the beginning of the round g22g145g142g561g5g138g151g140g158g151g561g15g146g151g146g156g157g142g155g146g138g149g561 an important milepost in the doha development agenda round was the 5th ministerial conference which was held in cancún mexico on september 1014 2003 the cancún ministerial ended without agreement on framework to guide future negotiations and this failure to advance the round resulted in serious loss of momentum and brought into question whether the january 1 2005 deadline would be met 8 the cancun ministerial collapsed for several reasons first differences over the singapore issues seemed irresolvable the eu had retreated on some of its demands but several developing countries refused any consideration of these issues at all second it was questioned whether some countries had come to cancun with serious intention to negotiate in the view of some observers few countries showed flexibility in their positions and only repeated their demands rather than talk about tradeoffs third the wide difference between developing and developed countries across virtually all topics was major obstacle the useu agricultural proposal and that of the group of 21 for example show strikingly different approaches to special and differential treatment fourth there was so criticism of procedure some claimed the agenda was too complicated also cancun ministerial chairman mexicos foreign minister luis ernesto derbez was faulted for ending the meeting when he did instead of trying to move the talks into areas where some progress could have been made at the end of their meeting in cancun trade ministers issued declaration instructing their officials to continue working on outstanding issues they asked the general council chair working with the directorgeneral to convene m eeting of the general council at senior official level later than december 15 2003 to take the action necessary at that stage to enable us to move towards successful and timely conclusion of the negotiations 8 for more detailed information on the cancún ministerial see crs report rs21664 the wto cancun ministerial by ian f fergusson and general accounting office

derbez text ministerial chairman derbez invited trade ministers to act as facilitators in cancun and help with negotiations in five groups agriculture nonagricultural market access development issues singapore issues and other issues the wto directorgeneral served as facilitator for sixth group on cotton the facilitators consulted with trade ministers and produced draft texts from their group consultations the ministerial chairman compiled the texts into draft ministerial declaration9 and circulated the revised draft among participants for comment the derbez text was widely criticized at cancun and it was not adopted but in the months following that meeting members looked increasingly at this text as possible negotiating framework on agriculture the derbez text drew largely on both the useu and group of 21 proposals it included larger cut from domestic support programs than the useu proposal made contained the blended tariff approach of the useu proposal but offered better terms for developing countries and provided for the elimination of export subsidies for products of particular interest to developing countries on the singapore issues it included decision to start new negotiations on government procurement and trade facilitation but not investment or competition g22g145g142g561g25g22g17g561g8g155g138g150g142g160g152g155g148g561g3g144g155g142g142g150g142g151g157g561 the aftermath of cancun was one of standstill and stocktaking negotiations were suspended for the remainder of 2003 however in early 2004 thenus trade representative ustr robert zoellick offered proposals on how to move the round forward10 the ustr called for focus on market access including an elimination of agricultural export subsidies he also said that the singapore issues could progress by negotiating on trade facilitation considering further action on government procurement and possibly dropping investment and competition this intervention was credited at the time with reviving interest in the negotiations and negotiations resumed in march 2004 on july 31 2004 wto members approved framework agreement that includes major developments in the most contentious and crucial issueagriculture 11 because of the importance of agriculture to the round the framework which provides guidelines but not specific concessions was regarded as major achievement with broad agreement on agriculture and on other issues negotiators were given clearer direction for future discussions however the talks settled back into driftless stalemate where few but the most technical issues were

the negotiations and would try to reach agreements in negotiating sectors where convergence was reported the final ministerial declaration of december 18 2005 reflected areas of agreement in agriculture industrial tariffs and dutyfree and tarifffree access for least developed countries see sectoral negotiations section below for details generally these convergences reflect step beyond the july framework agreement but fall short of full negotiating modalities12 deadlines were established at hong kong for concluding negotiations by the end of 2006 these deadlines included an april 30 2005 date to establish modalities for the agriculture and nama negotiations further deadlines set for july 31 2006 include the submission of tariff schedules for agriculture and nama the submission of

2006 wto directorgeneral pascal lamy announced there was consensus for agreement on modalities by the april 30 deadline trade negotiators likewise failed to reach agreement at highlevel meeting in geneva on june 30july 1 2006 it was agreed at those meetings however that directorgeneral pascal lamy would undertake more proactive role as catalyst to conduct intensive and wideranging consultations to achieve agricultural and industrial modalities 13 prior to the summit lamy for the first time in his tenure suggested the outline of possible compromise known as the 2020 20 proposal the offer 1 called on the united states to accept ceiling on domestic farm subsidies under 20 billion 2 proposed the negotiations use the g20 proposal of 54 as the minimum average cut to developed country agricultural tariffs and 3 set tariff ceiling of 20 for developing country industrial tariffs this suggestion was roundly criticized by all sides and was not adopted at the geneva meetings 14 at the

deadlock on agricultural tariffs and subsidies the eu blamed the united states for not improving on its offer of domestic support while the united states responded that new offers on market access

the criticism these texts received from nearly all quarters they have served to continue the engagement of the various parties in geneva at time when many have predicted the demise of the round

may have been raised had the negotiations continued17 if negotiators are not able to achieve breakthrough there may be several consequences for multilateral trade liberalization first the negotiation of bilateral and regional free trade agreements may accelerate in the wake of the 2006 suspension the united states the eu brazil and india all announced plans to concentrate on additional bilateral liberalization second consequence may be the increased use of the wtos dispute settlement function if political solution to disagreements among member s cannot be agreed through negotiations some practices like agricultural subsidies may be challenged in dispute settlement an increased reliance on dispute settlement may in turn put stress on the wto as an institution if the decisions rendered are not implemented or are not perceived as being fairly decided further consequence may be the loss of agreements already made at the negotiations 16 doha close but not enough bridges weekly trade

more efficient exchange of products among countries and encourages economic growth multilateral negotiations offer the greatest potential benefits by obliging countries throughout the world to reduce barriers to trade the gains to the united states and to the world from multilateral trade agreements have been calculated in the billions of dollars for example recent study by the international trade commission found that if the tariff cuts from the uruguay round were removed the welfare loss to the united states would be about 20 billion 18 study by the university of michigan found that if all trade barriers in agriculture services and manufactures were reduced by 33 as result of the doha development agenda there would be an increase in global welfare of 5740 billion19 other studies present more modest outcome predicting world net welfare gains ranging from 84 billion to 287 billion by the year 201520 multilateral negotiations are especially important to developing countries that might otherwise be left out of regional or bilateral trade agreement developing country blocs can improve trade and economic growth among its members but the larger share of benefits are from the trade agreements that open the markets of the world multilateral trade negotiations are also an exercise in international cooperation and encourage economic interdependence which offers political benefits as well when country opens its markets however increased imports might cause economic dislocations at the local or regional level communities might lose factories workers might lose 18 us

toward the longterm objective of substantial progressive reductions in support and protection by early 2001 wto members had achieved some preliminary work in those sectoral negotiations and later that year agriculture was wrapped into the broader doha agenda agriculture has become the linchpin in the doha development agenda 22 us goals in the new round were elimination of agricultural export subsidies easing of tariffs and quotas and reductions in tradedistorting domestic support the doha ministerial declaration included language on all of these three pillars of agricultural support it stated that the members committed to comprehensive negotiations aimed at substantial improvements in market access reductions of with view to phasing out all forms of export subsidies and substantial reductions in trade distorting support the course of the negotiations in the lead up to ca ncun were influenced by the reform of the eus common agricultural policy cap major issue for the eu was whether or not to approve separation decoupling of payments to farmers based on production those types of payments are among the most tradedistorting amber box on june 26 2003 eu agriculture ministers

agricultural reformdomestic supportbut did little in second pillarmarket access in the wto negotiations on market access the united states and the cairns group have supported leveling or harmonizing of tariff peaks or high rates in comparison the eu and japan want flexibility to cut some items less than others to arrive at an average total rate cut another difficulty is geographical indications or the protection of product names that reflect the original location of the product an example is the use of bordeaux wine for wines from the bordeaux region only europeans joined by india and some other countries want mandatory registry of geographical indications that would prevent other countries from using the names the united states and other countries refuse to negotiate mandatory list but will accept voluntary list with enforcement power while the eu has said that it will not accept an agriculture agreement without geographical registry it reportedly has lowered expectations to achieving registry for wines and spirits 24 developing countries view reform in agricultural trade as one of their most important goals they argue that their own producers cannot compete against the surplus agricultural goods that the developed countries principally the eu and the united states are selling on the world market at low subsidized prices some african countries also are calling for an end to cotton subsidies claiming that such subsidies are destroying markets for the smaller african producers the july 2004 framework agreement provided basis for which to continue the agriculture talks on domestic support subsidies are to be reduced by means of tiered or banded approach applied to achieve harmonization in the levels of support subsidizing countries will make downpayment of 20 reduction in levels of support in the first year of the agreement tariff reduction will utilize tiered formula with harmonization component but with some exceptions for import sensitive products the european union finally agreed to the elimination of export subsidies considered major negotiating goal of the united states while there was breakthrough at the december 2005 hong kong ministerial members agreed to eliminate export subsidies and export measures with equivalent effect by 2013 date favored by the european union eu members agreed to cut domestic support programs with three band methodology as the largest user of domestic agricultural subsidies the eu was placed in the highest band the united states and japan were placed in the second band and lesser subsidizing countries were placed in the third band however the actual percentage cuts that these bands represent remain subject to negotiation members also renewed commitment to achieve tariff cutting formula by april 30 2006 this deadline was not met in the parallel negotiations on cotton members agreed to eliminate export subsidies for cotton and to provide dutyfree and quotafree access for ldc cotton producers by yearend 2006 members also agreed to reduce domestic support for cotton in more ambitious manner than for other agricultural commodities as an objective in the ongoing agricultural negotiations talks to reach modalities proved unsuccessful at the july 23 2006 meeting of the g6 countries in geneva and the negotiations were suspended thereafter sources of the stalemate in the geneva talks included

allow countries to exempt certain products from the banded tariff formula the united states contends that the scope envisioned by some countries for these modalities would unacceptably diminish the overall market access gains from the agreement25 conversely the united states was under pressure at the meeting from the eu and the g20 group represented by brazil and india to improve its subsidy reduction offer but the united states put new offer on the table the united states insisted that it will not improve its offer on domestic subsidy reduction unless the eu improves considerably its market access offer and the g20 countries show willingness to open their markets not only to agricultural products but to industrial products and services as well these dynamics continued in 2007

negotiations in geneva revisions to this draft were made in february may and july 2008 the latter of which became the basis for negotiations at the wto summit in july 2129 2008 some of the headline

billion 381 billion the falconer draft would cut us and japanese subsidies by equal percentages resulting in final cap on japans overall tradedistorting support otds of 123156 billion the united states publicly offered to cap otds at 145 billion on july 25 2008 during the negotiating summit conditional on accepting the lamy compromise package then on the table while actual us expenditures likely have declined in the past few years due to higher commodity prices this has not been reflected in the us negotiating position the eu has set 70 reduction as its upper bound the g20 group of

tariffs currently above 75 27 64 cut for tariffs currently between 50 and 75 57 cut for tariffs currently between 20 and 50 and 50 cut for tariffs between 0 and 20 in addition the draft stipulates minimum tariff cuts of 54 for developed countries after application of the formula and other exceptions developing countries would be able to cut 23 of the amount of cuts agreed by developed countries from bands with higher thresholds in equal instalments over eight years while developed countries would have to cut 70 from tariffs currently above 75 their highest tariff band developing countries would have to cut 436 or 482 on all tariffs above 130 427 on tariffs between 80 and 130 38 for tariffs between 30 and 80 and 333 on tariffs between 0 and 30 the draft modalities also proposes that

for developing countries had been part of the doha round modalities since the july framework agreement of 2004 the controversy revolved around the trigger level and the resulting level of tariff increase the lamy proposal of july 25 posited an ssm that could be triggered on 40 surge above the level of base imports by imposing safeguards of 15 of the bound rate this level broadly the position of the united states was not acceptable to india and several other developing countries which s ought trigger of 1015 surge above base imports and safeguard increase of 30 beyond the bound tariff the united states also insisted on ceiling on the safeguard duties so that their imposition would not breach the existing pre doha bound rates 29 g21g142g155g159g146g140g142g156g561 along with agriculture

reaffirmed the march 2001 guidelines as the basis for continuing the negotiations it directed participants to submit initial requests for specific commitments by june 30 2002 and initial offers by

submitted their initial offers by march 31 2003 many have decried the poor quality of offers many of which only bind existing practices rather than offer new concessions and excluded some sectors

extent possible respond to requests with deeper andor wider commitments commensurate with levels of development regulatory capacity and national policy objectives 31 while much of the activity during the july 2129 2008 geneva talks continued to concern agriculture and industrial market access participants did hold signaling conference on july 26 on the types of additional offers of services liberalization countries would be willing to make provided an agreement was reached in the agriculture and nama talks one area of controversy is socalled mode iv services mode iv relates to the temporary movement of business persons to another country in order to perform service onsite developing countries want easier movement of their nationals under mode iv they claim that the services negotiations have centered on the establishment of businesses in other countries which has been focus of developed countries while there has been negotiation on mode iv which would help them developed countries especially the united states have opposed discussions on mode iv services trade congress might oppose easier entry for business persons based on senate approval of resolution sres 211 in the 108 th congress expressing the sense of the senate that future us trade agreements and implementing legislation should not contain immigrationrelated provisions mode iv services will be difficult issue to resolve fifteen countries have joined plurilateral request for mode iv services liberalization to the united states and other developed countries at the abovementioned signaling conference the united states and the eu reportedly signaled increased flexibility on allowing more services professionals access to their markets 32

of nontariff barriers which include import licensing quotas and other quantitative import restrictions conformity assessment procedures and technical barriers to trade the sectoral elimination of tariffs for specific groups has also be forwarded as an area of negotiation negotiators accepted the concept of less than full reciprocity in reductions for developing and leastdeveloped countries doha negotiators agreed to reach modalities for the reduction or elimination of tariffs and non tariff barriers by the end of may 2003 this deadline was as were subsequent ones not met nama issues were not discussed at cancun and there was agreement on the draft texts proposed for consideration at that ministerial the july 2004 framework agreement adopted the use of nonlinear tariff reduction formula applied on linebyline basis ie one that it can work towards evening out or harmonizing tariff levels and the hong kong ministerial did agreed to use swiss formula the ministerial did not agree on coefficients however and these have become the subject of continuing negotiations the july 2004 framework agreement also agreed that tariff reductions would be calculated from bound rather than the applied tariff rates negotiators are also grappling with the concept of flexibility or the nature and extent of developing countryspecial and differential treatment as it relates to formula cuts in addition to longer implementation times the july framework agreement allows for less than formula cuts for certain undetermined amount tariff lines keeping percentage of tariff lines unbound or not applying formula cuts for an undetermined percentage of tariff lines the socalled paragraph 8 flexibilities at hong kong negotiators did agree to provide tarifffree and quota free access for lcds by 2008 however this agreement provides the caveat that 3 of tariff lines can be exempted as sensitive products such as textiles apparel and footwear the april 30 2006 deadline like so many before was breached without agreement on the nama formula or on other issues the end of june geneva summit also failed to reach agreement on nama modalities the united states canada and switzerland proposed 5 percentage point differential between the swiss formula coefficien ts of developed and developing countries which is consistent with the eu proposal of 10 coefficient for developed countries and 15 coefficient for developing countries group of developing countries known as the nama11 proposed that the differential should be at least 25 percentage points 34 the nama talks have been increasingly linked to the agricultural talks with some mo vement on one becoming increasingly linked to progress in the other developing countries have been unwilling to commit on nama without agreement on agriculture but now some developed countries are tying further agriculture progress to nama this linkage has come be known as the exchange rate between the two negotiations june 2007 g4 meeting in potsdam germany faltered in part over the rejection by brazil of us proposal of 1025 spread for developed and developing country coefficients proposal that was clear break from either countrys stated positions 35 draft modality paper was released on july 17 2007 authored by don stephenson the nama negotiating chairman based on continuing committee level negotiations in geneva revisions to this text were issued in february may and july 2008 this paper sought to reconcile the positions of the parties to move the negotiations forward as such it faced mostly criticism from the diverse negotiating groups following the july 2008 ministerial the chairman revised his text again to reflect areas of convergence in the negotiations while admitting that not all members accepted 34 bridges

convergence while retaining the brackets to indicate that these figures do not represent an agreement for the swiss tariff reduction formula the dr aft called for coefficient of 8 for developed countries and range of coefficients of either x20y22z25 for developing countries depending on which paragraph 7 flexibility each country availed themselves this scenario would allow developing countries choose one of the following flexibilities based on the coefficient x or they chose for the tariff reduction formula 1 apply less than formula cuts for up to 14 for x10 for yof tariff lines provided that the cuts applied are less than half the formula cuts and that the tariff lines do not exceed 16 for x10 for of the value of members nonagricultural imports or 2 keep tariff lines unbound or not applying formula cuts for 65 for x 5 for of tariff lines provid ed they do not exceed 75 for x5 for yof the value of members nonagricultural imports countries choosing coefficient z which would lead to the lowest tariff cuts under the formula would not avail themselves of these flexibilities the use of these flexibilities has been further complicated by the socalled anticoncentration clause which provides that the flexibilities available to developing countries shall not be used to exclude full chapters of the harmonized tariff schedule hs from full formula reductions both the united states and the eu have been adamant that the flexibilities should not be used in way to exclude whole industrial sectors from formula cuts as reflected in the 2 digit hs chapter meanwhile developing countries have opposed expanding the anticoncentration clause beyond the level of full chapters as agreed by all members at the hong kong ministerial the august 2008 convergence text set full formula tariff reductions as minimum of 20 of national tariff lines in each hs chapter or 9 of the value of imports of the member in each hs chapter both the united states and the eu have favored using sectoral tariff elimination as supplemental modality for the nama negotiations negotiations have been heated on which products to cover and the extent of participati on ie whether developi ng countries or ldcs would be able exempt themselves from commitments proposals have been made for sectoral negotiations in the automotive and related parts bicycles and related parts chemicals electronicselectrical products fish and fish products forest products gems and jewelry hand tools industrial machinery open access to enhanced health care raw materials sports equipment toys and textiles clothing and footwear the united states has insisted that major developing countries participate in the sectorals while developing countries have countered that the negotiating mandate makes such negotiations voluntary the latest compromise language stipulates that countries would declare their intention to participate in at least two sectoral negotiations without prejudging that members decision to join in the sectoral initiative resulting from those negotiations those developing countries that did join however would be eligible to receiv higher coefficient in the swiss formula as noted above the industrial market access talks also encompass negotiations on the reduction of nontariff barriers ntbs the draft text includes several sectoral proposals concerning ntbs for chemical

agreement on traderelated aspects of intellectual property rights trips37 the issue involves the balance of interests between the pharmaceutical companies in developed countries that held patents on medicines and the public health needs in developing countries before the doha meeting the united states claimed that the current language in trips was flexible enough to address health emergencies but other countries insisted on new language section 6 of the doha document declaration on the trips agreement and public health trips declaration recognized that wto members with insufficient or manufacturing capabilities in the pharmaceutical sector could face difficulties in making effective use of compulsory licensing under the trips agreement in section 6 the trade ministers instructed the wto trips council to find an expeditious solution to this problem and to report to the wto general council before the end of 2002 on december 16 2002 thentrips council chairman eduardo perez motta produced draft that would allow countries that lack the manufacturing capacity to produce medicines to issue compulsory licenses for imports of the medicines all wto members approved of the chairmans draft except the united states the us position representing the interests of the pharmaceutical industry was that the chairmans draft did not include enough protections against possible misuse of compulsory licenses the united states sought limit on the diseases that would be covered by the chairmans text but other countries refused this initiative the united states decided to oppose the chairmans draft and unilaterally promised not to bring dispute against any least developed country that issued compulsory licenses for certain medicines one concern of the pharmaceutical industry was that the medicines sent to the developing country might be diverted instead to another country to address this problem it was suggested that the medicines be marked so that they can be tracked another concern was that more advanced developing countries might use the generic medicines to develop their own industries for this problem it was proposed that countries voluntarily optout or promise not to use compulsory licensing on august 30 2003 wto members reached agreement on the trips and medicines issue v oting in the general council member governments approved decision that offered an interim waiver under the trips agreement allowing member country to export pharmaceutical products made under compulsory licences to leastdeveloped and certain other members an accompanying statement represented several key shared understandings of members regarding the decision including the recognition that the decision should be used to protect public health 37 see crs report rl33750 the wto

to consider the implications of converting sd treatment measures into mandatory provisions to identify those that members consider should be made mandatory and to report to the general council with

countries wanted to negotiate on changes to sd provisions keep proposals together in the committee on trade and development and set shorter deadlines developed countries wanted to study sd provisions send some proposals to negotiating groups and leave deadlines open developing countries claimed that the developed countries were not negotiating in good faith while developed countries argued that

four issues transparency in government procurement trade facilitation trade and investment and trade and competition these became known as the singapore issues these issues were pushed at successive ministerials by the european union japan and korea and opposed by most developi ng countries the united states was lukewarm about the inclusion of these issues indicating that it could accept some or all of them at various times but preferring to focus on market access in 2001 the doha ministerial declaration called for further clarification on the four singapore issues to be undertaken before the 5th ministerial in 2003 at cancún and for negotiations to be launched on the basis of decision taken by explicit consensus at the 5th ministerial at cancún deadlock over the singapore issues was contributing factor in the breakup of that summit after further negotiations during 2004 compromise was reached in the july 2004 framework agreement three of the singapore issues government procurement investment and competition were dropped and negotiations would begin on trade facilitation trade facilitation aims to improve the efficiency of international trade by harmonizing and streamlining customs procedures such as duplicative documentation requirements customs processing delays and nontransparent or unequally enforced importation rules and requirements the talks have thus far revolved around the scope and obligations of the new disciplines member countries have tabled proposals dealing with freedom of transit fees and formalities and administrative transparency these proposals are reportedly being reviewed refined and drafted into legal provisions that will form the basis of negotiating text discussions have also occurred concerning the technical assistance and trade capacity building needed by developing countries to implement any subsequent agreement developing countries are in the process of assessing their own trade facilitation status and what it will take to bring them up to international standards with the help of customs experts from organizations such as the world bank and the world customs organization developed countries including the united states and the european union favor the negotiation of concrete rulesbased system with appropriate accountability while some developing countries prefer optional guidelines with policy flexibility

including them for discussion us negotiators did manage to insert language asserting that basic concepts principles and effectiveness of these agreements and their instruments and objectives would be preserved however congressional leaders were highly critical of this concession by us trade negotiators39 the doha ministerial declaration also called for clarifying and improving disciplines on fisheries subsidies and both the ministerial declaration and the implementation decision have special provisions on trade remedies and developing countries in addition to trade remedies the declaration calls for clarifying and improving wto disciplines and procedures on regional trade agreements the declaration identified two phases for the work on trade remedies in the initial phase of the negotiations participants will indicate the provisions including disciplines on trade distorting practices that they seek to clarify and improve in the subsequent phase deadlines were set for these phases the united states has primarily been on the defensive in the rules talks many countries have attacked the use of antidumping actions by the united states and other developed nations as disguised protectionism however many developi ng countries are now using antidumping actions themselves which may goad some countries to reexamine the necessity for discipline most of the proposals on trade remedies focus on providing more specificity or restrictions to the adascm agreements in terms of definitions and procedures yet agreements have been reached even on what is to be negotiated the leading proponents of such changes have be group of 15 developed and developing countries known as the friends of antidumping brazil chile colombia costa rica hong kong israel japan mexico norway singapore south korea switzerland taiwan thailand and turkey though not all countries sign onto every proposal they have made numerous proposals and in essence their proposals would reduce the incidence and amount of duties many of their proposals would require change in us laws although the eu is major user of trade remedies and not member of the friends group it has agreed with some of the groups proposals the united states itself has sought some changes in the wto rules submitting papers on antidumping proposals on issues such as transparency foreign practices to circumvent duty order and the wto standard used by dispute panels in reviewing national applications of trade remedy laws the united states also has submitted proposals on subsidies such as expanding list of prohibited subsidies and imposing disciplines on support to sales of natural resources the rules negotiations chair guillermo valles galmés released draft modalities paper on november 30 2007 key feature of this draft was language allowing the use of zeroing in certain antidumping ad calculations 40 the draft is widely seen as concession to the united states the only country that now employs the zeroing methodology which has faced several adverse appellate body decisions over the practice while the united states expressed disappointment that the text did not go far enough in legitimizing the practice several countries 39 zoellick stance on trade remedy in wto provokes criticism inside us trade november 13 2001 40 in determining dumping margins zeroing refers to calculation whereby only goods sold in the export market at less than the domestic market price are counted goods sold in the export market at higher than domestic price are assigned value of zero thus tending to
