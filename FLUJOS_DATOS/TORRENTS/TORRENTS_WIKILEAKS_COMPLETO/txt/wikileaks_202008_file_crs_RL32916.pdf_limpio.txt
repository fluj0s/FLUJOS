the uruguay round ur of multilateral trade negotia tions completed in 1994 represented the first significant step toward reforming international agricultural trade under the ur negotiations domestic policies and trade policies were viewed as interconnected as result wto member countries committed to disciplines in agricultural support in three broad areas domestic agricultural support programs export subsidies and market access often referred to as the three pillars of the agreement on agriculture aa in add ition members also agreed to provisions concerning the handling of sanitary and phytosanitary measures dispute settlement procedures and the continuati on of the reform process under the auspices of the urs aa wt member countries agreed to limit and reduce the most distortive domestic suppor t subsidies referred to as amber box subsidies and measured by the aggregate measure of support ams index several types of indirect subsidies were identified as causing minimal distortion to agricultural production and trade and were provided exemptions green box blue box minimis and special treatment from wt disciplines export subsidies were capped and subject to reductions in both value and volume in addition members agreed to improve market access for internationally traded agricultural products by converting nontari ff trade barriers ntbs into tariffs process called tariffication binding existing tariffs at january 1 1995 levels and reducing tariffs from bound levels with the allproduct average tariff being reduced faster than tariffs for individual products these subsidy and tariff reductions occurred during sixyear implementation period 19952000 t hose countries that had used ntbs to restrict imports submitted to form of tariffication that incl uded quotas and special safeguards offering extra protection from surges in imports for politically sensitive products each countrys specific commitments are listed in its schedule of concessions the aa also recognized the special needs of developing and leastdeveloped countries and provided them with greater flexibility in implementing their policy commitments referred to as special and differential treatment in general the rates of reduction applie d to tariffs and subsidies for veloping countries were lower than the rates used by developed countri in addition their reduction commitments were implemented over an ex tended period of time gene rally 10year period 1994 2004 leastdeveloped count ries as defined by the united nations were exempt from all reduction commitments but were required to bind tariffs and domestic support at baseyear levels to provide for monitoring and co mpliance of wto policy commitments each wto member country was expected to r outinely submit notification

improving the predictability transparency and marketorientation of international agricultural trade in light of this experience this report introduces several of the major negotiating issues that have emerged for each of the various policy commitments made under the auspices of the agreement on agriculture background on the uruguay round from 1948 through 1994 the general agr eement on tariffs and trade gatt provided the most widely accepted set of rules governing international trade although the rules of trade established unde r gatt also applied to agriculture they contained several loopholes exceptions and exemptions from most of the disciplines that applied to manufactured goods3 for example while export subsidies were not allowed for most industrial products they were permitted on ag ricultural products in addition gatt allowed the use of impor t quotas as well as subsidies on domestic production for agricultural products as result agricultural trade was highly distorted and lacked in transparency and fairness these problems were specifically addressed during the uruguay round 19861994 of gatt multilateral trade negotiations in the agreement on agriculture the world trade organization wto the uruguay round culminated in 1994 when 125 countries signed the final act embodying the results of the uruguay round of multilateral trade negotiations hereafter referred to as the final act 4 establishing the wto and subsuming the gatt5 built on gatt rules the wto replaced the gatt as the worlds principal institutional framework for overseeing trade negotiations and for adjudicating trade disputes as of april 2005 there were 148 members in the wto representing over 95 of world trade6 in addition there were 31 observer governments most of which had applied for membership in the wto and seven international organization observers the uruguay round negotiations produced general rules regarding subsidy disciplines and market access concessions that applied to all members however each individual member country also negotiated their own specific policy commitments the list of co mmitments along with their implementation period were spelled out for each

members may join the wto through formal process of accession negotiations8 during accession negotiations new members must also negotiate their specific policy commitments as detailed in schedule of concessions agreement on agriculture the agreement on agriculture aa the first multilateral agreement dedicated entirely to agriculture was one of 29 individual legal texts included under an umbrella agreement establishing the wto9 the stated objective of the aa was to reform trade in the agricultural s ector and to make mbercountry policies more marketoriented in order to improve predictability and security for importing and exporting countries alike policy tradeoff subsidies vs market access during the uruguay round negotiations domestic and trade policies were viewed as interconnected policies whic h supported domestic prices or subsidized production tended to encourag overproduction this in turn squeezed out imports or led to either export subsidies or lowpriced dumping on world markets furthermore to support artif icially high domestic prices border controls such as restrictive import quotas excessively high tariffs and other non tariff measures were often used to keep out lowerpriced foreig n supplies as result for new trade agreement to be reached trade negotiators felt that individual countries had to be willing to trade off some aspects of domestic policy in favor of facilitating greater openness in world markets in the final outcome of the uruguay round such tradeoff in agriculture involved commitments by member countries to improve market access on the one hand while limiting and reducing tradedistorting subsidies on the other hand the disciplines involved freezing protection nd subsidies at base period levels then instituting nnual reduc tions from the bound levels general framework for implementing these disciplines was veloped during the uruguay round description of the disciplines and commitments eg tariffication tariffrate quotas special safeguards subsidy nd tariff reductions special treatment implementation period and any special pr ovisions are provided below in the chapter entitled agricultu ral support commitments

country schedules were annexed to the gatt agreement and were approved as part of the uruguay round negotiations members that have joined since january 1 1995 also must list their policy commitments which are negotiated during their accession process in schedule of concessions for each wto member the country schedule is the official schedule of all policy commitments ratification of the aa by all wto member countries was equivalent to ratifi cation of the individual country schedules11 similarly acceding countries must obtai n unanimous consent of their country schedule as part of the accession process although the uruguay round negotiations established guidelines for most policy disciplines individua l member countries are gally committed only to those provisions included in their schedule of concessions regardless of their correspondence with the general guidelines each country schedule consists of the following four parts part i mostfavored nation mfn cessions maximum tariffs on goods from other wto members12 part i is divided into three major components section 1a lists tariffs on agricultural products section 1b lists tariff quotas on agricultural products and section 2 lists mfn conce ssions on all other products part ii preferential concessions tariffs that benefit countries within the scope of bilateral or regional trade agreements eg the north american free trade

at base year levels developing countries the wto does not have specific and transparent criteria to designate count ry as developing or developed instead member countries are permitted to lfdesignate such designation is significant because developing countries qualify fo r the benefits of sdt and as result do not have to cut their subsidies or lower their tariffs as much as developed countries plus they are granted an extended implementation period to meet their commitments many developed countries have questioned the authen ticity of several self designated developing count ries and recommend that more formal procedure be established before country is able to be nefit from sdt status for example using world bank data for the 19922003 peri od 13 wto member c ountries that have

countries those developingcountry members which rely on imports for the majority of thei r food supplies are recognized for special monitoring under article 16 of the aa17 the concern is that the reduction of domestic agricultural support subsidies by veloped countries c ould result in lower exports and higher internati onal prices thereby raising the food bill for netimporting countries with potentially negative effects agricultural support commitments to limit and reduce the amount of distortive subsidies directed to their agricultural sectors wto member countries agreed to disciplines in agricultural support in three broad areas domestic agricultural support programs export subsidies and market access often referred to as the three pillars of the aa each of these pillars is discussed in turn below general framework for disciplines in each of these three areas is outlined in table 1 domestic support domestic support broadly refers to those agricultural policies that operate within country so as to influence internal farm and rural incomes resource use production and consumption of agricultural products or the environmental impacts of farming individual wto member countries reserve th right and may be obligated by their electorate to use domestic support polic ies to pursue various national policy objectives as result the aa distingu ishes between support programs that have direct effect on agricultural producti on and those that are deemed minimally distorting the former are referred to as coupled programs because of their direct link to production and are subject to limitati ons and gradual reduction from historical base levels in contrast most indirect support measures ie those policies which are minimally trade or production dist orting are exempted from reduction commitments domestic support subject to reduction commitments domestic support deemed to have direct effect on agricultural production is measured by an index referred to as the ggregate measure of support ams18 the ams combines the monetary value of all nonex empt agricultural support into one overall measure the ams includes both budgetar outlays in the form of actual

schedules of concessions each countrys specific commitments vary according to the outcome of negotiations and are listed in their respective country schedules as result of the negotiations several developing countries chose to set fixed bound tariff ceilings that do not decline over the years darticle 94 of the aa includes temporary exemptions for developing countries allowing them to subsidize certain marketing and transport activitieshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32916crs8 domestic support exempt fr om reduction commitments the aa defines four categories of domestic support that are eligible for exemption from reduction commitments these are green box blue box minimis and sdt exemptions green box certain types of domestic subsid ies that do not distort trade or at most cause minimal distortion while achieving various domestic policy goals these types of policies as identified in annex 2 of the aa are exempted from domestic support disciplines in accordance with articles 71 and 72a complying policies include outlays for such activities as agricultural research and extension conservation and the environm ent rural development food security stocks domestic food aid eg food stamps farm disast er payments and structural adjustment programs also exempted are decoupled payments ie payments that are not linked to current production decisions thes specific exemptions are referred to as green in the trafficlight sense since c ountries can go ahead with these policies without limit provided each exempted polic complies fully with its respective provision in annex 2 blue box any support that would normally be in the amber box is placed in the blue box if the support also requi res agricultural producers to limit production article 65 both crop and livestock production may qualify for this exemption there are limits on blue box spending minimis exemptions commodityspecific support that is below 5 10 for developing countries of co mmoditys value of production is deemed sufficiently benign that it does not have to be included in the ams calculation article 64 such commodityspecific s upport can be evaluated for each individual commodity similarly nonproduct specific support that is below 5 10 for developing countries of the total valu of production for all commodities may be exempted from inclusion in the ams for countries that have ams reduction commitment in their schedules dom estic support is limited to their minimis values on both productspecific and total basis for any given year article 72b special and differential tr eatment sdt exemptions c r t i n domestic investment and input bsidies of developing countries and ldcs are exempt from support reducti on commitments article 62 domestic subsidy issues this subsection identifies some of the major issues concerning domestic support disciplin that have emerged during the first decade since the completion of the uruguay round several if not all of these issues are likely to be ddressed during the ongoing doha round of negotiations ams disaggregation presently ams commitments are calculated on an aggregate basis such aggregation allows subsidies to be sh ifted between products in such manner as to disproportionately favor certain commodities some wto members have argued for disaggregation of ams ceilings according to products ie to set commodityspecific ceilings within the larger ams aggregate ceiling it is argued that such commodityspecific disciplines would further liberalization within individual commodity marketshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32916crs9 ams reduction or elimination now that disciplines have been imposed on domestic support subsidies many members are expressing an interest in their elimination within three to five years fo r developed countries and nine years for developing countries this would bring ll countries down to their minimis levels as spending ceilings since most domestic support spending occu rs in just few developed countries partic ularly in the european union the united states and japan which account for over 90 of all am ber box spending this argument is often made by developing countries who suggest that harmonization of domestic support at minimis levels would be the most fair solution in contrast those countries which still depend on domestic support subsidies to achieve domestic policy goals are reluctant to accept their total elimination amber to green box subsidy shift another emerging issue concerns the gradual shift of subsidies away from the marketdistorting policies of the amber box towards the minimally distor ting policies of the green box although such subsidy shifting clearly helps to ach ieve one of the major objec tives of the uruguay round ie reduce market distortion many developing countries have complained about the excessive use of green box and other exemptions by developed countries in the posturuguay round period as larger volumes of subsidy outlays shift into the green box policymakers and trade negotiators will likely feel greater pressure to differentiate between the degree of mark et distortion caused by various greenbox exempted policies and to link disciplines more closely with the degree of market distortion limits on blue box spending only seven member s have notified using the blue box exemption the eu icel and norway japan the slovak republic slovenia and the united states of these the united states is longer using the box but has argued for its retention and would like to qualify countercyclical farm commodity payments for the blue box veral developed and developing countries contend that since blue box policies are not fully decoupled they should either be eliminated or moved into the amber box presently blue box spending is not subject to any limits minimis changes for those countries with domestic policy commitments in their country schedule domestic support subsidies must remain within their minimis ceilings many developing c ountries are subject to the minimis ceilings these countries are beginning to suggest that their minimis ceilings should be raised to give them gr eater flexibility in addressing their domestic poverty and rural development goals in c ontrast many countries have argued that developed countries with rge domestic production most notably the united states are able to avail themselves of high minimis spending limit exemptions thereby avoiding intended discip lines on domestic support export subsidies export subsidies are special incentives in the form of direct or indirect compensation provided by governments to commercial firms to encourage increased foreign sales of domestic products direct export subsidies explicit cash payments per unit of product exported are often used when nations domestic price for good is artificially raised above the world market price the aa imposes limits onhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32916crs10 20 for status report on the implementation of

indirect methods of export subsidization include g overnment subsidized financing for exports eg export credit guarantees export promotion and information activities tax benefits or other forms of assistance that may lead to lower than normal costs for exported products types of export subsidies article 91 of the aa defines seve ral types of export subsidies that are subject to limitations and reduction commitments including direct export payments by government to firms industries or producers of agricultural products contingent on export performance sales or gifts of government stocks at prices lower than acquisitionprices export payments financed through government action includingpayments financed by levies on producers subsidies to reduce export marketing costs including handling andexportspecific transportation and subsidies on goods incorporated in to export products article 11 export subsidy commitments in the uruguay round 25 countries agreed to both volume and value reductions in th use of direct export subsidies from 198690 base period see table 2 20 by volume developed countries committed to reduce the volume of subsidized exports by 21 over sixyear period 19952000 developing countries committed to 14 reduction over 10year period 19952004 by value developed countries co mmitted to reduce the value of subsidized exports by 36 over six years developing countries committed to 24 reduction over 10 years flexibility across years the aa provides some flexibility between years in terms of subsidy reducti ons article 92b country was allowed to exceed its export subsidy commitments in any of the years two through five 199699 pr ovided that the total cumulative value of export subsidies and th cumulative volume of subsidized exports through the year in

country schedule article 8 exemptions members agreed to exempt bona fide food aid transactions article 104 and widely av ailable export market promo tion and advisory services from the list of export subsidies however members must restrict their use of exempted export marketing practices that could cause them to circumvent their export subsidy commitments articles 101 and 103 export credit intentions finally members agreed to undertake work towards the development of internationally agreed disciplines to govern the use of export credit export credit guarantees and insurance progra ms article 102 export subsidy issues uruguay round disciplin have greatly reduced the value and volume of subsidized exports used in international agricultural markets while the complete elimination of direct export subsidies is an obvious goal several thorny issues remain surroundi ng indirect export subsidies export subsidy elimination the european union alone accounts for nearly 90 of all direct export subsidie s used in the posturuguay round period as result strong arguments have been made by most wto members for the complete elimination of direct export subsidies indirect export subsidies major concern is the general lack of transparency or any general agreement on which types of indirect export subsidies are most distortive and should be subject to di sciplines for example export credit and credit guarantees are alleged to contain hidden subsidies in the form of extended repayment periods and below market interestrate charges on export credit several members argue that export credit should be offered on strictly commercial terms defined according to criteria such as duration of the credit eg 180 days benchmarks for interest ra tes eg libor the london interbank offered rate plus some markup ppropriate insurance premiums et c also export restrictions such as differential export taxes that favor the export of processed products over the primary commodity can have the same effect as subsidy on the export of the processed products export stes some wto members argue that state trading enterprises stes or state marketing boards should be subject to explicit wto disciplines because they have monopoly power when buying domestic commodities for export enjoy government financial guarantees to underwrite their business risk and do not operate under commercial obj ectives however there is debate among wto members about whether stes are significantly different from large privatelyheld commercial enterprises both often have considerable market power are able to practice discriminatory pricing across markets and can be bailed out of financial difficulties with government funds so members argue that multinational corporations should also be subject to disc iplines still third voice in this debate is from some developing countries who conte nd that they need stes to fill in where their private sector is still too weak or underdevelped to operate commercially or to compete against large foreign companieshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32916crs12 21 for more information on the committee and its annual reports see wto market access for goods work of the committee on

that such aid reaches its intended recipients with minimum harm to local agricultural production and without unnecessarily pushing out commercial trade fro m those same markets also several wto members contend that in the past some countries most notably the united states have used food aid as an outlet for agricultural surpluses market access market access refers to the extent to which

justifie d under three general reasons to ensure domestic food security to protect impover ished or disadvantaged producers or to preserve rural society with these considerations in mind the uruguay round established disciplines on trade distorting import barriers while maintaining historical trade volumes and assuring some increased access of agricultural goods into highly protected markets the aa also recognized the special needs of developing countries with rules concerning exceptions and special and differential treatment sdt for market access provisions these disciplin and provisions are described below committee on market access the wto general c ouncil established the committee on market access january 31 1995 with mandate to supervise facilitate and monitor the imp lementation of market acce ss concessions ensure that country schedules are kept uptodate oversee the content and operation of and access to wto integrated database of tariff data and to report periodically in the form of annual public reports to the wto council on trade in goods21 the aa articles 4 and 5 requires adherence to market access commitments as identified in each countrys schedule of concessions principal among these are tariff bindings and reduction commitments as well as tariffication of ntbs for those products subject to ta riffication ie previously protected by ntbs special temporary safeguards were put in place to afford protection from unexpected import surges for many of these products tariffra quotas were also established to retain some vestige of historical protection rates while assuring some increased access tohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32916crs13 22 the wtos committee on agriculture uses mber notifications to produce occasional reports on the implementation of special safegu ards the most recent version of such report is wto special agricultural safeguard gagng s9rev1 february 19 2002highly protected markets each of these market access commitments are briefly discussed here tariff bindings and reductions wto members agreed to bind the maximum tariff rates that ma be applied for imported pr oducts at base period 1986 1988 levels as result of this discipline 100 of agricultural products now have bound tariffs member countries are free to apply tariff rates that are below the bound rate but may never apply tariff rate in excess of the bound rate without first consulting with the other members that are most likely to be affected by such change and agreeing on some level of compensation article 28 of the gatt in addition to the binding of maximum ta riff rates member countries agreed to reductions in the bound rates in general the bound annual average aggregate tariff was to be reduced by 36 in equal in stallments over sixyear period 19952000 for developed countries veloping countries were given 10year period 1995 2004 tariffs on individual pr oducts were to be reduced by less than 15 during these same periods tariffication tariffication is the process of converting nontariff trade barriers ntbs to bound tariffs tarifficati on was done under the aa to improve the transparency of existing agricultural trad barriers and to facilitate their proposed reductions under article 42 all agricultural ntbs were banned they were replaced by ordinary tariffs th at provided an equivalent vel of protection this was achieved by setting the new tariff at an amount equal to the difference between internal and external prices existing in the base period 19861988 for example if under the previous policy domestic prices were on average about 75 above world market prices then the new ad va lorem tariff would be set at 75 special safeguards ssgs the aa contains ssg provisions put in place for those products subject to tariffication article 5 an ssgs purpose is to prevent disruption of domestic markets due to impor t surges or abnormally low import prices ssgs allow member countries to impose additional tariffs on agricultural products if their import volume exceeds defined trigger levels or if import prices fall below specified trigger levels the ssg applies only to products that are either 1 subject to tariffication or 2 in cas where the country has designated product as eligible for the ssg in its country schedule an ssg can apply only to imports that exceed tariffrate quota volumes see the discussion on tariffrate quotas below the ssg is an alternative to the general safeguard provision of the gatt and is easier to invoke because it does not require test of injury or threat of injury as of february 11 2002 there were 39 wto members that had reserved the right to use combined total of 6156 ssgs on agricultural products in their commitments see tables 2 and 3 22httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32916crs14 23 the committee on

such report is wto tariff and other quotas tnags5 march 21 2002tariffrate quotas trqs quota is quantitative limit placed on the importation of specific commodity trq is simply twotiered tariff limited volume the quota can be imported at the wer tariff and imports in excess of the quota volume are charged higher usually prohib itive tariff under the uruguay round negotiations the quota component was t equal to historical trade levels to avoid dramatic disruption of traditional trade patterns where trade had been minimal an access quota was established at hi gher level than the historical average in order to provide improved access opportunitie s as result trq allows for some minimum access while assuring protection once that level of access has been achieved trq quotas and tariff rates were ne gotiated on country and commodity specific basis as of march 8 2002 ther were 43 wto members with combined total of 1425 tariffrate quotas in their commitments see tables 2 and 3 23 the specific quota and tariff rates are listed in the country schedules in general trq quota levels were set and were subject to an annual increas based on historical levels according to the following formula minimum access if imports represente d less than 5 of domestic consumption during the base pe riod 198688 then the access quota was initially set equal to 3 of domestic consumption but would grow to 5 of domestic consum ption during the implementation period and current access the access quota was to be less than the base period 198688 level if imports represented more than 5 of domestic consumption dur ing the base period special and differential treatment sdt special treatment provisions allow certain countries under certain conditions to post pone tariffication up to the end of the implementation period to 2000 for developed countries to 2004 for developing nations but subject to stri ctly defined conditions including minimum access for overseas suppliers under the uruguay round negotiati ons four countries were granted special treatment provisions japan south korea and the philippines for rice and israel for sheep meat whole milk powder and certain cheeses japan and israel have since given up their speci treatment rights however chinese taipei negotiated for and has received special treatment for rice with its accession to the wto on january 1 2002 under differential

to tariffi cation and bindings but were exempt from tariff reduction commitments market access issues many uruguayround par ticipants felt that the market access concessions eventually obtained were very pre liminary and represented only minimal beginning at opening many ag ricultural markets as result of the use of bound rates substantially above applied rates d irty tariffication megatariffs and selective product tari ff reductions within aggregate groupings agricultural tariffs remain very high fo r some politically sensitive products in some countries thereby limiting the trade benefits to be derived from the new rules each of these issues and terms and other emerging market access issues are briefly discussed here bound vs applied tariffs although tariff bindings and reductions represented positive step forward the base period chose n 198688 was time of very high protection levels thereby contri buting to the setting of high tariffs under tariffication25 in many cases the bound maximum levels were significantly above applied rates the gap is of ten referred to as water in the process of replacing ntbs with tariffs some countries exaggera ted their measures of domestic prices or understated the measures of world prices used thereby increasing the gap between domestic and world prices and inflating the new tariff binding process called dirty tariffication very large tariffs pa rticularly those much larger than necessary to protect the difference in domestic nd world prices are called megatariffs subjecting bound megatariffs to reductions may still leave the final bound tariff significantly above the tariff actually pplied thereby having essentially impact on trade the benefits of stable tariff regime are not achieved when bound tariffs are high and tariffs actually pplied are manipulated in response to market conditions some members argue that in order to effect genuine market access gains either dramatic reductions in bound ce ilings or setting bound levels at average applied rates will have to be made howe ver several countries conte nd that substantial water or the gap between bound and applied tariffs gives policymakers more flexibility in determining the level of import duties n eeded to protect farmers from subsidized exports flexibility in tariff reduction commitments the reduction commitment for aggregate tariffs was substantially larger than the reduction commitment for individual line items 36 ve rsus 15 respectively th is difference has afforded member countries significant flexibility in retaining tariff protection for agricultural products deemed politically sensitive thos tariffs most criti cal for protection of domestic agriculture generally are only subset of the total as result 36 average reduction can be achieved either by making rather large cuts in tariffs forhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32916crs16 26 for more information see crs report rs21905 agriculture in the wto doha round the framework agreem ent and next steps by charles hanrahancommodities that do not compete with dom estic production or by making large percentage cuts in tariffs that are already very low while making only minimal cuts in politically sensitive tariffs members seeking greater market access contend that future reduction rates for individual produc ts should be closer to the aggregate reduction rate to avoid within category manipulation of tariffs tariff escalation several developing countries complain that their domestic agricultural processing sector faces tariff escalation in international markets ie higher duties are charged on processed pr oducts than on the raw materials such tariff escalation encourages the exporting of agricultural raw materials rather than processed products and the affected count ries fail to capture the income gains of valueadded processing these countries argue for greater harmonization between raw and processed pr oducts in order to better permit countries with substantial agricultural production to be able to cap ture the valueadded from processing rate of ta riff reduction while the longrun goal of increasing market access through lowering of tariffs is clear there is widespread disagreement over the specific formula for such reductions countries w ith generally low import duties prefer formulation that would bring the hi ghest tariff rates down the fastest in order to gradually harmonize tariffs across memb er countries howe ver those countries with the highest tariff protection rates are re luctant to give up their protection and call for an approach that uses more egalitarian percentage rate cuts across all tariffs both high and low such an approach would leave the relative level of protection among member countries ssentially unchanged conversion of specific tariffs to ad valorem the concept of converting specific perunit duties to ad valorem value based is widely accepted as the best approach for ensuring transparency harmonization and eventual reduction of market access restrictions however the formulation for implementing such conversion encounters substantia l disagreement over which base prices domestic or international to use to value the perunit volumes this issue is contentious because most members are competing to preserve their current border protection level under tari ff conversion any pricing met hod that results in lower valuation will also imply lower tari ff rate however in may 2005 wto trade negotiators appear to have reached compromise agreement on dealing with this tariff conversion issue26 trq liberalization liberalization concerns loosening the tariff and quota components of existing trqs some mbers want to expand quota levels and reduce inquota tariffs to zero in order to permit greater mark et access
