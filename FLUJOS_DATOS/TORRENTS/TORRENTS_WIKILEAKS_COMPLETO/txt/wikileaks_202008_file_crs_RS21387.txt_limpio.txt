this report will be updated as negotiations progress on november 4 2002 united states trade representative ustr robert b zoellick notified congress of the administrations intention to launch negotiations for free trade agreement fta with the southern african customs union sacu comprised of botswana namibia lesotho south africa and swaziland this agreement would be the first us fta with subsaharan african country the first round of negotiations for the sacu fta began on june 3 2003 in johannesburg south africa the negotiations were initially scheduled to conclude by december 2004 but the deadline was pushed to the end of 2006 after negotiations stalled in late 2004 and resumed in late 2005 the talks continued to move at slow pace until april 2006 when us and sacu officials decided to suspend negotiations and instead begin longer term joint work program on july 16 2008 ustr susan schwab signed trade investment and development cooperation agreement tidca with trade ministers from sacu several possible rationales exist for the negotiation of an fta with sacu one impetus derives from sec 116 of the african growth and opportunity act agoa title i pl 106200 in which congress declared its sense that ftas should be negotiated crs2 with subsaharan african countries to serve as catalyst for trade and for us private sector investment in the region such trade and investment could fuel economic growth in southern africa by creating new jobs and wealth sacu member countries have achieved the most robust export growth under agoa and an fta may expand their access to the us market an fta may also encourage the continued economic liberalization of the sacu members and it could move sacu beyond oneway preferential access to full trade partnership with the united states finally although sacu is customs union its members investment and regulatory regimes are not fully harmonized comprehensive fta with the united states could force sacu to achieve greater harmonization potential ussacu fta is of interest to congress because 1 congress will need to consider ratifying any agreement signed by the parties 2 provisions of an fta may adversely affect us business in importcompeting industries and may affect employment in those industries and 3 an fta may increase the effectiveness of agoa and bolster its implementation on january 9 2003 bipartisan group of 41 representatives wrote to ambassador zoellick to support the beginning of fta negotiations with sacu httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21387 the us business community has also shown interest in ussacu fta the ussouth african business council an affiliate of the national foreign trade council announced the creation of an fta advocacy coalition in december 2002 the corporate council on africa us organization dedicated to enhancing trade and investment ties with africa also supports the negotiations for these business groups primary benefit of an fta with sacu would be to counteract the free trade agreement between the european union and south africa which has given price advantage to european firms the fta could also provide an opportunity to address the constraints on us exports to sacu countries such as relatively high tariffs import restrictions insufficient copyright protection and service sector barriers1 some us businesses have reportedly expressed skepticism about an fta with sacu citing concerns over corruption and inadequate transparency in government procurement particularly in south africa2 on december 16 2002 the interagency trade policy staff committee which is chaired by the ustr held hearing to receive public comment on negotiating positions for the proposed agreement several groups representing retailers food distributors and metal importers supported the reduction of us tariffs on sacu goods that an fta would bring others representing service industries and recycled clothing favored negotiations to remove tariff and nontariff barriers in the sacu market yet other groups opposed the additional opening of us markets to sacu goods or sought exemptions for their products they included the growers and processors of california peaches and apricots the american sugar alliance rubber footwear manufacturers and producers of silicon metal and manganese aluminum bricks some us civil society organizations are concerned that sacu fta could have negative consequences for poor southern africans citing potential adjustment costs for 1 the united states trade representative 2005 national trade estimate report on foreign trade barriers p 551 2

importing generic drugs to treat hivaids background the south african customs union consists of botswana lesotho namibia south africa and swaziland five contiguous states with population of 519 million people encompassing 17 million square miles on the southern tip of the african continent although this figure represents less than 1 of the population of subsaharan africa sacu accounts for onehalf of the subcontinents gross domestic product gdp wide differences exist among the economies of sacu while south africa has developed significant manufacturing and industrial capacity the other countries remain dependent on agriculture and mineral extraction the grouping is dominated by south africa which accounts for 87 of the population and 93 of the gdp of the customs area sacu member states had combined real gdp of about 158 billion in 20053 sacu is the united states second largest trading partner in africa behind nigeria whose exports are almost exclusively petroleum products overall sacu is the 33rd httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21387 largest trading partner of the united states merchandise imports from sacu totaled 100 billion in 2007 33 increase from 2005 and 169 increase from 19974 they were composed of minerals such as platinum and diamonds apparel vehicles and automotive parts major us exports to the region include aircraft automobiles computers medical instruments and construction and agricultural equipment the 2007 merchandise trade deficit with sacu was 44 billion the united states ran services trade surplus with south africa the only member of sacu for which service data are available with exports of 16 billion and imports of 11 billion in 20065 services trade between the united states and south africa has increased steadily over the last decade with both imports and exports doubling since 1996 the stock of us foreign direct investment in south africa totaled 38 billion in 2006 and was centered around manufacturing chemicals and services the stock of south african investment in the us stood at 652 million in 20066 fta negotiations with sacu may result in the first us trade agreement with an existing customs union sacu is the worlds oldest customs union it originated as customs agreement between the territories of south africa in 1889 the arrangement was formalized through the customs agreement of 1910 and was renegotiated in 1969 in 1994 the member states agreed to renegotiate the treaty in light of the political and economic changes implicit from the end of the apartheid regime the renegotiated 3 the world bank world development

some observers are concerned that further integration of the customs union may be threatened by individual member countries signing economic partnership agreements epas with the european union eu because these agreements would include policies that sacu has yet to harmonize such as rules of origin and customs procedures some observers believe that sacu should only negotiate these policies as group to avoid roadblocks to harmonization7 the 2002 agreement the 2002 agreement provides for greater institutional equality of the member states and effectively redistributes tariff revenue within the member states its three key policy provisions are the free movement of goods within sacu common external tariff and common revenue pool it also provides more institutional clout to botswana lesotho namibia and swaziland blns in decision making by creating policymaking council of ministers the agreement enhances the existing customs union commission and it creates permanent secretariat based in windhoek namibia the agreement renegotiated the formula for disbursement of the common revenue pool which accounts for large portion of government revenue in the blns countries blns disbursements were specified under the old formula but under httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21387 the new formula they are variable and based on shares of intrasacu trade both formulas result in redistribution of sacu tariff revenues from south africa to blns but the new formula has its basis in some measure of economic activity recent estimates indicate sacu payments accounted for 49 of government revenue in lesotho 69 in swaziland 25 in namibia 12 in botswana and 3 in south africa in 20058 sacu tariff structure 2003 wto trade policy review9 of sacu member states examined the tariff structure and trade posture of the customs union it noted that the south african tariff structure which was still the basis for the sacu tariff was relatively complex consisting of specific ad valorem mixed compound and formula duties however the south african government has embarked on tariff rationalization process to simplify the tariff schedule to convert tariff lines to ad valorem rates and to remove tariffs on items not produced in the sacu according to the ustr the complexity of the tariff regime has made it necessary for some us firms to employ facilitators to export to south africa10 the wto found applied mfn tariffs averaged 118 in manufacturing 55 in agriculture and 07 in mining and quarrying these average tariffs represent reduction from the previous wto review in 1998 when mfn tariffs averaged 16 56 and 14 respectively however tariffs are often bound11 much higher with some bindings as high as 400 7 epa threatens to tear apart oldest customs union africa news inter press

slowmoving and stalled negotiations us and sacu trade officials called off the fta negotiations in april 2006 in favor of longer term trade and investment work plan on july 16 2008 they signed trade investment and development cooperation agreement tidca which is the first of its kind the tidca is reportedly formal mechanism for the united states and sacu to negotiate interim traderelated agreements which may serve as the building blocks for future fta the agreement will also allow the two parties to work on key issues in their trade such as trade facilitation technical barriers investment promotion and sanitary and phytosanitary standards12 observers have cited several possible reasons for the halt in fta negotiations first the united states and sacu did not agree on the scope of the negotiations per their mandate from congress to pursue comprehensive ftas us negotiators attempted to proceed with negotiations including intellectual property rights government procurement investment and services provisions however sacu officials reportedly argued for these provisions to be excluded from the negotiations they called for making market httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21387 access commitments first and then negotiating the other areas now that congress has extended the agoa benefits to 2015 through the agoa acceleration act of 2004 pl 108274 there may be less incentive for sacu countries to complete an fta with the united states also the united states and sacu reportedly held different views on how to include certain industrial sectors in the negotiations the united states preferred what is called negative list where all industries are negotiable unless specifically excluded meanwhile sacu preferred positive list where the industries to be included in the negotiations are specified in advance and additional industries may be included in the agreement over time finally the united states and sacu differed on issues concerning labor rights and environmental regulations some observers have speculated that south africa may be leery of negotiating issues that are included in the current wto negotiations so as not to influence their positions in the wto13 former ustr robert zoellick has stated that the united states recognizes that sacu is still an emerging entity it has not developed harmonized policies on many of the issues that would be included in an fta which may add to the challenges of negotiating an fta14 12 us signs commercial pact with sacu says free trade agreement still possible bna july 17 2008
