transferring all target information from the european mainland via the strategic hub of london then by satellite to fort meade in maryland via the crucial hub at menwith hill in the north york moors of the uk the report referred to project known as echelon that works by indiscriminately intercepting very large quantities of communications and then siphoning out what is valuable using artificial aids to find key words2 subsequent reports provide more extensive technical discussion of nsas supposed capabilities3 the reports cite various journalistic accounts as sources for their information it is worth noting that such european parliament studies known as scientific and technological options assessments stoa are prepared by outside specialists commissioned because of prior publications and expertise the authors who are not civil servants do not have official access to the classified information of the member states moreover the parliament itself has not taken an official position on echelon the various charges relating to echelon are difficult to assess given the sensitivities involved in intelligence programs generally and in regard to the work of nsa in particular to far greater extent than the central intelligence agency cia nsa is publicly reticent about it operations indeed specific statutory restrictions apply to the disclosure of information regarding cryptanalytic processes4 nevertheless government efforts to gather intelligence about foreign countries and hostile groups through signals intelligence efforts are widely known statutory authorities nsa which was established in 1952 by presidential directive has statutory responsibilities for sigint designated in the national security act and an executive order eo 12333 signed by president reagan in 19815 major employer in the state of maryland nsa currently has much higher profile than was true in the past and its post cold war missions are widely discussed albeit usually not publicly by responsible government officials nsas operations in the us are covered by the foreign intelligence surveillance act fisa pl 95511 that was enacted in 1978 in part as result of concern about electronic surveillance of us persons undertaken by intelligence agencies without court authorization law enforcement agencies regularly conduct wiretaps and other surveillance activities but under different statutory authorities fisahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20444crs3 6 robert l dietz general counsel of nsa letter to the editor washington post december 7 1999 p a30 7 on encryption see richard nunno

surveillance can be undertaken in the us for foreign intelligence as opposed to law enforcement purposes the act includes specific provisions designed to preclude the improper use of electronic surveillance against us persons some critics have suggested that such provisions could be evaded by requesting foreign intelligence agencies to provide information on us persons the nsa has however officially denied that such practice occurs noting that it has been prohibited since 19786 observers of intelligence efforts acknowledge that sophisticated capabilities exist to gather electronic transmissions of different types they suggest however that any claims that every one of the many millions of daily telephone calls facsimile transmissions and emails can be intercepted translated and analyzed are not credible further the technical ability of intelligence agencies to sift out all words or identify speakers which might be of significance is distinctly limited for inevitable reasons intelligence agencies are unwilling to disclose the extent of their electronic surveillance capabilities and their accomplishmentsa factor that inhibits the useful forms of public costbenefit analyses although discounting media claims regarding the universality of the us surveillance effort observers of the intelligence community argue that sigint provides an extremely valuable and often unique source of information in an international environment that contains dangerous elements fully capable of undermining democratic institutions in this country and throughout the world in particular observers cite its value in obtaining information on terrorist groups planning attacks on us facilities on smugglers attempting to transport illegal narcotics into the us or on hostile countries capable of attacking the us or its allies for certain targets unapproachable by human agents or indistinguishable by overhead imagery sigint is said to provide unique information it is known that electronic surveillance efforts have faced new technological challenges in recent years people throughout the world are communicating morethrough regular telephones cellular telephones facsimile email and through the internet furthermore the increasing use of fiber optic lines rather than microwave transmission presents challenges not readily overcome the spread of sophisticated but inexpensive encryption systems has also complicated electronic surveillance efforts7 indeed the house intelligence committee has reported that nsa needs radical surgery to adapt to the postcold war environment and has concluded that nsa is in serious trouble8 apprehension about nsa is found among european observers who suspect that us intelligence agencies might be supporting us corporations competing for international businessa suspicion not shared by most us observers because of the complications that would be involved in transferring government intelligence to corporations in

was to be collected incidentally to foreign intelligence collection efforts not for law enforcement purposes or even at the request of law enforcement agencies section 814 of pl 104293 states however that intelligence agencies may collect such information notwithstanding that the law enforcement agency intends to use the information collected for purposes of law enforcement investigation or counterintelligence investigation 11 see stewart baker former general counsel of nsa should spies be cops foreign policy winter 19941995 12 see for instance christopher andrew intelligence and

environment many major us corporations are not wholly usowned and in those cases there would be way to provide sensitive intelligence without revealing it to nonus persons us intelligence agencies do however collect economic intellige nce based on an established requirement to provide information to senior us policymakers regarding unfair or illegal activities of foreign governments and corporations an underlying problem related to current concerns about electronic surveillance for intelligence purposes is the increasing overlap between foreign intelligence and law enforcement concerns9 as result of international banking scandals in the late 1980s procedures were worked out between us intelligence and law enforcement agencies to use information derived from intelligence sources in judicial proceedings in addition terrorism and narcotics trafficking formerly considered law enforcement matters have been elevated to national security concerns thus justifying the employment of intelligence resources such use has required that informatio n be collected and disseminated in accordance with specific laws and regulations that are designed to ensure that defendants rights are protected seeking to clarify statutory authorities the fy1997 intelligence authorization act pl 104293 authorized intelligence agencies including nsa to collect information outside the us about individuals who are not us persons at the request of us law enforcement agencies10 despite strict regulations however some observersand some within intelligence agenciesquestion whether it will ultimately be advisable to introduce into the judicial system information that has been gathered by procedures designed for collection of foreign intelligence information11 international cooperation an issue for many critics has been secret international cooperation in sigint collection and reporting the united states has cooperative intelligence collection arrangements with number of foreign countries the closest are those that emerged during world war ii with the british canadians and other commonwealth countries there have been numerous references to formal agreement signed in 1948 regarding sigint cooperation between the united states and the united kingdom although text has been made public12 given the extensive political and military ties between the two countries the advantages of agreement would include the allocation of tasks and thus considerable savings in expenditures the united states britain canada australia and new zealand shared common security policies in the cold war and continue to cooperate in opposinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20444crs5 13 during floor consideration of the conference report on the intelligence bill representative goss chairman of the permanent select committee on intelligence stated i can report notwithstanding this provision section 309 that the committee has substantial insight into the action of the nsa and the guidance of its legal staff i have thus far reason to believe that the nsa is not scrupulous in following the constitution and the laws concerning its sigint mission congressional record november 9 1999 p h11756rogue states terrorist groups and narcotics smugglers however even close allies do not have identical interests throughout the world and do not share sensitive intelligence across the board congressional reaction responding to concerns expressed about the propriety of nsas operations including echelon in may 1999 the house of representatives adopted an amendment offered by representative barr to the fy2000 intelligence authorization bill hr1555 subsequently enacted as pl 106120 requiring report from the executive branch in both classified and unclassified forms detailing legal standards for the interception of communications when such interception may result in the acquisition of information from communication to or from us persons intentional targeting of communications to or from us persons receipt from nonus sources of information pertaining to communications to or from us persons dissemination of informat ion acquired through interception of communications to or from us persons13 the resulting report the unclassified version of which was made available in late february 2000 reviews legal protections of communications of us persons it notes that in order to conduct electronic surveillance against us person located in the united states statutes require that us intelligence agency must have court order if us person is abroad eo 12333 requires approval by the attorney general the report further notes that while fisa provides the statutory basis for conducting electronic surveillance within the us eo 12333 establishes the overall framework for intelligence activities including electronic surveillance worldwide key principle of the eo it notes is protecting the rights of us persons another is prohibition on us agencies requesting other ie nonus parties to undertake activities that are forbidden by the eo various procedures have been establish to minimize or limit dissemination of information relating to us persons that might be acquired incidentally in otherwise authorized surveillance for instance communications between foreign agents describing activities of us person the report describes but does not enclose various agency regulations that implement fisa and eo 12333 in evaluating the report congress may choose to go beyond the question of whether current laws and regulations are being followed some foreign observers regard any us surveillance efforts with suspicion fearing that intelligence products will be used against their national interests the privacy rights of their citizens or to advance the interests of us firms in competition for international business this view is held even though it ishttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20444crs6 14 tabassum zakaria interviewcai chief says us doesnt spy for firms reuters march 1 2000wellknown that many countries have long undertaken similar efforts nonetheless some argue that electronic surveillance except in narrow courtapproved law enforcement context should not be undertaken by democratic governments responding to media discussions of echelon director of central intelligence george tenet in march 2000 press interview with reuters news service denied that us intelligence agencies spy on foreign firms to give american companies competitive advantage we do not spy on foreign companies for the economic gain of american companies we dont do this its our policy its our regulation we do not do this on the other hand tenet noted if we find that an american company is being robbed cheated and stolen or somebody is bribing and disenfranchising an american company we will go to the secretary of state or the secretary of commerce and say we have this information you figure out how to deal with it14 most observers tend to believe that some electronic surveillance for intelligence collection purposes will be found necessary for national security and law enforcement purposes they argue that in any event laws and regulations involving signals intelligence are based on balance between on one hand perceived requirements for collecting information on important security concerns with on the other the recognized importance of protecting individual privacy and fairness to individuals groups and enterprises in the context of domestic law enforcement such balance exists and is met in large measure through courtsupervis ed legal procedures for undertaking wiretaps and other forms of electronic surveillance observers argue that such protections cannot be readily extended to efforts beyond us borders that affect nonus persons few would support involving the courts in routine and ongoing signals intelligence operations observers supportive of nsa argue that legitimate concerns about the intrusion of electronic surveillance into the communications of us persons as well as the proper use of sigint can be addressed in number of waysby laws and regulations by public hearings and by executive branch and congressional oversight they note that the authority to task intelligence agencies rests ultimately with the national security council that appropriate congressional committees are kept fully and currently informed of collection activities and that congress must authorize and appropriate funds on an annual basis the major issue with regard to sigint they suggest is broadernamely that the widespread dissemination of sophisticated intelligence and expansion of communications are creating signals environment from which warning of armed attacks terrorist activities or narcotics smuggling can be gleaned only with enormous difficulty and greater costs number of observers believe that nsa in particular must be radically restructured if it is to continue to support national security objectivesan effort that will take years and require substantial increase in budgetary authority
