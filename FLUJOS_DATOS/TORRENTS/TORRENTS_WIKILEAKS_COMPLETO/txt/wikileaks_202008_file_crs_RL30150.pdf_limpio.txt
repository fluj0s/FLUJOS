north atlantic treaty organization nato contribute to the alliance in various ways the most significant means by far is through funding in their national defense budgets the deployment of their respective armed forces in support of nato missions over the past decade as the alliance has undertaken enlargement current member countries have been providing bilateral assistance to prospective future members defense analysts point out that the nato allies also contribute to mutual security in many other ways 1 several na to activities however are coordinated and conducted by the alliances headquarters in brussels these operations are directly funded by three common accounts the nato military budget the nato civil budget and the nato curity investment program nsip the funds are maintained by direct contributions from natos member states individual shares of the civil and military budgets remained unchanged for decades while nsip shares were adjusted every few years based upon gross relative domestic product gdp per capita gdp and several other factors in 2005 members negotiated new burdensharing arrangements for all three fundsfor all countries except the united states twice year ministers of nato member countries provide guidance on general use of nato resources but the actual management of the accounts is conducted by various separate committees as their names imply the three funds are responsible for separate but often complementary activities g16g3g22g17g561g5g146g159g146g149g561g4g158g141g144g142g157g561 the nato civil budget supports the alliances brussels headquarters and its international civilian staff which is responsible for policy planning of operations and capabilities liaison with non alliance partner countries and public diplomacy 2 natos international staff is headed by the secretary generals office and consists of civilian employees of member countries often provided to nato on 34 year details among other activities this staff supports the work of the north atlantic council the governing body of the alliance and its more than twodozen committees the civil budget covers standard administrative tasks such as personnel travel communications utilities supplies and furniture and security in addition this budget is used for several program activities including public information civil emergency planning and the work of the science committee the civil budget also has funded the nonmilitary aspects of structures related to enlargement including the partnership for peace pfp program and the euroatlantic partnership council

more than half of this fund is used to pay for operational and maintenance costs of the international military staff its headquarters in mons belgium and subordinate commands in different nato geographical areas this budget also covers the cost of administering the alliances militaryrelated activities and organizations including international military headquarters the airborne early warning

agency the level of the military budget is reviewed nd approved annually by the north atlantic council individual member state contributions to the budget are based on costsharing formula expenses for the various activities funded by the military budget may be split among 25 or 26 members because france does not participate in all military activities the us contribution to natos military budget is

was responsible chiefly for funding military installations and construction projects in may 1993 the functions of the program were changed significantly to reflect the alliances new security policy known since december 1994 as the nato security investment program nsip the funds activities have been steered away from static defense posture appropriate during the cold war toward crisis control

of wide variety of na to support functions including for example command control communications and information hardware and software logistics activities harbors and airfields training installations transportation and storage facilities for equipment fuel and munitions its work is managed by the nato infrastructure committee and individual projects are implemented by host countries or nato agencies or commands because nsip projects may be located in any of the member countries this program has tended to be somewhat more politically sensitive than the other two infrastructure and other nsip projects are decided upon through priority planning proc ess specific projects are generally awarded on the basis of competitive bidding and once completed undergo natocontrolled inspection and auditing according to the us department of defense dod the focus on new nato missions and the resultant redirection of nsip activities have been relatively advantageous for the united states among other benefits change made in may 1993 to the programs funding criteria for facilities construction and restoration all but eliminates nato facility funding for the european allies but continues full support for us requirements at european bases6 nsip also helps fund us storage facilities in europe as well as usbased facilities for american reinforcement forces assigned to nato dod has noted that the united states has benefitted from nato infrastructure support for several military operations including the 1986 air strike on libya desert storm provide comfort deny flight peacekeeping activities in the balkans as well as military operations in afghanistan and training in iraq finally the pentagon notes that us companies have been successful in bidding on nsip contracts in the 1990s nsip funding shortfalls were an issue according to dod congress had substantially reduced the departments budget request and large number of usunique projects could not be considered for nato funding pentagon officials state that in the post911 defense budget environment this has ceased to be problem dod has complained however about prohibitionin place since 2000on spending nsip funds on nato partnership for peace projects in countries that formerly belonged to the soviet union the ban dod argues continues to have considerable negative political consequences for us regional objectives such as the introduction of democratic institutions and free markets 7 like the na to military budget funding of nsip projects is divided among 25 or 26 member states depending upon french participation in 2007 the us share was 2225 which represented slight decrease that resulted from the accession of new member states as well as from increased french contributions 8 the united states provides funds to nsip through the military construction appropriations the us funding requirement for fy2008 was 2074 million however because of 6 million in recoupments from earlier years for projects funded by the

arises from the deployment of their own armed forces for this reason the burdensharing debate in the united states has tended to focus not so much on natos common funds but rather on the extent to which established allies have been restructuring their forces and acquiring new military capabilities that enable them to respond to both na tos traditional article v as well as its new nonarticle v missionsparticularly afghanistanand on the ability and willingness of the newer members to modernize their militaries make them interoperable with alliance standards and develop niche capabilities 10 as noted above the three nato common accounts are funded by contributions from the member states how have these national shares determined in the past the 2001 nato handbook noted that by convention the agreed costsharing formulae which determine each member countrys contributions are deemed to represent each countrys ability to pay however the basis for the formulae applied is as much political as it is economic 11 in may 1998 the us government accountability office gao responding to congressional request issued report on the history and apportionment of na to common funds shares12 according to gao nato cost shares have not been reviewed regularly but have been changed in response to requests from individual member states or to major events such as changes in membership like all nato decisions burden sharing arrangements are based upon members consensus nato has revised relative member contributions based on eventdriven changes the gao cited the following 1 the 1966 french withdrawal from the military command described below 2 the admission of spain in 1982 and the more recent enlargements in 1999 and 2004 for which shares were renegotiated among all members and 3 canadas 1994 unilateral 50 reduction of its nsip contribution for which veral european member countries agreed to defray the cost among themselves in addition to changes caused by specific events the alliance has periodically subjected shares to comprehensive reviews in the early years of na to the alliance agreed to split up members shares by grouping countries according to their economic strength and then assigned members within the different groups identical shares referencing those countries contributions to the united nations in 1952 the three largest member states the united states the united kingdom uk and france each paid 225 of the budget while the other countries were assessed according to their ability to pay ie their re lative gdp in 1955 nato determined that each countrys future contribution would be based on its average past expenditures for the civil and 10 see for example crs report rs21659 natos prague capabilities commitment by carl ek and crs report

shares annually since then relative shares of the civil account have remained unchanged13 the military account was revisited in 1965 when the u k requested review of that budget to take into account changed relative economic conditions among member states the following year france withdrew from the na to military structure and reduced its contributions since made on unilateral ad hoc basis this change was accommodated by prorating shares among the other members the net effect of both the britishrequested review and the partial french pullout was small redistribution of shares of the military budget shares of the nsip account have been examined somewhat more frequently the changes have been made through negotiations but the complete rationales behind the share revisions have not been made public according to gao the alliance s sought to achieve an equitable distribution of nsip cost shares by considering several factors 1 members capacity to pay 2 benefits of use of nsip projects that accrue to individual members 3 economic benefits of construction of nsip projects in member countries 4 noninfrastructural security contributions made by individual countries and 5 various political and economic factors14 in addition the alliance reportedly takes into account the scope and sophistication of member nations defense industries these criteria are not of course fully quantifiable na to has sought to develop such hardand fast objective guidelines but has been unable to achieve consensus therefore gao concluded the setting of cost shares is essentially accomplished through negotiations nsip cost shares were last reviewed and revised in 1990 however in early 2004 the alliances european members agreed to standardize the percentages that each participating nation contributes to the military budget and nsip when burdensharing contributions are negotiated the alliance reportedly has taken into consideration the united states worldwide security responsibilities for example the 2003 us contribution to the nsip budget was 238not too far above germanys 198 but that same year us gdp was 103 trillion while the combined gdp of the other 18 nato allies was 89 trillion if nato common funds assessments were based solely on gdp the us share that year would have been 536 and germanys would have been 98 15 in addition policy analysts long have argued that alliances save money the 2001 nato handbook for example noted that to arrive at meaningful conclusion on the cost of belonging to the alliance each member country would have to factor into the calculation the costs which it would have incurred over time in making provision for its national security independently or through alternative forms of international cooperation16 nonetheless the total size and individual shares of the common funds have been the subject of discussion in recent years prior to the 1999 enlargement analysts estimated the cost of adding 13 when spain joined in 1982 its share was negotiated and the other members shares were prorated accordingly shares were similarly reapportioned after the 1999 and 2004 enlargements 14 although the gao report does not describe these factors 1990 cato institute report identifies several likely variables including numbers of activeduty reinforcement and reserve military personnel and amounts and types of equipment and weapons systems each memberstate contributes and such less quantifiable factors as the member states geographic proximity to the likely points of engagement see nato in the 1990s burden shedding

different threat scenarios and accounting techniques some members of congress expressed concern over these cost projections and were also worried that the united states might be left to shoulder large share of the expenditures they questioned whether existing burdensharing arrangements should continue and suggested that the european allies should be encouraged to assume larger financial share for the security of the continent however nato study estimated that enlargement would require only 15 billion in common funds expenditures over 10 years and dod concurred it was further forecast that the 2004 round of enlargement would cost similar amount with greater benefits to us security in addition the addition of ten new contributors to the nato common funds actually reduced the percentage shares of the established membersincluding the united states 17 in mid2005 after reviewing existing burdensharing arrangements natos senior resource board recommended new formula that seeks to be fair equitable stable and objectively based with an automatic mechanism for regular updates18 the new formula excludes from its calculations the united states which negotiated ceiling for its cost share percentages at the existing rate the allies also agreed that if new members join the alliance us contributions would decline on pro rata basis the new pro rata apportionment will apply to cost shares after the limited us share has been subtracted the military and nsip budgets will be similarly adjusted to account for french non participation the formula will be based on gross national income gni data representing an average of figures using current prices and da ta measuring purchasing power parity both taken from the world banks world development indicators the formula will use twoyear rolling average of each countrys gni to smooth out annual fluctuations the revised cost share plan will be gradually introduced over 10year transition period beginning in january 2006 after additional review na to staff recommended in mid2006 that future burdensharing arrangements take into account several other factors besides gni including nationally provided staffing for critical na to operational activities nato airborne early warning benefits from nsip and other projects and nato staffing levels it was recommended that na to biennially review each nations contributions to specified na to operations over the previous four years and adjust the final share according to those contributions the second session of the 110 th congress will likely review the new burdensharing arrangementsas well as us contributions to the nato budgetsin the context of the defense department and state depa rtment appropriations 17 crs report 97668 nato expansion cost issues by carl ek
