as nancy mceldowney for reasons 14bd for the ambassador or charge summary and action request 1 sbu the department requests action addressees clarify for host governments at the highest possible level the planning process for isaf transition to afghan lead at the provincial level emphasizing that discussion of this issue must not be mischaracterized as plan for the imminent withdrawal of isaf forces in order for provincial transition to occur certain criteria pertaining to security as well as governance and development will have to be met as the president stated on december 1 it is important that we increase our commitments to the mission now in order to create the conditions to begin to draw down international combat forces beginning in mid2011 background 2 c nato is currently developing an annex to the isaf operational plan that describes the process for conditionsbased provincebyprovince transition of afghan responsibility for security nato will discuss the plan including political considerations with the intent of achieving north atlantic council nac approval prior to the january 28 london foreign ministers conference on afghanistan welcoming this plan or progress toward it is key deliverable of the london conference 3 c it is vital that in public messages the transition plan not be confused with an exit plan or timetable isaf is currently in phase 3 stabilization of its fivestage operational plan phase 4 is transition and phase 5 is redeployment culminating in withdrawal transition has at times been erroneously equated with transfer of lead security responsibility tlsr isaf phase 4 transition refers to tangible demonstration of progress in the overall stability and security of afghanistan and afghan ownership and responsibility based on rigorous security governance and development conditions transition will proceed on provincebyprovince basis and be gradual tlsr is an early tactical step in the partnership between afghan national security forces ansf and isaf controlled in theater at the operational level it is part of the ansf development process to encourage and accelerate ansf capability responsibility and ownership not an indication of changes in either ansf capabilities or the security mission 4 c it is important that our allies and partners counter erroneous misunderstanding that international support for the government of afghanistan is wavering and any false expectation of an imminent withdrawal of isaf forces using the london conference to lay out an exit strategy would send the wrong message to the people of afghanistan as well as to allied and partner publics reporting deadline state 00004108 002 of 003 5 sbu the department requests that action addressees report the results of their efforts by front channel cable slugged for eurrpm aaron cope ssrap and scaa by january 17 talking points 6 sbu action addressees should draw on the following points nato is currently developing an annex to the isaf operational plan describing the process for conditionsbased provincebyprovince transition in consultation with the government of afghanistan and other stakeholders as appropriate after discussing the plan and relevant political considerations the north atlantic council aims to adopt the transition plan prior to the january 28 london foreign ministers conference on afghanistan transition is tangible demonstration of progress in the overall stability and security of afghanistan and afghan ownership and responsibility transition will proceed gradually on provincebyprovince basis based on rigorous security governance and development conditions the specific conditions for provincial transition are the focus of ongoing planning processes and have not been finalized transition of individual provinces should be undertaken with extensive consultations among natoisaf the afghan government unama and other key stakeholders and only when it is clear that security governance and development conditions have been met and can be sustained transition is not an exit strategy for isaf although it is an important step toward fulfilling isafs mission isaf will retain supporting enabling and mentoringadvising roles throughout transition international civilians will remain in place and may in fact increase as the international mission is civilianized and as conditions allow the duration of the posttransition international presence will depend on local conditions isaf forces longer required in one province may need to shift to other provinces that are in earlier stages of the transition process affected nations participating in the provinces in which transition is taking place will be consulted regarding any necessary changes in force posture it is important to distinguish transition from transfer of lead security responsibility tlsr which is an early tactical step in the partnership between ansf and isaf whereby isaf forces gradually assume the supporting role and ansf take greater leadership this process is controlled in theater at the operational level it is part of the ansf development process to encourage and accelerate ansf capability responsibility and ownership not an indication of changes in either ansf capabilities or the security mission in the wake of president karzais positive commitments in his november 2009 inaugural address it is particularly important that in publicly discussing transition isaf countries neither imply that the commitment of the international community is wavering nor create unrealistic state 00004108 003 of 003 public expectations of an imminent reduction in isaf forces on the contrary now is the time to reinforce our contributions in afghanistan as president obama stated in his december 1 address in order to create the conditions that will allow us to begin the process of drawing down combat forces in the summer of 2011 welcoming natos progress in developing plan for provincial transition could be one useful deliverable of the january 28 international conference in london we expect the conference also will welcome and pledge support for an afghanled program of reintegration the conference will have broader range of outcomes in governance and development as well as civilian coordination not only security it will provide foreign ministers an important opportunity to welcome goa plans for initiatives on anticorruption subnational governance and economic development and to welcome the announcement of the new srsg the united states believes that the conference also should be able to welcome natos plans to strengthen the mandate for its senior civilian representative while this will not be pledging conference we will welcome any additional civilian or military contributions that allies or partners might announce there at natos defense ministerial meeting on february 45 in istanbul we will encourage nations to clarify previously pledged commitments to ensure that forces deployed in 2010 have an operational impact clinton
