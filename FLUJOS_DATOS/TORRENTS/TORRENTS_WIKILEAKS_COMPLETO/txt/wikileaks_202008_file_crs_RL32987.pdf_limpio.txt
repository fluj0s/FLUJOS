world to meet the debt service costs of the united states large and still growing foreign debt for the united states the longterm growth of real gdp percapita over the last 125 years has revealed remarkable steadiness advancing decade after decade with only modest and temporary variation from trend annual average rate of grow th of 18 overall the limited variability of the rate of us longterm growth despite major changes in economic conditions as well as economic and social policies suggests that us longterm growth may be governed by forces other than typical economic variables and may not be easy to alter with conventional economic policy nevertheless the evidence of some degree of mediumterm variability suggests the possibility of using economic policy to exert some influence it is important to recognize that even relatively small differences in the rate of economic growth will steadily cumulate to have large effects on the scale of improvement in futu re living standards such an improvement would make the burden of future transfers on workers less onerous given supporting social infrastructure that encourages and enables production of goods and services economic theory and evidence make it reasonably clear that countries that have achieved sustained longterm growth such as the united states are those that invest sizable fraction of current income in the accumulation of physical and human capital and have and continue to accumulate large stocks of both as importantly they are also economies that have been able to steadily raise the productivity of these two inputs through steady advance of technical knowledge there are reasons to believe despite its evident economic success that the united states due to varying degrees of market failure may under invest in each of the three determinants of economic growth in theory correcting that under investment through some form of government intervention could lead to an optimal increase in the rate of accumulation of each determinant and through that to an acceleration of the economys rate of economic growth knowing that there is the potential for improving on certain market outcomes is one thing designing economic policies that will efficiently induce these improvements is another thing the information shortcoming about what where and how much to invest with which the policymaker would have to contend will often be substantial and greatly raises the risk that the policy will be so blunt and misdirected that it will generate more economic costs than benefits this report will be updated annually

longterm economic growth is the salient measure of the nations ability to steadily advance its material living standard that living standard advances by increasing the economys capacity to produce goods and services and thereby expanding the range of choices open to society todays level of gross domestic product gdp per person is 15 to 25 times that of person alive in 1895 this degree of improvement in material wellbeing is not only the result of todays far lower cost relative to income of directly comparable products such as an hour of illumination new suit of clothes or chair but also the availability of an array of products that defines our current standard of living such as cd player air conditioning tv and air travel that were not available at any price in 1895 aside from the creation of new products economic growth has also meant dramatic change in what we do agriculture has gone from the principal occupation to that of tiny share of the labor force the automobile has transformed how we mo ve about and where we live higher education has become an endeavor of the many rather than the few hours of work have decreased while hours of leisure have increased the pace of longterm economic growth is likely to be central focus of attention in the decades just ahead as the us economy must confront the need to undertake unprecedentedly large generational transfers of income to pay for the retirement of the huge babyboom generation faster economic growth leads to larger economic pie from which to make such transfers and makes this redistribution less onerous for future workers 1 another element of concern about the future burd on workers grows out of the united states large accumulation of foreign debt stemming from long succession of large trade deficits with net foreign debt that now approaching 3 trillion and could plausibly approach 10 trillion in the decade ahead the united states could expect to have to make annual debt service payments to foreign creditors of 80 to 100 billion this means that significant share of future output growth will be transferred to foreigners and will not be available to improve the future living standard of domestic consumers again the eroding effect of these transfers on future living standards of workers will be less if the annual rate of longterm growth is greater 2 although the trend growth rates of mature indust rial economies have historically not shown great variability even relatively small differences in that growth rate steadily cumulate to have sizeable effects on the scale of improvement in future living standards an economy in which output per capita grows at an average annual pace of 20 will double in size in 34 years while growth at 30 leads to doubling in size in only 24 years put another way beginning at the 2004 level of real gdp per capita of about 37000 at the end of 24 years 3 annual growth rate generates level of per capita real gdp of about 75000 as compared to level of only about 59000 generated by 2 annual growth rate for the same time interval that extra 16000 confers substantial broadening of economic choices and the ability to achieve any given spectrum of economic and social goals with less sacrifice 1 see crs report rl31498 social security reform economic issues by jane g gravelle and marc labonte 2 see crs report rl31032 the us trade deficit causes

is seldom the explicit interest of economic policy nevertheless many policies directed at more immediate goals are likely to have implications for the speed of economic growth tax policy labor market policy science and technology policy education policy budget policy as well as legal and regulatory policy can all have effects on the rate of economic growth and the level of future income if more explicit concern with the rate of longterm growth is thoug ht appropriate by policy makers then it will be important to understand what the salient determ inants of longterm growth are whether the decisions of economic agents in private markets lead to economically optimal allocation of resources to each determinate how could economic policy most successfully correct for particular market failure and what admixture of particular economic policies are likely to offer the best chance of achieving an optimal rate of improvement in future living standards

that should be understood before proceeding first longterm growth refers to an economy increasing its productive capacity or what is usually called potential output this is somewhat distinct from shortrun changes in economic activity over the course of the business cycle such as recovery from recession the shortterm goal is to have the economy operate near potential output while the longterm goal is to steadily increase potential output shortterm performance is certainly going to have an effect on longterm economic performance but there will also be important differences in the forces governing each as well as different policy implications presented by each for example in the short run in an economy operating below potential output due to slack demand monetary and fiscal policy can stimulate aggregate demand accelerate economic growth and push an economy towards potential output but these policies may have little impact on the rate at which potential output expands the distinct forces that govern the growth of potential outputor aggregate supplyare the concern of this report second analysis of longterm growth focuses on the growth of per capita output most often measured as real or inflation adjusted gdp divided by the nations population as more gdp per capita will likely be the essential requirement for higher standard of living it is possible to increase real gdp per capita by increasing the percentage of the population in the labor force or the average hours worked by the labor force but both of these actions are bounded in that you can only increase the labor force up to the size of the population and realistically the upper bound will be well short of that and increase the average hours of work up to 24 hours day and again realistically the upper bound will be well short of that therefore these are not actions that can cause sustained increase in the rate of longterm growth this is probably particularly true for mature economy such as the united states where these labor force parameters tend to be relatively stable more fundamentally one can question whether increases in percapita gdp by such means represents true rise in the standard of living as we will see focus on percapita output points to critical requirement for longterm growth and rising standard of livingincreased efficiency or productivity that is doing things that enable each worker to steadily produce more in any given time period the standard measure of economic growthinc reased real gdppopulationdoes not always function as precise gauge of changes in economic welfare many valuable things are simply not measured in gdp for example leisure time child rearing and volunteer work all contribute to our wellbeing but they are not reflected in gdp therefore if parents decided to work fewer

fall but general wellbeing could increase rather than fall also many negative things can occur with economic growth that subtract from our wellbeing but are not counted as decrements in measures of real gdp environmental damage increased income inequality decreased quality of public education or falling public health decrease economic wellbeing but do not necessarily result in corresponding reduction of measured gdp conversely there are things measured in gdp such as more prisons more locks on doors and expenditures to protect against terrorism that do not easily correlate with rising living standard nevertheless while greater gdp does not assure higher living standard it provides the potential means for achieving greater wellbeing by making the various elements of how we choose to define that wellbeing more affordable more affordable in economics is essentially reduction in the number and degree of tradeoffs confronted in economic life if we choose to work fewer hours or reduce environmental damage then we can do so with less sacrifice of other things if gdp is greater 3 another important economic distinction between gr owth and economic welfare is that societys economic objective is not likely to be reaching the maximum rate of growth that is possible but rather achieving the optimal rate of growth that economic policy has the ability to accelerate the rate of longterm growth does not necessarily mean that it should because faster future growth usually means that the economy must divert resources from the production of goods for current consumption and toward growthgenerating activities the growth rate consistent with an optimal balance between the level of current consumption and the raised level of future consumption will likely be far short of the greatest possible rate superfast growth would have little appeal if the fruits of that achievement are never consumed because they must be continuously diverted to the investment needed to sustain that growth rate private economic agents will make decisions in the market place that establish relative valuation of current versus future output but if there is some degree of market failure this outcome will not be the optimal one and economic policy can potentially improve on the market outcome g22g145g142g561g9g155g152g160g157g145g561g20g142g140g152g155g141g561 sustained economic growth anywhere is relatively recent historical phenomenon while our knowledge is imperfect before 1500 there is record of any increase in output per capita anywhere in the world for millennia and only after 1800 is there consistent evidence of sizeable sustained increases in living standards across the globe between 1800 and 1900 output per capita in the industrializing economies probably grew on average at 10 per year between 1900 and 2000 that rate of growth likely accelerated to about 20 this may seem to be modest pace but its was sharp break from the stagnation and poverty that had prevailed for centuries before and because it was sustained rate of increase generating cumulative gains it was 3 for more discussion on the task of measuring gdp see n gregory mankiw principles of economics fort

unprecedented speed and ultimately transform the world economy4 we also observe over the last 100year span that the rates of economic growth across the then emerging industrial nations were fairly tightly clustered around this 20 pace at the high end was japan with an annual rate of growth averaging about 27 while at the low end was great britain with an annual growth rate averaging 14 the united states which grew at 18 average annual rate was slightly below average in the 25 year subperiod of 19802004 this clustering has become tighter and the relative speed ranking has also changed among the major advanced industrial economies the united kingdom grew fastest at 23 japans growth decelerated to 20 us growth accelerated to 20 and the major european economies germany france italy and the netherlands grew relatively slower with each achieving 16 pace in general this convergence of growth paths among the industrial economies has meant that the differences in average growth rates of percapita output are typically only few tenths of percentage point 5 however over the longrun few percentage points more will make substantial difference in the cumulative gain in the nations material standard of living for the united states the longterm growth of real gdp per capita over the last 125 years has revealed remarkable steadiness advancing decade after decade with only modest and temporary variation from the observed 18 annual rate of increase this constancy is not absolute however there has been shortrun variability caused by the business cycle but on balance these shortrun effects do not deflect the underlying longterm trend there has also been some mediumterm variability however that demarcates some distinct subperiods for us economic growth growth decelerated to 14 pace in the 19291950 period slowdown primarily reflecting the large and pervasive crippling effects of the great depression on economic activity throughout the 1930s from 1950 to 1973 economic growth accelerated to an above trend average annual pace of 21 as the united states and the world experienced strong economic rebound after wwii the most pronounced deviation from the longterm trend occurred from 1973 to 1995 with the growth rate of percapita gdp slowing to 06 other industrial economies also experienced similar or larger decelerations of economic growth unlike the period of the great depression this slowdown was not matter of persistent slack demand for the economy was most often operating at capacity 6 rather the us economys productive capacity was just expanding at much slower rate while some slowing from the post war boom could be expected this degree of dece leration went well below the longterm trend and why it did so remains largely an economic mystery since 1995 the speed of us economic growth accelerated once again reaching pace of 23 somewhat above the trend rate for the complete postworld war ii period this aboveaverage rate of growth is attributable to the economic boom of the late 1990s over the second half of this decade growth was somewhat below the longterm trend largely due to the effects of the 2001 recession 7 4 j bradford delong

over such long time period despite major changes in economic conditions as well as economic and social polices suggests that us longterm growth may be governed by forces other than typical economic variables and may not be easy to deliberately alter with conventional economic policies nevertheless the evidence of some degree of mediumterm variability suggests the possibility of using economic policy to exert some influence the reasons for those mediumterm decelerations and accelerations may reveal the dos and donts of accelerating economic growth in the next section the report examines the

result of increasing the productive power of workers causing over time an increase in the amount of goods and services the average worker can produce per hour or what is most often called increased productivity economists have isolated series of factors which through accumulation and interaction are thought to play critical roles for generating steady increases in productivity and sustained longterm growth three factors physical capital human capital and technological knowledge are seen playing direct role in magnifying the workers productivity other factors of importance play more indirect role these include the laws government policies and institutions that come together to create growth infrastructure that encourages enables and coordinates the economic behavior that causes steady accumulation of physical capital human capital and technical knowledge wh ich in turn together generate sustained long term growth

more still with backhoe than shovel such tools that leverage the productive power of the average worker the economist calls physical capital and the process of providing the average worker with more powerful tools is termed capital deepening to accomplish capital deepening an economy must divert some resources from producing goods for current consumption to the production of capital goods such as factories machine tools computers or transportation equipm ent in themselves capital goods do nothing to satisfy current wants and needs but their use will expand the economys capacity to produce goods in the future deferral of current consumption is the economic cost of increasing consumption in the future the calculation that economic agents have made that warrants incurring this cost is that what is given up today is more than compensated for by what is gained tomorrow this use of current resources for capital deepening is what the economist defines as investment high rates of investment lead to faster accumulation of the stock of physical capital and that ultimately translates into more rapid expansion of the economys productive capacity the necessary economic corollary to investment is saving diverting share of current income from current consumption therefore economies with high rates of investment will also tend to have

from use the saving of other nations there does not have to be an exact concordance of domestic saving and investment but over the long run the two do tend to be highly correlated the importance of investment for economic growth is suggested by the very strong historical correlation in cross country data between rates of investment as share of gdp and rates of economic growth for example over the last 50 years countries such as japan singapore and south korea which have had high saving rates 2 5 to 35 shares of gdp have also had high growth rates 5 to 7 annual rates of increase in percapita gdp on the other hand countries such as rwanda bangladesh and india with low investment rates 5 to 15 shares of gdp have also had low growth rates 1 to 15 annual rates of increase in percapita gdp the united states rate of investment averaged about 20 of gdp over this 50 year span and as already noted percapita gdp grew at an average annual rate of nearly 2 per annum however in recent years the us investment rate has fallen to about 15 of real gdp while correlation does not necessarily indicate causation and the causation could run from growth to investment most economists would judge that there is strong positive linkage between investment capital deepening and economic growth interestingly for most of the postwar period economic analysis of the sources of us economic growth attributed relatively modest contribution to capital deepening estimates at that time indicated that only 10 to 15 of the observed growth rate was the consequence of the accumulation of physical capital 8 moreover in the standard theoretical model used to analyze economic growth it was not possible to sustain an acceleration of the longterm growth rate through capital deepening alone9 in the standard theory of economic growth the force that steadily dissipates physical capitals impact on longterm growth is diminishing returns successive additions to the stock of physical capital yield steadily smaller increases in worker productivity to the point where there will be little growthboosting effect remaining capital deepening can temporarily boost the rate of productivity and raise the level of income but it cannot permanently increase the rate at which they grow this temporary acceleration of growth would most likely stretch out over period of many years and it would of course leave the economy at higher level of income than would have otherwise occurred in early formulations of this standard model of economic growth however this temporary boost was not thought to be particularly large similarly diminishing returns to capital also help explain why many other economies grew much faster than the united states over the last 50 years whether recovering from the devastation of world war ii such as japan and germany or just beginning the transition to an industrial economy such as korea and singapore the undert aking of process of capital deepening was occurring to far smaller existing stock of capital than that of the united states as result it was incurring little or attenuation of productivity growth because of diminishing returns so that equalsized rates of investment had larger impact on worker productivity in these capitalpoor countries then they did on the capitalrich economy 10 therefore slower growing us 8 edward denison

faster growing economies rather it was just moving at the slower pace co nsistent with its much larger stock of physical capital in the last decade and half there has been large increase in research on the question of what propels longterm economic growth one of the impor tant outcomes of these recent explorations has been sizeable upgrading of the estimated effect of capital deepening on the longterm growth rate of the us economy that effect is now judged to be near 50 of the observed growth rate of output 11 this boost in the estimate of the productive contribution of physical capital reflects two changes in thinking one an increase in the estimates of physical capitals relative importance in the productive process which translates into any given increase in the size of the capital stock causing larger initial impact on output and two slowing down of the rate of dissipation of that initial impact by the advance of diminishing returns due to an output boosting complementarity effect from associated increases in human capital eg new skills12 the likely importance of complementarity effects between the individual determinants of economic growth points to the importance of their overall pattern of accumulation there is likely to be pattern of joint accumulation that generates the greatest boost to output physical capital is not only important in its own right but new technology will often only be applied to the production process embodied in new capital equipment that new machine embodying the new technology will be most efficiently used if workers also have the boost in skills needed for its effective operation similarly some portion of improvements in human capital will occur through process of learning by doing as workers have access to the new physical capital embodying the new technology13 also the accumulation of physical capital embodying new technology may induce further advances in technical knowledge not likely to be captured by the initiating investor this type of external benefit may manifest as learning by observing effect as initial investors incur the costs of figuring out the best organizational patter ns for using the new technology and subsequent investors replicate these patterns at much lower cost for example mass production was initiated and perfected by few firms but once the productive benefits of this new process were clearly evident it was quickly adopted by other firms bringing sizeable economic benefits to the wider economy that were not included in the initiating investors profitloss calculation at the microeconomic level there is evidence in the case of adoption of new information technology it technology that few firms will undertake significant reorganization and make large initial investments in physical capital to take advantage of the new technology once they have settled on form that successfully incorporates that technology in their operation it will then be replicated in far less costly

learning by using effect whereby the propagation of new technology embodied in new investment goods generates burgeoning of derivative technological advances good example of this effect occurred with the widespread diffusion of electrical power into american indus try bringing with it an expanding opportunity for learning and experimentation with this new technology through which further technological advances such as the small electric motor were developed14 in many economies this correlation has been found to be particularly strong for investment in machinery and equipment15 the probable complementarity of physical capital with human capital and technological knowledge in the production process has possible implications for economic policy because portion the total economic benefits of investment in physical capital are spillovers to other firms that will not be taken into the profitloss calculation of the potential investor there is likelihood that the actions of private investors will from societys point of view lead to under investment in acquired capital when there is such divergence between the social and private rate of return from an action there is possibility that public policy can be used to affect better economic outcome than what the private market alone would achieve specific policy responses are discussed in later section of the report g10g158g150g138g151g561g5g138g153g146g157g138g149g561 workers productivity can also be magnified by increasing the knowledge and skills he brings to the job or as economists call it through increases in the stock of human capital in terms of the example used in the previous section giving worker backhoe who previously only had shovel will not boost the workers output until she has also acquired the skills needed to operate the enhanced physical capital human capital is most often augmented through education not only formal education such as grade school high school and college but also onthejob training both formal and informal as such human capital investment is analytically distinct from increased technical knowledge human capital refers to the various abilities that allow the worker to understand and apply new productive knowledge technical knowledge can be likened to the books in the library and human capital to the ability to read and understand what is in those books the invention of calculus added to the stock of technical knowledge whereas taking calculus course adds to the stock of human capital other than its direct application to the production of goods and services increases in human capital in the form of researchers scientists and engineers will also likely influence the creation of technological knowledge and exert an indirect influence on the growth of worker productivity human capital is the same as physical capital in that it is also produced by diverting resources students teachers schools and libraries from the production of goods for current consumption therefore the accumulation of human capital is also form of investment deferral of current 14 warren devine from shafts to wires historical perspectives on electrification explorations in

capital the accumulation of human capital will be subject to diminishing returns the magnitude of human capital investment is most often measured by years of educational attainment by that standard the united states ov er the last 125 years has undertaken substantial investments in human capital for the entire population the educational attainment for members of the population who had completed their education increased by 67 years for cohorts born between 1876 and 1975 16 the rate of increase in educational attainment was fastest from 1875 through 1951 with gain of 62 years however there was sizeable slowing of this rate of increase over the next 24 years with total gain in this recent period of only about 04 years the 75year period of rapid increase in educational attainment was broadly reflective of the nations steadily rising commitment of resources beginning in the 19th century to mass education this occurred first at the elementary grade levels and subsequently at the high school level leading to bettereducated young cohorts replacing less welleducated older cohorts as time passed for the purpose of accounting for economic growth however the more appropriate measure of human capital growth is the educational attainment of the labor force trends in the educational attainment of the labor force differ from those of the total population because of differences in the size of age cohorts and differences in the labor participation rates by age and sex however data on educational attainment of the us labor for ce are available only from 1940 those data reveal rapid gain in the educational attainment of the labor force from 1940 to 1980 followed by substantial slowing of the rate of increase from 1980 to 2000 average years of schooling increased 44 yearsrising from nine years to 134 years in 1940 70 of the labor force had less than high school education and less than 6 had college degree in 2000 only 11 had less than high school education and 28 had college degree increases in college education have been an important source of the rise of educational attainment in recent decades nevertheless the two decades since 1980 saw the slowest gains in educational attainment of the labor force of any 20 year interval increases in educational attainment of the average worker for the time period 1915 to 2000 is estimated to have directly contributed on average about 035 per year to the rate of growth of per capita real output or about 20 of the 18 trend growth rate of percapita output 17 this contribution however does not include any estimate of the hardtocalculate indirect benefits that the growth of educational attainment might have had on the growth of new technology and through that on productivity in contrast to physical capital large proportion of human capital accumulation in the us economy has been the result of some form of government subsidized schooling this reflects an explicit or implicit belief that human capital investments would be under supplied by the private market the chief economic rationale for public provision of education is that capital market 16 this discussion of educational attainment the

income families would cause suboptimal investment in many types of human capital it can also be also argued that education generates external benefits that are not going to be tallied in the rateofreturn calculation of the private investor leading to an undervaluation of the rate of return to education and from societys viewpoin t an under investment in human capital these external benefits could include facilitation of the exchange in ideas expansion of opportunities for imitation and learning by doing another potentially important externality associated with human capital investment was discussed in the previous section on physical capitalcomplementarity in the production process in this case it is result of investments in human capital having positive effects on the investment of physical capital for example an entrepreneur may not be willing to make substantial investment in physical capital unless there is also sufficiently large pool of skilled labor for the new enterprise to draw upon again the implication is that the private market by itself is likely to under invest in education and human capital accumulation despite ongoing large public investments in educat ion could there still be significant degree of market failure that causes the us economy to under invest in human capital given the historical importance of education in generating us longterm economic growth it is reasonable to be concerned that the recent slowing of the growth of educational attainment may undercut the united states ability to sustain the pace of economic growth in the future also evidence of very high rates of return to specific types of education and education support programs for subgroups of the population suggest that it may still be possible to boost the rate of economic growth through further corrective public policy initiatives in these areas of human capital accumulation

produce desired goods and services whether the growing of wheat the manufacture of automobiles or the development of new dr ug the steady improvement of technology over time by allowing the production of more and better output from any given endowment of economic resources is the engine that drives longterm growth and sustains improvement in the nations economic wellbeing in the analytical framework of the most widely accepted models of economic growth advancing technological knowledge plays the critical role of pushing back the onset of the diminishing returns that would otherwise steadily reduce over time the productivityraising and growth sustaining ability of successive additions to th economys stocks of physical and human capital the magnitude of the contribution of advances in technological knowledge to longterm economic growth has recently become matter of some debate among economists the issue is not whether steady improvement in technologic knowledge is what ultimately sustains long term growth but rather the size of its effect and what factors determine that improvement the seminal postwar literature on growth generally attributed about 75 of the growth in output per labor hour to technical progress in these studies technical knowledge and its output impact were not estimated directly but derived as residual that remained after the easiertomeasure contributions of physical and human capital to economic growth were estimated it was recognized that this residual was probably also picking up the contributions to output of other unmeasured forces such as resource reallocation economies of scale and unmeasured capital

to be the most important force generating us economic growth18 moreover from the standpoint of economic policy this model of economic growth indicated that technical progress was determined by extraeconomic forces such as the progress of science demographic patterns and the existence of cultural attitudes and socioeconomic institutions that govern incentives to save and invest in general these are determinants of technical progress and longterm growth that are unlikely to be significantly influenced by economic policy more recent research has changed this picture somewhat as already noted above more recent investigations have led to an increase in the estimated contribution to economic growth attributable to both the accumulation of physical and human capital and in turn commensurate reduction of the estimated size of technological knowledges contribution it is still very important however as it likely accounts for 40 to 50 of the rate of growth of real gdp per worker hour recent research on economic growth has also taken closer look at the likely determinants of technical progress looking to explain this phenomenon as the consequence of purposeful economic behavior influenced by typical notions of risk and reward and perhaps open to influence by economic policy the various versions of these new models are categorized under the heading endogeneous growth theories this simply means that the advance of technical progress is explained by the theory and not just taken as an unexplained external force 19 it would be inaccurate to say that endogenous growth theories have supplanted the standard model but they have induced more economically realistic rendering of the very important process of accumulating stock of technical knowledge the recent economic analysis of advancing technological knowledge proceeds very much like the analysis of physical and human capital at any point in time the economy possesses given stock of technological knowledge by continually adding to that stock it continually expands the productive potential of the economy that is generates sustained longterm economic growth these actions taken to add to the stock of productive knowledge are also form of investment in that the accumulation only occurs by channeling some of societys scarce productive resources away from the current production of final goods and services scientists engineers research facilities and equipment are scarce productive resources that could otherwise have been used for the current production of final goods and services and are the opportunity cost of producing technological advance and sustaining longterm econom ic growth it is the prospect of future gain that will exceed these costs that drives the accumulation of technical knowledge in market economy measuring the stock of technological knowledge is problematic undertaking however more tractable task is an accounting of the flow of endeav ors that most likely lead to additions to that stock factors thought indicative of investment in technological knowledge that can be measured include changes in the number and share of scientists and engineers in the labor force

industrial economies has demonstrated over the last century rising commitment of resources to creating technical knowledge but there is some evidence of waning of some elements of these efforts in recent years the most basic input to the production of knowledge is the number of heads devoted to the task more thinkers tend to generate more ideas the number of scientists and engineers engaged in rd in the united states has increased dramatically from 1950 to 1990 the number grew from less than 200000 to nearly 1000000 or an increase from about 025 of the labor force to nearly 075 more comprehensive indicator of the resource commitment to the production of technical knowledge is economywide expenditures on rd rd expenditures have also steadily increased rising from about 25 billion in 1953 to 312 billion in 2004 as share of gdp however rd expenditures have not shown sustained upward trend rising from about 14 in 1953 to peak value of nearly 29 in 1964 but since then fluctuating around 25 of gdp standing at 27 of gdp in 2004 for comparison rd expenditures as percentage of gdp in the european union was 19 in japan it was 31 and it was highest in isreal at 49 the steadiness of this share indicates that the united states has not increased the intensity of its research efforts in step with the size of the economy this steadiness also masks significant change in the source of funding for rd industry share has risen and that of government has fallen this change likely has implications for the type of research being funded and the social return forthcoming from the investment 20 there is an imperfect understanding of the nature of the translation from resource inputs to knowledge creation and then output growth making evaluation of the economic significance of these efforts imprecise and generally qualitative in nature for example while economists may be reasonably confident that here is positive causal relationship running from the level of resource commitment in rd to the rate of advance in technical knowledge the exact character of the transformation is not known it is known however that the inherent characte ristics of knowledge create substantial bias against marketdriven behavior investing enough in its creation improving technology is largely process of generating new ideas to the extent that new ideas lead to profitable outcomes and those profits can be secured by private firm or individual the market economy will generate new ideas and foster technological change an inherent attribute of ideas however is that they are nonrival as my using an idea does not preclude someone else from using it further ideas often have the attribute of limited excludability meaning the owner of the idea will find it difficult or impossible to collect fee from others who benefit from it these attributes cause divergence of private benefit and social benefit meaning what the creator of the idea can expect to gain less than what the overall economy can expect to gain in this situation as already observed with investment in physical and human capital we would expect the rateofreturn calculation that guides the investment in idea production decision of the private investor to undervalue projects true benefits and bring forth less than the socially desirable level of rd effort 20 data on science related employment and

likely subject to significant degree of market failure this will usually mean that it is an activity that may warrant some level of government support if it is to be done on socially optimal scale

determine the pace of mediumterm and longterm economic growth they are not by themselves sufficient to assure that an economy will be on path of sustained improvement in economic wellbeing that outcome will also likely be the consequence of the existence of an interlaced group of conditions and attributes that form an infrastructure for growth that enables and encourages the forward looking acts of accumulation and invention that pr opel economic growth this infrastructure is comprised of laws government policies socioeconomic institutions and cultural attitudes that are conducive to the entrepreneurial activity that generates sustained longterm economic growth 21 economic history provides examples of the critical role of the growth infrastructure in the fourteenth century china stood far ahead of europe in its inventiveness accumulation of technical knowledge and capacity for the accumulation of physical and human capital yet by the sixteenth century it was western europe that was set to initiate the industrial revolution and china had lapsed into state of economic stagnation while there is disagreement about the complete explanation for chinas failure to sustain longterm growth economic historians see key factor being the emergence in the ming dynasty that had come to rule in this period of general lack of institutional support for enterprising behavior the admixture of large controlling bureaucracy the absence of political opposition and the ming rulers preference for stability over surprise were likely inimical to economic growth 22 more recent example of the adverse effect of an unsupportive growth infrastructure is the case of argentina at the end of the 19th century argentina had one of the worlds highest levels of per capita income but by the end of the twentieth centur it had fallen to less than half that of the united states again the decline is thought to be in part the consequence of government policies that discouraged investment and invention and undermined economic growth examples of the obverse growth miracles rather then growth disasters can also be cited the biggest example of the favorable interaction of capital and knowledge accumulation with the concurrent development of an growthenabling in frastructure is postworld war ii japan that country had been an industrializing economy since the 1870s but its rate of growth of percapita output had been better than moderate in this prewar period with per capita output never surpassing 25 of the us level after the war however the initiation of significant institutional reforms improved that economys growth infrastructure and was likely major reason for the dramatic acceleration in the pace of japanese economic growth over the next 40 years far outpacing that of the united states and increasing japans percapita income to nearly 70 of that of the united states other east asian economies such as south korea singapore and hong kong are more recent examples of the positive influence of well conceived growth infrastructure on longterm growth 21 for more extensive discussion of growth supporting infrastructure see charles i jones

success in general and achieving sustained economic growth in particular is the market system of markets is social mechanism widely revealed to greatly facilitate making the basic economic decisions all societies face deciding what to produce including decisi ons about investment in physical capital human capital and technological knowledge deciding how to produce it and deciding how to distribute what is produced at root markets are an information gathering and dissemination system that directs and coordinates the actions of myriad economic decision makers with great efficiency leading to outcomes that are consistent with maximum econom ic welfare the former soviet union is clear example of the economic inefficiency and poor economic performance of nonmarket economy it was certainly able to accumulate capital and generate some measure of economic growth but in general the outcomes were well short of any reasonable reckoning of steadily rising living standard for the average citizen of course the poor performance of the soviet economy was an important reason for the ultimate collapse of the communist regime there 23 the discussion above has implied that government is likely to be an institution with potentially strong influence good or bad on the structure and operation of an economys growth infrastructure and through that an influence good or bad on longterm economic growth the positive role of government is likely to involve matters of prescription as well as proscription while there is single template for success many economic historians think that when governments create an infrastructure that on ba lance encourages production and investment economic growth occurs on the other hand if government on balance encourages diversion economic growth is imperiled investors will not invest if there is not reasonable confidence that the returns on that investment will be theirs and not diverted to others by government government as the maker and enforcer of laws can militate against the corrosive effects on economic incentives of corruption bribery fraud and theft function of law of central importance for all economic transactions is the establishment of property rights and the conditions of their transfer from one economic agent to another this is of importance not just for real property but also intellectual property as we know new ideas are the engine of longterm growth but due to nonexcludability the social return will often be greater then the return to the creator of the idea patent laws and copyright laws serve to bring the private return closer to the social return and thus encourage idea creation modern government can also contribute to the growth infrastructure through the pursuit of macroeconomic stability inflation by essentially raising the noise to signal ratio in price information degrades the markets ability to efficiently allocate economic resources including those that determine the pace of economic growth recession and depression deflate the incentives for investment and other forwardlook ing economic activity while the swings of the business cycle are unlikely to be avoided macroeconomic policy can modulate its amplitude and minimize its potential negative effects on economic growth the problem of the business cycle reminds us that markets do not always function perfectly that there will be instances of market failure as was discussed above markets can fail at the microeconomic level physical capital human capital and technological knowledge can all have 23 for fuller discussion of the

limited excludability so that the social benefit of investment in these factors of product ion may exceed the private benefit ie return to the investor in this circumstance the market will not accurately price these factors and there will be tendency for the acts of economic agents in the markets to lead to an under allocation of resources to these endeavors therefore an important aspect of governments role in the operation of growth infrastructure would be to forestall or compensate for such market failures of course the practical task facing government in correcting for market failure is likely formidable because the properties that prevent accurate pricing by the market will also likely mean that government policy makers will find it difficult to accurately target the source of the market failure and accurately gauge the extent of the under allocation the risk in large highly interdependent market system is that an inaccurate or poorly calibrated attempt by government policy to correct for market failure in one area may cause more costly distortions in an other area governments tasks extend beyond promoting longterm economic growth of course but the other things government does are often likely to have some economic repercussion taxation regulation operation of the legal system social safetynet programs and national defense all represent some use of resources that otherwise could be directly applied to investment and economic growth these are actions that may tend to lower economic growth but also raise overall welfare of citizens issues of importance for longterm growth due to such activities are likely to be the magnitude of the diversion and the degree of neutrality of the diversion on economic decision making particularity the decisions to save and invest 24 g16g138g157g158g155g138g149g561g20g142g156g152g158g155g140g142g156g561g138g151g141g561g157g145g142g561g14g146g150g146g157g156g561g157g152g561g9g155g152g160g157g145g561 does depletion of supplies of exhaustible natural resources place limit on economic growth this has been recurring critique of the econom ists view of seemingly unlimited upward path for living standards while it is possibility economists see it as an improbable event despite strong economic growth for more then century most commodity prices adjusted for inflation have not risen and many have fallen suggesting that supplies of most commodities are at least keeping up with demand and preventing any increase in relative scarcity of commodities part of the reason for this has been the steady discovery of new reserves of many natural resources finding new reserves however is likely to be bounded process that cannot be relied upon to increase the supply of particular natural resources forever there have been other important offsets to resource scarcity however the form of many of the advances in technical knowledge are innovations in machines and methods that eliminate or greatly reduce the need in the productive process for commodities that have grown in relative scarcity plastic replaced tin in containers fiber optic cable replaced copper and more fuel efficient engines replaced gas guzzlers these are cases where market incentives have likely induced advances in technical knowledge as the re lative scarcity of natural resource increases and its market price rises so does the economic incentive to find less costly alternatives current example is the sharp increase in the use of hybrid automobiles in response to rising gas prices one cannot guarantee that technical knowledge will always be able to forestall running out of commodities but the record so far has been very good 24 see stilitz op cit chapter 1 for more discussion of the economic roles of government

resources is economies of scale in many instances productive processes exhibit increasing returns to scale as output rises there is less than proportionate increase in the use of inputs so with economic growth the resource intensity of output falls causing slowing of the drain on commodity supplies historically for the united states economies of scale have contributed around 10 to output growth again what was true in the past need not carry into the future but the record cannot be ignored either markets can also take into account considerations of future resource needs and allocate resources efficiently between the present and the future if the owner of resource anticipates that rising scarcity will push its price much higher in the future then he could hold those resources for sale at that future date thus the use of some of todays supplies of resources gets pushed forward in time the market is making provision for the futures need for this resource of course looking into the future is task filled with uncertainty nd it is possible for market failure to occur it is unclear however that government intervention in this case would do better job of predicting future resource needs

understanding what determines longterm econom ic growth does not necessarily mean that economic policy should be used to affect it that faster economic growth is possible does not necessarily mean it is desirable there is always strong presumption in the efficacy of the market to get things right including the rate of investment in physical capital human capital and technological knowledge market failure can occur however when goods have attributes that preclude market prices from fully reflecting the economic value of an activity if market failure is present economic policy can in theory be used to improve on the market outcome and raise economic welfare in thinking about using economic policy to overcome some form of market failure it is important to recognize there will often be distinction between market failures economic relevance and its policy relevance economic analysis may indicate that significant market failure is occurring and its correction could generate large economic returns this however does not mean that it will be particularly easy or even possible to craft policy to correct for the market failure without also causing distortions and other inefficiencies that will lead to the policy generating more economic cost than economic benefit the often incomplete information about the market failures precise location extent and degree of interconnection with other economic activities elevates the risk of the policy creating more inefficiency than efficiency and doing more economic harm than good 25 in the preceding section of the report on the determinants of economic growth economic theory and evidence established reasons to suspect that due to various forms and degrees of market failure the us economy under invests in physical capital human capital and technical knowledge therefore the potential likely exists for various forms of economic policy by correcting or compensating for these market failures to accelerate the rate of economic growth and boost future living standards in the cases of physical and human capital economic analysis 25 for further discussion of market failure and the public policy response to

but it would endure long enough to still lead to significant permanent increase in the level of gdp most economists would agree that the engine of longterm economic growth the force that sustains rising living standard decade after decade generation after generation is the production of new ideas or what this report has subsumed under the term technical knowledge there is less agreement over what governs the rate of ad vance of technical knowledge and how it might be influenced by economic policy some would argue that the level of resource commitment to rd is an important determinant of the longterm growth rate and also an activity where greater degree of public support is warranted on the other hand the acceleration of economic growth commencing in the last half of the 1990s occurred without any increase in rd intensity also the marked historical stability of the us longterm growth rate of real per capita gdp at 18 average annual rate for more than 125 years despite significant changes in broad array of economic circumstances and policies over this long time span suggests to others that the generation of technical knowledge and in turn the longterm growth rate may be propelled by deeply embedded social forces that are not likely to be manipulated by economic policy of course if boost in rd activity only leads to temporary mediumterm increase in the pace of economic growth it will still have beneficial effect on future living standards as regards the invariability of the longterm growth rate it is also true that the united states has never really pursued welldefined and orchestrated longterm growth policy the closest approximation was the 1950s and 1960s when the confluence of high rates of investment in physical capital human capital and technical knowledge was also period when economic growth was significantly above trend even here it is hard to isolate specific economic policies that contributed to this higher rate of growth we do observe in this period however rising government commitment to rd spending although sizable share of this rd was for defense related programs it was also time of increased government support for higher education through the gi bill and other programs there were also periodic attempts to use the tax code to encourage business investment in physical capital it was also period when maintaining economic stability became central task of government the remainder of this section will examine specific economic polices to boost investment in the three principal direct determinants of economic growth and in turn accelerate economic growth

last 25 years as recently as 1998 the us saving rate was 183 but it had fallen to 135 by 2005 other advanced industrial economies typically have saving rate in the 20 to 25 range the economys overall saving rate is the confluence of saving undertaken by businesses households and government but only the last two have been the source of the fall of the overall saving rate the government saving rate in the united states has seen the biggest change in recent years moving down from 44 in 2000 to 06 in 2005 this change is consequence of the federal government budget swinging from surplus to deficit in this period the least understood change in saving behavior is the precipitous fall of the household saving rate down from around 7 of gdp in the 1970s and 1980 to below zero today 26 the fall of the household saving rate has been the object of much economic research but the reasons for the decline remain problematic single theory can fully account for the phenomenon but three have considerable plausibility first capital gains on real estate stocks and other investments particularly in the 1990s have greatly increased household wealth economic theory predicts that rise in wealth can reduce the need to save and increases the tendency to spend second increased government outlays for medicare and social security transfer income from relatively high saving segment of the population to relatively lowsaving segment third more streamlined credit market vehicles such as credit cards and home equity loans have removed constraints on household liquidity and prompted increased spending and reduced saving the fundamental issue of course is whether the dec line of the saving rate is largely the result of optimizing behavior by households to establish preferred balance between current and future consumption if it is the result of optimizing behavior on the part of households the size and abruptness of the fall of the household saving rate suggests quite startling reduction in the value placed on future consumption or with the risk associated with realizing that future consumption some doubt that such change could be the exclusive result of optimizing behavior and further suggest that it is at least as likely to be the consequence of an imprudent rise in economic impatience or myopia resulting from changes in institutions or social conventions at present economists can give definitive answer to the question of whether the low household saving rate is optimal or suboptimal if it is judged to be suboptimal then the issue becomes how can economic policy best affect an increase in the us saving rate the debate about raising the household saving rate has centered on the us system of taxation as it works as disincentive for saving or as it could be used to raise the incentives for saving the concerns have included high tax rates on interest income the double taxation of dividend income and the inheritance tax all are widely cited characteristics of the tax system that are disincentives to save incentives for saving are provided by the deferred tax liability offered by iras 401k and keogh plans expanding the availability and flexibility of such plans is seen by some as means for raising household saving elaborations on this same 26 negative saving rate by households indicates that as group they are dipping in to past

from an assessment against income to an assessment against consumption thereby exempting all household saving from taxation one criticism of such proposals for raising the incent ive to save is that they will also lead to sizeable reduction of the tax burden on higher income households who tend to save larger share of their income and sizeable increase in the tax burden on lower income households who tend to save smaller share of their income this result is in conflict with many peoples notion of fairness another criticism made by many economists of private saving incentive policies is their doubtful effectiveness at raising total saving there are doubts about whether there is significant positive effect on private saving and there are doubts about the ultimate effect on total saving even if the private saving rate is increased doubt about positive effect on private saving arises first because of the apparent inelasticity of saving to changes in the rate of return ie raising the aftertax rate of return will not induce large increases in saving and second because such incentives will have two opposite impacts on saving behavior substitution effect stemming from the raised rate of return which tends to increase saving and an income effect stemming from the increased wealth of the household that tends to reduce the need to save and raises current consumption studies indicate these two effects may be very close in size so that such saving incentive programs may have little net effect on the saving rate doubt about the ultimate effect of private saving incentives on total saving arise because tax breaks for encouraging private saving will through their effect on the balance of the government budget reduce public saving or increase government dissaving and leave the prospect of positive overall effect further in doubt the effect of changes in the public saving rate on total saving are far less problematic and may be more effective route by which economic policy can raise saving and investment the policy maker can be confident that policies that move the government budget away from budget deficits and toward budget surpluses will raise both public saving and total saving the change will not be oneforone due to some induced consumption spending but it will be positive with an added 1 dollar of public saving typically leading to an increase of 050 to 080 in total saving 27 the question about optimizing behavior that had potential policy relevance in the case of the household saving rate is not an issue in regard to the current low public saving rate the state of budget balance is the result of series of policy decisions that reflect numerous social political and economic problems and goals whose relative importance can change over time if higher saving higher investment and faster economic gr owth are seen as high priority then most economists would judge one of the surest ways for government to support that goal is to raise the rate of public saving by moving the budget balance from deficit to surplus g11g151g159g142g156g157g150g142g151g157g561g11g151g140g142g151g157g146g159g142g156g561 economists have strong suspicion that physical

capital in theory this market failure could be overcome by government policy with an appropriate investment incentive in practice however correcting this market failure is far from straightforward it is true that the structure of the tax system can have an influence on the decision to invest potentially affecting the rate of accumulation of the stock of physical capital as well as the allocation of resources across different classes of investment therefore the argument is made from time to time that the structure of the tax system should be shaped to promote investment in physical capital so as to accelerate the rate of economic growth proinvestment policies might involve more rapid rates of depreciation investment tax credits or altered tax treatment of capital gains or corporate profits but as already discussed above the economic issue is not question of whether such proposals can increase the rate of investment in physical capital but whether that increase is economically optimal the prevailing view among economists is that wh ile the tax system should not unduly discourage investment in physical capital neither should it be used as mechanism to directly intervene to promote it in the absence of true market failure economists argue that the tax system should be neutral in its effect on all forms of economic behavior in the presence of some form of market failure the daunting information requirements for implementing an efficient investment tax incentive policy make it likely that such policy would cause distortions in the pattern of investment in types of physical capital distortions in the allocation of resources between physical capital and other economic ends and inefficient rent seeking behavior the ultimate economic effect would most likely be to decrease overall economic efficiency and reduce economic welfare 28 on the other hand as discussed in regard to saving incentives economic theory and evidence indicates that by running budget deficits outside of periods of recession government generates disincentive to private investment spending by diverting share of the economys saving away from private investors29 there is economic presumption that this diversion is economically optimal therefore inclining the budget towards surpluses that add to the nations flow of saving and tend to stimulate investment spending is probably the surest and least distorting way the government can provide incentive for investment in physical capital

effect on the pace of economic growth and the future level of economic wellbeing30 the economic literature on education policy and human capital accumulation is vast and it is beyond the scope of this report to relay in full there are couple of issues however that seem to be of particular significance as they seem to offer potentially high rates of return high rates of return are guides to areas where an increased allocation of resources will improve economic efficiency and raise social wellbeing from the standpoint of economic efficiency the great likelihood of market failure in these areas means they are likely candidates for some enhancement of economic policies to induce an increase in the allocation of resources to these areas one prominent corollary to the decrease in average educational attainment of the us labor force since 1980 has been steady rise in the college wage premium economics tells us that such persistently high rate of return is evidence of an under allocation of resources to an endeavor in this case from the standpoint of economic efficiency too few students are seeking college degrees the share of high school graduates who attend college has increased over this time period but there are sizable differences in these enrollment rates across family income levels this would suggest that financial constraints continue to be barrier to higher education for low to moderate income youths and that policies that increase opportunities for financial aid for such youths could yield large economic returns 31 another area that current research suggests offe rs large social and economic returns would be expansion of programs that raise the quality of early childhood education for children from low income families good educational outcomes in general are the result of cumulative process that begins in the earliest childhood years poor results in the earlier stages make subsequent success much less likely32 good ultimate labor market outcomes from educational enrichment programs are also likely to depend on the enhancement of noncognitive skills ie persistence self discipline reliability etc as well as cognitive skills there is also evidence that an important constraint on access to quality education and human capital growth by children of lowincome families is lack of housing mobility how to best enhance early childhood education remains matter of debate however33

steadily advancing the economys stock of technical knowledge is acknowledged by economists to be the element of central importance for achieving longterm economic growth while the accumulation of physical and human capital are important contributors to this process its only in conjunction with advances in technical knowledge that these two factors can forestall the growth 30 policies to increase human capital will often have dual benefit of improving not only the level of output and income but by generally having the greatest positive impact on those at the low end of the income

be subject to and sustain long term growth but from policy perspective advancing technical knowledge has been somewhat of an enigma sizable share of the literature on economic growth does not deny its importance but tells us that it is phenomenon propelled by forces largely out of reach of economic policy on the other hand many economists argue that improvements in technical knowledge are likely to be the result of purposeful behavior and whether motivated by greed ambition curiosity or altruism that behavior is more likely to occur in an economic environment conducive to invention and innovation this suggests that considerations of marketdetermined outcomes relating to risk and reward will influence this behavior it is also likely that because of the nature of ideas private markets by themselves will likely cause less than optimal commitment of resources to th eir creation therefore an optimal level of investment in new technical knowledge may require action by government to overcome this market failure g20g142g156g142g138g155g140g145g561g139g162g561g4g158g156g146g151g142g156g156g561 research and development is the activity thought most closely linked to the development

ideas this is well developed set of laws in the united states but there are some questions about the patent systems impact on rd activity and economic welfare it is clear that the functioning of the patent system involves an economic tradeoff there is an economic gain from patents inducing more rd by companies but there is an economic cost to consumers of the patented product because the limited monopoly power conferred to the patent holder will result in the product being priced above what would prevail in competitive market the magnitude of this cost to consumers will of course increase with the length of time the patent is in force in theory there will be an opt imal term for the patent that just balances the social benefit of inducing invention and innov ation with the cost of the temporary monopoly power afforded by the patent some economists ar gue that the current patent system is out of balance giving too much weight to the rights of the inventor and not enough to the wider society that bears the cost of the limited monopoly and that shorter patent terms are needed 35 there is also concern by some economists about how efficient the current structure of the patent system

transfer that drives the accumulation of new knowledge36 at one level the patent system aids the process of information transfer for in order to get patent an inventor must make full disclosure of the details of their invention making the knowledge that is inherent to the inve ntion readily available to all who are interested therefore while imitation is not allowed others may be encouraged to invent around the patent or build upon that knowledge to develop other uni products or ideas and the possibility of licencing can allow use of the new knowledge by others however for some types of information important to the process of innovation the arms length marketoriented exchange that patents encourage are perhaps less efficient then various nonmarket mechanisms the problem arises because of the often c ollective and cumulative nature of information use in the process of innovation it is collective in that an innovation will often be the result of of information flows between several participants some of whom might be business rivals patents may tend to rigidify and slow these types on information transfers it is cumulative in nature in that current innovation will often be an essential input to the development of subsequent generations of technology because of this characteristic there is concern that patent system that strongly protects the rights of the first ge neration innovator can impede the information flow necessary for emergence of the subsequent generations of the innovation in general these information transfer issues suggest that as well as an optimal term for the patent there will also be an optimal breadth of the patents coverage some are concerned that the current patent system is inclined toward creating an overly wide breadth for patents and is slowing down the process of innovation in cases where patented idea is judged likely to carry particularly large social benefits the government may better serve general economic wellbeing by buying the patent from its creator and allowing quicker and wider dissemination and use of this valuable new knowledge 37 also in an increasingly globalized economy where the size of the market needed to assure the profitability of new endeavor often require foreign as well as domestic sales the patent systems of other nations become relevant to the domestic business firms willingness to undertake some research projects there is the prospect that improvement in the establishment and enforcement of property rights internationally could have positive effect on domestic rd activity another policy device that attempts to coax more rd out of business firms is the rd tax credit 38 as currently structured the tax code allows 20 tax credit on rd expenditures with the putative effect of stimulating such expenditure s by increasing the aftertax return on research projects while the evidence indicates that the research tax credit does raise rd spending by firms many economists have significant doubts about how well the tax credit does at targeting and inducing rd projects with large social benefits it is likely that even with the credit the investing firm will still be inclined to undertake the research projects that offer the company the greatest return rather than those that would offer the largest social return 36 see thomas mandeville understanding novelty information

rd projects that offer large social benefits relative to private return again as discussed above in regard to incentives for investment in physical capital the information requirements for operation of an efficient grant program is likely well beyond what government could hope to muster the economic risk is that program of direct grants would by distorting th patten of investment and by encouraging rent seeking behavior generate more inefficiency than efficiency curious aspect of firm behavior and the production of ideas is that in situations where the initial rd investments for new idea are very high but where once created the marginal cost of replication is very low firms will not undertake this endeavor unless they can expect to charge prices that exceed marginal cost otherwise insufficient profits would be earned the first copy of the windows operating system cost hundreds of millions of dollars but the cost of producing all subsequent copies the marginal cost is near zero pricing above marginal cost however violates one of the basic conditions for efficient market outcomes and connotes the presence of monopoly power and the attendant loss in consumer welfare government antitrust policy is predicated on preventing such behavior yet in this circumstance antitrust action would be antagonistic to invention innovation and economic growth

undertaken by private profit seeking business firms most often this new knowledge will in addition to having large economic benefits also have the attributes of being both highly nonrival and unexcludable therefore such research usually called basic research will only emerge through government funding moreover the beneficial outcomes of basic research are often unanticipated arguing for casting wide net of research support rather than highly focused funding strategy the fruits of past basic research have included the development of longitude and quantum physics the discovery of dna and penicillin and the invention of the transistor and the laser basic research is currently supported through the budgets of many government agencies including the national science foundation national instit utes of health nasa the department of energys office of science and the department of defense much of the actual research is done at major universities across the country 39 one policy issue for basic research is determining the appropriate level of government funding the rate of accumulation of technical knowledge is likely to rise with the level of resources devoted to it but the speculative nature of basic research makes it all but impossible to judge what the economically optimal size of governme nt spending on such research would be the absolute level of inflation adjusted government spending on basic research increased from about 14 billion in 1953 to about 39 billion in 2004 about 21 billion of these funds were allocated to universities and colleges where the research is performed the intensity of government funded basic research however has fallen decreasing from about 07 of gdp in 1953 to about 02 of gdp in 2004 international evidence has shown th at there is positive correlation between the intensity of governmentfunded basic research and economic growth nevertheless the understanding of linkage between basic research and economic growth is not well

growth from given increase in spending on basic research this in turn makes it difficult to say what the optimal level of such spending should be second policy issue with government funded basic research is the mix of that funding across areas of scientific inquiry the share of government research spending in health related areas has risen steadily for the last 30 years and has increased dramatically over the last 10 years funding for life sciences now accounts for 60 of the governments basic research expenditures in contrast inflationadjusted funding for basic research in the physical sciences has not risen over the last 30 years and accounts for only 10 of the governments budget for basic research 40 some argue that this disparity in funding is inconsistent with the often

longterm economic growth is defining characteristic of the highly successful us economy and perhaps more significantly it is also basic presumption that undergirds american society economic wellbeing is expected to improve for the current and each successive generation to be able to realistically hold such an expectation is reflective of momentous economic achievement over the long course of history sustained economic growth has been rarity and even today all too many nations struggle to achieve it economic historians suggest that one thing that likely demarcates past failure from current success at achieving sustained growth as well as the current disparities between rich and poor nations is the development of an infrastructure for growth this is an amalgam of laws government policies and institutions that form an environment that on balance encourages production and economic transactions given this supporting infrastructure economic theory and evidence make it reasonably clear that countries that have achieved sustained longterm growth such as the united states are those that invest sizable fraction of current income in the accumulation of physical and human capital and have accumulated large stocks of both more importantly they are also economies that have been able to steadily raise the productivity of these two inputs through steady advance of technical knowledge there are reasons to believe despite its evident economic success that the united states due to varying degrees of market failure may under invest in each of the three basic determinants of economic growth in theory correcting that under investment through some form of government intervention could lead to an optimal increase in the rate of accumulation of each determinant and through that an acceleration of the economys rate of economic growth in some instances the induced boost in the rate of growth may not be permanent but the level of future income and output will be higher

market outcomes is one thing designing economic policies that will efficiently induce these improvements is another thing the information shortcoming about what where and how much to invest that the policymaker would have to contend with will often be substantial and greatly raise the risk that the policy will be so blunt and misdirected that it generates more economic costs than benefits this risk is probably the greatest with policies aimed at increasing private investment and saving this leads most economists to argue that the surest and most efficient way to raise investment and saving is for the government to run budget surpluses rather than budget deficits this provides general incentive to investment in physical capital through its favorable effects on interest rates but leaves the decision on particular investments with the individual business firm this may not extract the greatest social benefit but what is extracted is done with minimum of the economic cost that would result from the distortions and rent seeking that more focused investment incentive policy would likely cause the government has been longstanding supporter of human capital accumulation through large scale funding for education programs these efforts have had substantial positive effect on economic growth however the slipping educatio nal attainment of younger labor force cohorts evident over the last 20 years raises concern about slowing human capital investment leading to future decrement in the pace of longterm growth based on estimates of likely high economic return policies to improve access to higher education by minorities and members of low income households and policies to enhance early childhood education may warrant more attention new ideas and the accumulation of technical know ledge is what ultimately propels longterm economic growth the production of new ideas is process that is unlikely to occur on an economically optimal scale without government support rd activities do receive public support but there is still concern about whether this support is accurately targeted and undertaken on an optimal scale of particular concern for public policy is spending on the basic research that is likely an important wellspring for new ideas such research is largely dependent on public funding and by some measures that funding has been steadily waning and tends to be very skewed in its distribution across research discip lines this would seem to be movement away from policies that have high probability of helping to sustain or accelerate economic growth 41 in trying to boost the longterm rate of economic growth the policy maker faces what is often thankless task in that he is asking citizens to in cur costs today for gains that will only fully accrue decades into the future in addition given the maturity and existing strength of the us economy as well as the revealed historical steadiness of the economys rate of longterm growth it may be that economic policies aimed at an acceleration of the economys longterm growth rate will boost that rate by only several tenths of percentage point nevertheless that would be significant achievement and as discussed earlier those seemingly moderate increases cumulate to substantial improvement in the level of national income 25 to 30 years from now the bulk of the benefits could be seen as largely gift from one generation to the next generation finally policies that encourage one growth determinant at the expense of other determinants are unlikely to accelerate the rate of economic growth for example reduction of the budget deficit that occurs through reductions of government sp ending that supports investment in education and 41 it bears repeating that support for basic research alone does not produce new knowledge it must interact with an educated and wellprepared mind and be sustained by an infrastructure encouraging free inquiry
