152 1980 upheld the authority of tribe to tax onreservation cigarette sales to continuedimporter in this state 11 it specifies that the legal incidence of the tax which generally means the duty of paying the tax falls on the distributor12 and that receipts are to be used to maintain the states highway system13 the distributor is permitted to pass the tax along to the retailer who in turn may include it in the price at the pump tribal members may seek refund of state taxes included in the gasoline that they buy on the reservation14 the tribe claiming that the kansas tax is preempted sought federal court injunction against the enforcement of the tax with respect to fuels distributed to its tribal retailer the district court ruled in favor of kansas15 and the court of appeals reversed16 preemption analysis preemption analysis begins with the supremacy clause of the us constitution17 under which congress may override state laws in conflict with its exercise of delegated powers if congre ss enacts legislation under one of its delegated powers that includes an explicit statement that state law is preempted the supreme court generally will give effect to that legislative intent18 where there is language of preemption the court is likely to find pree mption when it identifies direct conflict between the federal law and the state law or when it concludes that the federal government has so occupied the field as to preclude enforcement of state law with respect to the subject at hand19 in cases involving assertion of state authority over activities on indian lands in the absence of federal statute specifically addressing the issue or federal regulatory regime occupying the field the court is likely to examine the state interest in relation to the federal interest

358 us 217 1959 27 the court has said that while the tribes do have an interest in raising revenues for essential governmental programs that interest is str ongest when the revenues are derived from value generated on the reservation by activities involving the tribes and when the taxpayer is the recipient of tribal services the state also has legitimate governmental interest in raising revenues and that interest is likewise strongest wh the tax is directed at offreservation value and when the taxpayer is the recipient of state services washington v confederated tribes of the colville indian reservation 447 us 134 156157 28 411 us 145 1973 29 id at 148149tribes and their members are generally immune to state taxation unless congress has explicitly authorized the taxation22 the court has found state taxes inapplicable to on reservation sales to tribal members23 but it has permitted state taxation of onreservation sales to nonmembers when the basic argument favoring federal preem ption is merely that the economic impact of the state tax renders tribal sellers unable to compete with off reservation vendors who charge only the stat tax and not the additional tribal tax24 if the court locates the legal incidence of st ate tax with the nonindian purchaser and finds explicit statutory preemption it looks for implied preemption by examining the factual circumstances and any federal statutory backdrop to determin whether there is federal preemptive interest in tribal selfgovernme nt and economic development it looks for more than tribal sales that amount to ma rketing an exemption from state taxes and encouraging nonmembers to flout thei r obligations to pay state taxes25 the court may also frame its inquiry in terms of whethe r the state tax infringes on tribal self government26 it may look to whether or not the state tax disturbs market that is intrinsic to the reservation ie whether the stat is attempting to tax tribal product27 state taxation of offreserva tion tribal activities offreservation activities of tribes are subject to state taxing authority the leading case is mescalero apache tribe v jones 28 in which the court stated st andard absent express federal law to the contrary indians going beyond re servation boundaries have generally been held subject to nondiscriminatory stat law otherwise applicable to all citizens of the

made inside indian country the tax cannot be enforced absent clear congressional authorizati on 515 us 450 459 1995 36 the united states had argued that the kansas supreme court in kaul v kansas department of revenue 266 kan 464 970 p 2d 60 kan 1998 cert denied 528 us 812 1999 had found that the legal incidence of the tax on the indian retailers the supreme court however did not accept that interpretation of the case because the language in kaul was ambiguous and continuedtaxation of nonmember entities doing business with tribes montana v united states30 denies to indian tribes broad au thority over nonmembers within tribal reservation except in certain situations among which are taxing those who enter into consensual relations with tribe business contracting with tribe falls into this category and is subject to tribal taxes31 and such contractor may also be subject to state taxation provided balancing of fe deral state and tribal interests favors state tax if the federal regulatory scheme is pervasive it may eliminate any state taxing authority such was the ruling of the court with respect to the indian timber harvesting regime in white mountain apache tribe v bracker 32 if the state interest is more than revenue raising the balance may weigh against the state tax33 if however the state can show that the state has some involvement w ith the reservation activity to be taxed other than revenue raising the tax may be upheld if it is found to have less than substantial effect upon tribal selfgovernment and he ld not to be exorbitant34 supreme court decision in wagnon v prairie band potawatomi nation the kansas department of reve nue kansas had argued th at the case should be decided in line with other rulings on taxing offreserv ation activity of indian tribes the tribe contended that the kansas tax impacts its ability to impose tribal tax because the tribal retailer will pass the tax along to reservation customers it therefore urged that the case be decided in light of decisions involving nonindians doing onreservation business with tribe the supreme court l ooked closely at the issue of th legal incidence of the tax35 the court upheld the kansas position it view ed the transaction being taxed as one off reservation and involving nonindians the dist ributor and the motor fuels vendor it ruled that the legal incidence of the tax falls on the offreservation nonindian distributor it did so on the basis of the statutes explicitly 1 lodging the legal incidence of the tax and liability for payment of the tax on the distributor and 2 making

claim that application of the state tax would decrease its revenue whether those revenues are beled profits or tax proceeds39 by characterizing such loss of revenue as the inevitable economic result
