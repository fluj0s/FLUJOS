yacobucci specialist in energy policy resources science and industry divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31361boutique fuels and reformulated gasoline harmonization of fuel standards summary the current system of gasoline standards in the united states is complex because of federal and state programs to improve air quality and local refining and marketing decisions suppliers of gasoline face many different standards for fuel quality as result fuels are formulated to meet varying standards state and local decisions overlap with federal requirements leading to situations where adjacent or nearby areas may have significantly di fferent standards these various fuel formulations are often referred to as boutique fuels in this system supply disruptions can result if fuel from one ar ea cannot be used to supply another area because of potential supply concerns there is interest in simplifying harmonizing the system so that regiona l or national standa rds are consistent however the competing goals of ai r quality supply stability and costs make harmonizing the system complex process adding to these complications are cerns over methyl tertiary butyl ether mtbe common gasoline additive that has been detected in groundwater in numerous states at least 25 states have passed legislation to ban or limit the use of mtbe on august 8 2005 president bush signed the energy policy act of 2005 pl 10958 among other provisions pl 10958 addressed seve ral boutique fuels issues as result of pl 10958 ke component of the federal reformulated gasoline rfg program was eliminated may 6 2006 this requirement which gasoline suppliers asserted was fact mtbe requirement was used by gasoline suppliers as defense against liability fo r mtbe contamination therefore while pl 10958 actually gives the industry mo re flexibility the industry moved quickly to eliminate mtbe from the gasoline supply in spring 2006 this increased pressure on already tight refining capacity the loss in volume and energy from eliminating mtbe increased demand for gasoline as well as ethanol exacerbating the supply problem was the fact that the industry was making the transition from winter gasoline to more stringent summertime air quality specifications which adds competition for the highestquality gasoline components th pressures along with historically high crude oil prices led to historically hi gh gasoline prices further some localized areas faced shortterm supply disruptions as refineries made the transition this report discusses how gasoline com position is regulated and explains the various federal and state gaso line standards next the report presents some of the key issues with the federal rfg program some of the problems associated with boutique fuels are discussed as well as some of the potential effects of harmonization finally cong ressional actions in the 109th congress related to boutique fuels rfg and harmonization in cluding the passage of pl 10958 are discussed this report

three to indicate that each type of gasoline is sold at three octane levels or grades suppliers are not required by law to sell three grades of gasoline 3 conventional gasoline is sold across most of the country 4 major pipeline problems along with other complicating factors led to short supplies of gasoline in the area conventional gasoline s upplies were low as were supplies of the blendstock used to create rfg for the chicagomilwaukee areaboutique fuels and reformulated gasoline harmonization of fuel standards introduction because of federal and state programs to improve air quality and local refining and marketing decisions suppliers of gaso line must supply fuel that meets number of different standards according to xxonmobil as of 2002 there were 18 different gasoline formulations required across the country1 depending on how various overlapping standards ar counted this number can increase or decrease2 the two key federal programs are the reformulated gasoline program rfg which aims to reduce emissions of toxic air pollutants and ozoneforming compounds and the oxygenated fuels oxy fuel program which aims to reduce carbon monoxide emissions these programs are required by the clean air act in places where federal rfg is not required states may optin to the program or they may impose other fuel requirements as part of plan to meet air quality standards this mix of state and fede ral standards along with local marketing and refinery decisions has resulted in adjacent or nearby areas that may require gasoline with significantly diffe rent properties what are boutique fuels the term boutique fuels refers to the various specialized gasoline formulations made to meet air quality standards or local preferences besides conventional fuel3 refiners and marketers in state may also have to meet requirements in different areas for one two or even three different formulations what is the concern over boutique fuels because requirements can vary from state to state and within state if there is disruption in fuel supply it may be difficult for refiners to supply fuel meeting local specifications to the affected area if this happens prices can rise shar ply as occurred with particular severity in the midwest in the summer of 20004 and in the wake of hurricanes katrina and ritahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31361crs2 5 it is difficult however to distinguish the ffects of any one change on the costs of refining and distribution or on consumer prices both the costs to supply gasoline and pump prices respond to wide range of variables 6 pl 101549the ability to move product from one area of the country to another is called fungibility why not simply require one fuel across the country the existing system has evolved in response to various federal air quality sta ndards and resulting state standards local refiner decisions and consumer choices further many of the state formulations were signed to mitigate moderate air quality problems without requiring more stringent and presumably more expensive measures an attempt to group states under one regional or national standard refe rred to as harmonization might lead to higher pump prices for areas with less severe ozone problems or higher emissions in areas with more severe problems further refiners may have made considerable investments in tooling facilities to meet specific local requirements harmonizing standards would be complex process competing goals will make harmonizing standards complex process gasoline distribution would likely be more uniform under regiona l or national standa rds but refining costs and consumer price coul d increase under new standards5 further air quality could be improved or diminished depending on how standards are combined any changes in the us gasoline system will need to take all of these factors into account organization of report this report outlines the current situation with boutique fuels it discusses the various st ate and federal requirements their purposes and how they interact next it discusses in tail one of the key components of the federal rfg program component elimin ated by the energy policy act of 2005 pl 10958 then the repor t describes some of the s upply problems caused by the current system followed by discussion of the tradeoffs associated with harmonization finally the report discusse s congressional actions as well as actions taken by the bush administration that will lik ely affect the fuel system this report will be updated as events warrant gasoline standards changing gasoline standards as was stated above the current fuel sy stem has resulted fro m mix of federal and state requirements mandate d or motivated by the passage of the clean air act amendments of 19906 before 1990 fuel requirements were much simpler with only limits on volatility in the summer months to control ozone formation because temperature plays key role in ozone fo rmation twotier syst em was established with tighter summer volatility standards in the south httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31361crs3 7 groundlevel ozone is an air pollutant that causes smog adversely affects health and injures plants it should not be confused with stratospheric ozone which is natural layer some 6 to 20 miles above the earth and provides degree of protection from harmful radiation 8 us department of energy alternative fuels data center properties of fuels httpwwwafdcdoegovpdfsfueltablepdf the 1990 clean air act amendments adde d additional require ments producing more complex multilayer system these requirements include the use of various fuel formulations targeted at specific air quality problems in addition to federal requirements states with less severe pollution problems may establish their own standards these various federal and stat standards lead to patchwork of areas with in some cases very different sta ndards gasoline supply and distribution is further complicated by local refining and marketing decisions to promote or limit the use of certain additives this multilayer system of various standards and formulations can lead to supply instability if fuel from one market cannot be used in another market to meet changes in supply and demand general standards some gasoline standards apply to all fuel while others only apply to particular formulations currently fuel may be regulated for volatility nitrogen oxide emissions heavy metal content content and emissions of toxic compounds sulfur content andor oxygen content each of these factors plays role in pollutant emissions and overall air quality volatility volatility is chemicals propensity to evaporate evaporative emissions of hydrocarbons such as motor fuel contribute to the formation of ground level ozone which leads to smog7 reid vapor pressure rvp is measure of fuels volatility lower numbers indicate wer volatility the rvp for conventional gasoline can range from about 8 to 15 pounds per square inch psi8 but is limited to 90 psi in the summer months in areas where ozone is problem lower rvp is required nitrogen oxides nox nitrogen oxides nox include nitrous oxide nitric oxide and nitrogen dioxide nox contributes to the forma tion of ozone therefore fuel may be formulated to limit nox emissions heavy metals lead was commonly used as an octane enhancer until it was phasedout through the mid1980s it was completely banne d in 1995 due to the fact that lead can disable emissions control devices and because it is toxic to humans in some areas the use of other heavy metals eg manganese in gasoline may also be restricted toxic compounds some gasoline components and additives are toxic to humans further fuel combustion can lead to the formation of other toxic compounds such compounds include benz ene acetaldehyde formaldehyde 13 butadiene and polycyclic organic matter benzene is known human carcinogen while the other compounds can cause irr itation and exacerbate asthma some

report rs20163 sulfur in gasoline by stephen thompson and james mccarthy 11 this sulfur restriction is part of larger wholesystem approach by epa to limit vehicle emissions starting in model year 2004 automob ile manufacturers are facing more stringent emissions standards for their vehicles to enable the use of more advanced emissions control devices the sulfur content of gasoline must be limited as wellbe human carcinogens9 in some fuels benzene content is limited the overall emissions of toxic com pounds may be limited as well sulfur sulfur in gasoline can interfere with onboard emissions control devices catalytic converters are especially vulnerable10 to improve the performance of emissions controls the sulfur content of gasoline may also be limited by state or federal regulati ons currently alabama calif ornia georgia and nevada require lowersulfur gasoline starting january 1 2004 epa began phasing in new national limits for sulfur in gasoline effective january 1 2006 most ga soline is limited to sulfur level of 30 parts per million ppm11 before the new standards gasoline sulfur content averaged around 300 ppm oxygen because oxygen can improve combustion and thus limit the emissions of certain compounds min imum oxygen content may be required because pure oxygen cannot be added direc tly to gasoline it would simply escape from the fuel an oxygenbearing co mpound called an oxygenate is added typically ethers such as methyl tertiary butyl ether mtbe or alcohols such as ethanol are used to enhance the oxygen c ontent of gasoline these oxygenates are also highoctane compounds and reduce the need for other octane enhancers that may be more toxic such as benzene as discussed below key oxygen standard for federal reformulated gasolin was eliminated by pl 10958

is the fuel sold across most of the country it is the least stringently regulated fuel with summertime limit on rvp of 90 psi prohibition on the use of lead and limit on the level of manganese heavy metal because gasoline blended with 10 ethanol gasohol has higher volatility the rvp limit is raised by 1 psi to 100 psi thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31361crs5 12 there are other benefits to using

rvp limits were also more stringent for southern areas than for northern areas that law set single standard at the more stringent southern level federal rfg accounts for about 28 of summertime

2005 12 areas were implementing the program17 the oxyfuel program requires minimum oxygen content of 27 by weight because of the nature of carbon monoxide pollution most carbon monoxide nonattainment

states may establish th eir own fuel standards as strategy for mitigating emissions if they do not to optin to the rfg program the clean air act gives the epa the authority to permit reductions in the allowable rvp of fuel in the summertime most states require only lower rvp at 70 72 78 or 85 rvp in all other ways these stat fuel requirements are identi cal to conventional gasoline however some states go further and require lower sulfur content eg georgia or limit the use of certain additives eg texas further minnesota requires minimum of 10 ethanol in all gasoline sold in the state these various fuels account for about 12 of summer gasoline consumption20 california cleanerburning gasoline cbg in addition to giving states leeway on setting fuel standards the clean air act allows

and some animal studies indicate that it may pose potential cancer risk to humans for these reasons 25 states have taken steps to ban or limit its use according to the renewable fuels association23 the most significant of the ba ns in terms of the amount of fuel affected took effect at the end of 2003 c alifornia and new york leading many to suggest that congress revisit the issue to modify the oxygenate requirement and set more uniform national requirements regarding mtbe and its potential replacements principally ethanol the debate over the rfg oxygen standard support for eliminating the oxygenate requirement on nati onwide basis was widespread among environmental groups the petroleum indus try and states in general these stakeholders concluded that gasoline can meet the same low emission performance standards as rfg without the use of oxygen ates but agricultural interests presented potential obstacle to enacting legislation to remove the oxygen requirement according to the us department of ag riculture roughly 13 of the nations corn crop is used to produce the competing ox ygenate ethanol supporters of ethanol argued that as mtbe use was phased out with the oxygen requirement still in effect ethanol use would soar increasing demand for corn in fact according to epa ethanol demand has grown subs tantially as mtbe has been be phased out as result of state bans and refinery decisions c onversely if the oxygen requirement were waived by epa or through legislation not only would mtbe use decline but so likely would demand for ethanol thus so members of cong ress and governors from corngrowing states took keen inte rest in mtbe legi slation and related oxygenate requirements one concern voiced by ethanol supporte rs over the elimination of the rfg oxygen standard is that it had provided major impetus for ethanol demand to fill potential void in ethanol demand left by an elimination of the oxygen requirement there were legislative proposals to devel op renewable fuels standard rfs renewable fuel is one that can be produced from renewable resources such as solar energy agriculture products or waste material in general renewable fuels are those

numerous provisions relevant to mtbe and ethanol26 most notably pl 10958 repeals the clean air act requirement to use mtbe or other oxygenates in place of this requirement the bill establishes an rfs to prevent backsliding on air quality the bill requires that reductions in emissions of toxic substances achieved by rfg be maintained it also authorizes funds for mtbe cleanup27 pl 10958 established an rfs of 40 billion gallons in 2006 increasing yearly to 75 billion gallons in 2012 supporters argu that renewable fuels standard will foster agricultural production promote domes tic energy sources and lead to cleaner air critics argue that it will raise gasoline prices artificially inflate demand for ethanol and add one more yer of requirements to an already complex gasoline supply system further some critics argu that renewable mandate will result in corporate welfare for few large ethanol producers some critics question the net energy saving from fuel ethanol because the production of corn and ethanol requires significant fossil fuel inputs28 issues in the spring of 2006 mt be phaseout and ethanol supply as result of pl 10958 the oxygen requirement for rfg was eliminated as of may 6 2006 the elimination of the oxyg standard was supported by various states with mtbe contamination and by th refining industry as way to simplify gasoline supply however the oxygen requirement which gasoline suppliers asserted was facto mt be requirement has been used by gasoline suppliers as defense against liability for mtbe contamination29 pl 10958 did not ban mtbe use rather it actually gives the i ndustry more flexibility in making rfg with or without oxygenates but because of liability concerns the industry moved quickly to eliminate mtbe from the gasoline supply in spring 2006

roughly 15 of us gasoline demand the loss in volume and ergy due to eliminating mtbe increased demand for gasoline refined from petrol eum crude oil for the production of feedstocks and ethanol in response to pl 10958 in spring 2006 many refiners began producing gasoline blendstock for ethanolblended rfg30 for use in rfg areas ethanol cannot be blended with c onventional gasoline but requi res specific lowvolatility gasoline blendstock this blendstoc k called reformulated blendstock for oxygenate blending rbob tends to be more difficult and costly to produce and it requires the use of more highquality ga soline blending components further sharp increase in demand for ethanol for ga soline blending strained ethanol supplies also during the transition from mtbe to ethanolblended gasoline in many cases refiners terminals and retaile rs had to halt operations to purge their tanks of the old fuel potential issue with the transition between rfg with and without the oxygen requirement is one of timing during th transition some refiners had eliminated mtbeblended rfg before the may 6 trans ition to nonoxygenated rfg however between the time they eliminated mtbe and may 6 rfg was still subject to the oxygen standard therefore some gaso line suppliers who may in the future make the transition to nonoxygenated rfg needed to supply ethanolblended rfg during the transition the ultimate demand for ethanol in rfg will depend on gasoline refiners and suppliers deci sions about whether to ma rket ethanolblended or non oxygenated rfg exacerbating the supply problem was the f act that the industry was making the transition from winter gasoline to more stringent lowvolatility summertime specifications which adds competition fo r the highestquality gasoline components these pressures along with historically high crude oil prices have led to historically high nominal gasoline prices further some localized areas faced shortterm supply disruptions as refine ries made the transition renewable fuels standard some detractors of th rfs have claimed that high gasoline prices in spring 2006 are pa rtly due to the enactment of the rfs however while the shortterm increase in ethanol demand from the elimination of the oxygenate standard has certainly played role in the spring 2006 gasoline situation see above the effects of the rf s on high gasoline prices are less evident for 2006 the rfs requires the use of 40 billion gallons in gasoline roughly equivalent to us ethanol use in 2005 therefore while the increasing rfs could put pressure on ethanol supp lies and gasoline prices in coming years it seems less likely that the rfs has played role in the current situation31httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31361crs10 31 continued subject to 51centpergallon tax credit th erefore

are only one factor among many that play role in determining pump pricesharmonizing gasoline standards the multiple gasoline standards along with the use of various fuel additives have led to supply incompatibility be fore 1990 the us gasoline system was relatively fungible product could be moved from one market to meet diminished supply in another currently gasoline used in one area may not necessarily meet the standard of another for example in the summer fuel produced for the charlotte nc area cannot be used in norfolk va r fg or atlanta ga lower rvp and sulfur cap however fuel from either norfolk or atlanta could be shipped to charlotte in many cases the system is essentially oneway giving suppliers the ability to move product from more stringent areas to less stringent areas but not vice versa adding to this problem is the fact that us refiners and fuel pipelines are currently operating at or near capacity reducing the flexibility to produce and ship multiplicity of formulations or respond to change in local market needs any supply disruption caused by refinery fire pipeline rupture or other incident can lead to price volatility even with more fungible conventional gasoline adding localized requirements creates an even mo re complex situation where excess supply in one area may not be moved to the aff ected area because of emissions standards because of the complex nature of various gasoline standards there is interest in harmonizing the standards this would entail requiring one t of standards across region or even across the country po tential scenarios include requiring that within an area only one low rvp fuel could be used in addition to conventional gasoline and rfg in the above scenario with norfolk charlotte and atlanta while norfolk would still use rfg the standards for charlotte and atlanta would be identical another more drastic scenario would require that all fuel be conventional gasoline or rfg some of the key issues involved in harmonization would be production costs consumer prices pro duction capacity supply stability and air quality production cost depending on the way standards are harmonized production costs could increase32 while fewer standards across the country would seem to benefit refiners it could create need for expensive re finery modifications to meet the harmonized standards because refiners made investments in tooling their plants to meet the local requirements changes could be costly however less drastic harmonization where some of the lowrvp fuels are harmonized but not eliminated could mitigate some of these difficultieshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31361crs11 33 us department of energy energy information administration oil market basics chart us refining capacity crude runs and

refiners have operated at or bove 90 nominal capacity for over decade33 limited pr oduction capacity can lead to higher prices especially if there is disruption in production on in the flow of gasoline and gasoline inputs it is possible that harmonization could exacerbate this problem depending on how it is implemented new standards could lead to higher or lower supply levels for example very stringent volatility standards could require refiners to limit the use of some gasoline components the loss of volume from cutting back on these components would require increased supply in the form of petroleum ethanol or other blending components some of which are imported supply stability presumably main goal of harmonization would be to improve the fungib ility of the system reduc ing the possibility of s upply and distribution problems fewer standards ma ke it more likely that product could be moved from one area of the country to anothe r to meet local needs however it must be noted that supply disruptions can neve r be completely eliminated because there are so many factors outside of fuel standard s that play role in supply these include levels of crude oil supply petroleum imports refining capacity seasonal fluctuations in demand and weather patterns whi ch may influence demand for fuel air quality key concern in any discussion of harmonization is the effect on air quality many of these boutique fuel s standards were cr eated specifically to mitigate the unique air quality problems in specific metropolitan area the standards were devised as pa rt of state implementation plan sip for ozone sips are based on models showing that particular fuels requirements will lead to projected reductions in pollutant emissions more stringent requirements while more costly lead to greater emissions reductions therefore an effort has been made in the sips to balance air quality goals with producer and consumer concerns about cost any harmonization would necessitate that certain state fuels be chosen over others what must be resolved is the stion of which standards should apply to all states in region the most stringent the least stringent some compromise standard any standard less stringent than an sips current standard would require the state to identify other emissions reducti ons any standard more stringent than states current standard would likely lead to higher consumer prices state fuel requirements in addition to th above cerns about harmonization other issues remain one of these has to do with local marketing decisions and state requirements unrelated to air quality if these factors are not addressed the system could still remain quite complex for example minnesota requires the use of ethanol in gasoline acr oss the

detailed discussion of the national energy policy see crs report rl31096 bush energy policy overview of major proposals and legislative actionthe energy policy act of 2005 and harmonization the energy policy act of 2005 pl 10958 contained f our key provisions aimed at addressing bou tique fuels issues first as was stated above s ection 1504a eliminated the oxygen standard for federal rfg this standard was key motivation for the use of mtbe in gasoline second section 1504c eliminat ed the distinction between summertime rfg in northern and southern areas starting in may 2006 all rfg areas will use the more stringent southern rfg in summer months third section 1541b capped the num ber of state boutique fuels at the number as of september 1 2004 epa must publish list of these fuels and may not approve state implementation plan that establishes new state fuel if that would increase the number of fuels on epas list if listed fuel is longer used it may be delisted epa may then approve new fuel to take its place on the list fourth section 1509 requires epa to study the potential effects of comprehensive harmonization of fu standards across the country on may 4 2006 epa administrator stephen l johnson launched task force to study potential harmonization epa plans to submit the report to the president in july 200634 in addition to the above provisions s ection 1501 established renewable fuels standard rfs that requires the use of 75 billion gallons of renewable fuel in gasoline by 2012 administration action on harmonization as part of the bush administrations action on its national energy policy35 epa is currently studying the potential ffects of harmonization in preliminary report epa studied various scenarios and ttempted to analyze the effects of those scenarios recognizing that its study is the first step in much longer process epa found that depending on the scenario sta ndards could be harm onized without major cost increases increases in emissions or reductions in gasoline supply the study states that even though some of the harmonized areas have not faced supply disruptions in the past harmonizati on could reduce the potential for futurehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31361crs13 36 epa otaq staff white paper p 47disruptions36 more drastic measures the study finds would lead to simplified supply system but might lead to higher prices and major reductions in gasoline production capacity as was stated above on may 4 2006 ep administrator stephen l johnson announced task force to study potential harmonization and report to the president in july 2006 congressional action the most notable congressional ac tion on boutique fuels in the 109th congress was the passage of the energy policy ac t of 2005 pl 10958 as stated above pl 10958 eliminated the oxygen standard for rfg liminated the distinction between northern and southern summertime rfg limited the number of state boutique fuels required the study of fuel system harmonization and established renewable fuels standard other bills have been introduced in the 109th congress addressing boutique fuels from various angles hr 3807 ney w ould eliminate all boutique fuels including federal rfg and oxyfuel requiring the use of conventional gasoline across the country s 1859 burr would make some boutique fuels provisions of pl 10958 more stringent for example the bill would not allow new fuels to be added to epas list of allowable state boutique fuels after fuel is delisted language similar to hr 1459 blunt and hr 1493 blunt on limiting state fuels and studying comprehensive harmonization was included in pl 10958 all of these bills have been referred to committee among other provisions hr 3893 bar ton the gasoline for americas security act of 2005 would significantly limit the number of boutique fuels across the country other than california all st ates would be limited ither to conventional gasoline federal rfg or one of two lowrvp gasolines in addition to two blends of diesel fuel hr 3893 passed the house october 7 2005 on 212210 vote it has been referred to the senate committee on energy and natural resources conclusion the current system of gasoline standards in the united states is complex state and local decisions overlap with federal requirements leading to adjacent or nearby areas that may have significantly diffe rent requirements these various fuel formulations can lead to shortages and price spikes if an area facing supply disruptions cannot import fuel from another area adding to these complications is the fact that mtbe use has largely been phasedout by states and refiners and the demand for blending components to replace mtbe has increasedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31361crs14 the competing goals of air quality supply stability and costs will make harmonization complex process even with regional or national standards factors such as local marketing decisions and the use of ethanol will complicate the system for these reasons whether or not congre ss passes additional fu els legislation fuel standards will continue to be major issue
