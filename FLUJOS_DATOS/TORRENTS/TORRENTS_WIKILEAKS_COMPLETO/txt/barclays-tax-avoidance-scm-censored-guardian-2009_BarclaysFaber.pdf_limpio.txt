of the following luxembourg tax summary have been discussed with bonn schmitt steichen bss and are supported by the tax opinions attached at appendix 3 the tax analysis will be confirmed in advance with the luxembourg authorities by way of ruling 411 luxco 4111 luxco should not be taxable on the distributions received from lp because this will be considered income derived from an exempt participation 4112 luxco will be subject to tax on the interest income from the luxco portfolio 4113 capital duty should not be payable on the issuance of the b prefs in exchange for the lp interest nor on the capital contribution made by bib iom to lp the former is an exempt shareforshare exchange whilst the latter is nontaxable indirect capital contribution however capital duty at 1 will be chargeable on the issuance of the 100k shares and the 1m c shares 4114 luxco will be obliged to withhold tax at rate of 15 on dividends paid under the shares to luxbank and under the b prefs to bib iom anticipated to be 315k and 525m respectively 4115 an immaterial amount of net wealth tax will be payable as luxcos holding in lp is an exempt asset 412 luxbank tax analysis 4121 luxbank should be treated as beneficial owner of the b prefs and is taxable on 50 of any dividends paid on the b prefs 4122 luxbank should receive deduction equal to 50 of the fall in value of the b prefs which occurs when the b prefs dividend is paid this should offset the taxable dividend income in 4121 4123 luxbank should also be entitled to claim credit against its corporate income tax liability for the 15 wht applied to the b prefs dividend 4124 dividends receivable under the shares should be 50 taxable however credit should be available for the 15 luxembourg wht suffered 5 tax risk 51 based on discussions

prefs irrespective of the forward and the b prefs should satisfy the conditions in s91d fa 1996 5211 the b prefs are redeemable within the meaning of section 91d2 5212 given the formula for the b prefs redemption price the b prefs are designed to give libid return which equates to the return one would expect on an investment at commercial rate of interest and 5213 there are strong arguments that bib ioms purpose in holding the b prefs is to secure tax advantage 522 there is risk that the b prefs do not in fact satisfy condition 2 of s91d and hence do not fall within s91b the b prefs redemption formula is by reference to gross dividends whereas bib iom suffers 15 wht on any dividend received under the b prefs although this is adjusted for by the pricing under the forward and indeed the solus accounts of bib iom will show net libid return on bib ioms investment looking at the b prefs in isolation it could be argued that they do not give libid return however if the b prefs did fail to satisfy condition 2 then they should satisfy the conditions in s91e by virtue of the forward and hence still fall within the provisions of s91b 523 the effect of failing to fall within s91b would be that instead of being taxed on fair value basis ie on the net libid interest earned on the in substance loan to luxbank the b prefs would generate 3500m taxable income in respect of the b prefs dividend plus 3005m loss on redemption which could be disallowed however the risk that neither s91d nor s91e applies is considered remote section 91b risk on c shares 524 there risk that the c shares fall within s91b such that any return on the c shares is taxed as income the c shares are entitled to the residual net assets of luxco after return of capital and dividends on the shares and the b prefs however given the costs which are borne by luxco including luxbanks fee under the shares the return on the c shares will be significantly lower than libid and so the conditions in s91as91e should not be met 525 with regard to case law in respect of whether the return is income or capital and on the basis that bib iom should neither be held to be trading nor as discussed above fall within the loan relationship provisions the 147m return on the c shares should be treated as capital and therefore excluded for the purposes of bib ioms chargeable profits calculation 526 in the event the c shares are in fact treated as income for the purposes of cfc tax s42 fa 1998 provides that income should be computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting practice since the accounts of bib iom will show only the profit over and above the c share subscription and the capital contribution income for these purposes would be 147m 13 risk 527 the risk that paragraph 13 sch 9 fa 1996 13 applies to interest payable on the barclays deposit is not considered to be material on the basis that such interest would be payable irrespective of whether the transaction took place or not 528 since barclays will use noninterest bearing current accounts nibcas to fund repayment of bib ioms deposit it will not be possible to identify any interest debits in respect of this funding therefore it should not be possible to apply 13 to such funding formatted indent left 15 cmhanging 1 cm outline numbered level 3 numbering style 1 2 3 start at 1 alignment left aligned at 0 cm tab after 127 cm

calculation and has been assumed non deductible for the purpose of calculating the benefit of the transaction section 811 risk 5210 in cash terms bib iom will suffer wht and receive net dividend on the b prefs therefore bib iom will claim s811 icta 1988 section 811 deduction in respect of this luxembourg wht there is risk that the deduction is disallowed on the basis that when the forward is taken into account bib iom has net exposure to the wht however the receipt of payment under the forward should arguably not impact on an analysis of the amount of tax paid for s811 purposes 5211 it is also helpful that luxbank is anticipated to be in net tax paying position and will therefore claim credit in respect of the wht rather than refund this reduces the risk of an adjustment under s8114 5212 in the event that the s811 deduction is disallowed bib ioms chargeable profits for the relevant accounting period will be increased bib iom is likely to be classified as cfc for the period and will be required to pursue an acceptable distribution policy adp and pay 90 of it chargeable profits to mhiml as dividend which will be taxable in the hands of mhiml assuming the time limit for an adp has not expired or suffer an apportionment of its chargeable profits to mhiml the apportionment also being taxable on mhiml section 7516 risk 5213 there is risk that for the purpose of calculating its chargeable profits bib iom cannot include proportion of the luxembourg wht suffered on the b prefs as creditable tax under s7516 icta 1988 section 7516 5214 assuming that s804za icta 1988 applies bib iom should be assumed or deemed to have made s805 icta 1988 election and therefore eligible to claim deduction for the luxembourg wht suffered on the b prefs as described above 5215 in addition s7516 provides that creditable tax for cfc purposes includes the amount of any relief from corporation tax which would be given to bib iom in respect of any foreign tax which is brought into account in determining those chargeable profits therefore bib iom will also claim capped amount of luxembourg wht as creditable tax ie the amount of the wht which is attributable to the b prefs income included in bib ioms chargeable profits calculation for the period in which the b prefs dividend is paid unlike the s811 deduction creditable tax for cfc tax purposes can be set off against existing income in

summarised below detailed accounting analysis including the solus accounting in respect of each entity is attached at appendix 4 63 the accounting treatment has been agreed with scm finance and with pwc 64 barclays consolidation analysis 641 barclays owns 100 of the share capital and voting rights in bib iom and uksub and will therefore continue to consolidate both bib iom and uksub under ias 27 642 as gp uksub and therefore barclays will control lp and will make all the management decisions in respect of lp and the lp portfolio therefore barclays will consolidate lp under ias 27 643 luxco is an spe under sic12 since although luxbank will own 99 of the voting rights luxco which will have restricted articles of association will be created for specific well defined purpose and its activities will be restricted barclays will receive the majority of the reward from luxcos activities and is exposed to the majority of risks by virtue of the c shares which are entitled to the net assets of luxco after payment of dividends and return of capital on the b prefs and the shares therefore barclays will consolidate luxco 644 the lp and luxco portfolios should be accounted for as loans and receivables at amortised cost 645 the forward should be accounted for as derivative under ias 39 and fair valued through the consolidated income statement on the date of declaration of the b prefs dividend barclays should show pretax profit on the forward equal to the effective gross up under the forward 646 the luxembourg wht suffered on the b prefs dividend should be reflected in the tax line of the consolidated income statement on the date that the dividend is declared as an expense the luxembourg wht relates to the gain on the forward due to declaration of the dividend and should be recognised as deferred tax which becomes current tax when the wht is paid 647 the shares should be treated as debt in the consolidated accounts 65 the barclays consolidated ifrs position and the barclays consolidated us gaap position are expected to be materially the same 66 anticipated consolidated luxbank position 661 under ifrs luxbank should recognise the forward as derivative under ias 39 and recognise fair value movements on the forward in its income statement until day t 15 prior to declaration of the b prefs dividend the b prefs redemption price will be equal to the forward price noting that both can be accelerated at short notice such that any time value of money impact is negligible 662 upon declaration of dividend on the b prefs both the forward price payable by luxbank under the forward and the b prefs redemption price will be reduced by the amount of the dividend the forward price will also increase by 525m in respect of the wht which becomes payable by luxbank as result of the gross up within the forward price calculation however luxbank will simultaneously become entitled to credit of 525m therefore there will be net movement in luxbanks assets and liabilities luxbank should recognise liability in its balance sheet in respect of the wht gross up payable under the forward and receivable in respect of the wht credit due from the luxembourg

based on german gaap luxbank are currently not expecting to consolidate luxco under ias 27 luxco will also be classified as an spe under sic12 and consolidated by barclays 7 credit and market risk 71 barclays will have full management discretion over the lp portfolio by virtue of an investment management agreement ima with uksub which is the general partner of lp 72 the lp and luxco portfolios will consist of reverse repos over oecd sovereign securities 73 since these assets are highly rated any credit risk associated with the transaction is expected to be immaterial 74 credit limit will be marked against the various third party european financial institutions in respect of the reverse repos entered into to source the oecd sovereign securities 75 all necessary credit approvals will be obtained by scm through gfrm via the normal process 76 barclays will be exposed to market risk in respect of the interest rate risk on the lp and luxco portfolios with respect to the luxco portfolio this risk is not considered to be material given its size and in any case the reverse repos are anticipated to be short dated in respect of the lp portfolio given that the reverse repos are anticipated to be short dated and the loans to luxbank are anticipated to carry libor ie floating rate of interest again the risk is not anticipated to be material 8 regulatory capital 81 the regulatory capital reporting has been agreed with finance basel i 82 barclays soloconsolidated position 821 mhiml and bib iom are soloconsolidated subsequent to entering into the transaction both companies should continue to meet the requirements for solo consolidation therefore approval from the fsa should not be required 83 wras 831 there should be wras on either the b prefs or the c shares since these are intragroup items 832 the forward with luxbank can be viewed as credit derivative which provides bib iom with credit protection on the b prefs in accordance with cd 58 22 it should therefore be ignored for wra purposes 833 however upon declaration of dividend on the b prefs bib iom will become entitled to receivable under the forward in respect of the formatted indent hanging

up therefore counterparty risk should be recognised on this receivable ie wras of 105m 20 x 525m 84 large exposures 841 from the time that bib iom acquires the lp interest until it is transferred to luxco anticipated to be approximately 5 days an internal exposure of 11225m will arise in respect of the lp interest since this exposure will only last short period of time subject to approval from treasury it is not intended that this will be mitigated 611 on day t internal exposures of 3457m and 11225m arise on the c shares and the b prefs respectively lp will guarantee the obligations of luxco to redeem the c shares and the b prefs and will pledge the 14691m lp portfolio to bib iom in support of this obligation since the lp portfolio will consist of reverse repos over oecd sovereign securities which qualify as eligible collateral the internal exposure on the c shares and the b prefs will be mitigated to zero 842 in line with cd 101 1 the credit protection on the b prefs provided by the forward can also be ignored for wra purposes upon declaration of dividend on the b prefs bib iom will become entitled to receivable of 525m under the forward since the exposure will be for less than one year this exposure is exempt for the purpose of calculating barclays 25 limit 843 in order to pay any b prefs dividend the lp portfolio will be partially liquidated however on the basis that the price at which luxco is obliged to redeem the b prefs will also reduced it is anticipated that there should still be sufficient eligible collateral within the lp portfolio to mitigate significant proportion of the internal exposure on the c shares and the b prefs 844 to the extent barclays is required to provide guarantee in respect of the obligations of luxco and lp to the counterparties of the repos entered into to source the oecd collateral such guarantees will give rise to an internal large exposure of barclays to luxco and lp approximately equal to 519m 14691m x 102 x 1015 14691m assuming 2 haircut 845 large exposure will arise in respect of the cds given the exposure to the b shares under the cds will be mitigated by the pledge of eligible collateral under 842 above 85 barclays consolidated position 851 barclays should consolidate uksub luxco and lp therefore transactions between these entities should be eliminated for regulatory purposes 86 wras 861 the 14691m lp portfolio will consist of reverse repos over oecd sovereign securities and therefore will attract 0 risk weighting 862 the forward with luxbank provides the barclays group with second loss credit protection on the lp portfolio this protection has not been recognised in calculating the capital required in respect of the lp portfolio therefore as at the solus level the forward should be ignored for capital adequacy purposes similarly to the analysis at the solus level upon declaration of dividend on the b prefs wras of 105m should be marked in respect of the corresponding receivable under

exposure of 525m to luxbank arises basel ii 88 barclays soloconsolidated position 881 barclays has confirmed to the fsa that the basel ii requirements for solo consolidation will continue to be met by both mhiml and bib iom and therefore they will continue to be solo consolidated under basel ii 89 wras 891 wras declaration of b prefs dividend wras should be marked on the resulting receivable under the forward with luxbank and will be modelled using standard probability of default loss given default maturity and exposure at default inputs 892 luxco is not part of the ukig therefore prima facie solus wras will be required to be marked on the c shares and the b prefs however since lp will pledge oecd securities as collateral in respect of luxcos obligations under the c shares and the b prefs this collateral should be taken into account when modelling the applicable risk weighting and should reduce it accordingly any unhedged exposure would be risk weighted at 100 810 large exposures 8101 the internal exposure on the c shares and the b prefs should continue to be mitigated since the lp portfolio pledged by lp should continue to qualify as eligible collateral 8102 any external exposure to luxbank in respect of the receivable under the forward should be calculated using the same ead as for wra purposes 8103 the large exposure discussed at 845 above in respect of any guarantee provided by barclays to the third party repo counterparties may be as high as 893m 14691m x 102 x 104 14691m depending on the results of the modelling approach adopted 811 barclays consolidated position 8111 under basel ii barclays should continue to consolidate uksub luxco and lp uksub and lp will be part of the ukig however luxco will not since bib iom invests debt in luxco which is outside the ukig and luxco invests in the equity of lp which is inside the ukig the ukig capital base should be increased 812 wras 8121 the risk weighting of the lp portfolio will be modelled using standard inputs under basel ii the definition of collateral still includes oecd sovereign securities however for longer dated oecd sovereign securities the applicable haircut may increase by up to 4 therefore the relevant haircut should be taken into account in calculating the loss given default input to the lp portfolio risk weighting calculation 8122 the risk weighting of the 11m luxco portfolio and in respect of the receivable under the forward once dividend has been declared on the b prefs will also be modelled using standard inputs formatted indent left 15 cmhanging 125 cm
