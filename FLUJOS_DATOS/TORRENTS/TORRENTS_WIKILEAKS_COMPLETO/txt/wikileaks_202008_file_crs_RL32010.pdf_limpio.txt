and will be 166 of the states total population illinois is one of the few states in th country that provides older persons and younger adults who meet the eligibility cr iteria with state entitlements to home and communitybased longterm care services both entitlements resulted from court cases that were brought to eliminate waiting lists for services the state funds the community care program for older adults and the home services program for persons with physical disabilities with co mbination of state general revenue funds and medicaid section 1915c waiver fund s the community care program uses contracted agencies for the provision of homemaker adult day care services and case management services in contrast the home services programs relies primarily on personal assistants whom

longterm care today while some advocates maintain that the federal government should play larger role in providing support for home and co mmunitybased care congress has not yet decided on whether or

face of long term care illinois introduction federal legislative perspective states choosing to modify their programs for longterm care face significant challenges financing of nursing home care has dominated long term care spending for decades the federal financing structure that created incentives to support institutional care reaches back to 1965 number of converging factors have supported reliance on nursing home spending prior to enactment of medicaid homes for the aged and other public institutions were financed by combination of direct payments made by individuals with their social security old age assistance oaa benefits nd vendor payments made by states with federal matching payments on behalf of individuals the kerrmills medical assistance to the aged maa program enacted in 1960 predecessor to medicaid allowed states to provide medical services including skilled nursing home services to persons who were not eligible for oaa cash payments thereby expanding the eligible population1 in 1965 when kerrmills was transforme d into the federalstate medicaid program congress created an entitlement to skilled nursing facility care under the expanded program the social security amendments of 1965 required that states provide skilled nursing facility services and gave nursing home care the same level of priority as hospital and physician rvices amendments in 1967 allowed states to provide care in intermediate care facilities icfs for persons who did not need skilled nursing home care but needed more than room and board in 1987

beginning in 1967 in fy2001 medicaid spent 531 billion on institutional care for nursing homes and care in intermediate care facilities for the mentally retardedeliminated the distinction between skilled nursing facilities and intermediate care facilities effective in 1990 as resu lt of these various amendments people eligible under the states medicaid plan ar entitled to nursing home facility care that is if person meets the states income and asset requirements as well as the states functional eligibility requirements for entry into nursing home he or she is entitled to the benefit these early legislative developments were the basis for the beginnings of the modern day nursing home industry signif icant growth in the number of nursing homes occurred during the 1960s from 1960 to 1970 the number of homes more than doubled from 9582 to almost 23000 and the number of beds more than tripled from 331000 to more than one million2 today there are about 17000 nursing homes with 18 million beds3 during the latter part of the 1960s and the 1970s nursing home care attracted great deal of congressional oversight as result of concern about increasing federal expenditures and pattern of instances of fraud and abuse that was becoming evident between 1969 and 1976 the subcommittee on longterm care of the senate special committee on aging held 30 hearings on problems in the nursing home industry4 home care services received some congressional attention in the authorizing statute home health care services were one of the optional services that states could provide under the 1965 law three years later in 1968 congress amended the law to require states to provide home health care services to persons entitled to skilled nursing facility care as part of th eir state medicaid plan s effective in 1970 during the 1970s the department of healt h education and welfare now health and human services dhhs devoted attention to alternatives to nursing home care through variety of federal

stitutions however it was not until 1981 that congress took significant legislative ac tion to expand home and communitybased services through medicaid when it aut horized the medicaid section 1915c home and communitybased waiver program under that authority known then as the section 2176 waiver program the secretary of dhhs may waive certain medi caid state plan requirements to allow states to cover wide range of home and communitybased services to persons who otherwise meet the states eligibility requirements for institutional care the waiver provision was designed to alter the fact that the medicaid program had emphasized institutional care rather than care in home and communitybased settings services under the section 1915c waiver incl ude case management personal care homemaker home health aide adult day care habilitati on environmental modifications among many others5 these services are covered as an option of states and under the law persons are not entitled to these

programs are unique in the nation because they provide older pers ons and younger adults who meet nursing home functional eligibility requirements with state entitlement to home and communitybased services the state funds the community care program for older adults and home services program for younger adults with physical disabilities with combination of medicaid secti on 1915c waiver and state funds entitlements for both groups resulted from c ourt cases that were brought against the state to eliminate waiting lists for rvices in 1982 the department on aging received an order from the us district court regarding the benson vs blaser case this class action suit focused on the lengthening waiting list for communitybased services for the elderly the court ruled that persons on the waiting list were as entitled to timely deter mination of eligibility and receipt of services as beneficiaries who applied earlier when waiting list existed the order required the department to resolve the waiting list immediately in effect changing the community care program into an entitlement the final court order mandated the following 1 determination of eligibility within 30 days 2 mailing of notice of eligibility to each applicant within 15 days of the date of eligibility determination and 3 provision of services within 15 days of when the notice was sent an entitlement to the home services program was created as result of judicial decision emerging from the mcmillan vs mccrimon case in 1992 the state was refusing to accept and process applications for the home services program as method to contain costs th us district court held th at the state could not refuse to process applications for the program because federal medicaid requirements state that all individuals have the opportunity to apply for medical ssistance the court also stated that it was not clear where the public interest lay because forcing home services applicants into nursing homes had the potential to increase the state budget more than receiving care under the home rvices program the practical result of this court holding was that the state must offer those eligible for nursing facility services the opportunity to enter the home services program if they choose to do so the community care program for persons age 60 and over state entitlement and medicaid 1915c waiver the

calculations based on data presented in david braddock et the state of the states in developmental disabilities fifth edition 1998 washington dc american association on mental retardation p 404 for 1990 data unpublished data furnished by richard hemp university of colorado for 2000 data issues in longterm care in illinois the following discussion highlights the issues raised in state reports collected for the project and the interviews with st ate officials and key stakeholders conducted during the site visit to illinois in the summer of 2002 state entitlement and maximizati on of federal medicaid dollars illinois has unique approach to longterm care compared to other states because it has programs that provide an entitlement to home and communitybased services for frail older persons and younger adu lts with physical disabilities community care and the home services program respectively these entitlements result from two court cases during the early 1980s and 1990s which were designed to eliminate delays in receipt of services for which people qualified the state programs do not have income eligibility re quirements but do have maximum level of nonexempt assets the community care program uses costsharing system for those non medicaid individuals whose income ex ceeds 100 of the fe deral poverty levelhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32010crs25 19 section 1917 of the medicaid statute the w specifies that recovery may be made only after the death of the individual and his or her surviving spouse and only at time when there is surviving child under age 21 or child with disabilitiesbefore 2002 illinois did not require community care and home services program beneficiaries to pply for medicaid the state covered the program costs of some beneficiaries who might have qualified for medicai d entirely from state funds in 2002 the state began requiring applicants for and current beneficiaries of both programs to apply for medicaid this action is part of the states efforts to maximize medicaid funding by using this programs opti ons to the fullest extent possible this medicaid maximization has occurred at least in part because of the budgetary crisis illinois has been facing according to persons interviewed for th is study some peopl have refused to apply for medicaid and have dropped out of the state entitlement program interviewees assume that people do not apply for medicaid because they object to being welfare recipients and want to avoid potential estate recovery under medicaid states are required to recover fro m the estate of an individual age 55 or older reimbursement for amounts paid by medicaid for nursing facility services home and communitybased services and related hospital and prescription drugs19 budget cuts illinois like many states is facing revenue shortfall according to state officials state fiscal year sfy 2002 revenue was about 400 million below what had been projected at the time of the site visit the state planned eligibility or service cuts in response to the budget crisis rather most medicaid providers including home health agencies and nursing facilities received 59 rate decrease for sfy2003 however waiver providers did not receive any cuts generally low payment rates are affecting some providers for example interviewees asserted that some adult day care sites are closing because payments are too low the dpa has also slowed its payments to providers to address the budget shortfall payment can be dela yed by up to 90 days dpa can do this because it is the only department of state government that is able to pay the priors years bills with current appropriations according to inte rviewees slow payments do not hit large forprofits as hard as smaller nonpr ofit providers who do not have existing relationships with creditors payments to providers from othe r departments are not delayed certification and licensing of facilities interviewees mentioned number of issues related to certification and licensing of longterm care facilities the first issue relates to nursing facility certification for participation in medicare and medicaid the federal survey process treats every nursing facility the same and some interviewees would like surveyors to spend more time on the facilities with poor pe rformance interviewee suggested that surveyors examine facilitys core conditions and if they find th at the facility is out of compliance in one of these areas they then go into more pth in that area without having to do full surveyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32010crs26 the second issue relates to licensure fo r assisted living f acilities alfs which began in december 2001 according to state officials 17 licenses have been issued and 105 facilities have pplied for licensure half of wh ich are located in the chicago area state officials timate that 300500 alfs may seek licensure and state officials may face an upsurge in applica tions as result increasing the supply of facilities but also increasing the workload of licensing staff labor issues most interviewees agreed that the labor shortage may be affecting the quality of longterm care with the recent economic problems and the resulting rise in unemploym ent facilities had found it eas ier to hire direct care workers however medicaid payment cuts for facilities may lead to reductions in staff salary and benefits and additional problems hiring workers facilities that have trouble hiring staff tend to rely on temporar staffing agencies the results can be lack of continuity of care which can ne gatively affect residents quality of life because the temporary staff are not familiar w ith residents needs rural areas tend to have less trouble hiring and keeping l ongterm care staff because facilities may be the only major employers in an area one of the ways in which providers have d ealt with the labor shortage is to bring in nationally recognized experts to provi facilities with info rmation about how to make facilities more homelike and better environment for longterm care workers labor shortages do not appear to be as much of problem for facilities serving those with developmental disabilities three reasons were given for this 1 these facilities pay staff more than nursing facilities 2 developmental disability workers are generally in smaller facilities with long staying residents where relationships between staff and residents have chan ce to develop over time and 3 these workers also do not have to deal with as much incontinence as nursing facility workers do however retention of workers is still challenge the state implemented an early retirem ent initiative for state employees in 2002 this initiative has reduced the number of veteran employees just as new governor came into office the state has also attempted to lay off employees but court decision halted these actions the home rvices program is an example of how limited number of state workers can affect program the program is serving 200 new beneficiaries month up from 70 m onth several years ago however the number of state staff has not kept pace with the growth in the number of beneficiaries consumer direction although consumer direction is incorporated into the basic structure of the home services program for younger adults with physical disabilities older persons have not had that option concern is that older adults many with cognitive impairments would not want to manage their own services and might be vulnerable to exploitation by their workers some interviewees recommended that the federal government bring together policymakers who have instituted consumerdirection for persons with developmental disabilities to determine if so of the techniques are transferable to persons with cognitive impairmenthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32010crs27 lack of adequate supported housing another issue raised relates to lack of affordable housing this is sign ificant barrier to recei pt of longterm care in the community according to interviewees people who have resided in nursing homes and lost their community residence may have difficulty going back to the community without access to affordable hous ing also since medicaid pays for room and board in nursing facilities and not in assisted or supportive living facilities people may be forced into nursing facilitieshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32010 crs28 appendix 1 major home and communitybased longterm care programs for the elderly and persons with disabilities in illinois program target groupfunctional
