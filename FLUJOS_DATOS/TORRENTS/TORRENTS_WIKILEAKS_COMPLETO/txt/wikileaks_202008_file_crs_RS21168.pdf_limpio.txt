it into law in 2009 the 111th congress will consider the new presidents annual funding request for the p eace corps in addition new re authorization effort is expected by many observers background founded in 1961 the peace corps has sought to meet its legislative mandate of promoting world peace and friendship by sending american volunteers to serve at the grassroots level in villages and towns in all corners of the globe living and working with ordinary people volunteers have contributed in variety of capacities such as teachers environmental specialists hea lth promoters and small busin ess advisers to improving the lives of those they serve and helping ot hers understand american culture they also seek to share their understanding of other countries with americans back home through

corps empowerment act s 732 dodd introduced on march 1 2007 and the subject of hearings held by the senate foreign re lations committee on july 25 2007 would have authorized appropriations for the

authorization and an increase in the readjustment allowance provided to peace corps volunteers for use on their return home from 125 per month of service to 225 because these previous legislative efforts represent concerns that are likely to resurface in some form in the 111th congress many of the provisions of s 732 are discussed belowhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21168crs3 issues peace corps funding despite its apparent popul arity in congress and 2002 expansion initiative by president bush to doubl its size within five years the peace corps has seen only 19 increase in end of fiscal year volunt eer numbers since 2002 meant to raise the number of volunteers from below 7000 in 2002 to 14000 in 2007 the initiative would have require d an appropriation of about 485 million by fy2007 more

fy2009 continuing resolution peace corps is funded at the fy2008 level the cr expires on march 6 2009 recruitment programming and support continual concern for congress over the years has been how the peace corp s addresses recruitme nt programming and support of volunteers the recruitment of volunteers with appr opriate skills and w illingness to live in unfamiliar and some times uncomfortable conditions is essential to the overall mission of the peace corps substantial spike in applicants and those expressing interest in applying since september 11 2001 has made it easier for the peace corps to meet its recruitment goals in fy2006 12242 app lied to be volunteers 8897 in fy2001 5148 were invited to join and 4095 b ecame trainees 3191 in fy2001 the agency however while adept at recruiting generalists and providing them with sufficient training to carry out useful ssignments has not emphasized the provision of highly skilled professionals such as doctors agronomists or engineers which many argue more accurately reflects the current needs of developing countries weighed against this view is the belief that the p eace corps is an agency of public diplomacy as much as it is development organization nd personal interaction and demonstration of us values is as important as providing technical expertise to accommodate more highly skilled personnel some say the peace co rps might have to change many existing practices including methods of recruitment training programming and perhaps even terms of service however in its mexico program launched in 2004 the peace corps hashttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21168crs4 1 peace corps congressional budget justification fy2008 p 218been able to provide more specialized technical volunteers offering skills in water and environmental engineering s 732 addressed one aspect of this issu by requiring the doubling by end of 2009 of the number of volunteers with at least five years relevant work experience it also would have required the creation of at least 20 sectorspecific programs in at least 20 different countries for which volunteers with five years rele vant work experience would be mandatory in response the peace corps ar gued that relevant work experience is subjective term and it would be burdensome both financially and administratively to set up such demonstration program without causing problems for the regular peace corps program director tsche tter has made an objective of increasing the number of volunteers aged 50 and older which some wo uld argue might lead to more relevant workexperienced volunteers currently less than 6 of volunteers are 50 or older to encourage applications by older people s 732 would have required the peace corps to try to get active retiree health plans suspended while volunteers are serving the peace corps has been criticized in the past for providing inadequate programming and support of volunteers this view was reflected in 1990 government accountability office gao investigation peace corps meeting the challenges of the 1990s may 1990 nsiad90122 it noted that some volunteers had little or nothing to do or had spent six or more months developing their own assignments without benefit of site visits by peace corps staff the gao attributed the programming problem to failure of planning evaluation and monitori ng systems since then the peace corps maintains that it has addressed these weakne sses with systematic approaches to project development annual project reviews and increased opportunities for site visits and volunteer feedback however volunt eer anecdotal accounts suggesting poor programming and staff support still occur although their frequency and depth are not known the 2006 volunteer survey found that between 16 and 28 of volunteers were dissatisfied with regard to site selection job assignme nt and administrative support1 one sign of volunteer dissatisfaction the resignation rate has improved in recent years however with 88 resigning in fy2006 versus 98 in fy2001 small projects funding peace corps volunteers generally are employed under the auspices of developing country gove rnment agency such as the ministry of education or agriculture or nongovernment organization in many cases volunteers initiate their own small projects to address specific concerns they have identified in their villages or schools some of these projects have been supported through ad hoc efforts of the volunteer but over time more formal spigots of funding ve been developed currently there are two key sources of smallscale funding for peace corps volunteer projects funds raised for the p eace corps partnership program by the peace corps office of private sector initiativ opsi and funds provided through an agreement with the us agency for international development usaid volunteers do not have the authority to accept funds on beha lf of the agency but can solicit funds from family and friends accepted through opsi in the last seven years peace corps volunteers received on average 1114 grants each year worth total of 20 million in usaidhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21168crs5 2 testimony of ronald tschetter to senate foreign relations committee subcommittee on western hemisphere peace corps and narcotics affairs july 25 2007funds annually roughly 1795 per grant in fy2006 opsi raised 14 million and supported projects that individually averaged 2952 in value projects take variety of forms acco rding to the peace corps 619 grant for village fish farm in bolivia funded construction of chain link fence the cleaning of excessive algae from the pool and introducti on of 250 fish 4241 grant at thailand health clinic provided gr oundfloor addition to ease access for senior citizens and the disabled s 732 sought to enhance volunteer effectiv eness in the field by providing volunteers with increased access to funding for these proj ect activities it would have authorized 1 of the agencys own appropriations in each fis cal year to be allocated for such purposes each award of seed funds would be limited to 1000 in opposition the peace corps argued that its introduction as source of pr oject income would possibly change the local perception of the volunteer as someone working with the community to learn how to obtain its own funding sources to one that sees the volunteer as source of cash2 volunteer administration in another effort to improve the quality of the peace corps program s 732 would ve enhanced the role volunt eers play in program design and implementation including s ite selection training curriculum and hiring of senior peace corps country personnel to achieve th is it would establish mechanism at the country level for soliciting the views of volunt eers on these issues further volunteer advisory committee would be established in each country to make recommendations to senior personnel currently according to the peace corps volunteers play role in site selection by providing feedback on site safety project success and counter part effectiveness volunteers are encouraged through interaction with senior staff to share their views in addition all posts have volunteer adviso ry committee the peace corps argues that to legislatively require such committees would trigger the federal advisory committee act faca and associated burde nsome administrative requirements third goal s 732 also would have provided support to returned volunteer efforts to meet the socalled third goal of the peace corps act promoting understanding of other peoples on the part of the american people by authorizing the peace corps to award grants to returned volunteers for educa tional and other programs meeting that goal the bill would have authorized 10 million each year for this purpose currently peace corps sponsors several th ird goal activities funded in total at about 18 million in fy2008 these include the coverdell world wide schools program noted above the peace corps fellows program through which more than 4000 returned volunteers have served as interns in highneed urban or rural us communities and the annual peace corps week in which t housands of returned volunteers visit schools and libraries around the country to present their peace corps experiencehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21168crs6 3 peace corps the safety of the volunteer 2005 and peace corps fy2008 congressional budget justification p 214security issues because they live and work at the grassroots level in developing countries peace corps volunteers appear to many americans to be especially vulnerable to crime even before september 11 2001 their safety and security had been prime concern of the peace corps the threat of antiamerican terrorism has increased those concerns these fears were further raised in 2003 when the dayton ohio daily news ran series of reports highlighting many form er volunteers say exaggerating the dangers potentially faced by volunteers and suggested th at the agency was failing in its obligation to provide adequate security as result congressional hearings were held and legislation was approved by the house hr 4060 june 2004 that sought to address some security concerns safety statistics kept by the peace corps both in absolute terms and when viewed in the context of incidents per 1000 volunteer years to account for the rise in number of volunteers in this period vary from year to year aggravated assaults went from 57 in 1993 9 per 1000 volunteer years to 102 in 1999 16 per 1000 volunteer years and then leveledoff to 87 cases 14 per 1000 volunteer years in 2002 there were 87 events in 2005 12 per 1000 reports of rape ro from 10 incidents in 1993 31 per 1000 female volunteer years to peak of 20 53 per 1000 female vol unteer year s in 1997 and decreased to 12 in 2002 32 per 1000 fe male volunteer years there were 16 reported rapes in 2005 39 per 1000 however the numbers are viewed since the number of events is small there may be some question as to whethe r apparent trends are significant these statistics also reflect volunteer reporting rate s which likely produce undercounting and they do not demonstrate whether volunteers are any more or less susceptible to assault than americans living in new york or des moines when surveyed in 2006 88 of volunteers reported that they fe lt usually or very safe where they lived3 in general the peace corps says that it gives the safety and security of its volunteers the highest priority it has been particularly concerned in recent years with threats of terrorism crime and civil strife and has responded by upgrading communications testing emergency action plans and other security measures evacuations and closure of missions to insure the wellbeing of volunteers in cases of political instability and civil unrest have constrained the growth of the peace corps in the past ten years volunteers have been evacuated from at least 27 count ries for these reasons including three attributed to the events of september 11 uzbekistan turkmenistan and the kyrgyz republic they have since returned to the latter two countries despite the appeal of using peace corps volunteers to convey us cultu re and values direc tly to the grassroots of islamic countries many of these countries of us foreign policy interest might be considered unsafe for american s over the foreseeable future nonetheless it should be noted that about 20 of all volunteers at this time are serving in 15 countries with muslim populations of over 40 in general the peace corps has argued that the close interpersonal relationship between volunteers and members of their host country community helps to make them safe
