collected in previous years the budget authority is 5 more than the previous fiscal year but is less than the 1527 million expected to be collected in patent and trademark fees in fy2003 the administrations fy2004 budget would provide the uspto with the authority to spend 1203 million from fees collected in that fiscal year in addition the administration is proposing legislation to change the statutory fee structure to raise an additional 201 million to be spent by the office the expected 1404 million in budget authority is 100 million less than the anticipated 1504 million fee collection for fy2004 since 1990 appropriation measures have limited the patent and trademark offices use of the full amount of fees collected in each fiscal year this is an area of controversy opponents argue that since agency operations are supported by payments for services the total amount of these collections should be available to provide for those services in the year the expenses are incurred proponents of the current approach maintain that the fees are necessary to balance the budget and that the level of fees appropriated back to the uspto are sufficient to cover operating

funding for fy2003 also included 574 million for the weather satellites system nesdis and 760 million for the national weather service to ensure better weather forecasting the national institute of standards and technology nist received 7121 million in appropriations for fy2003 an increase of almost 5 above fy2002 included in this figure is 3594 million for intramural rd performed under the scientific and technical research and services strs account 180 million for the advanced technology program atp 1066 million for the manufacturing extension partnership mep and 661 million for construction funding for activities under the strs account is 12 above the previous fiscal year while support for atp and mep remain fairly constant the bush administrations fy2004 budget request includes 4968 million for nist 30 less than the fy2003 appropriation the major portion of this decreased funding is due to significant cuts in support for the advanced technology program and the manufacturing extension partnership two extramural programs operated by nist the 27 million requested for atp is to cover ongoing commitments new projects would be funded the 126 million for mep is to finance the operation of centers that have not reached 6 years of federal support14 internal 14 for additional information see crs report 97104 manufacturing extension partnership program an overview by wendy h schacht crs29 agency rd under the strs account would receive 3876 million an increase of 8 over the previous fiscal year the construction budget would be 696 million15 continued support for the advanced technology program has been major funding issue16 atp provides seed financing matched by private sector investment to businesses or consortia including universities and government laboratories for development of generic technologies that have broad applications across industries opponents of the program cite it as prime example of corporate welfare whereby the federal government invests in applied research activities that they maintain should be conducted by the private sector the clinton administration defended atp arguing it assisted businesses and small manufacturers develop technologies that while crucial to industrial competitiveness would not or could not be developed by the private sector alone since fy2000 the initial appropriation bills passed by the house have contained further funding for atp although the program has continued to receive funding in the final versions of the appropriations bills the bush administrations fy2004 budget proposal once again would eliminate the program the office of the undersecretary for technology and the office of technology policy otp was funded at 99 million in fy2003 21 increase over the previous fiscal year the bush administrations fy2004 budget calls for funding otp at 8 million for fy2003 the national telecommunications and information administration ntia received 737 million including 155 million for the technology opportunities program top grants the administration had requested the elimination of the top grants in fy2003 436 million for the public telecommunications facilities planning and construction ptfpc program and 147 million for salaries and expenses for fy2004 the bush administration has proposed that ntia receive 214 million down from 737 million appropriated for fy2003 much of this change would come from the bush administrations intent to eliminate funding in fy2004 for top and to suspend the ptfpc program by giving it 3 million to finish ongoing projects while critics of the top grants contend that the program has achieved its objectives of funding pilot programs in areas that do not have easy or direct access to the internet or highspeed telecommunications supporters maintain that the program is very important to closing the digital divide for ptfpc the bush administration would like the corporation for public broadcasting to pick up responsibility of this program which in recent years has supported conversion of public broadcast transmission to digital finally the bush administration has proposed that salaries and expenses for ntia the third part of the administrations budget be 188 million for fy2004 the government performance and results act gpra enacted by congress in 1993 pl 10362 107 stat 285 required that agencies

process brief explanation by wendy h schacht the judiciary background typically title iii of the cjs appropriation covers funding for the judiciary by statute 31 usc 1105 b the judicial branchs budget is accorded protection from presidential alteration thus when the president transmits proposed federal budget to congress he must forward the judicial branchs proposed budget to congress unchanged that process has been in operation since 1939 the total appropriation for the judiciary in fy2002 was 471 billion the judiciary budget consists of more than 10 separate accounts two of these accounts fund the supreme court of the united states one covering the courts salary and operational expenses and the other covering expenditures for the care of its building and grounds traditionally in practice dating back to the 1920s one or more of the courts justices appear before either house or senate appropriations subcommittee to address the budget requirements of the supreme court for the upcoming fiscal year focusing primarily on the courts salary and operational expenses subsequent to their testimony the architect of the capitol submits request for the courts building and grounds account17 although it is at the apex of the federal judicial system the supreme court represents only very small share of the judiciarys overall funding for fy2002 the total appropriations enacted for the supreme courts two accounts 1075 million were less than 23 of the judiciarys overall appropriation of 471 billion the rest of the judiciarys budget provides funding for the lower federal courts and for related judicial services among the lower court accounts one dwarfs 17 by authority of the act of may 7 1934 pl 73211 the architect of the capitol is responsible for the structural and mechanical care of the supreme court building including care of its grounds the architect however is not charged with responsibility for custodial care which is under the jurisdiction of the marshal of the supreme court crs33 all others the salaries and expenses account for the us courts of appeals and district courts the account however covers not only the salaries of circuit and district judges including judges of the territorial courts of the united states but also those of retired justices and judges us court of federal claims bankruptcy and magistrate judges and all other officers and employees of the federal judiciary not specifically provided for by other accounts other accounts for the lower courts include defender services for compensation and reimbursement of expenses of attorneys appointed to represent criminal defendants fees of jurors the us court of international trade the administrative office of the us courts the federal judicial center charged with furthering the development of improved judicial administration and the us sentencing commission an independent commission in the judicial branch which establishes sentencing policies and practices for the courts the annual judiciary budget request for the courts is presented to the house and senate appropriations subcommittees after being reviewed and cleared by the judicial conference the federal court systems governing body these presentations typically made by the chairman of the conferences budget committee are separate from subcommittee appearances justice makes on behalf of the supreme courts budget request the judiciary budget does not appropriate funds for three special courts in the us court system the us court of appeals for the armed forces funded in the department of defense appropriations bill the us tax court funded in the treasury postal service appropriations bill and the us court of appeals for veterans claims funded in the department of veteran affairs and housing and urban development appropriations bill construction of federal courthouses also is not funded within the judiciarys budget the usual legislative vehicle for funding federal courthouse construction is the treasury postal service appropriations bill for more details on individual appropriations for judiciary functions see the appendix fy2003 funding issues overview of the judiciarys budget request for fy2003 the fy2003 appropriations bill hrept 10810 provided 492 billion for the judiciary roughly 324 million below the requested level but 197 million above the fy2002 amount earlier in the 108th congress the senate had set total funding for the judiciary at 495 billion compared with 497 billion in houseintroduced bill for more detail on 108th house and senate funding levels see table at the end of this section and in the appendix for fy2003 the judiciary had requested 524 billion in total funding more than three quarters of this amount 4 billion was to be in the judiciarys largest account salaries and expenses for the courts of appeals district courts and other judicial services the fy2003 omnibus appropriations bill provided 38 billion for this account 56 increase over fy2002 funding of 36 billion crs34 in keeping with the judiciarys request the omnibus fy2003 appropriations bill provided increases for all of the other judiciary accounts except for two the supreme courts building and grounds account and judicial retirement funds18 in separate bill congress also agreed to the judiciarys request for costofliving salary adjustment for federal judges and justices that request as well as those for the supreme court and for two of the judiciarys other larger accounts court security and defender services are discussed in the following paragraphs19 supreme court the budget request of the supreme court for fy2003 as customary was in two parts for its first account salaries and expenses the court had requested 463 million 158 over fy2002 budget authority20 the enacted fy2003 appropriations bill provided 457 million roughly 600000 below the requested level but 57 million above the fy2002 amount for the courts second account care of the building and grounds the fy2003 omnibus bill provided 416 million roughly 12 million below the requested level21 and 26 million below the fy2002 amount however house and senate conferees p 734 of hrept 10810 said that they understood that these additional obligations of 12 million will occur in subsequent fiscal years and therefore may be budgeted in those fiscal years court security the enacted fy2003 omnibus appropriation bill provided 2684 million for this account which is roughly 298 million below the requested level and 477 million above the fy2002 level conferees for the fy2003 bill p 736 of hrept 10810 noted that court security is unique account appropriated to the judiciary but primarily managed by the department of justice the conferees said they expected the director of the us marshals service to provide the same level of budgetary and program oversight to this program as programs appropriated directly to the us marshals service 18 the fy2003 appropriations bill provided the same amount for judicial retirement funds as that requested by the judiciary 353 million 46 decrease from fy2002 19 for more information fy2003 funding for the judiciary see congressional record daily edition vol 149 feb 12 2003 book ii p h932 20 most of the requested increase 40 million the court said was to fund adjustments to base and maintain current services the rest of the increase 23 million was for program increases including 16 million for automation enhancements 21 in its fy2003 budget submission the court had specified that 498 million of its 536 million request would be carried forward from fy2002 and retained in the budget base on year basis for the supreme court building modernization project the request for decreased appropriation for this account in fy2003 followed the fy2002 enacted appropriation of 375 million and an emergency supplemental of 300 million provided for security the two separate appropriations according to the judiciary allowed 638 million to be made available for the court buildings modernization project in fy2002 in addition the court requested second emergency fy2002 appropriation of 10 million for its building and grounds account to pay for court perimeter security enhancements the 10 million as requested was included in the supplemental appropriations bill hr 4775 which was signed into law pl 107206 on august 2 2002 the fy2003 omnibus bill provided additional funds from fy2002 emergency supplemental appropriations crs35 the judiciary had requested 2982 million 72 increase which it explained included 456 million for the annualized recurring costs associated with increased court security officer hours additional deputy us marshals and enhanced screening all of which were implemented subsequent to the september 11 2001 terrorist attacks in new york city and washington dc the largest requested program increase of 54 million would fund perimeter security improvements at federal court courthouses besides seeking funding for court security in its regular annual appropriation the judiciary since september 11 2001 had obtained emergency supplemental funding of 2782 million appropriated for court security in fy2002 772 million came from emergency supplemental funding to enhance security at federal court facilities nationwide of the 772 million 197 million was provided by the president through an emergency allocation on october 17 2001 and 575 million came from the supplemental signed by the president on january 10 2002 pl 107 117 subsequently on july 19 2002 another emergency supplemental bill hr 4775 was approved by housesenate conferees which included additional funding for court security measures though not in the judiciarys court security account following its approval in conference hr 4775 was passed by the house and senate on july 23 and 24 2002 respectively and signed into law pl 107206 on august 2 2002 as noted above hr 4775 included 100 million to address the supreme court buildings perimeter security needs in addition the supplemental bill included 71 million for increased costs associated with terroristrelated trials in alexandria va boston and new york city the 71 million appropriation was to go to the judiciarys courts of appeals district courts and other judicial services salaries and expenses account of the 71 million 52 million was for perimeter security enhancements such as protective window film for courts with terrorist trials and 19 million for costs associated with the closed circuit transmission of the criminal trial of zacarias moussaoui to victims of the september 11 2001 attacks22 defender services this account funds the operations of the federal public defender and community defender organizations and the compensation reimbursement and expenses of private practice panel attorneys appointed by the courts to serve as defense counsel to indigent individuals accused of federal crimes the fy2003 omnibus bill provided 5385 million which is roughly 502 million below the request but 378 million above the fy2002 amount 22 the 71 million amount appropriated in hr 4775 specifically for federal courts with terroristrelated trials was much less than what the judiciary sought for its court security account in the supplemental legislation specifically the judiciary requested 240 million for protective film or laminate for windows in federal courthouses throughout the country conferees for hr 4775 also declined to approve the judiciarys request for 857000 for security improvements at the us court of appeals for the federal circuit in washington dc the conferees said they strongly supported the security needs of the federal circuit court and understood that the general services administration gsa was working with the court to provide for its security needs crs36 earlier the judiciary had sought 5888 million 176 increase nearly all of the requested increase 875 million according to the judiciary consisted of adjustments to base to maintain current services specifically of that overall amount 301 million would annualize in fy2003 the hourly increase in the pay rate of panel attorneys approved by congress in the fy2002 cjsjudiciary bill23 another 171 million in requested funding would increase the hourly panel attorney rate from 90 to 113 effective april 1 2003 in its fy2003 budget submission to congress the judiciary termed the requested 171 million increase as an adjustment to base rate adjustment rather than program increase the judiciary explained that under the criminal justice act as revised in 1986 the judicial conference is authorized to make annual adjustments to the panel attorney hourly pay rate accordingly funding to increase the hourly rate to 113 the judiciary said would ensure that it would not be further eroded by inflation conferees for the fy2003 omnibus bill explained in hrept 10810 p 735 that their agreement included an increase as requested by the judiciary of 301 million to annualize the panel attorney rate increase provided in fy2002 they noted however that their agreement did not include the requested additional funding for an increase in the pay rate for panel attorneys to 113 an hour24 costofliving increase in judges and justices salaries the ethics reform act of 1989 pl 101194 sec 704 created statutory mechanism under which judges and other federal officials are to receive an annual salary adjustment based on the employment cost index eci effective january 1 however under the provisions of pl 9792 sec 140 such annual adjustments for the judiciary must be specifically approved by congress because the 107th congress adjourned without enacting the permissive language the january 2003 salary adjustment of 31 which went into effect for members of congress and other legislative and executive branch officials did not go into effect for the judiciary subsequently however pl 1086 hr 16 108th congress was enacted providing that the judges would receive the pay increase retroactive to january 1 200325 23 for fy2001 the pay rate for panel attorneys was 75 incourt and 55 outofcourt in most locations which the judiciary said was well below the amount the attorneys needed just to cover their overhead costs in response congress agreed on an fy2002 increase in panel attorney pay to 90 per hour both in and outofcourt effective later than may 1 2002 24 the requested additional funding for pay rate increase was turned down they said because of the uncertainties between localities the size of the increase approved in fiscal year 2002 and the level of funding required to annualize this increase in fiscal year 2003 25 for more detailed discussion of judicial salary policies see crs report rs20278 judicial salarysetting policy by sharon s gressle on february 20 2003 president bush signed the consolidated appropriations resolution 2003 h j res 2 108th congress as passed by the senate that measure would have authorized the receipt of the pay raise by the judiciary sec 304 however that section was excised in conference the situation was further complicated because sec 637 provided an increase in the january 2003 salary adjustment for general schedule gs employees and that could have an impact on judicial salaries under the ethics reform act as amended the salaries of officials are limited to the rate of adjustment in basic pay for the gs the eci adjustment for officials salaries continued crs37 earlier in july 2002 the senate appropriations committee had recommended and provided 8 million in funding for 41 costofliving increase in the salaries of lower federal court judges and supreme court justices s 2778 sec 304 prior to the senate committee action the judiciary in its fy2003 budget submission had requested 70 million to fund 26 costofliving increase for judges and justices consistent with the expected 2003 salary adjustment for federal employees26 the fy2003 pay adjustment follows similar upward adjustments in judges and justices salaries which congress approved in fiscal years 2002 2001 2000 1998 and 1993 congress however declined to authorize such adjustments for fy1999 or for fiscal years 1994 through 1997 as part of the budget process the government performance and results act gpra enacted by congress in 1993 pl 10362 107 stat 285 requires that agencies develop strategic plans

william h rehnquist who maintained that more than costof living adjustment was needed in the way of judicial salary increase the chief justice cited the relatively low pay that federal judges receive

security and meeting the needs of the most urgent embassy security projects the house level was the same as the administration for both worldwide security upgrades accounts while the senate set 579

expenses of personnel as well as support for us diplomatic activities around the world secretary powell testified that while the department did get congressional approval and funding last year to increase hiring by 360 general staff 186 security professionals and technical experts in 2002 staffing gaps continue to exist the fy2003 state department request included funding for 631 new positions that would amount to an increase in new hires of crs43 more than 1100 within two years the house level for nonsecurity dcp funding equaled 32693 million and the senate level was 30421 million congress passed the house level in the omnibus budget bill the capital investment fund cif which was established in 1994 provides for purchasing information technology and capital equipment to ensure efficient management coordination operation and utilization of states resources for many years state department officials have testified that the departments technology problems ranging from archaic telephones

ability worldwide to communicate with each other or with state department headquarters in washington dc the fy2003 request equaled 177 million the house set the same level as the administration request while the senate recommended higher level of 210 million congress enacted 183 million for cif in the final bill educational and cultural exchange programs include programs such as the

million the senate level was enacted by congress the administration requested 726 million for international peacekeeping 1182 million less than the fy2002 level which would provide funding for ongoing peacekeeping activities in kosovo east timor africa and the middle east funds would also support war crimes tribunals for yugoslavia and rwanda the lower request reflected lower peacekeeping assessment rate and project terminations or reduction of operations in specified areas the administration requested that 15 of cipa funds be provided as twoyear funding because of the unpredictability of requirements for this account from yeartoyear within the crs44 supplemental request the administration sought an additional 43 million for cipa to meet the us share of projected increases in peacekeeping operations congress provided 23 million for the supplemental request for this account the house funding level was identical to the administrations request the senate recommended 6737

activities are appropriate for federally funded legal aid attorneys to undertake in annual appropriations laws congress traditionally has included legislative provisions restricting the activities of lscfunded grantees such as prohibiting representation in certain types of cases or conducting any lobbying activities congress appropriated 3293 million for lsc for fy2002 this was identical to the

commission eeoc the commission enforces laws banning employment discrimination based on race color national origin sex age or disability the eeocs workload has increased dramatically since the agency was created under title vii of the civil rights act of 1964 passage of the americans with disabilities act of 1990 and the civil rights act of 1991 as well as employees growing awareness of their rights have made it difficult for the agencys budget and staffing resources to keep pace with its heightened caseload congress approved 279 million for the agencys fy1999 budget an increase of 37 million the following year the appropriation rose minimally to 282 million but the commission received 21 million increase for fy2001 303 million despite this funding pattern the eeoc was able to reduce by about 70 the backlog of private sector charges from high of 111000 in mid1995 and to reduce the average processing time for private sector charges to 216 days the latter was largely due to the commissions expanded use of alternative dispute resolution adr procedures eg mediation the congress complied with president bushs request for 3104 million for fy2002 an increase of 72 million to allow the agency to further enhance its record in its private sector program and to make improvements in its federal sector program among other things the commission was directed to continue reducing the backlog of private sector discrimination charges 32481 in fy2001 it expressed concern about the still high level of these charges and expected the agency to exceed the small 6 backlog reduction assumed in the administrations budget request the bush administrations budget request of 3235 million for the eeoc for fy2003 included 147 million to fund the agencys full share of federal employee retirement costs as part of the administrations governmentwide proposal without this cost the fy2003 budget request was 3088 million the commission had anticipated achieving 121 reduction in the backlog of private sector charges and had expected to deal with the 16 million decrease from its fy2002 appropriation through efficiencies realized from workforce restructuring the 108th congress approved 3088 million budget for the eeoc for fy2003 or 16 million less than for fy2002 the conferees expressed concern about budget shortfall for the year unless the commission is able to realize savings in salaries expenses and other operational costs toward that end the eeoc must submit to the appropriations committees within 60 days of the bills enactment financial plan that includes steps the commission will take to stay within its fy2003 crs49 appropriation level as continuing reflection of the importance congress places on the work of state and local fair employment practice agencies fepas 330 million of the commissions appropriation is to go toward their funding and permit contract rate of 500 per charge the conferees encouraged the eeoc to use the fepa experience with mediation as the commission expands its adr programs commission on civil rights the commission collects and studies information on discrimination or denials of equal protection of the laws it received an appropriation of 89 million in fy2000 and fy2001 the fy2002 enacted level is 91 million the presidents request for fy2003 was to continue funding at 91 million federal communications commission fcc
