federal role david m bearden specialist in environmental policy resources science and industry division summary community perceptions of increasing exposure to noise from wide array of sources have raised questions about the role of the federal government in regulating noise and the adequacy of existing standards the role of the federal government in regulating noise has remained fairly constant overall since the enactment of the noise control act in 1972 pl 92574 with authorities under this and other related statutes the federal governme nt has established and enfo rces standards for maximum sound levels generated from airc raft and airports federally funded highways interstate motor carriers and railroads medium and heavyduty trucks motorcycles and mopeds workplace activities and portable air comp ressors the federal government also regulates human exposure to noise in federa lly funded housing in more recent years the federal role has expanded to include regulation of noise generated by human activities on public lands incl uding national parks st ate and local governments determine the extent to which other s ources of noise are regulated including commercial industrial and residential activities although noise standards generally provide level of protection sufficient to prevent human hearing loss they vary among individual sources in terms of what level of sound is permi ssible this report explains potential effects of various s ound levels describes the role of the federal government in regulating noise characterizes existing federal standards discusses the role of state and local governments and ex amines relevant issues introduction according to the national institute on deafness and other communication disorders exposure to loud sounds is res ponsible for hearing impairment in 10 million of the nearly 30 million people with hearing loss in the united states and another 30 million people are daily exposed to dangerous noise levels many individuals are also regularly exposed to sound levels that may not lead to hearing loss but can be intrusive and impair ones quality of life several federal laws require the federal government to maintain standards for various sources of noise however the standards do vary in stringency among individual sources lthough there is some variance among thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20531crs2 standards all of them limit so und levels at least to gree that would prevent human hearing loss the responsibility for setting and enforcing noise control standards is divided among multiple federal agencies in the past the environmental protection agency epa coordinated all federal noise control activities through its office of noise abatement and control however congress phased out the ffices funding in fy1983 as part of shift in federal noise control polic to transfer the primary re sponsibility for regulating noise to state and local governments althoug h epa longer plays prominent role in regulating noise its past sta ndards and regulations remain in effect and other federal agencies continue to set and enforce noise standards for sources within their regulatory jurisdiction public interest in the federal regulation of noise and the adequacy of existing standards continues to be strong especially among communities where sources of noise have proliferated and as re sidential developmen t has resulted in people living closer to sources of noise considering that existing standards generally are protective against hearing loss the primary concern among the public has been whether the standards should be tightened to protect the quality of lif in communities where sound levels may be perceived as annoying or intrusive but not necessarily harmful to human hearing potential effects of various sound levels and the roles of federal state and local governments in regulating individual s ources of noise are discussed below how loud is too loud sound is measured in units of decibels dba and an increase of 10 dba represents sounds that are perceived to be twice as l oud there is broad consensus among regulators in the united states that constant or repeat ed exposure to sound levels in the vicinity of 90 dba and higher can lead to hearing loss exposure to sounds significantly below these levels are generally not considered harmful to human hearing however most individuals perceive unwanted sound above 65 dba to be intrusive which can impair ones quality of life depending on the sensitivity of the individual and the frequency and duration of exposure some also argue that persistent exposure to intrusive sound may have certain physiological effects such as headaches or nausea even though ones hearing ability may not be impaired there also have been some questions about the vibr ationinduced effects of low frequency sound which can be felt but not heard what sources of noise are s ubject to federal regulation the noise control act of 1972 pl 92574 and several other fe deral laws require the federal government to set and enforce noise standards for ai rcraft and airports interstate motor carriers and railroads workplace activities engines and certain types of equipment federally funded highway projects and federally funded housing projects the noise control act also requires federal agencies to comply with all federal state and local noise requirements various federal laws and regulations governing the administration of park and recreational nds owned by the federal government also provide authorities for agencies to regulate noise that would be generated from human activities on and in the vicinity of these landshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20531crs3 1 49 usc 44715 2 49 usc 47528 3 14 cfr 36 4 70 federal register 38742 5 71 federal register 528most federal noise standards focus on preventing hearing loss by limiting exposure to sounds of 90 dba and higher some federa l standards are stricter and focus on limiting exposure to lower levels of around 65 dba to protect quality of life whether qualityof life standards should be tightened has been an ongoing issue particularly among communities located near transportation sources such as airports and highways where exposure to noise is daily or routine occu rrence as noted above there also have been some questions about the effects of low fre quency sound but so far noise standards in the united states have not regulated low frequency sound below the threshold of human hearing major existing federal standards th at regulate human exposure to noise and the agencies responsible for setting and enforcing them are discussed below aircraft and airports the aircraft noise abat ement act of 1968 pl 90411 requires the federal aviation administration f aa to develop and enforce standards for aircraft noise1 in developing these standards the faa generally follows noise limits recommended by the international civil av iation organization icao federal noise regulations define aircraft according to four noise classes stage 1 stage 2 stage 3 and stage 4 stage 1 aircraft are the loudest and stage 4 are the quietest all stage 1 aircraft have been phased out of co mmercial operation and all unmodified stage 2 aircraft over 75000 pounds were phased out by december 31 1999 as required by the airport noise and capacity act of 1990 pl 101508 title ix subtitle d2 stage 3 aircraft must meet separate standards for runway takeoffs landings and si delines ranging from 89 to 106 dba depending on the aircrafts we ight and its number of engines3 stage 4 standards are stricter and require furthe r reduction of 10 dba overall re lative to stage 3 standards the stage 4 standards are relatively new and are based on standards that the icao adopted in june 2001 referred to as chapter 4 in icao parlance the faa finalized these standards in july 20054 adopting the icao standards by reference the stage 4 standards apply to newly manuf actured subsonic jet airpla nes and subsonic transport category large airplanes for which new design is submitted for airworthiness certification on or after january 1 2006 as the ma jority of jet aircraft designed in recent years are already quiet enough to attain the stage 4 standards some have commented that the impact of the stricter standards on most aircraft manufacturers may be less significant than otherwise the icao also had reco mmended separate sta ndards for propeller driven small airplanes the faa fi nalized these standards in january 20065 they apply to newly manufactured prope llerdriven small aircraft for which new design is submitted for airworthiness certifi cation on or after february 3 2006 in addition to aircraft certif ication standards airports receiving federal funds are required to meet noise control standards fo r their operation the standards range from 65 dba for airports adjacent to residential areas to over 85 dba for those adjacent to landshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20531crs4 6 14 cfr

improvement act of 1982 pl 97248 established the air port improvement prog ram aip to provide federal assistance for airport construction projects and to award grants for mitigating noise resulting from the expansion of airport capacity airport operators applying for such grants must design noise exposure maps and develop mitigation programs to ensure that noise levels are compatible with adjacent land uses interstate motor carriers the noise control act re quired epa to develop noise standards for motor carriers engaged in interstate commerce and it authorized the federal highway administration to enforce them7 all commercial vehicles over 10000 pounds are subject to standards for highway travel and stationary operation but the standards do not apply to sounds from horns or sirens wh operated as warning devices for safety purposes8 for highway travel the standards range from 81 to 93 dba depending on the speed of the vehicle and the distance from which the sound is measured the standards for stationary operation are similar and range from 83 to 91 dba depending on the distance from the vehicle th standards apply at any time or condition of highway grade vehicle load accelera tion or deceleration interstate railroads the noise control act required epa to establish noise standards for trains and railway stations engaged in interstate commerce and the law authorized the federal railroad administration fra to enforce those standards9 there are separate standards for locomotives railway cars and railway station activities such as car coupling10 for locomotives built before 1980 noise is limited to 73 dba in stationary operation and at idle speeds and is limited to 96 dba at cruising speeds the standards for locomotives built after 1979 ar stricter and limit noise in stationary operation and at idle speeds to 70 dba and at cruising speeds to 90 dba noise from railway cars must not exceed 88 dba at speeds of 45 miles per hour mph or less and must not surpass 93 dba at speeds greater than 45 mph noise from car coupling activities at railway stations is limited to 92 dba there are uniform noise standards th at control sounds from locomotive horns whistles or bells when they are operated as warning devices for safety purposes however in response to concerns about noi from horns in communities located near railways the fra finalized regulations in 200511 and modified them in 200612 allowing such communities to designate quiet zones within these zones communities could prohibit the routine sounding of locomotive hor ns designation of these zones is subject to certain conditions including that there w ould be significant risk of loss of life or risk of serious personal injury resu lting from the lack of horn

noise exposure must not exceed 90 dba over 8 hours the highest s ound level to which workers can constantly be exposed is 115 dba and exposure to this level must not exceed 15 minutes within an 8hour period the standards limit instantaneous exposure such as impact noise to 140 dba if noise levels exceed these standards employers are required to provide hearing protection equipment to workers in orde r to reduce sound exposure to acceptable limits in april 2007 the department of labor proposed regulations that would require minors to wear hearing protection devices when working with wood processing machinery15 engines and certain types of equipment the noise control act directed epa to set and enforce noise standards fo r motors and engines and transportation construction and ectrical equipment16 with this authority epa established standards for motorcycles and mopeds medium and heavyduty trucks over 10000 pounds and portable air compressors the standards for mo torcycles only apply to those manufactured after 1982 and range from 80 to 86 dba depe nding on the model year and whether the motorcycle is designed fo r street or offroad use17 noise from mopeds is limited to 70 dba the standards for trucks over 10000 pounds only apply to those manufactured after 1978 and range from 80 to 83 dba depending on the model year18 these standards are separate from those for interstate motor carriers noise from portable air compressors is limited to 76 dba19 federally funded highway projects the federalaid highway act of 1970 pl 91605 required the federal highway ad ministration fhwa to develop standards for highway noise levels that are compatible with adjacent land uses20 the law prohibits the approval of federa l funding for highway projects that do not incorporate measures to attain these standards which range from 52 to 75 dba depending on adjacent land use21 among the most common method to attain thes standards is to er ect physical barrier ie noise wall between the highway and the adjacent land federally funded housing projects under general authorities provided by the housing and urban deve lopment act of 1968 pl 90448 the department of

housing include the installation of doors and windows designed to diminish the transmission of sound the insertion of noiseblocking insulation within walls and the use of thicker walls and floors in new construction federal park and recreational lands various federal laws and regulations governing the administration of park and recreational lands owned by the federal government also provide authorities for agencies to regulate noise that would be generated from human activities on and in the vicinity of these lands for example the national park service has included noise standards in its regulations governing the operation of vessels on waters within all national parks24 certain regulations also govern noise from specific sources in particular parks and recreational areas for example the faa has promulgated regulations limiting noise from aircraft operations in the vicinity of grand canyon national park25 these and other restrictions have been motivated by rising interest among recreational us ers in maintaining the serene qualities of public lands for their enjoyment however there have been conflicting desires betw een recreational users who seek quieter environment and those users whose preferred recreational activities would be restricted because of the noise those activitie s would generate noise reduction devices the federal government so is responsible for rating consumer devices designed to be worn by individuals to reduce exposure to potentially harmful or intrusive sound levels the ise control act authorized epa to require labels for products that reduce noise26 under this authority epa established noise reduction ratings for noise reduction devices such as head gear and ear plugs manufacturers are required to use these ra tings to identify the reduction of sound in decibels that the user would experience when wearing these devices27 what is the state and local role in controlling noise the federal role in regula ting noise is prima rily limited to transportation workplace activities certain types of quipment and human activities on public lands owned by the federal government state and local govern ments determine the extent to which other sources of noise are controlle d and regulations for such sources can vary widely among localities further some states do not directly regulate noise but allow local governments to play the primary role sources of noise commonly regulated at the state and local level include commercial i ndustrial and residen tial activities regulations for such sources typically control the publics exposure to noise by limiting certain activities to specific times such as construction noise only during business hours public concern about differing state and local control of noise s led some to suggest that the federal role should be expanded to regulate greater vari ety of sources uniformly across the country
