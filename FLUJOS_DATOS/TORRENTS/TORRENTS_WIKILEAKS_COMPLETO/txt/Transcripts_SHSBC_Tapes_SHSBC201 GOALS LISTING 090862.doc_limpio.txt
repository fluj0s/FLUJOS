goals listing lecture given on 9 august 1962 thank you well this is lecture two saint hill special briefing course 9 august whats the year audience 1962 ad 12 ad 12 all right thank you and what im going to talk to you about is just technically just listing listing how to list in the beginning there was the model session now what do you do in listing that is different than any other auditing well you prepcheck the object of and the lines of the auditing command every session beginning with fast check got it and i think if you do that your number of items that you need to list out goal will materially diminish i think youll find it saves its time over and over and over and over so lets put in the rudiments the beginning rudiments bangety bangetybang and say the pcs goal and tobeatiger it in other words get the middle ruds in on it fast get it to firing if we can of course we go just so far this thing is going to start firing latent and its going to expire one way or the other but after all it is our target and to run somebody endlessly with his goal suppressed and invalidated and all that sort of thing is liable to require large number of additional items and all kinds of other things in the session dont you see other things might go wrong you might even waste whole session and not even recognize that you have wasted one all right now the auditing command of course is the whowhat lines of which there are four now im not going to try to give you wording of the whowhat lines and say that will forever and always be true first you have finding the goal in 3ga and proving it out and then you get to listing and in actual fact the first step of listing is to find lines that fit the goal now youve got picture that you must comply with and the picture is an outflow arrow and an inflow arrow arrows pointing at one another draw circle for the pc and then draw line going out from him and then the arrow ends and then draw another line extending that one but its arrow ends are in toward the first arrow and then you have the retarding arrow of the first line and then you have the retarding arrow of the second line and theyre just arrows alongside the other two arrows going the opposite direction in other words you got four arrows here one is going out from the pc and one is going in toward the pc and then youve got the other pair of arrows further out the first one is in toward the pc and the other one is out away from the pc now the auditing command that you want simply matches up the four basic flows now you see there could be 16 flows listed there could be 32 flows listed there could be 128 flows listed dont you see you could list and list oh wow but staying with four is the most economical as far as we know at this particular time but those four must be meaningful to the pc theyve got to make sense to the pc now we want to know we want to know the first line is who or what would have it want it have it i dont care which one you use thats as far as the goal is concerned then who or what would oppose it see thats your outer arrow pointing in toward the first arrow who or what would oppose it now weve got to have specifically who or what would keep you from performing it or doing it you see and then weve got to find out who or what would oppose its being opposed now how you get these words to go together is remarkable and so forth but they must fire now the goal has rocket read and then so must the lines youve got to have read on those lines and the read on these lines must exist not because youve made mistake on the line you recognize that you could write the wrong line and so forth do you know to date we have had three people one of whose clearing was held up and two that was loused up right here at saint hill because nobody paid enough attention to the wording and value of the wording of lines so this is not light subject this is very important subject and it is the auditors responsibility not the training director or somebody elses responsibility this is the auditors responsibility those lines are there and theyve got to fire in other words if you read this line who or what would want to catch catfish that thing has got to fire on that not because the goal is on the end but the line as major thought has got to fire thats got to fire now remember that the whole rash of free needles that we got out earlier this summer were all listed on this simplicity ill show you how simple it can be line one who or what would want to catch catfish lets say this is the goal line two who or what would oppose catching catfish line three who or what would not oppose catching catfish line four who or what would not want to catch catfish now those are the exact lines the verb form changing on two of the lines to an ing and look even though they were reaching madly and having an awful time on line four and scrambling around on it most horribly they still made it see now it was only when on one and im not saying this just to be mean although the person who thinks who is going to hear it in moment will swear that i said it just to be mean the introduction of your into the line unreported by the auditor into one of the lines prevented that line from ever going to free needle till one day i caught the thing up and found out that this extra word existed in the line knocked the extra word out had it prepchecked little bit and wham all four lines went to free needle see there was one line in there ive forgotten which line it was but it was something on the order of who or what would oppose your catching catfish not who or what would oppose catching catfish see just the introduction of that your on one of the four lines see it wasnt on the other three and yet this was listed this way by three auditors see and the first auditor was completely exonerated on the matter because nobody had formulated the lines at that time to amount to anything and we were just at the beginning of this level and this auditor put them together as kind of what the pc thought they might be you see and there was your in it and that prevented those things from going to free needle so in other words the wording of the line can prevent or achieve free needle for that line it is the wording of the line now our modern more modern version seems to hit people much closer and we have had at least one goal not go clear on the old four lines but be much easier to run and is running much more easily and actually on the original four lines just went up to 50 as the ta and stuck right goal but it just went up and stuck because these lines were not adequate to describe the situation you see and started moving again the moment the wording was changed to these lines which we are now using line one who or what would want to catch catfish line two who or what would oppose catching catfish line three who or what would retard or pull back opposition to catching catfish and line four who or what would pull back what is it from catching catfish audience someone or something oh someone or something from catching catfish now someone or something could of course be on all four on at least two of the lines or on more of the lines you understand but there is the pattern which we are using now its pull back and pull back or retard and pull back on lines three and four but the point is the line has got to fire you read the goal to catch catfish bang to catch catfish bang to catch catfish bang all right that read transfers over on to all four lines and it is not true that it transfers on to just three of the lines and the other one isnt hot just now see its because that line that is not firing is not quite right see you should be able to put these four lines together and get them all to fire you say to catch catfish bang to catch catfish bang to catch catfish bang who or what would want to catch catfish bang you see theyve all got to fire that way now there are various oddball wordings which havent worked we run into the problem of the negative goal lets take the goal not to talk who or what would want not to talk thats perfectly fine isnt it who or what would oppose not to talk thats good isnt it thats fine were just going along fine there now lets get to line three on the old wording who or what would not oppose not to talk double negative enterprising auditor shift the double negative of course change it around so you dont have double negative thatd make it much better she never goes clear and line four who or what would not want not to talk now thats really becoming garbage as far as the auditor can see pretty gruesome but what do you know interestingly enough its perfectly comprehensible to the pc double negative so what doesnt mean anything to the pc the line means something to the pc but that it isnt grammatically something or other was not thing so that first wording was perfectly okay and was all right to remain just as it was if you had negative goal but this wording didnt work see double negative thats all right doesnt matter but this wording didnt work who or what would want the goal not to talk who or what would oppose the goal not to talk who or what would not oppose the goal not to talk for some cockeyed reason it ceases to make sense very soon see the goal the goal the goal makes it grammatical but apparently makes it unworkable now well get another one lets take the ing out of it who or what would oppose catching catfish see who or what would oppose the goal to catch catfish now this one is important for you to know about because pcs will try to steer you into it it hasnt the least bearing on the situation it doesnt go clear apparently this one lays an egg but pc tells you thats real hot the pc will tell you thats real good and apparently it is for the birds see the difference its different meaning who or what would oppose the goal to catch catfish of course is just dandy that sounds good doesnt it well it isnt the same meaning that you want on your list line we dont care about opposing the goal to hell with the goal why keep it in that realm we want to know who would oppose catching catfish not oppose the goal to catch catfish its who or what would oppose catching catfish that clears the pc see thats the opposition its the opposition to action because remember these are flow lines when everybody anybody tries to steer you away from wording which you think is proper and so forth in arguing it out with pc or figuring it out yourself or something just remember this these are actions these are actions now of course we get want the goal thats kind of an inflow isnt it and that has always kind of loused up i dont know quite why an inflow word like want works as an outflow action of the goal but it apparently keeps the goal in the items head that has got it see but have as far as i know although i dont have too much data on this have apparently works equally well apparently but its what fires that counts but what fires has got to be actions of the goal its got to be action because youre listing flow lines so this would be dead wrong who or what would oppose people who had the goal to catch catfish this is dead wrong thats you want to know who or what would oppose people well thats not the goal all right lets go little bit further afield here its after all catfish isnt it all right so who or what would oppose catfish youre practically listing two lines at once thats what messes up there because anybody whos trying to catch catfish is opposing catfish too and anybody whos opposing catfish is also opposing catfish and youve got opposition anyplace so you might as well just do the one line for the two dont you see and there we come into the liability of listing lines now believe this is quite problem because youre liable to make this horrible mistake unless forewarned the pc is given four commands but actually only lists three lines now look at the mess this gets him into he lists twice as many items on one line and he lists items on another line and an equal number on the remaining two lines in other words he overlists one line and doesnt list another line at all and the pc is going to go round the bend see hes really going to get cooked with this one next thing you know your tone arm is stuck and youll be saying its the wrong goal and everything is all upset well the pc through his own interpretation can do this just fine so the best way to handle this is have pcs draw you pictures now you want to draw the pc picture of the one i just gave you and present this as problem to the pc of how youre going to word this thing of course youre going to word this thing with current wording if absolutely impossible youre going to change it but youre going to try to word it with current wording but you want to show the pc this thing and its this arrow that comes in toward him and this arrow that goes out that faces the other arrow and then this arrow that pulls back and then this arrow that goes out parallel to the other one you want to show him those four arrows and youre going to say thats oppose thats opposed to doing your goal and this is doing your goal see and this is keeping you from doing your goal dont you see and thats retarding the other from being opposed but at the same time we dont want this fourth line here to be the second line up here do you see how that could be see who would oppose you doing your goal who would and who would not want you to do your goal ooooh those things are getting awful ghostly close together arent they but you got to have wording here that means these four flows with regard to the action of this goal now goals are action situations even being hound dog as goal to be hound dog see requires an action the action is at least to be thats not much action but its still enough action to be action and it causes flow you say who would want to be hound dog and of course now youve got it pretty well made of course theres some action little bit added in there and not want to be hound dog see you could get these things you see but theyre still actions oppose being hound dog thats guaranteeing action you see and retard opposition to being hound dog and these are very hard for pcs to wrap their wits around very often particularly when theyre lying at the bottom of the gpm there they lie nobody has disturbed them on this subject for millennia you see or trillennia nobodys even breathed it at them or mentioned it to them and you all of sudden come along and propound the philosophic principle of whether or not theyre going to oppose or not oppose being hound dog you know theyve just never considered it theyll be in this kind of state they know that everybody opposes being hound dog and that is the truth that isnt fact you see thats the truth the truth of life life opposes being hound dog now you introduce brandnew idea you say who would want to be hound dog want to be hound dog good heavens nobodys thought of that you see well thats factually they havent thought of it for ages see and these other actions the other three actions so they very readily steer themselves over onto one groove if they possibly can itll be the flow they happen to be stuck on at the moment you get them to figure it out so their advice is worse than useless but you want to find out whether or not they can answer it thats what you want to know thats why you consult them you dont take their wording but you want to find out if they can answer it and then you juggle the wording around or do anything you have to do to the wording so that you can clear you know invalidation mistake wrong word anything like that that you want to clear on this thing and after this line is cleaned up with fast check on the mid ruds like tobeatiger drill after this line is cleaned up brrrrp see that you say that line and you get pow you get read see you say the line you get read you say the line you get read dandy here we go thats fine see now you want to get the next one so that when you say that line you get read say that line get read prepcheck it out in other words you midrud the thing you see you get those mid ruds in on the line and then test it youd be surprised how busy they are sometimes in invalidating lines and all that straighten out so frankly ive opened up subject to you you possibly havent looked at very intimately and that is the wording of line to be listed but that second to the goal is the most important source from which all clearing flows is that line and now keeping an even balance amongst those lines as they list all right now so much for this this wording of the line your next step is to make sure that as you list you list in model session your rudiments are in without antagonizing the pc unduly because you see you can put the rudiments in so often that it amounts to auditing and then the rudiments go out see so your basic action is dont list too long on one line how long is too long its the exact ill tell you exactly how long you should list line exactly how long as long as the flow in that direction persists yeah how are you going to know that well short of an oscilloscope youre not an oscilloscope will show you the flow line so you just pays your money and you takes your chance but ill give you an indicator this would be slightly overlisting line but would be safe this is slightly overlisting the line by an item or two but its very safe as soon as the pc says uh and uhhhh change your lines go to the next line why youve hit the null point you see dont be under the delusion that the pc is thinking up these items dont make that mistake he thinks hes thinking he thinks hes talking he thinks its all going off but actually hes just woundup doll see hes just firing off he couldnt help it he practically couldnt help but give you the items because theyre being dealt see because theyre in theyre stacked in the gpm in that way he doesnt think of any of them now if pc is groping for the right wording youve overlisted i mean auhi mean auhuhummuh that isnt the right word uhuha uha biga biguhuh big big huge uhuh gargantuan uha tr truh lets see tremendously that isnt uh tremendously large oh man you overlisted long way back you should just quit see now that item will spew onto the paper bang just without any trouble from the pc and long times in listing sessions without many items coming onto the page is all caused by the auditor not judging the flows right comm lag of the pc eats up session and if you keep the pc out of that comm lag you just list in rotation one two three four one two three four one two three four and dont let the pc comm lag or shut off an automaticity isnt that neat you mustnt shut off pcs automaticity hes saying tiger waterbuck water buffalo uh big snakes pythons uh mindoro uh natives pygmies uh pygmies pygmies uhuh well the funny part of it is is you mustnt have shut him off at water buffalo because itd suppress the next two items he cant help but say them dont you see theyre just being dealt off the top of the deck one two three four see theyre just coming right on up one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven trtralenun nun and then aah shift lines now ill tell you when youve listed too long slightly but not to the other degree i cant get the right word for it i dont know what oh youre way overdue man you missed the 515 you missed the 620 see you missed the midnight express heres the one the pc says thats not it youve gone over youve gone over right now hes invalidating the item he is giving you why is he invalidating the item he has given you because the other flow line is now meeting the direction of his attention and is overwhelming his attention so that any item he thinks up is of course being overwhelmed by the other flow line coming to him just like that heh its very neat and you just listen to him as he goes along on listing and he says water buffalo tiger mindoro native pygmy uhuhuhuha p python uhumuhuhaa deer thats not it uma uhbuck buckuhuhno uma buck uhno not anotnotnot anot buck deer uhum lets see now um well i ccacantcant really think of the name of the thing uhuh big uha buck uhuhuha va very laruhauh its certain kind of deer they have down in mindoro uha dak or uu oh man you missed the 615 the 830 the 1020 theyve all gone by see thats the whole gamut you have run the lot now see your first indicator was and uh well out of courtesy you could let him give it to you hell say uhbuck and you say all right thank you very much thank you so much now all right were going to start on the next line and here we go weve shifted gears and were now listing on something else thats really the way to get away from the pin fast and your pc doesnt get suppressions and you dont have to put in the mid ruds all the time and all that sort of thing just catch it on that first ahh and its just handed to you on silver platter he tells you this line has run as far as its going to go and is now in an eddy area and is about to turn around and go the opposite direction thats what he tells you with that ahh with the invalidation he tells you it has already turned around and is going in the opposite direction and anything i think of is being overwhelmed and invalidated by the line which is now coming the other way see and when he cant think of it at all hes just totally overwhumped now the line is really racing at him but similarly let make this point again it is high crime to shut off an automaticity because he wont be able to get it again this thing is firing off and you put suppression right on the middle of the thing hes going to tell you all of sudden thirty items brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr and you say well thats enough he says bubu brrrbbrrbrrrr and you put in the mid ruds at that point you find it was all suppressed the pc feels kind of loused up he feels kind of betrayed and so on so there are the basic tricks of listing 1 at the beginning of the session get in your rudiments 2 get your goal fastchecked 3 now theres two ways you could go about this one is simply to fastcheck the first line you do and then when you get to the next line give it fast check when you get to the next line give it fast check first time you ask it you see you get to the nextfourth line give it fast check and then dont check them anymore just see if it fires thats the only thing you want its very fast see that could be done that way or you could take all five of these things the goal and the lines and just read them all off to see if they all fire see if therere any suppressions on them you know and clean them up bangbang get them all firing bong and then go on to your session two ways you could go about this find out which one is best for you now you center his attention on the lines of course too solidly in prepchecking the things and hell start giving you answers then youre already insession so that has some liability connected with it now your next action is to get the pc to list the first line down to point where he says and auhuhlet see let him see by all means but if he sees for more than few seconds you say well all right thats fine well get that one the next time we come around now lets start on this next line see lets just not leave him in thin air and just list to the comm lag go straight along down the line list to the comm lag list to the comm lag list to the comm lag now youre going to get in trouble sooner or later because your lines are going to get ragged if you list to the comm lag and thats liable to upset you so you take one of those times when hes feeling very very easy and catch up few items and its nice balance which you do but if its straining him to think of any more items just to make you catch up you abandon catching up you got it because its not quantitative process after all its the amount of flow see its the amount of flow that were interested in not the number of items and number of items is merely an approximation of keeping them level that is sloppy index of how much flow has been gotten off any one of these lines as far as checking the mid ruds is concerned every time you turn around you wont have to do it if you list this way which makes for very fast listing but if you make yourself bunch of mistakes this is really when to use the mid ruds fast check of the mid ruds not repetitive check if you make big mistake and this pc is going brrrrrrr and you say thank you thank you thank you very much yeah thank you yeah thank you yeah well i got that now are there any other item that person or being there that would want to catch catfish and the pc is sitting there looking blanched you know hes been struck dead hes halfway through an automaticity and he cant get it out actually recognize whats happened to him youve suppressed thirty or forty items just like that bang you didnt quite see what you were doing you know you didnt realize he was running off an automaticity and it was just tearing right on down the line and you all of sudden gave him nice tone 40 acknowledgment see brought him into present time put him into the session crash you see all that sort of thing and you just smell the rubber burning you make goof like that dont let him yap or get upset about it just get in your mid ruds suppress man that is really going to be hot you made him suppress the lot get the idea or if you were kind of sleepy and it was summer afternoon and you suddenly wake up to realize that the pc for five minutes has been sitting there saying various things like this is it large large tiger aaa very tiger stri striped i cant quite get the word for this tiger with horns that would not be right and so forth and you wake up suddenly the pcs been going on like this for about five minutes be an awfully good thing to get in the mid ruds in other words the mid ruds are something with which you pick up goofs and if youre really smooth auditor you dont goof now how many items does it take per line to list goal out how many items what an interesting question its almost philosophic in its impulse it has lot to do with how smoothly it was done oddly enough and the less smoothness it was done the less insessionness it was done with the more items you are going to have so therefore you cant say how many items should appear on list as just fait accompli how many items bang you see you cant say that but you sure can say that it isnt going to be ten or fifteen ten or fifteen hundred now were getting more into the zone and order of magnitude but speaking then were only speaking for the first goal how many is it for second goal how many is it for third goal how many is it for fourth goal well these things become shorter and shorter these lines do so how many clears the goal well as many as you write down well and expertly to point where the needle goes free thats how many it is and it certainly is not going to be less than thousand i dont think weve got the third goal i think youre still within that order of magnitude but im just guessing there the first goal seven thousand items on each line i wouldnt worry too much about it unless the ta has gone up and stuck and has been stuck for long time or something like this you see i wouldnt worry about the number of items ill tell you what to worry about in minute but the number of items isnt something to worry about you understand too few god help us ah now of course you dont ever null these items and the pc is going to ask you why are we writing them down it would be an interesting question why are we writing the items down well my answer to that is writing them down is better acknowledgment and its much better way to keep tabs on your lists and theres various reasons for writing them down but amongst them isnt nulling we dont ever do anything with these items i dont know anything to do with them your pc at first will be rather puzzled as to which one it is well of course thats the joke it isnt which one hes been going long piece of track on that goals problem mass man hes had an opportunity to collect an awful lot of identities and the identities which he personally has picked up has had the opportunity to collect an awful lot of enemies and he himself has collected an awful lot of things which oppose enemies and he himself has had very interesting taste for things which prevented him from doing his goal hell begin to wonder after while what possessed him and all of these things combined make quantity and the quantity is large all right now lets talk about how long line is listed it is listed exactly to free needle it is not listed one item beyond free needle hear now not one item beyond the free needle not even one needle was free now the proper conduct of an auditor when observing free needle on line should be professional he should not suddenly get hold of one of his favorite valences of rodeo performer start bucking about in the chair and trying to put quirt to the emeter free needle haha heyhey haha thats enough its free needle hey do you want to come around and see this that is not optimum auditor conduct its all right because we can run the suppressions off but youll feel like that when you first see one you go to the next line and list it to free needle or if it doesnt go to free needle until the flow runs out as usual sometimes one of them goes free and three of them will stick for while some of them then youve got two free and the other two are sticking and then sometimes youve got three free and one is all hung up and then eventually it goes free well the way to do that is you keep going one two three four see this thing is stuck this line is sticky its not free come back here to your next line in sequence see and put one two three free needle see now your needle is free when you go to your next line your next line doesnt upset it at all now i cant lay down rule absolutely here because it may not make the least bit of difference but if it you said the line to the pc and you get needle reaction of any kind whatsoever and nothing happens to the needle it might be very foolish to list it so we go to the next line and we read the thing off and theres needle reaction of any kind to it you see and the needle is still free and we come to the line we had that was sticky in the first place and its still sticky now we list that thing on down until we get to comm lag and its still stuck well now which line do we come back to next because nothing is cooling this thing down well youd better check them hadnt you now it wont upset anybody if you put one item on each one of these lines now were into completely questionable area of what is the right thing to do experience will tell what is the right thing to do i cant give you packaged answer but i can tell you this is dont list beyond free needle because its quite upsetting its like asking for rudiment answer when there isnt one see and if i were to lay down an operating rule for myself on this as something i would now be guided by i would wade myself through this i would read these other lines and see if i could get stick or fall see something and id get an item and then id walk back to the line that was stuck and i would list it till i got comm lag you get the idea and id walk myself through this and if i had three lines all of which were giving free needle i wouldnt test all three in rotation every time id test one after the other in other words id take the sticky line id list on it to comm lag and then id choose another one of these lines not the one in rotation id skip rotation see and then id list some more sticky needle and then id choose the third one that was free and test it now you know id just walk my way through this sort of like on eggs you get the idea and i wouldnt list those lines my instinct would be agin it if i couldnt get fall or stick or any needle misbehavior on it i dont think i would i would touch them id ask them the pc id ask the pc if he had any items on these lines but my auditing command would not be who or what would want to catch catfish can you think of anything right now that anything anybody want to catch catfish you cant all right thank you huhhuh that is thats fine thank you very much get off of there see pc said yeah i just thought uh game wardens catch catfish every now and then and then youve set it down see all right he just gave you that gratuitously thats to keep from missing withholds youre at touchy end of the case and obviously to you it isnt touchy end of the case at all because the pc is now practically clear and clear can stand anything that might be your reason if the needle is this free why doesnt matter how we treat the pc is it well thats the wrong kind of thinking because right at that stage of the game it is rather edgy because you could take one of these free needle lines and you could list it right on into hole in other words you could stick it all up again its already happened here dont think im just dealing on theory only overlisting has occurred all right thats enough for that you can certainly list through to free needle on four lines now if one line consistently and continually hangs up and you cant make it go free then you investigate the living daylights out of what is wrong with that particular line and see if you can find anything wrong with it at all and see if you can get any variation of wording of that line to fire nicely and neatly and continue listing on that new wording and that line will go clean okay thats in case of emergency because there might have been throughout something wrong with that one line see you might have missed it already been done here so it can happen three lines went free one didnt well when that happened before your was in the fourth line that your was enough to keep that line from going free and an examination of it only took couple three sessions of listing after that and all four lines were free just like that see so suspect that if you get too much an inequality of this and its hanging on too long dont let it go for months look into it okay audience mmmm all right now what are the dangers of listing number one listing is auditing it is auditing and must be treated as such it is the only therapeutic action undertaken to free goal is merely listing the pc does not give out these answers analytically matter how bright and alert the pc might act theyre all being dealt off the bottom of the deck all out of the reactive mind and you must not worry as to whether the pc is inventing answers or dreaming them up or thinking of them analytically or anything else just be calm about this look there are enough things to worry about in auditing without inventing things just take what the pc gives you man keep the session going and relax see all right now as you are starting in with the goal you have period of danger and this period of danger begins at the moment of finding the goal and is over when you have proved beyond doubt that this goal while being listed on all four lines turns on pain on line one sensation on line two little more sensation than pain on line three and little more pain than sensation on line four and when youve proven that to your own complete satisfaction well look i youre looking at as though i should detail this more but figure it out for yourself man figure it out for yourself lines one and three belong to the pc and lines two and four belong to the enemy and the enemy is sensation and the pc is pain thats easy and unless you get that optimum condition of affairs that goal is wrong and you better get off of that hotter than hot and faster than fast line one heres what makes goal wrong line one turns on sensation who or what would want to catch catfish dizzy misemotional groggy uhuuhhhohhh see pressures who or what would oppose catching catfish ouch oh what terrible pain went through my head oh what an awful pain in my back oh dear dear dear ohrrarr ohh my ouch see its the wrong line that should be turning on sensation its turning on the pain and we get to line three which is the pcs own line again since its an allied line and the person says nyoom oh dear still very dizzy and so on so on and so on and so on and so on very dizzy and theres this little tiny pain in my ear but that doesnt amount to much sure makes you dizzy doesnt it and he gets to line four who or what would pull back your goal you see thats the enemy man and ouch urp pain went through the back there what was that now look that condition as purity seldom exists it wont exist for very long if you continue to list this it all becomes sen everything gets to be sen but if you go too far on this everything goes sen the bank starts to become hard beefy lumpy the person wakes up in the morning and the ridges he usually had are now really ridges were getting an exaggeration of the situation that bank is becoming heavy its like running creative processing without having the goal to create and the pc will wake up in the morning actually and hell feel like theres board going through his head see something like this and hes and it all turns into sensation its all dizzy groggy pressures nausea misemotion starts to feel like that after while he didnt do anything to high blood pressure probably but he starts to feel like high blood pressure would be much more comfortable you see all four lines go to sen thats an interesting item isnt it now if all four lines went to pn i wouldnt worry but if they all went to sen to hell with it get out of there youre wrong i dont care what you think youre wrong you got it i dont care what the pc says thats the wrong goal yeah it read yeah its fine yeah it checked out we had three instructors and the governor of australia check it out i dont care about all those arguments the line is wrong because that is the final proof of goal you got it you havent got goal until you have listed it two or three hundred items on each line as the auditor and that will save your bacon of course if it checks out beautifully pc got pain on it bang and so forth youre pretty sure arent you but the final test of any pudding is the listing you go two three hundred items deep on this thing if its turning on pain in the right places and sen on the right places and that sort of thing oh boy youre in go for broke now the only thing could happen wrong is you start listing with the rudiments out something crazy goes on in the pcs life hes got ptps like mad or rudiments are wildly out or something of the sort you see and on minor way you see checking the goal out every time is just way of speeding this up it wont prevent clearing and checking the lines out wont prevent clearing by listing they just slow it down but wrong line will wrong line will prevent clearing who or what would try awfully hard to oppose catching catfish and the next line to it is who or what would not want to catch catfish you see and the next line down the line all out of position see all misworded it would be too cruel an experiment i have seen this in actual action but you can take four lines check them out and then throw one now it will fire on suggestion and an invalidation see and mistake you can get it to fire of course just like you can get goal to fire and now insist on listing that line who or what would know he had to have to catch catfish and then put all the other ones down correctly the action of doing something like that is to bring the ta up to stick its almost exactly 45 to 50 almost always i havent ever seen tone arm on misworded line or mislisting or arc broke sessions or overlisting in sessions the errors you can make in other words that on goals listing didnt go up to 45 and 50 im quite prepared to see one go up to 60 or to 70 or 375 im quite prepared to you understand but it just happens that every one ive seen have gone from 45 to 50 and then stick theyll stick at 45 or theyll stick at 50 and more have stuck at 50 than at 45 so when your tone arm starts lingering around 50 for session and next session lingers around 50 dont be surprised if the third session your pc all of sudden says well i was awfully dizzy i was walking down the street and i saw the buildings sort of reel youre doing something weird something wild is going on here somethings happened you got to straighten it out now what straightens out how do you straighten one of these things out well you locate whats wrong you better check out the goal and get it to fire again if you possibly can check out the lines one after the other see if theres any disagreement from the pc on these lines or these wordings thats quite important youre not going to change them around just because he disagrees with them but youre going to sure make it answerable if you can check out your sessioning in general which isnt really enough to keep it all hung up and just straighten this thing out and get it to rolling again thats what youre going to do now look if you cant straighten the goal out after youve listed couple hundred if it ceases to fire after two or three hundred items on each one of four lists its sort of which way did they go what happened you got to get it back to firing again of course if you cant get it back to firing again it was probably the wrong goal in the first place the method were using to find goals right now rather makes it very difficult to get wrong goal that makes it pretty difficult for you to get wrong goal or run wrong goal thats the beauty of it and why i love that method ease of auditing and positiveness of finding the goal were enough to have this and thats not why im happy about it it used to be that only an instructor or somebody who was specially trained in that little tiny technique of checkout we could absolutely rely on the fact that it was the right goal now any of you guys if youre good enough to do nulling by mid ruds down to point where you find goal youre so used to checking them out that checking out goal doesnt phase you anymore youll be able to actually look at goal and say well boom lets check it out brrr brrr to be tiger tzaltup bang thud bang yup it doesnt fire see thatd be all there was to it you know lets see is there suppression on there that goal been suppressed that isnt goal see positiveness enters into the picture and thats going to save an awful lot of bacons so preventing the wrong goal from being found has been quite campaign ive had to engage on here for quite while and actually it was what was marvelous is that this new nulling by mid ruds not just for its value for the auditor but to prevent wrong goals from being found is worth its weight in planets man and thats pretty heavy now this idea of finding goal finding it firing and saying that is the persons goal or agreeing that it is the persons goal thats perfectly all right because it can be run out its an assertion see thats all right but when the pc keeps saying it isnt my goal and the auditor keeps saying yes it is your goal ridge is built up which is pretty hard to take apart and it will keep goal firing so dont argue over somebodys goal or youll make it fire and fire and fire and its not his goal you get the suppressions invalidations off it hell agree with it if its his goal and if it isnt his goal he wont you could find an opposition goal this is the other thing that could be wrong you could find an opposition goal now i dont know that by nulling by mid ruds you will find an opposition goal i dont know too much about finding opposition goals as distinct from finding goals i cant give you much data on this actually because ive never seen an opposition goal that would fire after it has been prepchecked and nulled by mid ruds you understand so theres always the possibility that opposition goals actually only fired because they were invalidations of the goal or something you get the idea and they might not have had rocket reads on them at all you see and somebody the other day came up with reverse rocket read on goal and immediately proposed it was probably an opposition goal which i thought was very interesting so if you see that sort of thing let know but i dont know that you can get rocket read on an opposition goal i dont know that it isnt just the invalidation of the goal that makes the opposition goal fire well theres youre fairly secure if you have found the goal and checked it out but dont be too cocky until youve got two hundred on line and if you found goal and then turned it over to somebody to list remember to reach out by the time they got three hundred on each line or something like that and say to the pc how are you doing how do you feel all right when they ask you soandso and soandso where does the somatic come and the person says well its so and so on now what kind of somatic is it is it sensation or is it painful or what is it and what line is it on and check it all out yourself you got the idea you know dont read the auditors report thats good prevention otherwise than that you realize that somebody who is trained to hca level could be quite competent in listing and listing is the longest part of clearing so if you had somebody helping you in auditing and you kept your eye on the situation person with less training than is necessary to find goals could list goals and because he was doing this sort of thing and doing some prepchecking and so forth as he went along he would actually get up to point where he could locate goals so its good training school listing is see now that lengthens the number of people you could clear by three or four times savvy now you got to know all about listing and you should list somebody to clear just to see how it looks and get the experience and that sort of thing but i dont expect you to list every goal to clear that you find itd be much more economic situation for you to find the goal and then keep your eagle eye beagled on the somebody who is listing it out now how about autolisting well there is telling i wont say that autolisting is impossible i dont i dont believe that it is possible or impossible at this particular stage of the game i believe that it would be better than nothing let put it that way but to tell somebody to go home and list on four lists and you will look into it in couple of weeks it seems to like its sort of taking his life in your hands you know i wouldnt be sure at this about this at all but i would say this i would say this that if you were on desert island and you knew your goal and you knew exactly what the goal is and itd been expertly checked out and there was absolutely way under the sun for you to get clear any other way i would say that you should pick up pencil and piece of palm bark but we would know more about that in due course now these are the various ramifications to listing clearing itself consists of the cycle of finding goal and then listing it until you have free needle on each of four lines finding another goal and listing it on each of four lines finding another goal and listing it on each of four lines and the state of case is regulated by the number of goals the person has which have not been found and listed those are damping factors now here at saint hill its fairly simple to make firstgoal clear not simple but with heroic activities let us put it that way we can make firstgoal clear now to find second goal on pc and list that one out this is getting much more difficult we have just now found and checked out second goal on jean and that was very very good news that i was very happy about and at least it was stated to in so many words that it was checked out today was it female voice hmhm yeah all right thats second goal okay now shes got little time to list on this second goal and i think they possibly even may list it out because the listing very possibly is much shorter than first goal but we know more about that in due course shes already starting to depart from the standard state of clear or such person is already starting to depart from what we have considered clear theyre starting to move up into theta clear or something like that and its an adventure from there on out because these various states now of course are not regulated in any way by different processes to different conditions its gradient scale of the same condition all the way of course now i cant even tell you how many goals it is to ot see or how long itd take you to find and list each one of these goals i was very happy to find today that the second goal would fire so nicely nice i was told they had good rocket reads on the thing see i was very happy about that somewhere up the line why the goals are not going to stay in theyre going to start blowing but how far do you have to keep the goals not blowing to get ot see but thats that is the road that we are on basically and its repetition of the same action the only improvement which i see in auditing which is coming immediately up and so on is mechanical improvement that is to say persistency of read devices to make read more persistent and therefore more observable by an auditor i dont see any changes to amount to anything on clearing as such i do see some dodges one could do to probably shorten up finding goal and i see some frills one could add on to listing that would possibly shorten the thing up one way or the other but i dont look for any fabulous advance from along that line i dont because there are certain limitations that you hit and the limitations is that the person has got just that much case and they have to sit there just that long and they can talk just that fast get the idea all right and maybe when were all ot why maybe well look back over the whole thing again and well say it would have been much easier had we done it this way and i hope that were in that condition and dont have to do it some other way those are the improvements i look for in clearing i really dont look for many other improvements but i do look for improvements thatll take little shortcuts little faster something that is more valuable to do this than to do that you know little things along the line and we may carve it down we may carve it down considerably we may use various systems of auditing just given you one tonight you find the goal let an hpa list it see under your eye therefore youve lost two hundred hours of auditing just like that various other mechanisms of this character can be fine and we can step it up into quantitative clearing our problem now is quantitative clearing my immediate problem is to get some of you to read an emeter better well im solving that with drills and attention and various things and im also doublesolving it by making sure that persistentread emeter comes into existence in the very near future that can be hooked up to mark iv and red lights go on and pinballs dials go around when you hit read see and it stays on until you do something about it or something like that but i have actually quarrel real quarrel with your drills real quarrel with your auditing presence real quarrel with these things i see just this metering thats being problem and well get that licked i have problem of how many how many of you can i push on through to firstgoal clears in space of time when the fellow alongside of you cant read an emeter and neither can you you know some of you are in that condition and thats worrying i got these various problems but i havent got any technical problems now i havent got any im not even worrying about whats in the guts of this meter i just told them well what we need is an idiot meter you have an onandoff switch and red light when you say something to the pc the red light goes on or it doesnt go on and if it goes on you clean it up see and if it doesnt go on you dont clean it up idiot meter these things well have these things well have i can undoubtedly find where we can best expect the goal to appear on list and therefore cut down the number of goals we have to null in order to find the goal you know do various other tricks of this character but as far as technology is concerned we got it made and youre doing it and the only thing some of you are doing wrong is youre missing few reads see well thats all i got to cure so thats easy thats that thank you very much
