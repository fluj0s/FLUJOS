greater diversification and participant choice in the tsp as well as potentially higher returns as benefits of the proposal the tsp board while studying the matter has argued that changes shoul d only occur as part of comprehensive program should not encourage return chas ing by participants and should maintain the current very low cost structure of the tsp hr 1578 the real estate investment th

reit considerations for the federal employees thrift savings plan tsp introduction1 real estate investment trusts reits are mutual funds made up of real estate and mortgage assets in recent years their performance has been stronger than broader market indicators leading to calls for inclusion of reit alternative in the thrift savings plan tsp for federal workers hr 1578 the real estate investment th rift savings act was introduced april 12 2005 to provide for an reit option in the tsp hearings were held on the legislation april 19 2005 by the house government reform subcommittee on the federal workforce and agency organizati on further hearings are scheduled for april 26 2006 companion bill s 2490 was introduced in the senate on april 13 2006 this report summarizes the legal and econo mic history of reits and the factors that have contributed to recent strong performances of reits as investment vehicles it then addresses the argu ments behind their possible inclusion as an investment alternative in the tsp background on reits introduced in the 1960s real estate i nvestment trusts reits applied the mutual fund concept to real estate by buying an interest in reit an investor could own share of number of real estate assets reducing the risks and transaction costs that accompany investment in single piece of real estate congress made the reit concept financially viable by enacting the real estate investment trust act of 1960 which exempted reits from double taxa tion of shareholder dividends that is reit income is not taxed at the trust level but only after it has been distributed to shareholders stock and bond mutual funds receive similar tax treatment to qualify for this tax exemption reits are requi red to distribute at least 90 of their income in the form of dividends second piece of legislati on critical to the development of the reit market was the tax reform act of 1986 which permitted reits to operate and manage property themselves previously they were permitted to be only passive investorshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33380crs2 2 figures in this report reflect only publicly traded reitsthe tax reform act also cha nneled investment funds into reits by restricting the use of limited real estate partnerships as tax shelters individual reits tend to specialize in certa in kinds of real estate but taken as whole the reit industry invests in the broad range of commerc ial and residential primarily multifamily properties figure1 shows the distribution of reit assets at the end of 2005 source national association of reits there are two basic types of reits equity and mortgage equity reits develop own and operate inco meproducing real estate nd provide tenant services whereas mortgage reits lend money to real estate owners and operators or acquire loans or mortgagebacked securities few hybrid reits operate in both mode s the investment characteristics of the two types differ mortgage reits are highly sensitive to interest rates because their profits depend on the spread between the income from their loans and other debt assets and their own cost of funds as in terest rates have rise n since 2004 the returns on investment in and share prices f mortgage reits have fallen sharply equity reits on the other hand ar affected by range of economic fundamentals besides in terest rates for example re its that invest

period for reits see steve bergsman after an awful year in the real estate investment trust market investment dealers digest june 28 1999 p 1what accounts for the recent performance of reit stocks first the economic fundamentals have been favor able following the stock market crash in 2000 and the september 11 2001 attacks the federal reserve lowered shor tterm interest rates to the lowest levels since the 1950s greatly reducing the cost of borrowed funds longer term rates partly in response to the fed moves nd partly because of fall in post911 investment demand c ontinued their decadelong decline lowering the cost of funds most important to real estate funding considerably long rates in particular have remained low by historical standa rds in 2006 in addition consumer spending has been strong since the end of the st recession in november 2001 which is good news for reits that invest in resorts nd retail structures including shopping malls economic growth has been good for the indus trial real estate sector and improving business conditions have buoyed the hotel nd lodging sectors and are beginning to drive down the office vacancy rate in many parts of the country second factor has been wave of rgers and goingprivate transactions in the industry when publicly traded reit is acquired by anot her or taken private shareholders receive premium above the cu rrent market price fo r their stock the prospect of merger or buyout usually dds to the attraction of reit shares and drives prices up third and perhaps the most important factor behind rising reit share prices has been the relatively poor perform ance of other investments since the market peak in 2000 stock yields have b een much lower than during the 1990s at the same time low interest rates have meant that returns to fixedincome investments like corporate bonds bank certificates of posit and us treasury notes have been meager by historical standa rds the combination according to standard poors analysis has sent investor dollars surging into us reits in recent years4 thus performance of reit shares is ffected not only by the fundamentals of the real estate business but also by the quality of other i nvestment opportunities figure 2 shows that the reit index was negative during several periods in the late 1990s not just because of problems in real estate markets and earnings5 but also because investors shifted funds to nasdaq technology stoc ks and other hot sectors where returns of 30 per year were considered sluggish future prospects future returns on any stock market investme nt are of course uncertain several factors make predictions about reits even more uncertain than most as table 1 shows the market value of reit stocks has grown explosively since 1990 since 2000 alone market capitalizati on has more than doubled this suggests two thingshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33380crs5 6 jonathan clements reits awakening from slumber wall street journal feb 15 2000 p c1 7 ibbotson associates ask ibbotson http wwwibbot soncom see also testimony of roger g ibbotson hearing of the house government reform subcommittee on the federal workforce and agency organization april 19 20051 that publicly traded reits have become much larger though mergers external debt and equity financings as well as internallygenerated growth and 2 that investor perceptions of reits have changedthe first point means that an investme nt fund that attempted to capture the aggregate return of the full range of publicly traded reits as tsp fund would presumably do would in fact be investing in shifting pool of firms and assets as public reits buy private funds or assets or as they are taken private the volume and composition of the real estate assets that generate reit income will not be constant which implies that past behavi or of reit stocks may not be reliable guide to future performance on the second point if investors move in and out of reits in response to factors unrelated to the state of the underl ying commercial real estate market the behavior of reit stocks under any given set of market conditions can be expected to change in 2000 wall street journal 6 article noted that historically reits have behaved like stocks bu t in the last two years they have seemed more like bonds diving as interest ra tes rose recent ibbotson associates study found that the historical correlation between reits and smallcapitalizati on stocks has broken down early in the 1990s however the markets perception of these securities began to shift as the reit market grew along with investor understanding of the sector in turn shifts in the market began to alte r the behavior patterns of this asset class since 1992 the reit market has more than quadrupled and investors have begun to view these investments more as real estate investments and less as simply domestic equity investments over the last 10 years correlations between reits and more traditional asset classes have been declining making them significant source of portfolio diversification7 together these trends suggest that the investment characteristics of the present set of publicly traded reits may not hold constant over the years to come in the shortterm the fact that re its have outperformed the sp 500 for several years running suggests that reit stocks may be overv alued and due for correction standard poors analysis notes that the cap rate measure of commercial property returns was low in early 2006 suggesting that stock prices were higher than the fundamentals of th commercial real estate market wouldhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33380crs6 8 real estate investment trusts standard poors industry surveys p 7 9 jennifer forsythe reits rally again defying predictions wall street journal mar 22 2006 p d1 the article cites speculation on mergers as principal reason for the continued rise 10 opening statement of chairman jon porter hearing of the house government reform subcommittee on the federal workforce and agency organization apr 19 2005support8 nevertheless reit st ocks have risen by 13 since the beginning of 2006 seemingly in defiance of common sense according to the wall street journal 9 reit fund for the tsp the thrift savings plan tsp is ta xdeferred retirement savings vehicle for federal workers akin to 401k plans for private sector employees although available to all federal employees it is par ticularly important to those covered by the federal employees retirement system f ers whose contributions are partially matched by their federal agency at presen t the tsp has five investment vehicles three of which are broad stock indexes one of the stock funds tracks the sp 500 index of major uslisted companies the c fund the i fund tracks international stocks and the s fund invests in stocks not included in the sp 500 including shares of small and midsize companies the re maining two funds invest in bonds the f fund and government s ecurities the g fund in addition the tsp has five automatic lifecycle arrangements of investing among the five vehicles each geared to ward projected time frame over which accounts will remain in the tsp at this time the tsp does not allow for investment in individual stocks nor in funds made up of particular economic sectors or industries such as biotec h or aeronautics the t sp has approxima tely 35 million participants and more th an 180 billion in assets on april 12 2005 chairman jon porter of the house government reform subcommittee on the federal workforce nd agency organization introduced hr 1578 the real estate investment thrift sa vings act which would provide for real estate stock index inves tment option under the tsp the subcommittee held hearing on april 19 2005 chairman porter made the case for the legislation as follows what we are talking about today is simple concept diversification basic economic principles dictate th at investors should not place all of their eggs in one basket but must spread their money and risk among different types of assets few years ago during the tech bubble collapse many federal employees experienced setbacks in their investment portfolio and did not have the option to invest substantially in reits federal employees should not be left out in the cold adding reit fund option to the tsp is the next logical step with its resilient earnings and lower vola tility real estate provides sound investment over the long haul such an investment is valuable diversification tool providing the possibility of strong returns and risk reduction10httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33380crs7 11 ibid 12 statements of andrew m saul chairman of the federal retirement thrift investment board and gary amelio executive dire ctor before the house government reform subcommittee on the federal workforce and agency organization apr 19 2005chairman porter also noted that the t sp offered five inves tment options versus 16 for the average corporate 401k pla n investment diversification is the cornerstone of modern portfolio theory whic h holds that the inclusion of highly risky assets in portfolio can enhance overall returns and does not imply high level of risk to the portfolio as long as the risks are not positively correlated if the correlation between reits and the stock ma rket has declined as the ibbotson study cited above finds reit f und woul d offer tsp participants way to hedge their investments in stock funds if the stock funds fell the reits would rise or at least not fall as far easing the pain of stock ma rket episodes such as the bear market of 20002002 at the same time based on th eir expectations of future reit performance participants could move funds into reits in search of higher yields thus as chairman porter stated re it fund may offer both the possibility of strong returns and risk reduction11 the tsp governing board and ceo how ever have recommended against the addition of reit fund their arguments as set out at the 2005 hearing mentioned above12 may be summarized as follows the view of reits as hedge against stock market declines is complicated by the fact that reit stocks are already in cluded in both the large and small stock funds currently offered by the tsp for exampl nine reit stocks are included in the sp 500 which the tsps c fund tracks ga ry amelio the tsp executive director noted in his 2005 testimony that the c nd s stock funds held over billion dollars in reit shares making tsp the thirteenthlargest holder of reits in the united states thus the hedging value of reits is to an extent already built into the tsp if reits rise when other stocks fall th aggregate indexes mirrored by the tsp funds will fall less than they would have otherwise similarly superior returns earned by reits over any period are captured in the ggregate return to the tsp stock funds what the creation of reit fund would do is allow tsp participants to increase the proportion of reit stocks in their tfolios beyond their weighting in broad indices such as the sp 500 if their timing were right tsp par ticipants who chose the reit option could outperform their peer s who remained in the stock funds but figure 2 suggests that they would be choosing volatile investment option that could lead to losses as well as gains by offering only few investment altern atives the tsp is structured in way that discourages return chas ing conventional wisdom in financial theory is that many investors particular ly small investors tend to buy the stocks or mutual funds that did well in the last reportin g period and that this is generally an unsuccessful strategy for two reasons return chasers are always paying topofthe market prices and by frequently realloca ting their investments they incur highhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33380crs8 13 ibid 14 ibid 15 testimony of amy schioldager head of u s equity indexing products before the house government reform subcommittee on the federal workforce and agency organization apr 19 2005 16 for an overview of the field see hersh shefrin beyond fear and greed new york oxford university press 2002 368 p or for very brief account john j bowen the enemy within financial planning apr 1 2006transaction costs gary amelio noted th at educational programs to discourage such counterproductive investment be havior would be expensive13 another argument regarding the hedging and diversification benefits offered by new tsp funds is that such alternatives oug ht to be offered if they are needed as part of comprehensive considered program rather than piecemeal if tsp investors would be better off with reit choice observers ask why not add funds based on emerging markets hedge f unds commodities junk bonds and so on two general arguments against such multiplication of investment options are made one deals with fund expenses cu rrent tsp expenses are extremely low by industry standards off the charts according to andrew saul14 partly because the number of funds is limited if annual expenses go up by even fraction of percentage point the effect on total investment returns over 20 or 30year time frame can be dramatic testimony from ba rclays global investors which serves as tsp investment manager indicated th at administration of reit fund while desirable from pure inves tment perspective would likely incur management and transaction costs considerab ly above present levels15 second there is some question whether wide menu of investment choices is in the interest of tsp participants many of whom are not and do not care to become expert in financial markets pr esenting unsophisticated investors with many choices may result in lessthanoptimal behavior including the chasing of returns discussed above or the selection of an unsuitable initial i nvestment allocation which the participant may not correct later because the perceived costs of obtaining expertise are too high these argument s can be countered by the charge of paternalism and the case for investor choice and selfdirection is intuitively attractive if as neoclassical economics assumes individuals act rationally in their own selfinterest why should the government or its designees decide where tsp participants can put their funds however growing body of empirical and theoretical research called behavioral finance throws doubt on the notion that individual investors can be expected to make the decisions that are best for themselves16 behavioral finance identifies mistakes that inve stors make consistently ch as reliance upon inaccurate rules of thumb and being influenced by th form in which an investment opportunity is presented rather than the substance th bad habits appear to be deeply rooted and not easily corrected by education programs httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33380crs9 17 jenna gottlieb asset allocation funds benefit participants study shows 401k performance shines for those who let others make decisions pensions and investments mar 20 2006 p 6 18 statement of gary amelio ibida recent study of investment returns by definedcontribution plan participants found that individuals who chose an asset allocation or balanced fund such as the tsp lifestyle options achieved better returns than participants who make allocation decisions themselves17 results like these suggest that the neoclassical assumption that individuals can be relied upon to act ra tionally in their own selfinterest may be overly simplistic this line of analysis seems to support the contention of the tsp directors that the current plan design based on few broad choices and low costs has been recognized by many impartial observers as an optimum approach18 recent events s 2490 companion bill to hr 1578 was introduced by senator norm coleman april 3 2006 thus bringing the i ssue to the senate as well as the house the house government reform committee has scheduled new hearings on the subject for april 26 2006 in march 2006 the employee thrift adviso ry council an advisory panel made up of labor management nd other federal employees adopted resolution opposing the addition of reit option to the tsp finally study has been commissioned by the federal retirement thrift investment board to review the existing tsp investment policy and consider the add ition of more options including reit option but publication is not expected until later in 2006
