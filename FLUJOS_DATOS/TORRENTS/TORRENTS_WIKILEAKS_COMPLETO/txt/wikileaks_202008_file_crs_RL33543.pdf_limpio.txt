dods three largest tactical aircraft modernization programs the background section provides brief description of each program and discussion of how tactical aircraft fit into military air operations the missions they typically perform and how they contrast to longerrange combat aircraft the analysis key issues to consider section examines number of policy issues including affordability capability required force structure and defense industrial base the paper concludes with synopsis of congressional action on these programs the defense department is procuring the f22 fighter for the air force the fa18ef fighterattack plane for the navy and the joint strike fighter jsf aircraft in three variants some of which might be operational around 2012 decisions in congress and the defense department regarding these aircraft programs may have important longterm implications the fa18ef is in fullrate production the f22 is nearing the end of its planned production the jsf might be in production through the 2020s decisions about the funding of these programs will influence the future of individual us aircraft manufacturers and may well affect the division of combat roles and missions among the services for decades some in congress have expressed concern about the need for some of these aircraft programs on grounds of cost and affordability and military requirements some in congress have also expressed concern over the potential impact of these aircraft programs on the defense industrial base this report will be updated as events warrant this report replaces issue brief ib92115 of the

aircraftfighter planes fighterattack planes and attack planesconstitute major component of us military capability they played prominent role in the 1991 gulf war and are expected to play leading role in contemporary and future military operations particularly in situations where us leaders hope to limit or avoid the commitment of us ground forces operation allied force the 1999 war in kosovo may have fueled these expectations during this 78day war hundreds of coalition aircraft attacked serbian targets losing only two aircraft in the process navy tactic combat aircraft played prominent role in the early stages of operation enduring freedom and tactical aircraft from all services continue fighting in the war in afghanistan and iraq tactical aviation accounts for significant part of the defense budget counting the costs of developing procuring and operating aircraft engines avionics and weapon systems and personnel training and administrative costs in round numbers the us air force navy and marine corps operated approximately 4200 fixedwing tactical combat aircraft in 2007 of these the air force operated about 2658 and the navy and the marine corps 1541 in addition to these fixedwing combat aircraft the services operate about 1300 armed helicopters 1 this report focuses on fixedwing aircraft programs the air force f22 the navy fa18ef and the f35 joint strike fighter the research and development procurement and military construction costs of these aircraft will combine to cost taxpayers an estimated 418 billion in constant dollars2 these aircraft have been traditionally referred to as tactical aircraft to distinguish them from the air forces b52 b1 and b2 strategic bombers when applied to aircraft tactical generally refers to smaller and shorterranged planes while strategic generally refers to larger and longer ranged aircraft both tactical and strategic types are operated by usafs air combat command which in 1992 replaced strategic air command sac and tactical air command tac reflecting the postcold war demise of sac and tac tactical aircraft are sometimes referred to as theater aircraft the military services use alphanumeric designations eg a10 f15 b52 fa18 to identify the type of mission the aircraft is designed to perform this taxonomy can be confusing because it is loosely defined eg the joint strike fighter is multirole aircraft which would suggest an fa35 designation and because over time an aircraft can be modified to perform additional missions for example the b52 stratofortress today exploits advanced targeting and precision guided munitions pgms to conduct close air support cas missions which are historically performed by tactical aircraft not longrange bombers generally speaking however fighter planes primarily engage in airtoair combat either at closevisual range or at ranges requiring radarguided missiles and standoff munitions including precisionguided munitions pgms attack planes focus on airtosurface combat operations such as cas for friendly ground forces engaged in battle battlefield air interdiction bai against 1 see crs report rl32447 military helicopter modernization background

attacks of 911 have informed dod plans for tactical aviation modernization in response to an emerging congressional consensus and recommendations by the defense departments 1993 bottomup review bur of force structure requ irements the clinton administration decided in late 1993 to continue two major aircraft programs then underwaythe f22 lowobservabletoradar stealthy fighter for the air force and the fa18ef version of the fa18 fighterattack plane for the navywhile also pursuing new avia tion technology initiatives through the joint advanced strike technology jast program which later evolved into the joint strike fighter jsf program the george h bush administrations plan for modernizing us tactical aircraft had focused on four key aircraft programs 1 the f22 2 the fa18ef 3 the afx stealthy attackfighter aircraft to be developed for the navy and air force and 4 the multirole fighter mrf either new aircraft or an upgraded version of the f16 fighterattack plane for the air force since there was funding for the mrf and only minimal funding for the afx their rejection by the bur in 1993 was more recognition of their demise than the termination of viable programs the defense departments first quadrennial defe nse review qdr released in may of 1997 recommended buying fewer tactical aircraft than was then projected with reduced annual procurement of the f22 and the fa18ef the george w bush administration took office with the aim to transform the department of defense rather than merely modernize its capabilities 3 tactical aircraft programs were reviewed in th is context and in prog ram budget decision pbd 753 december 23 2004 dod recommended that the f22 program be terminated after the fy2008 purchase 3 unlike modernization transformation is generally viewed as discontinuous change or leap ahead in capabilities see crs report rl32238 defense transformation background and oversight issues for congress by ronald orourke for more information on military

subcontractors it is replacing the f15 as the air forces air superiority fighter like the f15e the f22 will also have airtosurface attack capabilities the program was in competitive prototyping from 1986 to 1991 and then entered engineering and manufacturing development emd with prototype flights beginning in 1997 on september 14 2001 the defense acquisition board dab announced its much awaited decision that the f22 program had succ essfully completed emd and was ready to move on to lowrate initial production on december 15 2005 the air force announced that 12 aircraft detachment of f22s had achieved initial operational capability ioc figur 1 f22 ra ptor in recent years tension has emerged between the air force which states requirement for 381 raptors and dods civilian leaders who have re stricted spending plans instead to 184 aircraft f22 supporters won the debate in the 109th congress on whether to grant multiyear procurement myp authority for the final 60 raptors in fy2009 congress provided dod with the resources to either continue f22 procurement beyond the current program of record or to begin closing the production line in early 2009 dod and the 111th congress will be faced with making decision on the f22s future see crs report rl31673 f22a raptor by christopher bolkcom for more information on the f22

larger and more expensive version of the older fa18cd fighterattack plane it has more rangepayload than the fa18s it will replace and has more potential for future modernization in may 1992 the program entered emd with prototypes beginning flighttests in late 1995 and procurement funding beginning in fy1997 in december 2003 the navy awarded fiveyear 86 billion multiyear procurement contract for 210 fa18efs to the boeing company procurement of 493 fa18efs is currently projected at cost 463 billion in then year dollars4 eightyfive electronic attack versions of the aircraftthe ea18g will be procured as replacement for the navys aging ea6b prowler fleet5 separate 1 billion contract was also awarded to develop this aircraft which is estimated to cost total of 86 billion the first operational ea18g was delivered to the navy in june 2008 due to continued operations in afghanistan and iraq department of the navy don officials state that the current strikefighter fleet is ageing prematurely and that the current aircraft modernization plan will not satisfy future needs at its worst don officials projected deficit of more than 90 aircraft in fy2017fy2020 this perceived fighter gap has prompted many to argue that dod should purchase additional fa18ef aircraft beyond the current plan figur 2 fa18f super hornet 4 fa18ef selected acquisition report sar office of the secretary

f35 lightening ii also called the joint strike fighter jsf began in fy1994 as the joint advanced strike technology jast program which emerged after cancellations of the afx and mrf the jsf program seeks to design develop and produce family of affordable jointservice fighterattack planes with conventional takeoff and landing ctol aircraft for the air force and navy and short takeoff vertical landing stovl aircraft for the us marine corps and the uk royal navy in february 2004 air force leaders announced that the air force would also procure some number of stovl variants to improve its ability to prosecute the close air support cas mission and reduce reliance on access to forward bases the jsf is dods largest cooperative acquisition program eight foreign countries have pledged funds to the jsf program 6 number of other countries are being considered for either jsf partnership or as purchasers7 participation is related to the financial contributions to the program by these governments the british government being the major nonus contributor of development funds from 1997 to 2001 the program was in competitive design phase involving prototypes built by both boeing and lockheed martin on october 26 2001 dod announced that lockheed martin won the competition and would move on to the production phase in may 2005 dod approved plan to revamp the jsf program to account for developmental difficulties the revised plan entails stretching out development efforts 16 to 22 months adding 117 billion in costs and cutting the number of aircraft the defense department will buy as now projected some 2456 jsfs would be procured low rate production was approved in 2008 and operational service is scheduled for march 2012 the jsf program is currently estimated december 2007 at 298 billion 8 in its fy2009 budget dod requested funds for the jsf f136 alternate engine program despite clear guidance from the 109th congress that this program was to be pursued the f136 was

aircraft for military missions increased very slowly until the commercial world experienced rapid advances in geopositioning communications and information technologies in the 1980s and 1990s spending on ua vs has more than quadrupled between 2001 and 2009 667 million to 29 billion and the variety of programs and missions is noteworthy the air force and the army currently field three armed ua vs that have increasingly been used to attack ground targets in afghanistan iraq and sewhere the mq1 predator mq9 reaper and extended range multipurpose ermp unmanned ae rial system uas which is based on the shadow 200 ua v the air force plans to purchase 38 predators and 9 reapers in fy2009 to add to the 268 predators and 18 reapers previously ordered the army has purchased 84 shadow ua vs in the past and asks to purchase one more in fy2009 armed ua vs appear to complement manned tact ical combat aircraft advantages of ua vs include risk of losing pilots and long dwell time up to 30 hours which provides persistent surveillance over the battlefield and the ability to attack promptly if necessary disadvantages of ua vs include relatively high accident rate and less flexibility than

possible constraints on defense spending in future years can we afford tactical aircraft modernization programs as currently projected for more than 20 yearssince 1993some observers have predicted train wreck in dods tactical aviation programs these observers see too many aircraft competing for too few dollars in march 2005 for example tactical air and land forces subcommittee chairman representative curt weldon began hearing by obser ving that tactical aviation is in the midst of massive train wreck financially representative weldon noted that the costs of the f22 and jsf had increased by well over 100 and 80 respectively and one impact of these increases was reduced aircraft purchases11 it may be that budgetary train wreck is loom ing as the table below suggests more apt

spending on unmanned aerial vehicles ua vs has more than quadrupled between 2001 and 2009 and dods appetite for these systems show sign of abating all the services wish to recapitalize their helicopter fleets advocates of longrange bombers have been pressuring the air force to maintain its current inventory of bombers and to field replacement earlier than the planned date of 2037 also as congress is well aware replacing dods aging fleet of longrange aerial refueling aircraft is growing priority and will require sustained investment some also believe that previously unanticipated costs associated with combating terrorism may mean that the tac air train wreck has fully arrived crs estimates that since the september 11 terrorist attacks dod has received over 859 bi llion for combat operations occupation and support for military personnel deployed or supporting operations in iraq and afghanistan and for enhanced security at military installations dod and congressional initiatives to increase both personnel benefits and personnel end strength could also increase pressure to reduce tactical aviation budgets the act of matching resources ie budget to objectives in procurement program can be called business case gao for one has argued that the f22 lacks business case gao05304 and that the jsfs business case is unexecutable gao05271 this assertion suggests to some at least implicitly that the relevance of these aircraft as reflected in their currently planned procurement quantities to the current military environment is unclear

expected to continue producing highperformance aircraft and airdefense missiles that could pose serious threats in the 1990s and beyond the f22 was then justified as an advanced aircraft capable of performing combat missions in highthreat military environment with the demise of the soviet union and much changed politicomilitary environment some question the need to procure large quantities of such expensive highcapability aircraft alternatives would be to produce only limited numbers of these aircraft while upgrading and extending the service lives of existing aircraft such as air force f15es and f16cs navy and marine corps fa18cds and navy fa 18efs others argue that advanced combat ai rcraft are not the most applicable airpower resources for counterinsurgency and antiterrorism operations these observers would reduce planned combat aircraft procurement programs in favor of increased investments in unmanned aerial vehicles special operations helicopters medical evacuation aircraft and training and equipping forward air controllers 12 others argue that large numbers of highcapability aircraft are still necessary because russian aircraft and surfacetoair missiles sams are available to potential adversaries of the united states and its allies and some european and asian companies may soon be able to market advanced aircraft and sams to potential enemies in this view the demise of the soviet union does not mean the end of potential highthreat areas requiring advanced aircraft recent acquisitions of fighter aircraft and surfacetoair missiles by china and to lesser degree india have fueled some observers concerns that these countries may effectively challenge us airpower in the future in recent conflicts in iraq and ugoslavia the f117 stealth attack plane played crucial role in destroying targets in highthreat areas having large numbers of such advanced aircraft it is argued will help ensure operational success in future conflicts with wellarmed adversaries most of those questioning the modernization plan acknowledge that proliferation of advanced aircraft and airdefense equipment in the third world will require the united states to field some newgeneration highcapability aircraft they argue however that the gulf war showed the united states has formidable advantage in airtoair combat which can be maintained by procuring limited number of f22s for use against those adversaries who may be able to make effective use of modern russian or european aircraft they note that the stealthy f117s used in the gulf war constituted tiny percentage of all tactical aircraft employed against iraq and only few nonstealthy planes were shot down even in the early days of the war moreover they argue that cruise missiles and stealthy b2 bombers and nonstealthy b1s equipped with adequate standoff munitions could be used against heavily defended targets in this view f22s would be procured in some smaller quantity than the 381 planes currently desired by the air force and could be operated as special silver bullet forces others take issue with the need for any f22s arguing that the air force and navy will face generally the same adversary aircraft in the future and these services now have roughly equal capability in airtoair combat as well as considerable airtosurface attack capabilities with f 15es others point out that the navy will eventually conduct its airtoair combat mission primarily with the fa18ef if the navy does not need new generation stealth fighter for the postcold war era they ask why is such an aircraft required for the air force some also argue 12 see crs report rl32737 military aviation issues and options for combating terrorism and counterinsurgency by christopher bolkcom and kenneth katzman for more

sufficient for carrierbased attack missions against the most likely adversaries in regional conflicts furthermore it can be argued that the successful development of longerrange and more accurate and

aircraft does the united states need the george h bush administrations proposed base force for the mid1990s and beyond reduced force structure to 265 air force fighter and attack wings 13 navy carrier air wings and 4 marine corps air wings compared to 35 15 and 4 air wings respectively in fy1990 budgetary considerations and radically altered international conditions led to these reductions which some argued were appropriate for the postcold war era while others viewed this force structure as excessive secretary of defense aspin announced in september 1993 that the clinton administration projected base force of 20 air force fighterattack wings 13 active 7 reserve 11 navy carrier air wings and 4 marine corps air wings the 1997 qdr recommended major changes in this force structure although the 20 air force tactical wings would comprise 12 active and 8 reserve wings the question of how many wings of tactical aircraft the united states needs for the post911 era and how this number should be determined is part of an ongoing debate in the defense department and congress over the proper overall size of us military forces decisions on this issue can affect views on the affordability and focus of plans for modernizing tactical aircraft reduction in the number of air wings would lead to corresponding reduction in the number of aircraft to be procured however reduction in the number of air wings may lead to decision to increase the proportions of f22s and fa18efs in the force on grounds that reduced forces need more capable equipment in an attempt to save money but maintain combat capability the navymarine corps tactical air integration plan proposed in late 2002 reduced the number of navy and marine corps combat aircraft squadrons by nine 13 deputy secretary of defense gor don england reportedly views this reduction as potential model for dods entire tactical aviation force in march 21 2005 interview mr england noted that by better integrating navy and marine corps tactical aviation the defense department was able to reduce aircraft purchases and save 35 billion while maintaining the same combat capabilities increased efficiencies that might be realized across dods tactical air enterprise might include better integration and more common assets he told reporters mr england advocated that dod examine its whole tactical aviation enterprise and search for efficiencies and savings 14 debate over the size of current and projected tactical aviation forces continues in the 110th congress despite its integration plan described above the navy and

under current procurement plans16 critics of air force claims that fighter gap will emerge argue that such projections are strongly influenced by assumptions on threats and whether the united states will fight alone or part of coalition also some argue that air force demands for more fighter aircraft are driven more by organizational constraints than by actual war fighting needs an argument akin to that levied against the army when it organized itself principally by division rather than by todays more deployable brigade combat teams 17

health of the us defense industrial base is perennial and unsettled issue report by the defense science board published in the spring of 2000 noted that the defense industry was in the midst of painful transition that was complicated by the new economy which was draining human and financial resources unless steps were taken promptly the study concluded the us defense industry would likely be less competitive and financially viable in 5 to 10 years than it was in 2000 july 2000 study by boozallen hamilton reported that the us defense industrial base was in state of decline and national security would be affected if thencurrent trends went unchecked18 2005 study by dod however found major problems with us defense industry19 congressional decisions on tactical aviation programs have serious implications for the aerospace sector of the us industrial base which is major source of technological innovations as well as export earnings aerospace is the nations leading net exporter of manufactured goods with exports exceeding imports in 2005 by 397 billion including 102 billion in military exports according to the aerospace industries association there is general agreement that there were more aircraft manufacturers and subcontractors than recent levels of defense spending could sustain consequently the aerospace industry like other industries heavily dependent on pentagon spending has been undergoing shakeout with some companies leaving the military aircraft business and others merging with fi nancially stronger competitors and downsizing production lines congressional decisions on which military aircraft programs to support could determine which aircraft manufacturers and subcontractors remain in business although the us economy as whole regularly absorbs declines

argue that preservation of critical components of us defense industry is now as important as military requirements which have always been matters of judgment based on threat assumptions that are subject to change there is apparent consensus however about what is most critical to future us military requirements or how excess military industrial capabilities can be converted to civilian production that might enhance international competitiveness in export trade several questions arise out of the industrial base issue how many aircraft manufacturers are needed to support us military needs to what extent should the survivability of these firms be taken into account in deciding which aircraft programs to pursue which aspects of the aerospace industry are genuinely unique and vital to production of us tactical aircraft how can competitiveness among us defense contractors be maintained with fewer firms particularly regarding different design concepts and costreduction innovations in the development and production of planes should foreign sales of us military aircraft be factored into decisions on which tactical aircraft programs to pursue how might decisions on tactical aircraft programs affect us export earnings and international competitiveness of the us aerospace industry there are easy answers to such questions and consensus on these industrial base issues which confront all industrial nations in the early 2000s recently us companies have lost number of competitions to european companies in an area of historic dominance domestic us defense aviation european
