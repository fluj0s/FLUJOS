mechanisms for appointing interim us attorneys statutory changes in the past 21 years there have been two changes in how vacant us attorney positions may be filled on an interim basis pending

attorneys enacted at that time reflected existing language7 that language read as follows the district court for district in wh ich the office of united states attorney is vacant may appoint united states attorney to serve until the vacancy is filled the order of appointment by the court shall be filed with the clerk of the court8 in 1986 congress amended the language to llow for the district court to continue to make an interim appointme nt but first allowed the ttorney general to make an interim appointment of more than 120 days the revised language read as follows except as provided in subsection b the attorney general may appoint united states attorney for the district in which the office of united states attorney is vacant b the attorney general shall not appoint as united states

district c ourts now play role in appointing interim us attorneys to fill vacancies supporters of the 2006 law have argued that district courts occasionally failed to appoint individuals put forward by the department of justice to interim us attorney positions11 and that allowing federal judges to appoint interim us attorney s raises separation ofpowers concerns12 critics of the 2006 law ve claimed that the new law allows us attorneys to be dismissed for political reasons13 and that interim replacements for terminated us attorneys may serve indefinitely wit hout presidential mination or senate confirmation to fouryear terms14 identification of us attorneys serving less than four years the recent dismissal of seven us attorn eys has raised interest in patterns in departures of us attorneys not related to completion of fouryear term or change in presidential administration the dismi ssal has also renewed focus on how interim us attorneys are appointed with several members of c

of the usa patriot act crs attempted to ascertain how often prior to 2007 us attorneys left office before completing their fouryear terms without change in presidential administration methodology in order to determine how many us ttorneys had served less than four years with tenure uninterrupted by change in presidential administration crs began by contacting the executive office for united states attorneys eousa which serves as the liaison between us attorneys and the department of justice crs first contacted the eousa january 24 2007 to seek records on the appointment and termination dates for us attorneys as of february 20 2007 eousa had not provided the requested data crs also contacted the office of personnel management opm which ma intains the central personne l data file cpdf crs spoke with representative in opms cong ressional liaison office and was told that the database could not produce the info rmation needed the opm representative referred crs to the depa rtment of justice absent direct information on starting nd termination dates of us attorneys as well as reasons for their termina tion crs collected data on presidential nomination and senate confirmation of us attorneys during the 97th 19811982 through 109th 20052006 congresses the legisl ative information system lis16 provides searchable database of all nominations submitted to the senate for consideration which allowe d crs to build records of succession for senate confirmed occupants of the 93 us attorney positions using the lis database crs identified each us attorney who was nomin ated to the position less than four years after his or her predecessor was confirme d to the same position nomination of successor less than four years after the confirmation of predecessor suggests that the predecessor had served less than four years in the office17 excluded from these calculations were us attorneys appoi nted after change in presidential administration us attorneys have typically been removed from office by new president so that the new president could appoint his own us attorneys18 two examples may prove illustrative in 1991 president george hw bush nominated and the senate confirmed maurice ellswort h to the position of us attorney for the district of idaho in september 1993 president clinton appointed and the senate conf irmed betty richardson to the same position

ed and the senate confirmed karin immergut to the same position in 2003 gi ven that michael mo sman left office before the completion of his fouryear term and his replacement was appointed by the same president crs attempted to ascertain the reason for his departure using this methodology crs identified 54 instances from 1981 through 2006 in which the tenure of us attorney fell short of the fouryear term specified by statute see the appendix this appro ach likely underestimates the number of us attorneys who departed office before comp letion of their fouryear terms us attorney would not have been included in the appendix if the individual resigned of his or her own initiative or at the presidents request before completing fouryear term was replaced by someone appointed by district court or the attorney general and the president did not make nominati on to replace the individual until after four years from the start of the resigned us attorneys term if for example us attorney confirmed in 1993 resigned in 1996 but nomination to replace that individual was not made until 1998 the data collection method utilized by crs would not have captured the i ndividual who resigned in 1996 once crs identified all us attorneys who met these criteria crs used secondary sources including mar tindale hubbell lawyer locator19 nexis news searches20 and the lis nominations database21 to ascertain the dates and the reasons that the identified us attorneys left office22 findings the appendix identifies 54 us attorn eys who were appoi nted be tween 1981 and 2006 left office before completing thei r fouryear terms and whose terms did not extend beyond one presidents tenure in office the entries in the appendix are sorted in ascending order of confirmation date in each case crs has annotated the results of secondary source searches regard ing the approximate da of departure and the reason for departure from the position seventeen of the 54 us attorneys left office early to
