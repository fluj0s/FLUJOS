congress committee on commerce science and transportation internet tax non continuedstudy to the senate committee on commerce science and transportation and the house committee on energy and commerce by november 1 2005 the repor t was published in january 20062 issues the five main issues surrounding in ternet taxation and ecommerce that congress may address before the 2014 expiration are as follows whether or not to extend the moratorium on internet access taxes and if so temporarily or permanently whether if the moratorium were to be extended to continue to grant grandfather protection for states that imposed taxes on internet access before the original moratorium was enacted how to better define internet acce ss and discriminatory taxes to the satisfaction of ll stakeholders whether to grant states the authority to require remote sellers to collect use taxes if the states adopt ed streamlined sales tax system and if congressional codifica tion of guidelines is needed for establishing whether or not business engaged in interstate commerce has nexus in jurisdiction for purposes of business activity tax bat eg corporate income tax franchise tax business license tax liability these issues remain similar to those considered in 2004 and 2007 the two most recent times the internet tax moratorium was temporarily extended growth in internet technology and electronic comme rce however may generate new policy questions before 2014 the moratorium permanent vs temporary extension the intent of the internet tax freedom act enacted in 1998 was to prevent state taxes on internet access to ensure th at multiple jurisdictions could not tax the same electronic commerce tran saction and to ensure that commerce over the internet would not be singled out for discriminator tax treatment s upporters of extending the moratorium contend that the internet should continue to be protected from the administrative and financial burdens of taxation in order to further advance of internet technology and ssociated economic activity3 opponents of extending thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33261crs4 3 continued discrimination act of 2003 report to accompany s 150 108th cong 1st sess

7 2008moratorium contend that federal morato rium infringes on th states independent authority to levy taxes and further that internet transactions and services should not be afforded preferential tax treatment supporters of permanent extension of the moratorium maintain it would eliminate the need for congress to revisit the issues surr ounding internet taxation when temporary moratorium expires permanent extension presumably could also provide both the producers and consumers of internet serv ices greater certainty about state and local taxation of the intern et opponents on the other hand say permanent extension would not address the underlying issue of federal restrictions on state taxation nor would it clarif the definition of internet access opponents of permanent extension of the moratorium point out that temporary one would allow c ongress to periodically review the conditions of the moratorium and the effect of the moratorium on the states reassessment could then be made in the context of developmen ts in computer technology and business organization as well as state and local g overnment tax administr ation temporary extension could also provide more time for the states to further simplify their sales and use taxes see the discussion below on streamlined sales taxes and remote collection authority allowing the moratorium to sunset w ould permit states to tax internet access although in practice the trend has been for states to repeal thei r internet access taxes as internet technology continues to change the telecommunications industry however state and local governments will likely modify how the industry is taxed sunset of the moratorium could i nduce states to address the taxation of telecommunications more broadly grandfathering of existing access taxes the internet tax freedom act exempted from the moratorium taxes on internet access that were generally imposed and actually enforced prior to october 1 1998 when itfa legislation was bein g considered in the spring of 1998 10 states and the district of columbia were already applying their sales tax to internet access services4 subsequently connecticut iowa tennessee and the district of columbia eliminated their tax on intern et access and south carolina has not enforced the collection of its tax during the federal moratorium these developments left six states imposing sales tax or

administrators the tax may also take the form of sales and use tax or excise tax levied specifically on telecommunications information servi ces or data processing services the definition of which

refined the definition of internet access to include homepage electronic mail and instant messaging services10 telecommunications industry concerns telecommunications carriers were concerned that internet access offered through primarily telecommunications technologies such as dsl or wireless serv ices might not be tr eated as exempt from tax while access offered over other technol ogies such as cable modem would be exempt in an attempt to address thes concerns both pl 110108 and pl 108435 provided that all forms of telecommunicati ons services used to provide internet access would be exempt from state nd local taxes under the moratorium11 state and local government concerns before enactment of pl 108 435 state and local governments were cerned that the tax moratorium could be

retail revenues of telecommunications carriers for their state s universal service fund18 supporters of the universal service prog rams were concerned that efforts to protect internet access and associated tel ecommunications services should not reduce the funding base for universal service the moratorium does not prevent the federal government or the states from imposing or collecting the fees or charges on telecommunications that are used to finan ce the universal service program nor does it prevent states or local governments fro m collecting fees or charges to support 911 or e911 emergency services nor does it affect any federal or state regulatory proceeding that is not related to taxation multiple taxes the ban on multiple taxes prohibits more than one state or more than one local jurisdiction at the same level of government ie more than one county or one city from imposing tax on the same transaction unless credit is offered for taxes paid to anot her jurisdiction however th state county and city in which an electronic commerce transaction takes place could all levy their sales taxes on the transaction discriminatory taxes in practice the ban on discriminatory taxes on electronic commerce means that transactions arranged over the internet are to be taxed in the same manner as mailorder or telephone sales under the current judicial interpretation of nexus as pplied to mailorder sales state cannot require an outof state seller to collect use tax from the customer unless the seller has physical presence in the taxing state19 use tax is the companion tax to the sales tax applicable to interstate sales congress or the supreme court would need to act to grant or approve the states ability to requi re outofstate tax collection whether the transaction was arranged over the internet or by mail order telephone or other means the second part of the itfas definiti on of discriminatory tax lists conditions under which remote sellers use of comput er server an internet access service or online services does not establish nexus these circumstances include the sole ability to access site on remote sellers outofstate computer server the display of remote sellers information or content on the outofstate computer server of provider of internet access service or on line services and processing of orders through the outofstate computer server of provider of internet access service or online services some businesses have taken advantage of these nexus limits in the itfas definition of discriminatory tax to establish what are referred to as

organizati on are an abuse of the definition of discriminatory tax streamlined sales taxes and re mote collection authority in earlier congresses the debate surrounding legisla tion to extend the internet tax moratorium was linked to the states quest for sales and use tax collection authority the issue continues to be whether congress is willing to grant states the authority to require remote outofstate sellers to collect use taxes on interstate sales conditioned on simplification of state and local sales and use tax systems bills were introduced in conjunction with an exte nsion of the moratori um that enumerated criteria for simplified sales and use ta x system and procedures for congress to grant tax collection authority in contrast in the 108th congress and continuing into the 109th and 110th congress the sales tax issue has been pursued separately from the moratorium remote collection issue under current law vendor with substantial nexus usually defined as physical presence in its customers state collects the state and local sales tax on sales arranged over the internet or by telephone mail order or other means in contrast an outofsta vendor without subs tantial nexus in the customers state is not required to collect the sales tax20 technically the customer is required to remit use tax to his or her state of residence21 in practice however use tax compliance by nonbusiness purchas ers is low because of this low compliance many states have long want ed to require outo fstate vendors without physical presence in the respective states refe rred to as remote sellers to collect the use tax from the customer this would apply to all interstate sales whether arranged over the internet or by mailorde r catalog telephone or other means the streamlined sales and

the possibility that states could be au thorized to require remote vendors to collect sales and use taxes on interstate sales raised concerns that states would then attempt to impose income and other busin ess taxes on those vendors in response some multistate businesses asked congress to clarify nexus standards for state and local business activity taxes bats24 past court decisions and the landmark pl 86272 enacted in 1959 15 usc 381 et seq clarified nexus by identifying those activities which would not establish nexus generally soliciting the sale of tangible goods in state for shipment by common carrier from locations outside the state would not be sufficient to trigger nexus proponents of federally defined nexus standards cont end that current federal law does not sufficiently define s ubstantial nexus the issue before congress is whether to codify nexus rules for in tangible property and services not just tangible goods as provided for in pl 86272 currently each state independently implements rules that establish nexus for economic activities that are not covered by pl 86 272 although state rules are very similar for ma ny services and activities there is still significant variation among states on the thre shold for establishing nexus in theory congress could establish uniform federa l standards for imposing state business activity taxes on outofstate businesses some representatives of state and local governments however are concerned that enacting federal nexus guidelines could restrict their ability to levy corporate income taxes or other bats on business activities conducted in their state for example if congress implemented threshol ds at the midpoint level of all existing state nexus rules by definition many stat would lose
