to seek declaratory judgment of invalidity or noninfringement of the licensed patent medimmune v genentech summary according to earlier precedent of the us court of appeals for the federal circuit suit filed by patent licensee in good standing seeking to declare the underlying patent invalid unenforceable or not infring ed is nonjusticiable under the declaratory judgment act because there is actual controversy between the licensee and licensor the federal circuit had asserted that license agreement eliminates any reasonable apprehension that the nonrepudiating licensee will be sued for infringement and thus federal courts must dismiss such declaratory judgment actions for lack of subject matter jurisdicti on under article iii of the us constitution in medimmune v genentech 549 us __ 05608 decided january 9 2007 the us supreme court rejected the ju risdictional rule adopted by the federal circuit holding to the contrary that patent licensee need not materially breach its license agreement for example by ceasing royalty payments to the patent holder before it may bring suit to obtain judgment that the underlying patent is invalid unenforceable or not infringed in situations where the licensorpatentee has implicitly or explicitly threatened to sue for patent infringement if the licensee did not pay the demanded royalties paym ent of royalties under such coercive circumstances does not eliminate the jurisdiction of the federal courts to entertain declaratory judgment actions from patent licensees in good standing the court explained notably this decision is limited to the procedural issue of whether federal courts have subject matter ju risdiction over these types of claims the supreme court declined to express an opinion on the merits of the arguments made by the licensor patentee in the case for denying declaratory relief to the licensee this report provides summary and anal ysis of the supreme courts opinion in medimmune and discusses its

patent licensees right to seek declaratory judgment of invalidity or noninfringement of the licensed patent medimmune v genentech introduction in medimmune v genentech the us supreme court held that at least in instances where the licensorpatentee has implicitly or explicitly threatened to sue for patent infringement if the licensee did not pay the demanded royalties patent licensee need not terminate or breach its license agreement before it may bring suit to obtain declaratory judgme nt that the underlying pate nt is invalid unenforceable or not infringed the us court of app eals for the federal circuit had previously adopted procedural rule that licens ee must stop paying royalties and thereby materially breach the agreement before bringing suit to challenge the validity or scope of the licensed patent the medimmune decision thus repudi ates the federal circuits rule that had resulted in federal courts dismissing such declaratory judgment actions for lack of subj ect matter jurisdiction background patent licensing agreements because the patent act expressly provides that patents shall have the ttributes of personal property1 patent holders may sell their patent rights in legal transfer called an assignment2 alternatively patent holders may grant others license to ex ercise one of the five statutory patent rights3 license is not transfer of ownershi p of the patent but rather is the patent holders permission to another entity to use the invention in limited way typically in exchange for periodic royalty paym ents during the term of the patent4 patent holder may grant to licensee the right to practice the invention through contract typically known as patent licensing agreement the terms of the licensing agreement however may include conditions upon the grant of rights for examplehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34156crs2 5 united states v general ectric co 272 us 476 490 1926 6 john r thomas pharmaceutical patent law 427 bna books 2005 7 schechter thomas supra

of the limitations and conditions of the grant of rights or refuses to comply with the terms of the license agreement such as by refusing to pay the required royalties is potentially liable to the patent holder for breach of contract as well as for patent infringement6 licensee estoppel over the term of patent license agreement licensee may wish to challenge the validity of th underlying patent

been issued for an invention that actually fails to meet all of the statutory standards fo r patentability novelty utility and nonobviousness by challenging the validity of the underlying patent the licensee could avoid paying royalties or freely pur sue other activities that had previously appeared to come within the scope of the patent however prior to 1969 an equitable doctrine known as licensee est oppel prevented patent licensee from denying the validity of the licensed patent this doctrine was developed by courts that were interested in supporting general principles of cont ract law which normally do not permit buyers to repudiate their promis to purchase goods when they become unhappy with the contract made with the sellers at least without some form of compensation to the other party7 in 1969 the supreme court overruled the licensee estoppel doctrine by announcing in lear inc v adkins8 that license agreement does not bar the licensee from challenging the validity of patent the court explained that the important public interest in permitting full and free competition in the use of ideas which are in reality part of the pub lic domain trumps the tec hnical requirements of contract doctrine9 furthermore other policy consider ations weigh in favor of abrogating licensee estoppel licensees may ofte n be the only individuals with enough economic incentive

authorizes federal cour t to issue judgment declaring the legal rights of any interested party seeking such declaration whether or not further relief is or could be sought in case of actua l controversy within its jurisdiction the us supreme court has held that an action for declaratory relief qualifies as case or controversy under article iii12 furthermore it has explained the question in each case is whether the facts alleged under all the circumstances show that there is substantial controvers between parties having adverse legal interests of sufficient immediacy and reality to warrant the issuance of declaratory judgment13 the court has also stressed that article iii requires that the dispute at issue must bedefinite and concrete touching the legal relations of parties having adverse legal interests and that it must be real and substantial controversy admitting of specific relief through decree of conclusive character as distinguished from an opinion advising what the law would be upon hypothetical state of facts 14 however the supreme court has previously opined that the difference between an abstract question and contr oversy contemplated by th declaratory judgment act is necessarily one of degree and it would be difficult if it would be possible to fashion precise test for determining in every case whether there is such controversy15 the us court of appeals for the federal circuit federal circuit16 had attempted to articulate such test the federal circuit developed twopart test to determine whether there was an actual controversy in declaratory judgment action for patent noninfringement or invalidity there must be both 1 an explicit threat or other action by the patentee which creates reasonable apprehension on th part of the declaratory judgment plaintiff that it will face an infringemen t suit and 2 present activity whichhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34156crs4 17 bp chems ltd v union carbid corp 4 f3d 975 978 fed cir 1993 18 359 f3d 1376

taken with the intent to conduct such activity17 in the lear case discussed above the licensee had refused to continue paying royalties and thus was sued by the licenso rpatentee for breach of contract the lower courts in that case had applied th licensee estoppel doctrine to prevent the licensee from raising patent invalidity as defense to the lawsuit as previously discussed the supreme court overruled thos courts and expressly repudiated the licensee estoppel doctrine in 2004 the federal circuit in genprobe inc v vysis inc opined that the lear doctrine does not grant every licensee in every circumstance the right to challenge the validity of the licensed patent18 t h appellate court in genprobe explained licensee cannot invoke the protection of the lear doctrine until it i actually ceases payment of royalties and ii provides notice to the licensor that the reason for ceasing payment of royalties is because it has deemed the relevant claims to be invalid this language posits that licensee must at minimum stop paying royalties and thereby materially breach the agreement before bringing suit to challenge the validity or scope of the licensed patent19 the question that the us supreme court faced in medimmune v genentech was whether patent licensee in good standing meaning that the licensee is complying fully with the license terms meeting royalty payment obligations and cannot be sued by the li censorpatentee must ter minate or breach its license agreement before it can bring declaratory judgment action to challenge demand to pay royalties on the grounds that the unde rlying patent is invalid unenforceable or not infringed20 medimmune v genentech medimmune inc is pharmaceutical company that manufactures drug synagis used to prevent respiratory

coexpression of immunoglobulin chains in recombinant host cells21 medimmune agreed to pay royalties on sales of any licensed products that it may make or sell which would in fringe the claims of

letter asserting that the synagis drug came within the scope of the new cabilly ii pa tent and that therefore it was licensed product for which royalties are owed under the 1997 licen agreement medimmune however believed the cabilly ii patent invalid and unenforceable or alternatively that synagis did not infringe the patents claims despite this assessment medimmune paid the royalties under protest because it considered genentechs letter threat to sue for patent infringement if it failed to comply with the demands therein23 as this drug accounted for more than 80 of the companys revenue from sales since 1999 medimmune was unwilling to risk the consequences of losing patent infringement suit which included being enjoined from selling synagis24 medimmune initiated declaratory judgment action against genentech seeking declaration that the patent was invalid and unenforceable genentech filed defense motion pursuant to fe deral rules of civil proce dure 12b1 asserting that the federal courts lacked article iii jurisdiction over the claim because actual controversy existed be tween the parties the district courts opinion the us district court for the central district of california gran ted genentechs motion dismi ssing the case for lack of subject matter jurisdiction25 the district court explained that it was obliged to dismiss the case26 due to the controlling preceden t of the federal circuits genprobe inc v vysis inc decision in 2004 which had held that patent licensee in good standing cannot establish an article iii case or controversy with regard to validity enforceability or scope of the patent becau the license agreement obliterates any reasonable apprehension that the licensee will be sued for infringement27 because medimmune continued to pa royalties under the license agreement and did not otherwise breach it it was licensee in g ood standing and was not under threat or in reasonable apprehension of suit the court reasoned28 the federal circuits opinion on appeal medimmune conceded that it was free of apprehension of suit and that it continued to pay royalties only to avoid the consequences of successful patent infringement suit by genentech

35 id at 77172medimmune asserted that the lear case provided it with the absolute right to challenge the validity or enforceability of the patent whether or not it breaches the license and whether or not it can be sued by the patentee and appealed for gen probe to be overruled29 in response genentech argued that the facts of the case did not support invocation of lear which had dealt with licensee estoppel but rather that the threshold question for the dispute concerned article iii jurisdiction under the declaratory judgment act30 the federal circuit agreed with genentech and affirmed the district courts judgment relying on its earlier genprobe decision in determining that there was lack of justiciable controversy31 the appellate court rejected the applicability of lear because in that case th licensee had ceased royalty payments thus breaching the license and was then sued by the patentee in contrast the federal circuit explained here such breach was assiduously avoided thus this case does not raise the question of whether pa tent invalidity is available as defense to suit against defaulting licensee the li censee estoppel that wa s laid to rest in lear for there is defaulting licensee and possibility of suit32 the supreme court granted certiorari on february 21 2006 to review the medimmune case in order to answer the following question does article iiis grant of jurisdiction of all cases arising under the laws of the united states implemented in the actual controversy requirement of the declaratory judgment act 28 usc 2201a require patent licensee to refuse to pay royalties and commit material breach of the license agreement before suing to declare the patent invalid unenforceable or not infringed33 the supreme courts opinion on january 9 2007 the supreme court reversed the federal circuits judgment in an 81 decision and remanded the case to the district court the court held that patent licensee is not required to repudiate its license agreement before seeking declaratory judgment in federal court that the underlying patent is invalid unenforceable or not infringed34 writing for the majority justice antonin scalia first explained that the article iii case or controversy requirement would have been satisfied if medimmune had refused to make royalty payments35 at issue here however was whether case or controversy still existed when medimmunes compliance with the license terms eliminated the immediate threat of injury from patent infringement lawsuit justice scalia offered comparison to situation where the government threatens legal action in which there is requirement th at plaintiff expose himself to liability before bringing suit to challenge the basis for the threat for example

of law threatened to be enforced36 in such case he noted courts have not found article iii jurisdiction to be lacking despite the fact that the plaintiffs own action or inaction in failing to violate the law eliminates the imminent threat of prosecution37 although private party rather than the government threatened the enforcement action in medimmune this distinction does not make significant legal difference that would eliminate juri sdiction justice scalia argued38 he identified an earlier supreme court decision altvater v freeman 39 that had substantially similar fact pattern as medimmune in altvater the patentees had filed suit against their licensees to enforce territorial restri ctions in the license the licensees then filed counterclaim for declaratory judg ment that the underlying patents were invalid however the licensees continue d to pay royalties under protest although it was being required to do so under an in junction decree that the patentees had obtained in an earlier case yet justice scalia explained that the absence of an injunction in medimmune does not distinguish the case from altvater because if the altvater licensee had stopped paying the royaltie s in defiance of the injunction the licensee would have risked being liable for actual and treble damages in patent infringement lawsuit40 the altvater court had held certainly the requirements of case or controversy are met where payment of claim is demanded as of right and where payment is made but where the involuntary or coercive nature of the ex action preserves the right to recover the sums paid or to challenge the legality of the claim41 here genentech had demande d that medimmune make ro yalty payments under the licensing agreement and apparently threatened to bring patent infringement lawsuit to enjoin sales of medimmunes synagis drug if royalties were not paid medimmunes payment of royalties under such coercive ci rcumstances does not eliminate jurisdiction of court to entert ain declaratory judgment action justice scalia stated42 he opined the rule that plai ntiff must destroy large building bet the farm or as here risk treble damages and the loss of 80 percent of its business before seeking declaration of its actively contested legal rights finds support in article iii43 justice scalia cautioned that the supreme courts decision in this case is limited to the procedural issue of whether federal courts have subject matter jurisdiction over these types of declaratory judgment acti ons brought by nonrepudiating licensees

the arguments made by the licensorpatentee for denying declaratory relief to the licensee in its briefs filed with the court genentech had appeal ed to commonlaw doctrine that party to contract cannot challenge its validity while simultaneously continuing to reap its benefits44 furthermore genentech had argued that the license agreement itself precluded the suit because when licensee enters such an ag reement it essentially purchases an insurance policy immunizing it from suits for infringement so long as it continues to pay royalties and does not challenge the covered patents permitting it to challenge the validity of the patent without terminating or breaking the agreement alters the deal allowing the licensee to continue enjoying its immunity while bringing suit the elimination of which was part of the patentees quid pro quo 45 justice scalia observed however that these two points raised by genentech went to the merits of the case and not to the question of whether article iii jurisdiction is available over medimm unes declaratory judgment action46 finally noting that the declaratory judgme nt act provides that court may declare the rights and other legal relations of any interested party47 justice scalia decided to leave the equitable prudential and policy arguments in favor of such discretionary dismissal for the lower cour ts consideration on remand48 similarly left for consideration on remand are any meritsbased arguments for denial of declaratory relief in the case in lone dissent justice clarence thomas maintained that patent licensee in good standing must breach its license pr ior to challenging the validity of the underlying patent49 he stated the declarat ory judgment procedure cannot be used to obtain advanced rulings on matters that would be addressed in future case of actual controversy50 in his view medimmunes suit was an attempt to seek ruling on hypothetical or conjectural matters and thus federal c ourts lacked article iii jurisdiction over its claims concluding observations since medimmune was decided the federal circuit has acknowledged that the first prong of its twopart test for declaratory judgment jurisdiction the reasonable appreh ension of suit prong is longer valid because it contradicts supreme court precedent as explained by the medimmunehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34156crs9 51 sandisk corp v stmicroe lectronics inc 480 f 3d 1372 1380 fed cir 2007 the federal circuit expressly chose to leave to another day the effect of medimmune if any on the second prong of its test id 52 lear 395 us at 673 overriding federal po licies would be significantly frustrated if licensees could be required to continue to pa royalties during the time they are challenging patent validity in the courts 53 medimmune 127 sct at 76970 thus it is unc ertain whether nonrepudiating patent licensees who pay royalties under protest may be able to obtain refund of those royalties when the patent is finally held invalid 54 the enforceability of such provision as noted above is unclear however it is possible that licensorpatentee could draft clause pr oviding that the patent may be challenged by the nonrepudiating licensee on the c ondition that such action would trigger steep increase in royalty payments or large lump sum payment to cover the licensors litigation expenses among other things catherine nyarady medimmune v genentech unanswered questions 237 n ew york law journal 22 feb 1 2007court51 medimmune however left open several unr esolved questions whose impact on the patent law remain to be seen lower courts interpretations of the decision will be instructive and the supreme court may well revisit the issues it declined to address in medimmune during future case for example the lear court had ruled that repudiating licensee need not comply with its contract and continue paying royalties until the patent is held invalid by court52 however the medimmune court expressed opinion on whether nonrepudiating licensee is relieved of its contract obligations during the suit challenging the patents validity53 therefore the applicability of the licensee estoppel doctrin to this situation is an open question after medimmune also the medimmune court had emphasized that district courts still have statutory discretionary authority to decline to hear declaratory judgment actions it will be up to licensorspatentees to craft equitable prudential and policy arguments to successfully pe rsuade the district court to exercise that discretion finally the medimmune court did not consider the enforceability of drafting provision in license agreement that obliged licensee not to challenge the validity of the underlying patent unless he or she breached the license other ramifications of medimmune on the patent law are significant first the ruling may spark an increase in patent litigation activity as more patent licensees may find it easier to bring declaratory judgment actions to challenge the patents validity without having to terminate or breach their license agreements before doing so second the decision promises to play role in drafting and negotiating the terms of patent licensing agreements as licensorspatentees may be interested in having licensees agree to the inclusion of challenge clauses54 it is also likely that the decision may have an impact beyond patent law as it ma be applicable to licensing and contract law matters that do not involve intellectual property
