appropriations the administration has requested 572 billion for department of veterans affairs va programs for fy2003 congress appropriated 527 billion for fy2002 and 479 billion for fy2001 the administration proposes legislation to establish 1500 per year deductible for veterans seeking va medical services and who do not have service connected condition or whose incomes are above vas meanstest for free care on february 4 2002 the copayment portion of costsharing had declined for most medical care outpatient visits to 15 from its previous 50 while raising the copayment for prescription drugs to 7 per monthly prescription from 2 the change if enacted would make the average copayment for outpatient visits around 95 until the 1500 deductible limit is met costofliving

bush signed hr 801 pl 10714 which improves montgomery gi benefits for special categories of beneficiaries increases burial and funeral benefits provides greater amounts for adaptive equipment for the severely disabled and excludes family farmland from the va medical care means test pl 10711 has been enacted to expedite the completion of the world war ii memorial on the mall in washington pl 107103 made numerous changes among which are ones which increase the monthly benefit under the montgomery gi bill education program to 800 per month as of january 2002 for threeyear enlistment and raises it

tables table 1 appropriations department of veterans affairs fy2001fy2003 4 veterans issues in the 107th congress introduction federal policy toward veterans recognizes the importance of their service to the nation and the effect that service may have on their subsequent civilian lives the department of veterans affairs va administers directly or in conjunction with other federal agencies programs that provide compensation for disabilities sustained or worsened as result of active duty military service pensions for totally disabled poor war veterans cash payments for certain categories of dependents andor survivors free medical care for conditions sustained during military service and medical care for other conditions much of which is provided free to low income veterans education training rehabilitation and job placement services to assist veterans upon their return to civilian life loan guarantees to help them obtain homes life insurance to enhance financial security for their dependents and burial assistance flags gravesites and headstones when they die the veteran population there were about 253 million veterans as of september 30 2001 of whom 191 million had served during at least one period defined as wartime family members and survivors of veterans totaled about 414 million thus va is potential source of benefits for almost onefourth of the population of the united states onethird of veterans live in 1 of 5 states california florida texas new york pennsylvania the number of veterans is declining and their average age increasing during the fiveyear period from 20002005 the number of veterans is projected to decline by 92 while the number of veterans 80 and older is expected to go up by 834 at the end of fy2000 the median age of veterans was 574 years 36 were over 65 years of age about 55 were female va projects decline of about 26 in the number of veterans between 1990 and 2010 down from one of four men in 1995 to one of eight in 2010 half of whom will be over age 62 decline in the size of military forces and the corresponding effect that decline has had on the number of persons entering veterans status means relatively stable numbers of compensated veterans and fewer veterans seeking readjustment for postservice education and training the number of disabled wartime veterans receiving pensions is declining because of the deaths of existing beneficiaries and because veterans who might once have depended on va pensions as social safety net now have other sources of social insurance primarily social security that bring their incomes above the va pension eligibility levels however the increasing average age of veterans means additional demands for medical services from eligible veterans as aging brings on chronic conditions needing more frequent care and lengthier convalescence crs2 overview of the department of veterans affairs the va is divided into three administrative structures the veterans benefit administration the veterans health administration and the national cemetery administration va programs are funded through 21 separate lines ofappropriations including six revolving funds receiving appropriations 10 revolving funds not receiving appropriations two intragovernmental funds two special fund and six trust funds the cash benefit programs ie compensation and pensions and benefits for eligible survivors readjustment benefits education and training special assistance for the disabled home loan guarantees and veterans insurance and indemnities are mandatory entitlement spending although required amounts are annually appropriated veterans entitlement benefits were once increasing rapidly but now are relatively stable federal obligation to declining population of eligible beneficiaries and constitute about 53 of va spending the remaining programs primarily those associated with medical care facility construction and medical research are annual discretionary appropriations as are funds for the costs of administering va programs unlike the ratio of entitlement spending to discretionary spending in the rest of the federal budget the entitlement portion income security mostly for disability compensation pensions and education benefits of va is declining as percent of total va spending in fy1976 entitlements constituted 73 of vas budget with the remaining 27 discretionary appropriations for va health care administration and construction by fy2002 mandatory spending had fallen to 53 of the total va budget as discretionary spending had risen to 47 for the entire federal budget about onethird of spending is discretionary va budget and appropriations summary appropriations in the 107th congress fy2003 the administrations budget request for department of veterans affairs va programs during fy2003 is 572 billion an increase of 44 billion over the amount projected to be the final appropriations recorded for fy20021 about 18 billion results from projected increases in mandatory spending for va cash entitlement programs the va medical care program would receive about 26 billion in additional appropriations under the administrations budget fy2002 after including updated spending for increased mandatory spending for va entitlements the administrations fy2003 budget documents estimate vas total appropriation for fy2002 to be 527 billion according to the conference report accompanying pl 10773 the vahud appropriation bill as the bill 1 final spending levels remain uncertain until all program experience has been recorded and any supplemental appropriations or rescissions have been included crs3 containing annual appropriations for va is popularly known hrept 107272 the administration requested 507 billion for va programs for fy2002 the house had previously approved 514 billion for va programs for fy2002 the senate version of the bill contained 511 billion the difference was primarily in fund the house bill proposed that would have provided 300 million to upgrade va medical facilities for safety and for corrections of earthquake damages the concurrent resolution on the budget for fy2002 hconres 83 had assumed that the ultimate amount appropriated would be 515 billion after improvements to the montgomery gi bill and veterans burial benefits were adopted spending for va programs va cash benefits spending for the va cash benefit programs is mandatory and the amounts requested by the budget are based on projected caseloads definitions of eligibility and benefit levels are in law while the number of veterans is declining va entitlement spending mostly serviceconnected compensation pensions and readjustment primarily education payments reached 234 billion in fy2000 257 billion in fy2001 is expected to be 279 billion in fy2002 and is projected to reach 293 billion in fy2003 much of the projected increases for fy2001 and fy2002 result from liberalizations to the montgomery gi bill the primary education program compensation and pensions the compensation program pays benefits to living veterans who have suffered loss or reduction in earning capacity as result of condition traceable to period of military service and to the dependent survivors of certain veterans the va pension program is meanstested benefit for permanently disabled from condition unrelated to their military service veterans of wartime service whose incomes and assets fall below certain levels after taking into consideration the financial circumstances and dependents of eligible veterans the pension payments along with countable income are intended to bring their total incomes to the targeted amounts2 given the broad availability of other sources of income including social security program caseload is diminishing as fewer veterans have incomes below the categorical levels during fy2002 about 23 million veterans are drawing an average of 633 in monthly compensation for serviceconnected disabilities about 310000 of their dependent survivors are averaging about 1021 in monthly payments pensions for 346000 veterans averaged about 569 monthly 233000 survivors of veterans pensioners averaged about 245 monthly readjustment following tradition going back to the beginnings of the republic near the end of world war ii congress enacted series of programs to assist veterans in their readjustment to civilian life and to help the national economy adapt to the influx of demobilizing armed forces the gi bill has entered the 2 for 2002 the annual basic level for an eligible single veteran is 9556 with 1 dependent 12516 and each additional dependent 1630 additional amounts are available for eligible veterans who are housebound or in need of aid and attendance crs4 national lexicon as an example of federal responsibility for this readjustment responsibility and many citizens continue to refer to the current array of programs by that historical name indeed the largest current program providing readjustment education benefits is named the montgomery gi bill program after its congressional sponsor and the heritage it brought into the age of an allvolunteer military service without conscription to fill the ranks of active duty armed services the inducements to potential recruits must be sufficient to attract them to enlist the montgomery gi bill provides recruits with the promise of educational assistance when they separate and the amounts that eligible participants receive has climbed significantly over the last few years currently 800 per month for 36 months for threeyear enlistment and scheduled to rise to 900 per month on october 1 2002 and 985 per month on october 1 2003 during fy2003 about 22 billion in total payments for education payments will go to 326000 active duty veterans 79000 reservists and 50000 dependents table 1 shows appropriations enacted for fy2001 amounts requested enacted for fy2002 and amounts requested for fy2003 table 1

care va operates the nations largest health care system with 172 hospitals 137 nursing homes 43 domiciliaries 206 readjustment counseling centers vet centers 73 home healthcare programs and about 900 outpatient clinics about 88 of vas 207000 employees will be involved in the provision of medical services to an estimated 47 million veterans during fy2002 caseload expected to reach 49 million by the end of fy2003 the fy2001 caseload was about 42 million unique patients outpatient visits are climbing rapidly the total number of such visits had reached 438 million during fy2001 and is projected to increase by 23 million over fy2002fy2003 from slightly less than 47 million to 492 million patients will average around 12 visits per veteran patient served almost 2000 medical care employment slots will shift from inpatient programs to outpatient care according to va data accompanying the fy2003 budget the daily inpatient caseload for fy2002 is projected to be 57522 rising to 58361 patients by the end of fy2003 there is decline in all service units except for 2 categories acute care and nursing homes acute care patients have increased because of the larger number of total numbers of veterans who are seeking va medical services and while the total number of acute care cases has increased by 2700 over the last year the average daily census for acute care has actually declined by 20 patients in reflection of the aging of the veteran population and the commitment by congress to increase the capacity of va to serve an aging veteran population the number of patients given convalescent care is projected to increase by over 7000 during the next year with the average daily nursing home census rising by 1205 patients the administration has asked congress to provide 235 billion for va medical care for fy2003 continuing the annual increases in funds as the program continues crs6 to serve larger number of veterans each year fy2002 congressional appropriations for va medical care were 213 billion 1 billion above the 203 provided for fy2001 congress approved 19 billion for fy2000 medical care cost collections in addition to the funds provided by congress va medical care is also authorized to recycle budget authority from amounts va facilities collect from various sources with an obligation to help defray the cost of va care for certain patients the balanced budget act of 1997 pl 105 33 gave va authority to retain net receipts of the medical care collections fund mccf allowing the funds to be spent for medical services to veterans rather than be transferred to the treasury as under previous law current estimates are that the change added an estimated 767 million in recycled spending authority in fy2001 and will generate an estimated 805 million in fy2002 and 108 billion in fy2003 health services improvement fund congress also created new fund for fy2002 the health services improvement fund which collects increases in pharmacy copayments that went in to affect on february 4 2002 this new fund also receives income from enhanced use leases which are arrangements for sharing va medical assets with paying customers from outside of va these leases can include the revenue from liquidation or leasing of va capital assets as well as income from va services for which users have contracted an estimated 226 million will be recycled to va facilities from this fund in fy2002 and an estimated 365 million will be gained in fy2003 medical research the va engages in research as ancillary function of the treatment of veterans and conducts independent research projects intended to advance medical science almost onehalf of vas research funding comes from conventional medical research funding sources the bulk of which is provided through grants from the national institutes of health nih the remaining funds supporting va research are split almost evenly between appropriations from congress specifically for such research and salaries and expenses from the va medical care budget for the va medical staff who are producing the studies that exhibit vas research findings about twothirds of the research projects are initiated by the medical staff reporting their findings these projects are giving greater attention to the diseases associated with an aging population especially in conjunction with the management of those chronic conditions that are growing part of the outpatient workload the administration has requested 409 million in direct appropriations for va research in fy2003 congress provided 371 million for va research in fy2002 350 million for fy2001 and 321 million for fy2000 response to hepatitis c hcv the centers for disease control and prevention cdc estimates that over 4 million americans are infected with hepatitis c and some data exists that the disease is even more prevalent among veterans than in the general population va study in 1999 found that the veterans it surveyed had prevalence rate of 66 compared to an estimated 18 in the general population upon release of the study leading veterans groups and some health care professionals advocated an aggressive response by va to combat the crs7 contagious threat the administrations budget estimated that funding for the diagnosis and treatment of infected veterans would rise to 340 million in fy2001 up from 195 million in fy2000 and 46 million in fy1999 however va analysts were concerned that comprehensive system was in place to collect information about actual workloads and costsfor the hepatitis c program because the projections for them were based on formulas that relied on untested assumptions and actual performance particularly for fy2000 did not bear out projections while hepatitis c continues to be serious health issue in need of dedicated attention to its causes prevalence diagnosis treatment management and possible cure it does not appear as if the dire predictions about its effect on the veteran population has occurred actual costs for hcv related medical services during fy2001 are estimated to have been 98 million and for fy2002 are projected to reach 105 million with 111 million expected to carry out diagnosis and treatment during fy2003 veterans housing benefits the va program to guarantee home loans for veterans has made significant contribution to the national goal of increasing the number of families who own their own homes because of the guarantees lenders are protected against losses up to the amount of the guarantee thereby permitting veterans to obtain mortgages with little or down payment and with competitive interest rates these guarantees and certain direct loans to specific categories of veterans were obligations of the federal government that constituted mandatory spending administrative expenses are discretionary appropriations transferred from the home loan programs to the general operating expenses account va construction the administration has requested 194 million for major construction projects for fy2003 and requested the same amount for minor construction as was appropriated for fy2002 congress provided 183 million in major construction for fy2002 and 211 million in minor construction major construction projects are those with an estimated cost over 4 million many of the minor construction projects will continue vas overall strategy of expanding outpatient access congress provided 66 million for major construction and total of 171 million for minor construction for fy2001 pl 10674 included 65 million for major construction and 160 million for minor construction for fy2000 capital asset realignment va has developed comprehensive planning approach to constructing altering extending or otherwise improving facilities in part this new planning approach called capital asset realignment for enhanced services cares is the departments reaction to the criticism it has received from areas of the country in which hospital resources have been cut back in order to redirect those resources to outpatient care usually in other geographical areas while va has been successful in expanding the number of patients it serves conflict continues between advocates of more efficient use of resources who advocate reducing hospital space and closing or selling superfluous inpatient facilities and veterans groups who see any reduction in inpatient care as threat to the medical care needs of the veteran population the cares effort is an attempt to make the planning process by which the capital assets are developed used modified or relinquished open to veterans crs8 groups often the fears about reductions in health care to veterans are based on an inadequate understanding of the improvements in care for more veterans that such realignment of resources makes possible and the cares approach may lessen those misunderstandings some veterans have expressed the belief that over time moving resources from an inpatient facility in one area to outpatient access in another yields an unacceptable rate of deterioration in the former facility as the commitment to maintain the building is diminished as the department moves toward its eventual abandonment burial and cemetery benefits payments to honor and help defray the cost of veterans burials will total about 155 million in fy2003 and cover about 84 thousand burials 69 thousand burial plots 9 thousand serviceconnected deaths 528 thousand flags and 354 thousand headstones and markers department administration the administration has requested 1317 billion for general operating expenses goe for fy2003 and 77 million for medical administration congress approved the administrations request for funds for administration for fy2002 providing 1195 billion for goe and 68 million for medical administration pl 106377 included 1050 billion of the requested 1062 billion requested for goe and 62 million for medical administration for fy200 pl 10674 provided 913 million for goe and 60 million for administration of the medical care programs for fy2000 va employment estimates the bush administration projects overall va employment will decline to an average of 204670 in fy2002 down from an average 205896 during fy2001 which was up from an average of 202621 during fy2000 and 205547 in fy1999 much of the decline will be in medical staff which va projects will average 179300 during fy2002 currently va projects that va medical care slots will average 181500 in fy2001 va originally estimated that 179206 medical care slots were needed for fy2001 compared to an 179520 in fy2000 and 182661 in fy1999 accrual accounting part of the 44 billion increase in total va spending for fy2003 does not reflect expanded program costs for additional benefits or medical services to veterans but rather change in methods by which future compensation for va employees who will eventually retire is attributed to current service those employees perform this new accounting method would result in the transfer of 892 million to central accounts in the treasury to fund the accruing future cost of retirement and retiree health benefits for va employees because the accrued funds would be retained in government fund this new accounting practice does not affect employees benefits in any way nor does it have direct impact on taxpayers however to cover the accrual payments the changing practice makes the apparent current cost of va employment somewhat higher especially in the labor intensive medical programs as appropriations to fund requested program levels must be higher than would otherwise be required to maintain the same level of services although there is necessary reason for accrual accounting to make any difference in total government expenditures the apparent higher personnel costs for individual crs9 agencies may act as psychological impetus to reduce personnel expenditures if congress requires the agency to absorb the accrual transfer within an appropriation that does not increase to meet the new requirement closer look at ongoing issues medical care in recent years congress has invested substantial resources to improve the efficiency quality and breadth of va medical care and to make that care more accessible to more veterans the va medical care system has been transformed from hospitalbased program providing most of its services to inpatient treatment of relatively small percentage of veterans who tended to be older sicker poorer and more frequently minorities than the general population while va continues to provide inpatient treatment to its traditional clientele the va system is increasingly emphasizing outpatient care administered through regional va health plans organized around managed primary care principles and provided in an increasing number of outpatient clinics the number of individual veterans served by va medical care staff has increased by 65 in the last seven years and nearly all of that increase has been in primary care provided through outpatient clinics in fy1996 va medical care resources were split evenly between inpatient and outpatient services by fy2003 inpatient care will consume less than onethird of the resources as the average age of the veterans population rises more attention is being directed toward the additional medical issues pertinent to older aged patients the 106th congress enacted legislation directing va to expand its geriatric services including nursing home care and other extended care capacity and to develop more assisted living arrangements and practices consistent with an evolving medical view about improving the lives of elderly people at the same time an increasing reliance on outpatient services has increased the importance of vas pharmacy program in its role implementing outpatient treatment plans the increasing awareness of va pharmacy benefits has magnified the relative absence of similar benefits under medicare the primary federal medical program serving people over the age of 65 veterans are not denied care currently va medical personnel can be expected to provide medical services to all veterans who appear at va medical facilities seeking care veterans seeking appointments may sometimes be discouraged by va administrative staff from having their medical needs served through va and encouraged to seek health care services elsewhere in the community in practice however all veterans presenting health complaints to va medical facilities are screened to determine their medical condition the disposition of most cases occurs simultaneously with that screening for instance veteran complaining of sore throat asks to see doctor va medical staff examine the patient diagnose an infection prescribe an appropriate crs10 antibiotic which is then filled at an onsite va pharmacy if during this screening patient is discovered as having an emergent condition condition that left untreated could threaten the health of the patient the medical staff can be expected to initiate an appropriate course of treatment without regard to eligibility status in the event that the medical staff commitment to address all complaints was to come into conflict with resource limitations vas medical care professionals would allocate the services they could provide according to the traditional triage model applicants would be given access to care based on the urgency and type of conditions presented and those veterans most in need of care would be given high priority for services regardless of those veterans overall place in the priority schedule administered by va health care resource management this potential sharp contradiction between medical and administrative priorities has not occurred appropriated resources and the shift of more services from inpatient to outpatient settings has allowed va to serve all veterans applying for care without denying care to any particular veteran with medical need identified by va medical professionals while some veterans have complained that services are not given to them in the same manner or location as they had previously experienced this change is not itself denial of care but rather byproduct of the efficiency efforts yet some areas of the country continue to feel the pinch of reduced va medical resources as programs dependent upon inpatient capacity give way to outpatient services shifting resources from underutilized inpatient care to outpatient clinics increases the number of veterans who can be served by the same number of va medical personnel 75 of the va medical care budget funds medical care personnel either as federal employees or through contracted care at the same time this shift in resources can result in the termination of programs that often rely upon inpatient capacity especially those concerned with mental health and substance abuse programs costsharing for veterans medical care for the treatment of service connected conditions is free to veterans care for nonserviceconnected conditions is also free for veterans rated at 50 or greater for purposes of va compensation for serviceconnected conditions3 the largest category of other veterans eligible for free nonserviceconnected care have limited assets below 50000 and income below an annually adjusted standard in 2001 23688 single 28429 one dependent 1586 each additional dependent veterans awarded purple heart for injuries sustained during combat are exempt from copayments for medical services but may remain subject to copayments for pharmacy benefits other veterans who may be eligible for free care are those who were exposed to environmental contaminants such as agent orange during service in vietnam or who were prisonersofwar 3 although the law specifies that veterans with 50 or greater disability ratings are assurred free va medical care in practice va generally does not seek costsharing payments from veterans with serviceconnected disability ratings of 10 or greater crs11 remaining veterans priority 7 are primarily veterans who do not have rating for compensable serviceconnected disability are not seeking care for condition potentially traceable to an environmental hazard encountered in vietnam or the persian gulf do not meet other specific criteria associated with the circumstances of the military service and have incomes and assets above the va medical care means test these priority 7 veterans can receive va care but are obligated for share of the costs of such care in the past va patients tended to be older sicker poorer and more likely to have social problems and mental illness than persons using private health care facilities4 increasingly va patients are drawn from cross section of the population that more closely resembles the general public after considering the differences in demographics between the veteran population and others indeed the administration reports that the largest growth in veterans seeking va care are veterans who do not have serviceconnected condition do not have incomes that fall below vas income test and do not meet any other criterion warranting free va care under current law these priority 7 veterans have climbed from about 2 of the patients seen in 1986 to about 33 currently and are projected to climb to 42 of the patients va provides services to by 2010 according to va documents supporting the administrations request for fy2003 for inpatient care copayments are equivalent to the medicare costsharing schedule for 2002 veterans pay 792 for the first 90 days of hospitalization during any 365 day period plus 10 per day each additional 90 days requires copayment of onehalf that initial amount plus 10 per day the nursing home charge is equal to the full amount plus 5 per day for outpatient care veterans are obligated for 20 of the projected average cost of an outpatient visit this formula yields copayment of 50 for outpatient visits in 2001 veterans single dependents with incomes above 9304 in 2001 are obligated for 2 for each monthly outpatient prescription filled through the va pharmacy system changes made in va copayment schedule under authority of the millennium health care act pl 106117 va was given the authority to revise the costsharing structure to bring copayments more into line with prevailing private sector practices these changes reduce the outofpocket cost to veterans who seek care in va facilities because of lack of health insurance elsewhere or because the insurance they have including medicare does not provide much in the way of coverage for prescription drugs before february 4 2002 priority 7 veterans were obligated for relatively high copayment for va outpatient visit 50 and many veterans expressed dismay when told that they owe an outpatient visit copayment even if they are only seeking to have prescription filled by va pharmacy at 2 per month copayment many of these veterans sought care from va because they had been given an expensive prescription by another medical care provider and they did not have insurance benefits that would pay the cost of that prescription frequently these veterans were covered by medicare and did not understand why they should need to see two 4 fy2000 va budget submission v 2 medical programs p 28 crs12 providers at government expense when it was the same condition that was to be treated as result of instructions given to the department by pl 106117 va has introduced new copayment structure beginning february 4 2002 under the new structure priority 7 veterans will pay copayment of 15 for primary care visit and 50 for visit to specialist those veterans obligated for copayments for drugs will now pay 7 dollars for each months supply preventive medical services including flu shots laboratory tests certain radiological services hepatitis c screening and certain other preventive services would not require copayment in most cases proposed deductible in its budget proposals for va for fy2003 the administration has requested legislation that would establish deductible for priority 7 veterans of 1500 per year assignable at rate of 45 of the cost of each visit until the maximum level is reached thus under the administrations plan veterans who have had their copayment reduced from 50 per visit under provisions engendered by pl 106117 would have their copayments increased to about an average of 95 per visit until the maximum of 1500 is reached in calendar year in part the basis for the administrations request is to discourage the rise in the rate at which priority 7 veterans are enrolling in va health care plans copayments are generally not thought of as ways of raising money from the population of patients affected but as way of discouraging those persons from seeking care through that system of services va projects that the imposition of their proposal would yield 260 million in copayments and reduce services by 885 million by discouraging priority 7 enrollees from seeking services for which the copayment is applicable the va pharmacy formulary va does not operate pharmacy in the same sense in which drugstore can be expected to fill prescriptions across the full spectrum of available medical supplies va operates pharmacy in conjunction with the treatment plans developed by va medical staff for treating specific conditions among its patientveterans in order to improve the efficacy of its treatments and to maximize the bargaining position of va pharmaceutical purchasing agents va staff developed limiting list called formulary that guides the va physician in prescribing drugs from among those that have similar effectiveness5 thus va physician must see veteran in order to prescribe drugs for that patient both to assure that va quality of care criteria are respected and will continue to develop through statistical examination of patient outcomes and to match the veterans prescription needs with those available through va pharmacy the 107th congress will likely continue to encourage the directions taken by the va medical program over the last few years in the absence of comprehensive prescription drug benefit under the medicare program veterans otherwise eligible for medicare benefits will continue to seek pharmacy benefits from va and will 5 the va pharmacy formulary does not prevent va physician from prescribing outside the formulary provided the physician has medical justification for doing so crs13 continue pressure on congress and the department to modify the amounts veterans obligated for costsharing payments are expected to pay for outpatient visits geriatric care pl 106117 added to extended care services for veterans including geriatric evaluation nursing home care domiciliary services adult day health care noninstitutional alternatives to nursing home care home or residence assistance and respite care for caregivers the act instructed va to assure access for the services to any veteran who needs such care for serviceconnected condition and to any veteran with serviceconnected disability rated at 70 or higher language in the act also instructed va to increase emphasis on mental health services especially such services applicable to posttraumatic stress disorder and substance abuse the act also authorized va to pay for emergency care on behalf of uninsured enrolled veterans who are within two years of having received va health care at the time of the emergency the new law authorized va to increase from 2 monthly the copayment obligation on those veterans ineligible for free prescriptions establish maximum monthly and annual amount for veterans with multiple prescriptions and revise outpatient care copayments for higher income veterans pl 106117 gave high priority access to va medical services for military retirees which had the effect of placing priority access for military retirees ahead of veterans who do not qualify for free relatively highpriority care because they do not meet the standards for serviceconnected free care and they do not have incomes and assets below vas meanstested threshold also veterans awarded purple heart are now to be given access to free higher priority health care it should be noted however the priority access has not had the effect of denying care to any veterans as the va health plan enrollment system has remained open to all veterans who enroll medicare subvention work will likely continue on rationalizing the relationship between the va and medicare programs many veterans advocates have suggested that va should also be reimbursed for nonserviceconnected care va provides veterans who are also covered by medicare medicare subvention meaning transfer or subsidy from the medicare trust funds is the term by which this proposal is known if medicare were to transfer funds to cover the cost of vas services to its existing caseload of patients who are also covered by medicare medicare program outlays could increase and va would experience an increase in spending authority on the other hand if va served additional veterans whose care is currently paid by medicare and if va provided that care less expensively than providers who would otherwise be reimbursed through medicare then real savings could be possible both to taxpayers and to medicare offset against this potential savings would be any costs accrued by va for services to additional patients and for benefits that va provides that medicare does not cover for its participants such as prescription drugs if subvention caused the government to provide more in total services than would otherwise have been provided overall federal spending would increase unless savings in the cost of crs14 providing those services through va instead of through medicare reimbursement of private health care providers equals or exceeds the cost of the additional services however the real stumbling block to subvention appears to be the fact that va already serves medicare patients for which it is not reimbursed by medicare and that will continue without change in law under any scenario medicare would transfer funds to va for services va provided to medicarecovered veterans and for which medicare would otherwise be obligated to pay to private providers thus there is real incentive for medicare advocates to support plan which transfers medicare funds to va to pay for services that medicare would not otherwise pay for at all subvention recent proposals one approach receiving attention in the last two congresses would have permitted veterans with medicare eligibility whose va eligibility requires them to share in the cost of their medical care to enroll in va plan and have their medicare benefits provided through that plan medicare would then pay va the same rate per covered person that it would pay for those persons to enroll in similar private prepaid plan approved by medicare medicare subvention would require va and the department of health and human services hhs to coordinate the collection of data which would be analyzed to make sure that medicareeligible veteran receives less in medical benefits through va than would be received directly through medicare and that reimbursements to va from medicare do not exceed established limits under legislation deliberated in the previous two congresses the medicare trust fund would have been authorized to reimburse va for medicare services it provides to these duallycovered veterans by up to 50 million annually va would serve the medicarecovered veterans in these plans in the most appropriate venue whether in va facility or through contracts with private health care providers late in the 2nd session of the 106th congress an amended version of the evolving medicare subvention proposal was deliberated during the development of legislation to enact comprehensive changes to medicare various participants including the house ways and means committee the house commerce committee the senate finance committee together with house and senate leadership proposed an agreement called the medicare medicaid and schip benefits and improvement and protection act of 2000 which was then attached to hr 2614 bill to amend the small business investment act the agreement passed the house on october 26 2000 but the provisions to establish medicare subvention pilot program were dropped from the bill before action was taken another approach deliberated during the 106th congress that addressed some of the same issues in dual medicareva medical coverage would have permitted va to pay some of the costs associated with treatments given to veteran in nonva medical facility when va determined that it is in the veterans medical interest to provide such care outside va for practical reasons such as the distance veteran might need to travel to reach an appropriate va medical facility four pilot projects were to be authorized and the projects selected were to be located in such way as to limit the number of veterans participating to more than crs15 15 of those living in the area 70 of the veterans in the area must have travel of more than 2 hours to reach facility and the total that could be spent on the projects in any fiscal year was to be limited to 50 million the pilot projects were to expire in 2005 and any adverse effects on va medical facilities would have prompted changes in projects proponents of these provisions pointed to the increased access that would result from veterans becoming able to seek care closer to their homes and noted that the number of veterans seeking care from va is increasing fast enough to compensate for diminished demand at the facilities affected in effect the provisions would have allowed va to pay costs including copayments and deductibles for veterans in va plans who were also covered by other plans including medicare opportunities for veterans to seek care elsewhere alarms some veterans organizations which believe it could lead to an erosion of va specialization in veterans disability services and declines in the number of veterans seeking services at va medical facilities they conclude that such changes when combined with va efficiency moves shifting care from inpatient facilities to outpatient clinics would mean the eventual closing of va hospitals the ongoing issue of presuming service connections the relationship between risk exposure and subsequent disabilities introduction some veterans and their advocates believe that exposure to environmental toxins or unknown and mysterious diseases during military service has left many veterans vulnerable to an array of disabilities later in life in recent times congress has considered the concerns of veterans with claims arising from service in nuclear testing areas vietnam and the persian gulf authority for va to provide medical treatment for diseases presumed linked to radiation has been made permanent similar authority to receive high priority medical treatment for diseases presumed related to exposure to agent orange and other herbicides in vietnam expires at the end of 2002 authority for priority medical treatment for veterans who may have been exposed to toxic substances or environmental hazards during the persian gulf war expired at the end of 2001 authority to evaluate the health of spouses and children of persian gulf war veterans expires at the end of this year although major legislation has not been considered in the 107th congress the issue of presuming disabilities to be serviceconnected and the implications of such presumptions is of ongoing concern to congress and to veterans service organizations the following discusses the history and current status of this issue giving veterans the benefit of the doubt the nation has accepted an obligation to veterans who incur injury disease or aggravate an existing condition va law calls all of these disabilities while in service to the country health services cash payments and other benefits may be given to veterans who experience disabilities traceable to period of military service these disabilities need not have occurred in the line of duty or even be related to active duty for condition to be regarded as serviceconnected veterans need show only that the condition occurred or was aggravated as result of military service or arose during that period crs16 to receive benefits for serviceconnected disability veterans are required to document that their condition is related to their service the claim is often clearly documented by pertinent military records however with some disorders evidence of serviceconnection is inconclusive congress has sometimes granted presumption of serviceconnection so that veterans can be treated and given appropriate compensation while scientific studies attempt to determine whether correlation can be found between risks the veteran encountered during military service and the subsequent manifestation of disorder early in the 20th century these presumed serviceconnections permitted va and its administrative forerunners to treat veterans for variety of little understood ailments that they might have contracted during duty in faroff lands while many tropical diseases long defied routine diagnosis more familiar diseases such as malaria were diagnosed accurately and the sporadic recurrence of its symptoms over time were well known the passage of time between veterans exposure to risk and onset or recurrence of specific disease made the use of presumptions an attractive alternative to protracted examination of claim that was necessarily difficult to validate or rebut recent presumption issues current concern that latent illnesses could be related to toxic exposure during gulf war service was preceded by similar concern that certain diseases could be related to exposure to agent orange or other herbicides in vietnam that concern was preceded by concerns that certain diseases could be related to exposure to nuclear radiation during world war ii or during atomic testing in the 1950s in these cases policy objectives were based on the rationale that veterans should be given the benefitofthedoubt as to the treatment of illnesses potentially traceable to military service 1 these veterans were sick with serious diseases needing treatment 2 they did serve their country often in wartime combat zone and 3 capacity to provide the services existed if they were given high priority access from scientific standpoint the evidence necessary for va to conclude that particular presumption should be expanded to include additional diseases is not particularly high threshold generally speaking the law excludes extending presumptions to disorders in which scientific evidence has found correlation between exposure to risk and the contraction of disorder or when the disorder is attributable to another cause yet other scientific evidence even when inconclusive may be enough for the list of disorders with presumptive service link to be expanded presumptions and exposure to nuclear radiation from 1945 until 1963 the us exploded approximately 235 nuclear devices in the atmosphere potentially exposing an estimated 220000 military personnel to unknown levels of radiation some of these veterans later claimed that low level radiation released during the testing may be cause of certain adverse health consequences they had experienced in addition some veterans who had been among occupation forces in hiroshima and nagasaki after the atomic bomb attacks on those cities also claimed that they had experienced adverse health effects because of that occupation service crs17 while carcinogenic and other health effects of high radiation doses was well known scientific evidence about the longterm health consequences of exposure to low levels was inconclusive in 1987 congress chose not to abide by its longstanding tradition that benefits should be paid only where substantive evidence is clearly available to establish that the disabling conditions existed while on active duty or are clearly related to such period of service instead congress accepted the conclusion that because the evidence of exposurelevel risk could not be verified it should depend instead on correlation of various diseases with radiation exposure pl 100321 included language establishing presumption that 13 diseases would be presumed to be serviceconnected if they manifested in veterans whose service histories included active duty in radiationrisk activity6 the va opposed passage of the bill arguing that existing law was sufficient to permit awarding benefits in cases in which the evidence linking diseases to radiation exposure was conclusive at the heart of the objection to the bill was the administrations claim that the overwhelming majority of veterans covered by the bill received very low doses of radiation whether they participated in the weapons tests or the occupation of hiroshima or nagasaki va examined scientific data on correlations between various cancers and radiation exposure at the level that had been experienced by the veterans and projected that of the 32000 to 34000 deaths from cancer that would otherwise occur among the 200000 veterans made eligible for the presumption under the law the additional exposure from their service experience would lead to 10 additional deaths the administration concluded that the issue really becomes whether the federal government should presume that all 32010 eventual cancers among atomic veterans are serviceconnected in order to assure that the 10 possible excess cases related to service are covered or whether it is better public policy to look at each case individually to separate the more deserving claims from those less deserving7 in spite of the va opposition the bill passed and subsequently has been amended to include additional diseases expanding presumptions to include exposure to agent orange congress also granted priority medical treatment to veterans who had been exposed to the defoliant agent orange the active ingredient in that defoliant is the chemical dioxin for which there is some evidence of diseasecausing potential by the time that congress enacted legislation authorizing the treatment of diseases possibly linked to radiation exposure increasing numbers of veterans of service in vietnam were claiming serviceconnection for disabilities that they believed were related to exposure to agent orange when concern mounted that exposure to herbicides in vietnam could have posed health risk the department of defense examined its records to determine which personnel may actually have been exposed and what level of exposure they may have experienced however deployment records and troop movement data 6 hrept 100235 report from the house committee on veterans affairs to accompany the atomic veterans compensation act of 1987 pl 100321 7 ibid p 1011 crs18 could not pinpoint exposure with accuracy congress drew the conclusion that exposure to agent orange or to other herbicides regardless of their toxicity at sufficient levels to be potentially diseasecausing had to be presumed given the widespread use of herbicides because exposure to toxic herbicides was presumed for any military personnel who served in vietnam during the period in which agent orange was used science need only find some evidence suggestive of an association between particular disease and exposure to herbicides at any level in order to validate presumption that the disease is serviceconnected presumption for spina bifida in 1996 congress amended va law to grant the presumption of serviceconnection to claims on behalf of children stricken by the disease spina bifida who are born to vietnam veterans spina bifida is birth related disease that can entail intensive and expensive assistance to the child for years the basis for this expansion was national academy of sciences nas report reviewing studies of correlation between toxic exposure of vietnam veterans and children born to them with spina bifida while the scientific studies were inconclusive nas did find some evidence suggestive of such correlation expanding presumptions and the persian gulf war syndrome after returning from service in the persian gulf war some veterans began complaining of illnesses that they thought might be attributable to their service there commonly reported symptoms included fatigue muscle and joint pain severe headaches and memory loss media reports began to characterize the array of symptoms as the gulf war syndrome although single illness with the multitude of symptoms has been diagnosed and common characteristics of the veterans circumstances have been identified other than persian gulf service on land or at sea although majority of ill veterans have been diagnosed with recognized disease significant number remain undiagnosed and appear to be suffering from multiple illnesses with overlapping symptoms and causes congress provided for all illness claims of persian gulf war veterans to be examined at va medical facilities illnesses diagnosed whenever possible symptoms treated if necessary and database created to facilitate further research into causes8 more than 100 federallyfunded research studies pertaining to gulf war illnesses are underway to date clinical studies have not found an unexplained increase in deaths hospitalizations or diagnosed diseases among the gulf war veteran population evidence has been found of new or unique disease connected to gulf war service evidence steadily emerges that gulf war veterans were in complex environment contaminated by multiple chemical substances some of which had been introduced to improve the safety and comfort of friendly forces perhaps as many as 25000 american soldiers may have been exposed to chemical weapons while they were not actually used in combat some believe the destruction of the weapons released toxins that may have caused illnesses with delayed symptoms so far medical experts report that conclusive evidence has been presented that 8 the dod medical registry and the va persian gulf health registry have had some clinical evaluation contact with about 100000 of the nearly 700000 gulf war veterans crs19 persian gulf war illnesses are related to chemical weapons but studies of the possible effects of multiple chemical exposure including the effects of lowlevel exposure to chemical weapons are underway the presidential advisory committee on gulf war veterans illnesses finding thatmany veterans clearly are experiencing medical difficulties connected to their service in the gulf war the advisory committee reviewed numerous studies of gulf war veterans and their health complaints the advisory committees report dated december 31 1996 concluded that scientific evidence had not produced causal link between symptoms and illnesses reported by gulf war veterans and exposure to pesticides chemical warfare agents biological warfare agents vaccines pyridostigmine bromide infectious diseases depleted uranium oil well fires and smoke and petroleum products nevertheless the advisory committee recommended further research in several areas including the medical risks especially longterm risks that might be related to multichemical exposure lowlevel exposure to chemical warfare agents and other toxic substances with recognized carcinogenic potential that were known to be present in the persian gulf war finally the report of the advisory committee emphasized the need to examine closely the relationship between wartime stress and the broad range of physiological and psychological illnesses currently being reported by gulf war veterans9 priority health care authority to provide high priority medical care for vietnam veterans with diseases presumed linked to herbicide exposure expires december 31 2002 authorization for priority health care for veterans with diseases presumed linked to radiation exposure has been made permanent pl 105368 extended high priority health care for persian gulf veterans through 2001 expanded coverage to include treatments for veterans dependents when their illnesses are related to the veterans gulf war service and required va to seek advice from the national academy of sciences on ways in which these veterans could be more effectively treated the law also established an independent mechanism recommended by the academy so that research into gulf war illness claims could be evaluated outside of the federal government federal research the dod va and hhs through the persian gulf veterans coordinating board have established comprehensive research program to provide information about the prevalence distribution and causes of illnesses among gulf war veterans according to gao report federal agencies spent total of 37 million on research on gulf war veterans illnesses through fy1996 and several additional projects are currently underway for additional information on federal research see crs report 9821 gulf war veterans illnesses federal research and legislative mandates potential for adverse effects of the persian gulf presumptions on future scientific studies in the absence of firm scientific evidence to the contrary congress has given veterans of the persian gulf war the benefitofthe 9 report of the presidential advisory committee on gulf war veterans illnesses p 125 crs20 doubt that their ailments may be connected to their military service however the basis for establishing scientifically link between an exposure to risk and the incidence of disease could be further eroded persian gulf war veterans were potentially exposed to large number of toxins and were authorized to receive priority treatment for virtually unlimited list of symptoms researchers caution that it may be impossible to identify the causes of illness in many gulf war veterans because of the absence of baseline data on the health of military personnel and the lack of reliable data on levels of exposure to potential risks in their wartime environment in effect because both exposure to toxic risk and the presence of disorder are presumed the statistical relationship between the risk level for one and the incidence of the other may be indeterminable overcoming presumed serviceconnection tobacco related illnesses in the 105th congress action was taken to prevent serviceconnection to toxic risk after several years of study in 1997 va had concluded that nicotine addiction is disease that could be linked to tobacco use that began during military service thus if nicotine addiction has its origins in military service then secondary diseases linked to tobacco use were arguably serviceconnected while there are actual data on the number of total possible claims the potential number of claims was in the millions moreover the echo of serviceconnected claims could have continued for decades through compensation automatically paid to the dependents and survivors of veterans who die from serviceconnected conditions at issue was the governments responsibility when its military personnel made unwise health choices which were at least facilitated if not openly encouraged by government actions some argued that american taxpayers should not be held liable for illnesses caused by veterans decisions to use harmful tobacco products however as former va official pointed out during recent hearing our veterans were in many cases provided that first cigarette by our government as part of their daily food ration or as part of comfort pack clearly the government was the agent that ultimately gave those cigarettes to our veterans while some veterans advocates vigorously opposed changing the law others focused on securing some of the savings for veterans benefits provision restricting va from paying compensation to veterans for adverse effects of tobacco use was included in pl 105178 the transportation equity act for the 21st century tea21 similar proposal in the presidents fy1999 budget estimated the fiveyear savings at 169 billion 154 billion of that estimated savings were used to offset spending for highway projects and the remainder was directed toward improvements in various veterans benefits for further information on this issue see crs report 98373 veterans and smokingrelated illnesses congress enacts limitations to compensation other issues costofliving adjustments cola pl 10794 provided costofliving adjustment cola to va disability compensation payments of 26 first payable in checks issued in january 2002 crs21 with the exception of the serviceconnected disability and survivors programs veterans cash programs are fully and automatically adjusted each year for changes in the cola in the same manner granted to most federal benefit programs including social security why these two important federal obligations are not also automatically linked to the official measurement of changes to the costofliving is largely tactical instead of amending va law to make cola automatic the strong commitment to these programs means that legislation to provide an annual adjustment is sure to receive procedural attention even during the frantic days at the end of legislative session when floor time to consider bills is at premium to facilitate the passage of other veterans legislation when congress becomes pinched for time the house and senate committees on veterans affairs report legislation each year that provides for an increase to these programs equal to the increases automatically applied to most other entitlement benefits attaching to the bill other veterans legislation approved by house and senate conferees for information on issues in veterans legislation enacted during previous congresses see crs report rl30099 veterans issues in the 106th congress and crs report 97266 veterans issues in the 105th congress the insurance dividend hoax reappears on the internet the internet has made possible the dissemination through chain letter postings of numerous reports which give every appearance of being factually correct but which are in fact totally false one such disseminated false report tells of supposed dividend that congress has recently enacted and for which veterans are eligible if they apply rumors of this bonus have surfaced periodically through various forms of informal media for nearly 50 years defying vigorous attempts by va and congress to eradicate it from the common sense origin of the dividend rumor in 1950 va paid 27 billion in special dividends to 16 million world war ii veterans who had national service life insurance policies with premiums paid to 1948 the 1948 special dividend from that point forward the possibility of dividends has led to periodic rumors that congress has again passed such benefit or is considering doing so for instance in 1965 for unknown reasons some newspapers published stories reporting of the special dividends that had been paid in the early 1950s as if the dividends were being paid at the time the stories were published while va attempted to squash the misinformation with factual stories each time the false reports surfaced the stories would take on local circulation life gradually drifting to more marginal print media such as newsletters flyers and local bulletins and sometimes accompanied by bogus application forms at some points va received as many as 20000 inquiries per week about this supposed dividend and in 1970 the volume of requesters prompted congress to enact legislation declaring steps to be taken whenever va was presented with such bogus applications the stories are false there has been recent legislation that would authorize special dividends dividends are not payable to current service members insured under the servicemans group life insurance sgli or veterans group life insurance vgli both of which are group policies without dividend concepts involved va does automatically pay dividends on some policies of other programs crs22 that have that intended feature but then only to veterans who have kept the policies in force in the event veteran is due one of these dividends it is paid automatically on the anniversary date of the policy and application for the payment is necessary legislation the 107th congress has enacted several bills affecting benefits for veterans pl 10714veterans survivor benefits improvements act of 2001 hr 801 this law created new life insurance and health care benefits for spouses and children of certain veterans pl 10795 homeless veterans comprehensive assistance act of 2001 hr 2176 this

and outreach provisions the bill included expansion of outreach to veterans during transition from active duty among the efforts are those that crs23 give va authority to provide transition assistance in permanent offices overseas extend preseparation counseling to as early as 12 months before discharge and 24 months before retirement improve outreach to veterans dependents and survivors to provide them with enhanced access to va services and benefits medical benefits repealed the 30year presumptive period for respiratory cancers linked to exposure to herbicides expanded the list of illnesses presumed to be serviceconnected to gulf war service to include medically unexplained chronic multisymptom illness such as chronic fatigue syndrome fibromyalgia and irritable bowel syndrome which has been defined by cluster of signs or symptoms memorial affairs insurance and other provisions the bill also adds to memorial benefits the bill increased burial and funeral allowances from 1500 to 2000 for veterans dying from serviceconnected conditions and increased the allowance from 300 to 500 for other veterans and increased the burial plot allowance from 150 to 300 increased the amounts available to adapt automobiles or other equipment for severely disabled veterans from 8000 to 9000 and increased housing adaptation grants for such veterans from 43000 to 48000 and for the less disabled from 8250 to 9250 revised the meanstest rules for vas wartimeservice pension so that agricultural real estate is excluded from asset determinations expanded outreach programs for dependents and expanded the period during which transition counseling is available to persons leaving active duty permits veterans to receive education benefits for independent study from qualified institutions of higher learning increased the home loan guaranty from 50750 to 60000 and assures that wartime service veterans aged 65 and above can be eligible for means tested pension assistance without determination of disability pl 10711 bill to expedite the completion of the world war ii memorial hr 1696 concern in congress about the pace of construction on the memorial to honor world war ii veterans led to the passage of legislation to expedite the memorials completion and to block further efforts that had surfaced to modify the design and placement of that memorial the new law specifies that the memorial as described in plans approved by the commission of fine arts on july 20 2000 and november 16 2000 and selected by the national capital planning commission on september 21 2000 and
