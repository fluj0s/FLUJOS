of certain offenses during war9 past military commissions trying enemy belligerents for war crimes directly applied the international law of war w ithout recourse to domestic criminal statutes unless

individuals captured during armed conflict and that its requirements are general ones crafted to accommodate wide variety of legal systems the military commissions unde r mco 1 did not meet these criteria in particular the military commissions were not regularly constituted because they deviated too far in the courts view from the rules that apply to courts martial without satisfactory explana

combatant under the mca citizens who fit the definition of unlawful enemy combatant are not amenable to tria l by military commission under the mca but may be subject to detention the mca does not

particip ation in an armed conflict the mca might run afoul of the courts historical aversion to trying civilians before military tribunal when othe r courts are available41 it is unclear whether this

otherwise meet the definition of unlawful enemy combatant it is generally accepted that aliens within the united states are entitled to the same protections in criminal trials that apply to us

set up by th pentagon to determine the status of detainees using procedures similar to thos the army uses to determine pow status during traditional wars43 the csrts however are not empowered to determine whether the enemy combatants are unlawful or lawful which recently led two military commission judges to hold that csrt determinations are inadequate to form the basis for the jurisdiction of military commissions44 one of the judges determined that the military commission itself is not co mpetent to make th determination while the other judge appears to have determined that the governments allegations did not set forth sufficient facts to conclude that the defendant salim hamdan was an unlawful enemy combatant45 the court of military commission review cmcr reversed the dismissal in the first case46 while it agreed that the csrt determinations are insufficient by themse lves to establish jurisdiction it found the military judge erred in declaring that the status determination had to be made by competent tribunal other than the military commission itself in denying the governments request to find that csrt determinations are sufficient to establish jurisdiction over the accused the cmcr interpreted the mca to require more than establishing membership in qaeda or the taliban the cmcr found support for the governments claim that congress through the mca created comprehensive system which sought to embrace and adopt all prior csrt determinations that resulted in enemy combatant status assignments and summarily turn those designations into findings that persons so labeled could also properly be considered unlawful emy combatants similarly we find support for the governments position regarding the parenthetical language contained in

definition of murder in violation of the law of war to include not just killing but also deaths resulting from an act or omission of the accused where the accused intended to kill the victim or victims temporal and spatial jurisdiction the law of war has traditionally applied within the territori and temporal boundaries of an armed conflict between at least two belligerents60 it traditionally has not b een applied to conduct occurring on the territory of neutral states or on rritory not under the control of belligerent to conduct that preceded the outbreak of hostilities or to conduct during hostilities that do not amount to an armed conflict unlike the conflict in afghanistan the global war on terrorism does not ve clear boundaries in time or space61 nor is it entirely

combatant before on or after september 11 200163 however certain definitions used in describing the offenses triable by military commissions would seem to limit many of them to conduct occurring in an armed conflict common element among the crimes enumer ated in mci no2 was that the conduct took place in the context of and was associated with armed conflict the instruction explained that the phrase re quired nexus between the conduct and armed hostilities64 which has traditionally been necessary element of any war crime however the definition of armed hostilities was broader than the customary definition of war or armed conflict according to the mci armed hostilities need not be declared war or ongoing mutual hostilities65 instead any hostile act or attempted hostile act might have had sufficient nexus if its severity rose to the level of an armed attack or if it were intended to contribute to such acts some commentators have argued that th expansion of arme d conflict beyond its customary bounds improperly expanded th jurisdiction of military commissions beyond those that by statute or under the law of war are triable by military commissions66 the elements of crimes set forth in the mmc also include nexus to an armed conflict but ne ither the manual nor the mca contains definition the supreme court has not clarif ied the scope of the globa l war on terrorism but has not simply deferred to the presidents interpretation in enacting the mca congress seems to have provided the necessary statutory definitions of criminal offenses to overcome previous objections with respect to subject matter jurisdiction of military commissions however questions may still arise with respect to the necessity for c onduct to occur in the context of an armed conflict in order to be triable by military commissi on there is express requirement to that effect in the mca the overall purpose of the statute together with the elements of some of the crimes arguably may be read to require nexus the definition for enemy provided in mci 2 raised similar issues according to 5b enemy includes any entity with which the united states or allied forces may be engaged in armed conflicts

pursuant to mco 1 5a573 the mca 10 usc 950w authorizes the military commissions to punish for contempt any pe rson who uses any menacing word sign or gesture in its presence or who disturbs its

mmc provides for jurisdiction over all persons including civilians and permits military judges to sentence those convi cted with both fines and terms of confinement74 the ucmj authorizes other military commissions to punish contempt with fine of 100 confinement for up to 30 days or both75 the mmc does not set limit on punishment for contempt the mca provides that military commissions have the same power as general courtmartial to compel witnesses to app ear in manner similar to that which courts of the united states having criminal jurisdiction may lawfully issue76 however rather than providing that the trial c ounsel and the defense are to have equal opportunity to compel witnesses and obtai n evidence the mca provides the defense reasonable opportunity to obtain witnesse s and

military commission the bills would require procedural and evidentiary rules for military commissions to conform to the ucmj ex cept where expressly provided otherwise and would limit the secretary of defenses authority to make exceptions to commission procedures and rules of eviden ce to those made necessary by unique circumstances of military or intelligence operations during hostilities the bills would repeal the authority for civilian attorneys to act as trial prosecution counsel in commission proceeding but would permit civilian attorneys to act as defense counsel with the assistance of deta iled defense counsel an accused who elects to represent himself would be authorized to obtain the assistance of civilian counsel in ddition to detailed defense counsel the bills would modify the evidentiary requirements of the mca in several respects the provision for permitting ev idence acquired without warrant would not apply to evidence acquired within the united states the

judge would have th authority to order trial counsel to disclose to defense counsel the sources methods or activities by which witnesses or evidence against the accused was obtained if he determines

fair trial the judge could dismiss some or all of the charges or specifications or take such other action as he deemed necessary in the interest of justice habeas corpus would be available to tainees to challenge their detention but other causes of action would be eliminated the bills would route appeals of military commissions to the court of appeals for the armed forces rather than the court of
