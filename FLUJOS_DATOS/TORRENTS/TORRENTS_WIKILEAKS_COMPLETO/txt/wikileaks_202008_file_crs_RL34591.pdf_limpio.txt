lowincome families all allow families to pay affordable incomebased rents however different forms of assistance target different types of households including the elderly persons with disabilities and families with children several trends in federal housing policy have emerged in r ecent decades as the focus of federal housing assistance has shifted away from constructionbased s ubsidies to rental assistance block grants and lihtc stat and local governments have had greater access to federal resources to fund cal housing and community development priorities this shift in federal funding has also led affordable housing developers to pursue mixed financing the use of multip streams of federal funding state and local funding or private financing lagging homeownership rates among low income

construction and providing homeownership and rental assistance for werincome households since the 1930 s today congress funds number of programs to help meet the housing needs of poor and vulnerable popul ations the programs are primarily administered by the department of h ousing and urban deve lopment hud with some assistance provided to rural communities through the department of agriculture the modern housing assistance programs include both relatively flexible grants to state and local governments to serve homeless people build affordable housing provide assistance to first time homebuyers and promote community development and more struct ured direct assistance prog rams that provide lowcost apartments and rental vouchers to poor fa milies administered through local public quasipublic and private inte rmediaries the federal g overnment also makes tax credits available to states to distribute to developers of lowco st housing and provides insurance to lenders that make mortgages to eligible homebuyers the federal governments largest housing program howev er is arguably the mortgage interest deduction which is not targeted to loweri ncome households but is available to all homeowners who pay mortgage inte rest and itemize their deductions this report begins with an overview of the history and volution of federal housing assistance policy followed by desc ription of todays major federal housing assistance programs and concl udes with discussion of issu and trends in federal housing assistance policy this report which will be updated periodically does not track current legislation interest ed readers should see crs report rl33879 housing issues in the 110th congress for information on current legislation history and evolution of federal housing assistance policy the beginning of federal housing assistance fha and public housing the federal governments first major hou sing policy was formulated in response to trouble in the mortgage market resulting from the great depression until the early 1930s most mortgages were written for terms of three to five years and required borrowers to make payments only on an annual basis at the end of the three or fiveyear terms the remaining loan balance had to be repaid or the mortgagehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34591crs2 1 for more information on the history of public housing see fisher robert moore 20 years of public housing harper nd brothers 1959 and wood elizabeth the beautiful beginnings the failure to learn fifty years of public housing in america the national center for housing management october 1982had to be renegotiated another feature of the mortgage market was that lenders would only lend 40 to 50 of the value of the property so borrowers had to have the cash to complete the transaction or find someone willing to finance the balance or part of the balance in second mort gage during the great depression however lenders were unable or unwillin g to refinance many of the loans that became due when borrowers could not pay the loan bala nces lenders foreclosed on the loans and took possession of the properties it was against this background that the housing act of 1934 pl 73479 was enacted the broad objectives of the act were to 1 encourage lenders to invest in housing construction and 2 to stimulate employment in the building industry the act created the federal housing administration fha fha insured lenders against losses on home modernization and home imp rovement loans created the mutual mortgage insurance fund to fund the ope ration of the newlycreated mortgage insurance programs and blished national mortgage ssociations to buy and sell mortgages the creation of fha also institutionalized revolutionary idea 20year mortgages on which loan would be completely repaid at the end of its term if borrowers defaulted fha insured that the nder would be fully repaid eventually lenders began to make longterm mortga ges without fha insurance as long as borrowers made significant downpayments over time 25 and 30year mortgages have become standard mortgage products as in the case of the mortgage finance market the federal government initially became i nvolved in the provision of rental housing assistance in response to the great depression in the early 1930s housing division was added to president franklin d roosevelts works progress administration wpa as part of the effort to create jobs and spur economic growth1 the housing division acquired land and built mul tifamily housing projects for occupancy by lowerincome families across the country however the housing division s activities proved cont roversial with local government officials who thought that th ey were not consulted in the process against this backdrop the us housin g act of 1937 pl 75412 was enacted it replaced the wpas housing division and its projects by establishing new federal united states housing agency pr ecursor agency to todays department of housing and urban development and new lowrent public housing program the new program required part nerships between the federa l government states and localities states that wished to receive assistance in building lowrent public housing were required to pass enabling legi slation creating new quasigovernmental local public housing authorities phas thes phas could then apply to the federal government for funding to aid in the construction and maintenance of lowrent housing developments targeted to lowincome families the act declared that it was the policy of the united stateshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34591crs3

assist the several states and their political subdivisions to alleviate present and recurring unemployment and to remedy the unsafe and unsanitary housing conditions and the acute shortage of decent safe and sanitary dwellings for families of lowincome in rural or urban communities that are injurious to the health safety and morals of the citizens of the nation housing was major issue in the presidential and congressional races during 1948 president harry s trumans pledge to address the postwar housing shortage and the problem of urban slums played key role in his margin of victory2 in his state of the union address in 1949 unveilin g the fair deal president truman observed that five million families are still living in slums and firetraps three million families share their homes with others3 he further stated the housing shortage continues to be acut as an immediate step the congress should enact the provisions for lowre nt public housing slum clearance farm housing and housing research which i have repeatedly recommended the number of lowrent public housing units provided for in the legislation should be increased to 1 million units in the next 7 years even this number of units will not begin to meet our need for new housing the housing act of 1949 pl 81171 declared the goal of decent home and suitable living environment for every american family the act 1 established federal urban redevelopment and slum clear ance program authorizing federal loans of 1 billion over fiveyear period to help local redevelopment agencies acquire slum pr operties and assemble sites for redevelopment 2 reactivated the public housing program for lowincome families which had been on hold during world war ii authorizing subsidies to local housing authorities sufficient to build 810000 units over six years 3 expanded the fhas mortgage insurance program to promote home building and homeownership 4 created within the us department of agriculture prog ram of financial assi stance and subsidies to improve housing conditions on farms and in rural areas and 5 authorized federal grants for research primarily to impr ove the productivity of the housing industry government subsidization of private development through the 1950s the federal government s role in housing assistance focused largely on public housing which served mostly poor population congress recognized that gap existed in the market few options existed for moderate income families whose incomes were too high to qualify for public housing but too low to afford adequate market rate housing4 proposals in congress had been madehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34591crs4 4 continued housing act of 1961 87th cong 1st sess srept 281 may 19 1961 the largest unfilled demand in the housing market is that of moderateincome families 5 srept 281 perhaps the most significant reason that previous proposals to establish moderateincome housing program have not been favorably received by the congress is that the majority of those proposals would have placed sole responsibility for such program on the federal governmentto address the shortage of housing for m oderate income households during the 1950s however legislation had been enacted in part due to the cost to the government of creating and funding new program5 in order to avoid creating another large housing program with high expenditures while at the same time finding way to serve this segment of the population congre ss approved legislation at the end of the 1950s and throughout the 1960s that engaged the private sector in the development of affordable housing the housing act of 1959 pl 86372 was the first significant instance where government incentives were used to persua private developers to build housing that would be affordable to low and moderateincome househol ds as part of pl 86 372 congress created the section 202 housin g for the elderly program through the section 202 program the federal gove rnment extended lowinterest loans to private nonprofit organizations for the development of affordable housing for moderateincome residents ag 62 and older the low interest rates were meant to ensure that units would be affordable with nonprofit develope rs able to charge lower rents and still have adequate revenue to pay back the government loans the housing act of 1961 pl 8770 furt her expanded the role of the private sector in providing housing to low and moderateincome households the act created the section 221d3 below market interest ra bmir housing program which both insured mortgages to privat developers of multifamily housing and provided loans at low interest rates the bmir program expanded the pool of eligible borrowers to private forprofit developers and government entities as well as nonprofit developers eligible developers included cooperatives limited dividend corporations and state or local government agencies like the section 202 program the low interest rates in the bmir program were meant to ensure that building owners could offer afford able rents to tenants in 1965 the housing and urban devel opment act pl 89117 added rental assistance to the list of incentives for private multifamily housing developers that participated in the section 221d3 bmir program pl 89117 created the rent supplement program which capped the rent s charged to tenants at 20 of their incomes and paid building owners the diffe rence between 20 of tenants income and fair market rent the housing and urban development ac t of 1965 also created the section 23 leased housing program the first program to provide rent subsidies for use in existing private rental market units the same phas that administered the public housing program were authorized to enter into contracts with landlords in the private market these contracts authorized payments to landlords who rented units to lowincomehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34591crs5 6 us department of hous ing and urban development

the section 236 program the government subsidized private developers mortgage inte rest payments so that they would not pay more than 1 toward interest like the low interest rate loans provided

individual homeowners rather than multif amily housing developers under the public housing program tenant s generally paid rent in an amount equal to the costs of operating the assisted housing in which they lived over time as operating costs rose there was concern that the belowmarket rents being charged to families were too high to be affordable to the poorest families the brooke amendment which was included as part of the housing and urban development act of 1969 pl 91152 limited tenant contri butions toward rent in all rent assisted units including public hous ing and all projectbas ed rental assistance units to an amount equal to 25 of tenant income this was later raised to 30 the brooke amendment is considered res ponsible for codifying an incomebased rent structure in federal housing programs by the end of the 1960s subsidies to pr ivate developers had resulted in the creation of hundreds of thousands of hous ing units approximately 700000 units of housing had been built through the sec tion 236 and s ection 221d3 programs alone6 the section 202 program had created more than 45000 units for elderly households7 the section 235 and section 23 leasedhousing programs

the early 1970s10 rethinking the strategy from construction subsidies to rent subsidies by the early 1970s concern was growing about the cost efficacy and equity of the constructionbased housin g subsidy programs such as the section 236 and public housing programs thenpresident rich ard m nixon criticized the existing programs as not equitably serving families in the same circumstances providing poor quality housing being too costly and placi ng some families in homes they could not afford11 out of these concerns president nixon declared moratorium on all new activity under the major housing subsidy programs except for the section 23 leasedhousing program beginning in january 1973 assisted housing activity slowly restarted in response to lawsuits and new legislation the housing act of 1974 pl 93383 was the first omnibus housing legislation since 1968 and the first such gislation following the nixon moratorium the act created new lowincome rental assistance program referred to as section 8 although the 1960s had seen rental assi stance programs like rent supplement and section 23 the scale of the section 8 program made it th first comprehensive rental assistance program the section 8 progra m combined features of the section 236 program which was popular with advocates of constructionbased subsidies and the section 23 leased housing program which used the existing housing stock and was popular with the nixon administration th rough section 8 the federal government provided private property owners mont hly assistance payments for new or substantially rehabilitated rental units in exchange for monthly rental payments property owners would agree to rent to eligible lowincome families defined as families with incomes at or below 80 of local area median income who would pay an incomebased rent it also provided phas with the authority to enter into rental assistance contracts for existing private market units over time the use of section 8 in new construction and substantial rehabilitation projects was f ound to be more expensive than its use in existing housing the housing and urbanru ral recovery act of 1983 pl 98181 repealed huds authority to enter into new section 8 contracts tied to new construction and substantial rehabilitation but retained hud s authority to issue new contracts for existing properties the act also created new demonstration program to test modified use of section 8 referred to as vouche rs vouchers were similar to the use of section 8 rent subsidie s in existing housing but provided more flexibility to

mid1980s federal housing prog rams had gone through number of iterations some programs had been scra pped as inefficient subject to fraud and abuse or too expensive shifting federal priorities toward reducing taxes and increasing military spending in response to the cold war reduced funding available for social programs including housing assistance creation of assisted housing with federal funds was on the d ecline with production between 1982 and 1988 slowing significantly12 in addition existing afford able rental units were being lost as use restrictions be tween private owners and hud expired or owners chose to prepay their lowinterest mortgages and begin charging marketrate rent13 as result of reduced federal support fo r housing state and local governments and private for or nonprofit organizations began to take the initiative in developing innovative ways of providing housing in their communities14 policymakers acknowledged that in some cases cal communities had better knowledge about how to provide housing than the federal g overnment and might be able to provide housing more efficiently than hud15 from the late 1980s through the 1990s congress acknowledged the value of local control and gave more decisionmaking authority over housing policy to state and local governments through the creation of block grants and tax credits in 1986 the low income housing tax credit lihtc program was created as part of the tax reform act of 1986 pl 99514 the lihtc was not initially part of the bill that became the tax reform act hr 3838 however because portions of hr 3838 eliminated the fa vorable treatment of real estate i nvestment income members added the lihtc program to the bill in order to ensure that developers would have an incentive to continue to construct low nd moderateincome housing16 the lihtc program intentionally or not was one of the first major programs to give good deal of control over housing policy to states and localities tax credits are allocated to states ba sed on population states then have discretion in setting priorities as to how the credits will be use d while states must prioritize projects that serve the lowest income

earlier block grant the community development block grant cdbg which was created as part of the housing act of 1974 to consolidate several special purpose grants funding many activities other than housing such as neighborhood revitalization open space nd water and sewer grants naha directed that home funds be allocated to states and loca lities based on formula and that funds be targeted to assist families with incomes at or below 60 of area median income recipient jurisdictions were permitted to use funds to ssist homeowners construct rental housing or provide rent assistance and they were required to establish plans for spending their funds meet match re quirements and partner with local non profits the native american housing assistan ce and selfdetermination act of 1996 nahasda pl 104330 reorganized the sy stem of federal housing assistance to native americans by eliminating several separate programs of assistance and replacing them with single block grant program in addition to simplifying the process of providing housing assistan ce the purpose of nahasda was to provide federal assistance for indian tribes in manner that recognizes the right of indian selfdetermination and tribal selfgovernance reforming rental assistance throughout the 1990s concern about the state of public housing grew the public perceived public housing as misma naged of poor quality and dangerous17 at the same time interest was growing in reforming social programs by devolving control to the states and increasing their focus on promoting work and self sufficiency concern over th state of public housing and the influence of the 1996 welfare reform debate nd legislation led to pr oposals for major public and assisted housing reforms several years of debate in congress culminated with the enactment of the quality housing and wo rk opportunity rec onciliation act of 1998 pl 105276 the purposes of qhwra as defined in the act were to deregulate phas provide more

lowincome families is comprised of programs that fall into three main categories re ntal housing assistance federal assistance to state and local g overnments and homeownership assistance rental assistance is provide d primarily through rent vouc hers that families can use in the private market belowmarket rental units owned by phas or private landlords under contract with the fede ral government and to limited extent construction of new belowmarket rental units assistance to state and local governments comes in number of forms including broad flexible block grants that can be used for rental homeownership or community developmen t purposes special purpose block grants and programs based in the tax system homeownership assistance includes direct assistance to defray homebuying costs as well as mortgage insurance programs to help provide incentives for the private ma rket to meet the needs of underserved segments of the population the following section provides descri ption of the major housing assistance programs that fall into these three categories rental housing assistance section 8 vouchers section 8 vouchers are fo rm of tenantbased rental assistance funded by the

1437fo generally eligible fa milies with vouchers live in the housing of their choice in the private market and the voucher pays the di fference between the familys contribution toward rent and the actual rent for the unit specifically family pays 30 of its adjusted income toward rent although th ey can choose to pay more and the pha which receives funding from hud makes payments to the landlord based on maximum subsidy set by the pha based on the local fair market rent established by hud less the tenants cont ribution families are eligib to receive voucher if they are very lowincome earning 50 or less of the local area median income or lowincome earning 80 or less of the local area median income but meet other special criteria for example are elderly or have disabilities however phas must provide 75 of all vouchers available in year to extremely lowincome fam ilies earning 30 or less of the area median in come vouchers ar nationally portable once family receives voucher it can

purchases and tax preferences favoring homeowners one of the tax incentives that promotes homeownership is the mortgage interest duction the mortgage interest deduction allows homeowners to deduct any interest paid on their mortgage from their taxable income thus reducing their tax liability the deduction benef its those households that own homes that have mortgage on wh ich they pay interest that have federal income tax liability and for whom ite mized deductions exceed the standardhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34591crs25 27 as described in crs report rl33025 fundamental tax reform options for the

programs incidence of housing problems when the federal housing assistance pr ograms began in the 1930s the nation was considered to be illhoused th housing act of 1937 identified an acute shortage of decent safe and sanitary dwellings thanks in part to stricter building codes and standards most housing in the united states today is decent safe and sanitary although some units are still c onsidered substandard today the greatest perceived housing problem is affordabililty housing is considered affordable if it costs more than 30 of households income households that pay half or more of their income toward their hous ing costs are considered severely cost burdened households that pa between 30 and 50 of their income toward their housing costs are considered moderately cost burdened according to data from the census bureaus american community survey 20 million households were moderately cost burdened and 17 million households were severely cost burdened in 200529 hud is directed to report to congress periodically on the incidence of worst case housing needs worst case housing n eeds are defined as unassisted renters with very low incomes at or below 50 of area median income

housing needs 91 were severely cost burdened but lived in standard housing only about 4 of households had worst cas housing needs solely because they lived in substandard housing in other word s their worst case housing needs were function of the cost of their housing to much greater extent than the condition of their housing characteristics of fam ilies receiving assistance public housing section 8 vouchers and the projectbased rental assistance programs including projectbased sec tion 8 section 202 and section 811 combined serve roughly 4 million households and can be considered the primary housing assistance programs for lowincome families these three forms of assistance are similar in many ways they all target assistance to extremely lowincome families require families to pay 30 of their incomes toward rent and generally have long waiting lists for assistance however the three vary significantly in terms of their evolution the structure of their benefit portable voucher versus housing unit and their administration pha versus private owner the similarities and differences in the programs themselves result in similarities and differences in the characteristic s of the

in fy2004 national median income for family of four was 5750031 across all three programs roughly 5 of households repor ted having zero income given the differences in characteristics of households

instituting such requi rements looking at nonelderly non disabled households across the three progra ms half or more of all households have at least some income from work concern has been raised that perhaps th incomebased rent structure in the assisted housing programs acts as disin centive for households to increase their earnings for every new dollar family earns thirtycents must go toward

enure was greatest in the public housing program at just over five years and shor test in the voucher program at just under three and half years33 the federal governments role in housing beginning in the 1980s the federal gove rnment took on lesser role in the creation of assisted housing this occu rred in several ways congress ceased funding new construction under the section 8 pr ojectbased program which from its enactment in 1974 had subsidized hundreds of thousands of units of assisted housing this left very few active programs in which hud pported the development of physical housing units between 1976 and 1982 the federal housing programs produced more than one million units of subsidized housing34 i n the following years however annual pr oduction was around 25000 new subsidized units35 around the time that housing producti on was declining congress created two programs that gave good deal of control over decisions regarding housing policy and development to state and loca l governments these included the low income housing tax credit lihtc program and the home investment partnerships program these programs pa rticularly the lihtc have been used by states and localities to create hundreds of t housands of units of affordable housing the federal governments decision to ta ke lesser role in the development of housing has had several consequences first state nd local governments have taken on an increased role in providing afford able housing and estab lishing priorities in their communities36 second due to reduction in the number of new affordable housing units that are created each year th need to preserve existing affordable housing units has taken on new importance third consequence is the need forhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34591crs30 37 see for example

available at httpwwwrecapadvisorscompdfwu2061pdfmultiple streams of funding other than fe deral grants in order both to support the creation of new affordable housing units and to preserve existing units those three consequences are discu ssed more fully below first with the advent of both th lihtc program and the home program states and localities were able to exercise discretion in determining how to prioritize and develop housing using larger pool of federal funds until that point even though states through their housing fi nance agencies help ed finance mortgage loans and affordable rental housing th eir role was limited by the amount of funds available in the low income housing tax credit pr ogram states develop plans in which they may set aside certain percentage of tax credits for populations such as homeless individuals or persons with disabilities they may also decide to use tax credits to preserve existing housing as well as to build new housing funds that states receive from the home program may be used for the construction of new rental housing and rental assistance for lowincome households potential drawback of these programs is their inability on their own to reach the neediest households37 for example in lihtc developm ent at least 20 of units must be affordable to households at or below 50 of area median income or 40 of units must be affordable to households at or below 60 of area median income many of the older hud programs constructed housing that was affordable to households at or below 30 of area median income those considered extremely lowincome often these households cannot afford its in lihtc properties without rental subsidies such as section 8 vouchers38 another way some states and local g overnments support affordable housing is outside of the assistance of the federal g overnment through establishment of their own housing trust funds these trust funds use dedicated funding sources such as document recording fees or real estate tr ansfer taxes to create pool of funds for affordable housing by using dedicated source of financing trust funds may not be as subject to the vicissitude s of state budgets as are ot her means of funding housing development states and local communitie s also support affordable housing through inclusionary zoning through this thod housing developers are expected to dedicate percentage of units they build as affordable housing in exchange states or local communities give developers incentives that allow them to expand or speed up the pace of development some of the incentives include density bonuses or zoning variances that allow developers to build larger facilities than they would be able to under existing zoning regulations as well as expedited approval of building permitshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34591crs31 39 for example according to huds database of section 236 properties with active loans at least 1200 loans representing 137000 units will have mortgages that mature over five year period between 2008 and 2013a second consequence of the decreased ro of the federal government in the creation of affordable housing units is th increased pressure to maintain the affordability of existing units many hud subsidized units that were developed in the 1960s and 1970s through programs such as section 236 and section 221d3 as well as those units that received secti on 8 projectbased rental assistance are longer available to lowincome househol ds at the time the properties were developed building owners tered into contracts with hud in which they agreed to maintain affordability for certain number of years the duration of these contracts varied depending on the federa l program these contracts or use restrictions may last between 15 years the low income housing tax credit program and 50 years early section 202 velopments in recent years these contracts have begun to expire or in some cases property owners have chosen to pay off their mortgages early and end the use restrictions contracts for rental assistance including projectbased secti on 8 rental assistance have also begun to expire when any of these events occur owners may char ge marketrate rents for the units and the affordable units are lost the term used to refer to efforts to maintain the affordability of these housing units is affordable housin g preservation in coming years more and more property owners will be in position to opt out of affordability restrictions and thousands of units could be lost39 congress has attempted to enact laws th at would preserve affordable housing units however due to the temporary nature of some of the measures preservation remains concern congress first enacted legislation to help preserve affordable rental housing in 1987 the emergency lowincome housing preservation act elihpa enacted as part of the hous ing and community development act of 1987 pl 100242 was temporary measure that prevented owners of section 236 and section 221d3 properties from prepaying their mortgages in 1990 the low income housing preserva tion and resident homeow nership act lihprha enacted as part of the cranstongonzalez national affordable housing act pl 101625 offered incentives to owners to k eep them from prepaying their mortgages however six years after lihprha was enacted congress reinstated the right of owners to prepay their mortgages see pl 104134 another effort to preserve affordable housing was enacted as part of the multifamily assisted housing reform and accountability act mahra pl 10565 through this effort called markto market hud restructures the debt of building owners while at the same time renegotiating their rental assistance contracts unlike elihpa and lihprha the marktomarket program is still in effect third consequence of decreased fe deral funding for the construction of affordable housing is the need for lowin come housing developers to bring together multiple funding streams in order to build development when the federal government first began to subsidize the production of affordable housing in many cases the funds appropriated for housing pr ograms were sufficient to construct or

have become smaller portion of the total amount needed to support the development of affordable housing as result it has become necessary for developers to turn to multiple sources of financing including low income housing tax credits tax exempt bonds and state or local housing trust funds in addition it is often necessary for building owners to seek rent subsidies through programs like section 8 home and shelter pl us care to make renting to very low or extremely lowincome households feasible the interactions among these various financing streams can be complex and putting together

decades presented 363 increase in nominal dollars 105 increase in real dollars the growth in outlays was greatest from the late1980s to mid 1990s from 1988 to 1995 outlays grew by over 98 in nominal terms over 62 in real terms but has slowed in recent years from 2000 to 2007 outlays grew by 29 in minal terms 8 in real terms another trend that can be seen in table 12 is the increase in outlays for the rental assistance programs in recent year s while outlays in the public housing and other housing assistance programs are declinin g this is consistent with the shift from projectbased assistan ce to tenantbased assist ance or vouchers discussed earlier in this reporthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34591crs36 table 12 outlays selected housing programs fy1980fy2007 nominal dollars in millions unless

turnover properties are rarely at 100 occupancy and vouchers are rarely 100 utilized as result fewer households receive assistance in year than there are units eligible for payment in year as shown in table 13 the total number of units ligible for payment under the selected housing programs has grown by over 50 over the nearly three decades presented however most of that grow th happened in the 1980s since the early 1990s the number of units eligible for pa yment has gone up and down from year to year with an overall decline in units from fy2001 to fy2007 table 13 also helps to illustrate

assistance programs has been on the decline since the nixon mora torium in the 1970s for many of those units once the family leaves the program they receive voucher in the case of public housing the
