senate begins to consider it committee amendments are considered first then senators can offer amendments to any part of the bill in any order senators may debate each amendment without limit unless the senate 1 agrees to motion to table kill the amendment 2 agrees to unanimous consent request to limit debate on the amendment or 3 invokes cloture lim iting debate on the amendment or on the bill and all amendments to it there are several different types of amendments first degree amendment proposes to change the text of the bill second degree amendment proposes to change the text of first degree amendment that the senate is considering third degree amendments are not allowed an amendment may propose to strike out language from bill or first degree amendment to insert new language or to replace language by striking out and inserting in general an amendment that proposes to replace the entire text of bill is known as an amendment in the nature of substitute an amendment to replace the entire text of first degree amendment is known as substitute amendment an amendment especially in the second degree that makes some lesser change is known as perfecting amendment depending on the kinds of amendments that senators offer and the order in which they are recognized to offer their amendments senators can offer anywhere from three to 11 amendments before the senate has to vote on any of them amendment trees are the graphic ways of depicting these possible situations the senate only requires that amendments be germane when amendments are offered 1 to general appropriations bills and budget measures 2 under cloture or 3 under certain unanimous consent agreements and certain statutes otherwise senators can offer amendments on any subject to any bill there are several general restrictions on the amending process for example it is not in order to propose an amendment that proposes only to amend language in bill that already has been amended however it is possible to reamend that language in the process of amending larger portion of the bill there also are special provisions in senate rules to limit amendments to appropriations bills if those amendments propose unauthorized appropriations or changes in existing law the senate can and sometimes does choose not to enforce these restrictions the senator who has offered an amendment may withdraw or modify it at any time until the senate has taken some action on it such as by amending it or by ordering rollcall vote on it senators also may demand that certain amendments be divided into two or more parts rollcall vote on an amendment is ordered at the request of at least eleven senators the senates amending process changes under cloture for example amendment can be offered under cloture unless senator submitted it in writing before the cloture vote occurred this report will be updated as events warrant

summarizes many of the rules precedents and practices of the senate affecting the consideration of amendments to measures on the floor much of the information presented here has been extracted from riddick s senate procedure senate document 10128 the published collection of senate precedents this report should be read with several caveats in mind first report of this length can take account of every ruling that has been made and every contingency that can arise second the senate conducts much of its business by unanimous consent and may thereby change or set aside its rules or customary procedures although this report may provide useful background information it should not be considered substitute for consultation with the parliamentarian and his associates on specific procedural problems and opportunities this report should not be cited as authority in senate proceedings

or by unanimous consent the title of the measure is read if there are committee amendments printed in the measure as reported the first of these amendments then is pending automatically debate usually begins with opening statements about the measure as whole by its majority and minority floor managers and other senators this is customary practice of the senate its rules do not set aside time for these opening statements the senate then acts on the committee amendments after which senators may offer their own amendments to any part of the measure in any order in the house measures often are read for amendment by sections or titles in that case representatives may offer amendments only to the one section or title that is then open to amendment in the senate by contrast measures are considered to be open to amendment at any point the first amendments that the senate considers are amendments recommended by the committee or committees that reported the measure senators do not have to call up these amendments for consideration they are considered automatically one by one and in the order in which they are printed in the measure as reported except by unanimous consent individual senators may offer second degree amendments to each committee amendment or first degree amendments to that part of the measure that committee amendment proposes to strike out or replacesee the amendment trees and the senate considers and disposes of any such amendments before acting on the committee amendment itself under regular senate procedure then the senate may consider each committee amendment before senators offer other unrelated amendments from the floor but the senate may not dispose of all committee amendments at the beginning of the amending process in fact when committee reports measure with an amendment in the nature of substitute for the entire text of the bill the vote on that committee amendment may conclude the amending process and immediately precede the vote on passing the bill see the amendment trees in another common alternative the senate may consider an amendment in the nature of substitute for 1 this report was written by stanley bach formerly senior

text considered to be original text for the purposes of further amendment in this way the senate can preserve the ability to amend the substitute in two degrees this can also be the situation when senate committee reports bill with series of separate amendments and the senate often decides not to consider the amendments individually the senate can agree by unanimous consent to consider and agree to all the committee amendments bloc that is as if they were one amendment and then to consider the measure as thus amended as original text for the purpose of further amendment under such an agreement senators may offer am endments in two degrees to the text of each committee amendment that now has been made part of the measure the effect of this arrangement is to create the same opportunities for senators to propose amendments to each of the committees recommendations that senators enjoy when committee reports single text that includes all of its recommendationseither in the form of either complete substitute for measure referred to it or in the form of new original measure that is introduced at the same time the committee reports it to the senate from time to time one or more committee amendments may be excluded from such unanimous consent agreement leaving that amendment or those amendments to be considered separately the appropriations committee is the only senate committee that may occasionally report measures to the senate with series of separate committee amendments most other senate committees usually consolidate all their amendments to major bill into single complete substitute amendment for the text of the bill as introduced or they incorporate their amendments into the text of an original bill that the committee chairman introduces on behalf of the committee this later option is also sometimes used by the appropriations committee paragraph 5 of rule xv prohibits the consideration of substantive committee amendment which contains any significant matter not within the jurisdiction of the committee proposing such amendment however this prohibition does not apply if committee chooses to incorporate that committee amendment into the text of an original bill it orders reported after disposing of committee amendments the senate considers additional first degree amendments and amendments thereto in whatever order senators wish to offer them in the case of committee amendment in the nature of substitute for the entire text of the bill both that amendment and the text of the underlying measure are open to amendment at any point to offer an amendment senator must have the floor and paragraph 1 of rule xix directs the presiding officer to recognize the senator who shall first address him as matter of established practice however preference in recognition is accorded to the majority and minority leaders when either leader and another senator are seeking recognition at the same time the chair also may give preference in recognition to either floor manager of the measure the senate is considering technically senator loses the floor after offering an amendment or making any motion unless recognized again in practice the senator offering an amendment normally is recognized to begin the debate on it with the exception of committee amendments the order in which first degree amendments are offered is determined not by rule or precedent but by the convenience of senators second degree amendment of course may only be offered while the first degree amendment it would affect is pending the form of first and second degree amendments determines what additional httpwikileaksorgwikicrs98853g22g145g142g561g3g150g142g151g141g146g151g144g561g18g155g152g140g142g156g156g561g146g151g561g157g145g142g561g21

simultaneously see classification of amendments and the amendment trees normally amendments are offered and considered individually but senators may request unanimous consent that two or more related amendments be considered bloc this is useful practice when for example senator needs to amend bill in two non contiguous places in order to accomplish single policy change an amendment must be in writing and when offered is to be read before debate begins the reading of an amendment usually is dispensed with by unanimous consent when the floor managers and other interested senators already are familiar with the amendments purpose and provisions in 2007 the senates rule xv was amended to require that written copy of each amendment be provided to all senators on their desks and to the majority and minority leaders before debate on the amendment commences2 for the information and convenience of the senate senators often submit proposed amendments to be printed in the congressional record day or more before they are to be called up for consideration they are listed in section called amendments submitted if an amendment is submitted for printing in the record it is assigned number at that time otherwise the amendment is numbered at the time it is offered and read on the floor in this way all floor amendments are numbered sequentially throughout the course of congress the text of each amendment usually appears in the congressional record at the point at which it is called up even if it had been printed in an earlier issue of the record except under cloture an amendment printed in advance in the record enjoys special standing see amendments under cloture it must be ca lled up by senator in the same manner as any other amendment however printed amendment may be called up by any senator not just by the senator who submitted it for printing this does not occur often in senate practice pending amendment may sometimes be laid aside temporarily by unanimous consent in order to permit consideration of another amendment instead once the second amendment is disposed of the first amendment is back before the senate automatically the senate sometimes does not dispose immediately of the second amendment in this scenario instead amendments may virtually be stacked having been offered but not disposed of until the senate decides to act on one of the setaside amendments when an amendment is laid aside temporarily it is usually for one of two reasons either to accommodate another senator who wishes to offer an amendment at certain time or to permit interested senators to discuss and perhaps to agree on changes in pending amendment without occupying the time of the full senate the senate can but rarely does adopt motion that postpones to time certain further action on an amendment that it has been considering after the senate agrees to consider measure am endments to it are in order at any time subject to limitations on the number and types of amendments that may be pending simultaneously until the measure has been read third time by title except under cloture senate rules and precedents impose limits on the number of amendments that may be offered by the same token there is limit on how long senators may debate one amendment or all amendments except 1 by unanimous consent 2 under cloture or 3 under the provisions of certain statutes such as the congressional budget and impoundment act of which imposes time limit for senate floor action on budget resolutions and reconciliation bills rule xix states that senator shall speak 2 pl 11081 formerly s 1 the honest leadership and open government act of 2007 enacted on sept 14 2007

leave of the senate but the length of each speech is not controlled senator may stop debate on an amendment by being recognized and then moving to lay it on the table if the senate agrees to this nondebatable motion the amendment is considered to be rejected or tabled the senate may vote to table first degree amendment while second degree amendment to it is pending if the tabling motion is defeated debate on the amendment may resume however the vote on motion to table an amendment often is considered to be decisive test vote on the amendment if the tabling motion is defeated on roll call vote the amendment itself may be agreed to by voice vote shortly thereafter moving to table an amendment is essentially negative action and there is other motion available in the senate to bring the body to an immediate vote to dispose of pending amendment the notion of precedence has an important effect on the amending process paragraph 1 of rule xxii specifies an order of precedence among motions including the motion to amend under the terms of this paragraph motion to adjourn or recess is in order while an amendment is pending it is in order also to move to lay pending amendment on the table in fact all the other motions listed in rule xxii have precedence over the motion to amend

agreements that specify parliamentary conditions for considering and amending particular measure in their most comprehensive form these agreements can impose time limit for debating each first and second degree amendment and indicate how the time in each case is to be divided and controlled standard period of time may be provided for debating each amendmentfor example one hour for each first degree amendment and 30 minutes for each second degree amendment and any other debatable questionbut the agreement may permit lengthier debates on certain specific amendments the time for debating each amendment usually is divided between its proposer and the majority floor manager or the minority floor manager if the majority floor manager supports the amendment such comprehensive unanimous consent agreements or time agreements as they often are called also provide period of time for debate on the question of final passagedebate on the measure as whole that may be used or yielded by the majority and minority floor managers at any time that the senate is considering the measure in addition these agreements normally require that all amendments must be relevant although specific amendments may be exempted from this requirement instead of approving comprehensive time agreement when it begins debate on bill the senate frequently debates and amends major bill for some time before developing an agreement that identifies the remaining amendments that may be offered to the bill and the amount of time available for debating each of those amendments that agreement even may specify the order in which the remaining amendments are to be offered the senate also may reach agreements during the course of debate that apply only to individual amendmentsfor instance an agreement limiting how long the pending amendment will be debated and which amendment will be the next one to be considered unanimous consent agreements affect the amending process in another important respect under such an agreement covering one or all amendments to measure it is not in order to move to

precedence or to make point of order against the amendment until all the time for debating it has expired or has been yielded back at least by the proponent of the amendment in the absence of unanimous consent agreement any senator who is recognized may take any of these actions at any time after an amendment has been called up unanimous consent agreement to limit debate on specific amendment also constitutes action by the senate on that amendment once such an agreement is reached the senator offering the amendment may modify or withdraw it only by unanimous consent see modification withdrawal and division of amendments through unanimous consent agreements the senate imposes an order and some limits on the amending process that are not required by senate rules and precedents these agreements require the explicit or implicit concurrence of every senator if single senator objects the amending process may continue indefinitely or until the measure is fully amended and without limitations on debate unless the senate invokes cloture g5g149g138g156g156g146g143g146g140g138g157g146g152g151g561g152g143g561g3g150g142g151g141g150g142g151g157g156g561 as noted in riddick

amendment in two degrees unless the senate agrees otherwise by unanimous consent it is in order to offer an amendment to the text of any measure an amendment in the first degree and it is also in order to offer an amendment to that amendment an amendment in the second degree while the first degree amendment is pending it is not in order to offer an amendment in the third degreean amendment to an amendment to an amendmentexcept by unanimous consent there are parliamentary conditions under which in principle as many as 11 amendments may be pending simultaneously see the amendment trees3 g8g152g155g150g561 there are three different forms an amendment can take first an amendment may propose to insert additional language in measure or pending first degree amendment without changing anything that already is in the text it would amend second an amendment may take the form of motion to strike out part of measure or pending first degree amendment without inserting anything in its place or third an amendment may propose to strike out and insert to replace one or more words or provisions of measure or pending first degree amendment with one or more different words or provisions 3 technically there may be only one amendment pending before the senate at any moment the pending amendment is the amendment on which the senate is to act first for th sake of convenience in this report however the term pending amendments is used more generally to refer to all the amendments that have been offered and that have not been laid aside temporarily withdrawn or disposed of by the senate in some fashion httpwikileaksorgwikicrs98853g22g145g142g561g3g150g142g151g141g146g151g144g561g18g155g152g140g142g156g156g561g146g151g561g157g145g142g561g21 g142g151g138g157g142g561 g561

amendment in the first degree proposes to replace some part of the text of measure complete substitute denoted in this report as an amendment in the nature of substitute is special form of substitute amendment that proposes to replace the entire text of the measureto strike all after the enacting clause and insert in lieu thereof different text4 substitute amendment in the second degree proposes to replace the entire text of pending first degree amendment with different text all substitute amendments are motions to strike out and insert but not all motions to strike out and insert are considered substitutes perfecting amendments may insert strike or strike and insert first degree amendment to insert or first degree motion to strike out is perfecting amendment first degree amendment in the form of motion to strike out and insert is perfecting amendment if it would replace less of the measure than pending first degree substitute amendment perfecting amendment in the second degree may take any of the three possible forms so long as it proposes to alter or perfect rather than to replace entirely the text of pending first degree amendment whether first degree amendment is considered to be perfecting or substitute amendment may depend on the parliamentary circumstances in which it is offered also the distinction between perfecting and substitute amendments can depend on the way in which the amendments are drafted not on the significance of the legislative changes they propose when senator offers first degree amendment in the form of motion to strike out and insert that amendment is considered to be substitute amendment if other such first degree amendment is already pending however the same first degree amendment to strike out and insert may be considered to be perfecting amendment instead if it is offered while there is already pending substitute for some larger portion of the measure any motion to strike out and insert in the first degreeeven an amendment that would replace an entire title of the measureis perfecting amendment if it is offered while the senate is considering an amendment in the nature of substitute that would replace the text of the measure altogether with regard to second degree amendments any amendment is substitute amendment so long as it proposes to insert something in the measure in place of the matter that the pending first degree amendment proposes to insertwithout regard to whether the first degree amendment proposes only to insert or to strike out and insert on the other hand second degree amendment is perfecting amendment so long as it proposes to alter but not replace entirely the matter proposed to be inserted by the pending first degree amendment as result second degree perfecting amendment may propose major changes in first degree amendment while second degree substitute amendment may be identical to the text it would replace except for one word or number it is sometimes possible and useful for the same second degree amendment to be drafted both as perfecting amendment and as substitute amendment so that the amendment may be offered under the widest range of parliamentary circumstances 4 unlike the house the senate does not use the phrase amendment in the nature of substitute to refer consistently and exclusively to an amendment that proposes to strike out all after the enacting clause of bill or resolving clause of resolution and replace that text with different text for purp oses of clarity the phrase will be used only in that sense in this report but it should be borne in mind that senators may use the same phrase in broader sense when an amendment in the nature of substitute has been offered it is not considered to be fi rst degree amendment thus the amendment in the nature of substitute is open to two degrees of amendment httpwikileaksorgwikicrs98853g22g145g142g561g3g150g142g151g141g146g151g144g561g18g155g152g140g142g156g156g561g146g151g561g157g145g142g561g21

classes of amendments committee and floor which have been discussed earlier in this report g18g155g142g140g142g141g142g151g140g142g561g3g150g152g151g144g561g3g150g142g151g141g150g142g151g157g156g561 the distinctions among amendments can be of considerable practical importance because of the relations of precedence among amendments for purposes of the amending process in the senate precedence has two related meanings if one amendment has precedence over another 1 it may be offered while the other is pending and 2 it is disposed of first thus if amendment has precedence over amendment b amendment may be offered even though amendment b already has been offered and is still pending before the senate and if both amendments are pending at the same time the senate acts on amendment before it acts on amendment b precedence also has negative consequences amendment b may not be offered while amendment is pending and if both are pending at the same time the senate may not act on amendment b before it acts on amendment except by unanimous consent senate precedents set out three principles of precedence among amendments that are directed to the same text 1 second degree amendment has precedence over first degree amendment 2 motion to insert and motion to strike out and insert have precedence over motion to strike out and 3 perfecting amendment and an amendment to it has precedence over substitute amendment and an amendment to it the first of these principles is axiomatic second degree amendment is an amendment to first degree amendment and it must be offered while the first degree amendment is pendingthat is after the first degree amendment has been offered but before the senate has disposed of it the senate also acts on an amendment to first degree amendment before it acts on the first degree amendment itself so this principle conforms to senate practice under both meanings of precedence it may be helpful in understanding the second two principles to think about decisions the senate needs to make about text changing the text of an amendment through seconddegree amendment could cure problem senators may have had with the amendments original language that could obviate the need to strike out the text entirely for example if first degree substitute amendment is pending including an amendment in the nature of substitute an amendment may be offered to perfect the part of the measure that the substitute proposes to replace if that perfecting amendment is offered the senate votes on the perfecting amendment to the measure before it acts on the substitute by the same token while motion to strike out part of measure is pending an amendment may be offered to the text proposed to be stricken and the senate acts on the latter amendment before it votes on the motion httpwikileaksorgwikicrs98853g22g145g142g561g3g150g142g151g141g146g151g144g561g18g155g152g140g142g156g156g561g146g151g561g157g145g142g561g21 g142g151g138g157g142g561 g561

amendments number of amendments may be pending at the same time see the amendment trees precedence controls what amendments may be offered at any given time but it has effect on the order in which senators are recognized to offer amendments if two senators wish to offer amendments the order in which the amendments are called up for consideration assuming both are in order depends on which senator seeks recognition first not on the relative precedence of the two amendments g22g145g142g561g3g150g142g151g141g150g142g151g157g561g22g155g142g142g156g561 under certain parliamentary circumstances numbe r of amendments may be pending at the same time the graphic display of the amendments that are in order at any one time can be called an amendment tree senators sometimes speak of filling the amendment tree when talking about offering series of amendments to bill sometimes the goal of filling the amendment tree might be to prevent or limit further amendments from being offered to the underlying measure even if several amendments to measure have been offered senator may be able to offer an amendment by asking for unanimous consent that pending amendment be set aside so that the senate may consider his or her amendment in this way the senate may consider one or more amendments even in the absence of final action on prior amendment this action however requires unanimous consent to set aside the earlier amendment one indicati on that the tree may have been filled for the purpose of blocking further amendments is that objection is heard when the senate is asked to lay aside pending amendments the same tactic can also be used to limit the amendments that can be offered if one or more senators systematically object to laying aside pending amendments in order to allow additional amendments to be offered unless they meet specified conditions for example by keeping the amendment tree full senator might be able to prevent nongermane amendments from being offered to bill amendments that are offered to measures under these circumstances often are slight variations on the base text so that whether adopted or defeated they achieve the basic intent of supporters of the measure sometimes the amendment can be allencompassing so that if it is adopted it will amend the entire text of the bill thus prohibiting further amendment in addition once the amendment tree has been filled senator also may then file cloture petition either to the pending amendment or to the underlying measure if cloture is successful it both limits amendments that may be offered to the underlying measure to those that are germane and also establishes time limit for further consideration of the bill by keeping the amendment tree full until the expiration of the time available under cloture senator or group of senators may even be able to prevent any other amendments from being offered to the bill two methods of depicting the amendment trees are presented in this report first is the official system used in riddick s senate procedure the four diagrams in this section that are labeled charts are taken directly from riddick and are explained in considerable detail in its extended discussion of precedents concerning amendments pages 24125 httpwikileaksorgwikicrs98853g22g145g142g561g3g150g142g151g141g146g151g144g561g18g155g152g140g142g156g156g561g146g151g561g157g145g142g561g21 g142g151g138g157g142g561 g561

procedure are figures that depict precisely the same situations and possibilities but using different visuals5 the discussion that follows in this section focuses on these figures as an alternative way of visualizing and understanding the amendment situations that can develop on the senate floor both depict the same information however only the charts in riddick s senate procedure have any standing as senate precedents the amendments that are in order at any one time depend on the form and scope of the first amendment to be proposed and then on the form type and degree of subsequent amendments thus depending on the form and type of the first amendment to be offered as few as two or as many as ten other amendments may be offered before the senate must vote on any one of them but whether all of these amendments actually will be pending depends on what amendments senators wish to offer and the order in which they are recognized to do so g25g146g157g145g561g138g151g561g3g150g142g151g141g150g142g151g157g561g157g152g561g11g151g156g142g155g157g561g18g142g151g141g146g151g144g561 an amendment to insert additional matter in measure is first degree perfecting amendment while such an amendment to the text of the measure is pending other first degree amendments may be offered because other first degree amendment has precedence over such perfecting amendment to measure however the amendment to insert as first degree amendment is open to an amendment in the second degree which may be either perfecting amendment or substitute amendment once the second degree amendment is disposed of another perfecting or substitute amendment may be proposed to the pending first degree amendment so long as subsequent second degree amendment does not propose only to amend matter in the first degree amendment that already has been amended the process of offering and disposing of second degree amendments may continue until further second degree amendments are proposed or until the entire text of the first degree amendment has been amended after acting on all second degree amendments the senate proceeds to vote on the first degree amendment if and as amended if second degree perfecting amendment is offeredthat is an amendment to alter or perfect the matter proposed to be insertedno further amendments are in order until the second degree amendment is disposed of the second degree perfecting amendment may propose to delete insert or replace matter in the first degree amendment the order in which the second degree amendments are offered is decisive because perfecting amendment has precedence over substitute amendment directed to the same text in this case the text being the first degree amendment second degree perfecting amendment may be offered before the senate votes on pending second degree substitute the converse however is not true second substitute is not in order while second degree perfecting amendment is pending seconddegree substitute amendment may be offered if the first amendment in the second degree to be offered is substitute rather than perfecting amendment or if second degree substitute is offered when second degree perfecting amendment is not already pending in such 5 there is companion figure for riddicks figure 5 amendment to strike the tree that can develop in that situation is depicted in figure 3 httpwikileaksorgwikicrs98853g22g145g142g561g3g150g142g151g141g146g151g144g561g18g155g152g140g142g156g156g561g146g151g561g157g145g142g561g21 g142g151g138g157g142g561 g561

degree perfecting amendment it also is in order for senator to offer second degree perfecting amendment to the first degree amendment see figure 2 and figure 1 if second degree perfecting and substitute amendments are pending at the same time to first degree amendment to insert the senate acts first on the second degree perfecting amendment and then on the second degree substitute amendment after disposing of both second degree amendments the senate then acts on the first degree amendment if and as amended this voting order also reflects the principles of precedence the perfecting amendment has precedence over the substitute amendment directed to the same text and both second degree amendments have precedence over the first degree amendment thus when the first amendment is first degree perfecting amendment there may be three amendments pending at the same time the first gree perfecting amendment to insert additional matter second degree perfecting amendment to that amendment and second degree substitute amendment after the senate acts on the second degree perfecting amendment senators may offer other such amendments one at time and the senate acts on each of them before acting on the second degree substitute by the same token if the second degree substitute is rejected or tabled another such substitute may be proposed and while it is pending additional second degree perfecting amendments may be offered neither of the second degree amendments is open to amendment because third degree amendments are prohibited

when senator proposes first degree amendment in the form of motion to strike out and insert and does so when other such amendment is pending that motion to strike out and insert is considered to be substitute amendment for part of the measure and as many as four other amendments may be pending simultaneously but only if the amendments are offered in specific order see figure 4 and figure 3 first degree substitute for part of the measure is open to an amendment in the second degree and the second degree amendment may be either perfecting amendment or substitute amendment if second degree perfecting amendment is offered additional amendments to the first degree substitute are in order until the senate acts on the second degree amendment at that time second degree substitute amendment or another second degree perfecting amendment may be offered while the first degree substitute remains pending httpwikileaksorgwikicrs98853g22g145g142g561g3g150g142g151g141g146g151g144g561g18g155g152g140g142g156g156g561g146g151g561g157g145g142g561g21 g142g151g138g157g142g561 g561

pending first degree substitute second degree perfecting amendment also may be offered while the first and second degree substitute amendments are pending the second degree substitute must be offered before any second degree perfecting amendment has been offered or after one or more second degree perfecting amendments already have been offered and acted on with second degree substitute amendment pending the senate may consider and act on series of second degree perfecting amendments before it votes on the second degree substitute should the second degree substitute be rejected or tabled another such substitute may be offered and while it is pending additional second degree perfecting amendments may be offered to the first degree substitute amendment to this point the tree is the same for first degree perfecting amendment that would insert language and first degree substitute amendmen t but with the substitute amendment further branches of the tree may developmore amendments may be offered when substitute amendment for part of the measure is pending and when second degree perfecting amendment or second degree substitute amendment or both is pending to the first degree substitute it is also in order for senator to offer perfecting amendment to the part of the measure that the first degree substitute would strike out and replace that is because perfecting amendment has precedence over substitute amendment that is directed to the same text and the perfecting amendment also has precedence over an amendment to the substitute as result first degree perfecting and substitute amendments may be pending to the same part of the measure at the same time the perfecting amendment may take the form of an amendment to insert to strike out or to strike out and insert moreover because the perfecting amendment to the measure is first degree amendment it is open to an amendment in the second degree with substitute amendment pending for part of the measure therefore as many as four additional amendments may be pending simultaneously 1 second degree substitute amendment for the first degree substitute 2 second degree perfecting amendment to the first degree substitute 3 first degree perfecting amendment directed to the same part of the measure that the first degree substitute would strike out and replace and 4 second degree perfecting or substitute amendment directed to the first degree perfecting amendment when substitute amendment for part of the measure is pending the first degree perfecting amendment to the measure may be motion to strike out and insert but if so it proposes to replace less of the measure than the initial motion to strike out and insert this is one situation in which first degree amendment is considered to be perfecting amendment even though it might be treated as substitute amendment under other circumstances for example if the first degree substitute amendment the first motion to strike out and insert to be offered proposes to replace title of the measure the first degree perfecting amendment may propose to replace an entire section of that title this latter amendment would be considered substitute if other amendments already were pending but it is treated as perfecting amendment if it is offered while substitute amendment for larger part of the measure is pending for all five amendments to be pending simultaneously they must be offered in exactly the order in which they were listed earlier if the various amendments are not proposed in the specific order noted in figure 3 and figure 4 only part of the fivebranched tree may develop if part or all of this tree does develop the order of voting is the reverse of the order in which the amendments are offered the senate acts first on perfecting amendments to the measure the first vote occurs on the second degree amendment or on tabling motion after which the senate

amended if amended the senate then acts in order on the second degree perfecting amendment to the first degree substitute the second substitute for the first degree substitute and finally the first degree substitute as amended if amended the five amendments may not be disposed of in any other order except by unanimous consent but the senate may consider and act on several amendments on one branch of the amendment tree before it turns to the amendment on the next branch in order for example if all five amendments have been offered and the senate has acted on the first and second degree perfecting amendments to the measure senators may offer additional such amendments and they must be acted on before the senate acts on the second degree amendments to the first degree substitute similarly once the text of the measure has been perfected succession of second degree perfecting amendments to the first degree substitute may be proposed and acted on before vote occurs on the second degree substitute if the first degree substitute as amended if amended finally is rejected by the senate another first degree substitute may be offered and the amendment tree may develop once again

only one second degree amendment may be pending at time senators may not offer both the second degree perfecting amendment and the second degree substitute amendment depicted in figure 1 before either is voted on finally if the motion to strike out is followed by motion to strike out less of the text that is at issue neither motion to strike out is amendable

can be as many as three amendments offered to change section or any part of measure before the senate must act on any one of thema motion to strike out the section an amendment to strike out and insert that constitutes complete substitute for the section and an amendment to perfect the section by inserting striking out or striking out and inserting the senate acts on any and all of the amendments that come behind motion to strike out before it then acts on that motion to strike out if senator offers an amendment to perfect the text proposed to be stricken the senate votes on that amendment as and if amended and then it proceeds to vote on the motion to strike out if that motion is agreed to the effect is to remove the text at issue as it has been perfected on the other hand if the senate agrees to complete substitute for the text proposed to be stricken the motion to strike out falls automatically without being voted on the entire text in question having been amended the motion to strike out would constitute an attempt to reamend that text and therefore is longer in order it should be noted that it would be highly unusual for all of the amendments depicted in figure 3 to be proposed after an amendment to strike out is offered also the opportunity to perfect or substitute for the text that motion to strike out proposes to eliminate is only available when the motion to strike out is directed to part of the text of measure or to part of complete substitute for the text of the measure which is treated as an original question for purposes of amendment if senator offers second degree perfecting amendment that proposes to strike out part of first degree amendment that part of the first degree amendment may not be perfected while the motion to strike out is pending

the most complex amendment tree can develop when senator or senate committee proposes an amendment in the nature of substitute for th full text of the measurethat is complete substitute that proposes to strike out all after the enacting or resolving clause of the measure and replace it with completely different text individual senators do not offer such amendments very often but it is common practice for senate committees to report house or senate measure with an amendment in the nature of substitute that preserves the original number of the bill or resolution while proposing to replace

an original question for purposes of amendment under either of two circumstances 1 when it is reported committee amendment that becomes pending automatically when the measure itself is called up or 2 when an individual senator offers it at time that other amendment of any kind is pending as an original question for purposes of amendment such complete substitute is not considered to be first degree amendment that may only be amended in one further degree instead both the amendment in the nature of substitute and the text of the measure itself may be amended in two degrees creating the possibility of seven or even eleven amendments pending simultaneously see figure 3figure 6 and figure 4 to repeat when an amendment in the nature of substitute is considered as an original question it is amendable in two degrees senator may propose first degree amendment that is substitute for the amendment in the nature of the substitute for the measure the effect of such an amendment is to propose third version of the text of the bill or resolution it is then in order also to offer first degree perfecting amendment to the text of the substitute for the measure that the first degree substitute would replace furthermore both the first degree substitute amendment and the first degree perfecting amendment are open to amendments in the second degree only one second degree amendment may be pending at time to each of the first degree amendments second degree perfecting and substitute amendments may not be pending at the same time to either the first degree perfecting amendment or the first degree substitute amendment even when any or all of these amendments are pending to the amendment in the nature of substitute the text of the measure itself is amendable in two degrees any first degree amendment to the measure is considered to be perfecting amendment even though it might be substitute under other circumstances because it must affect less of the measure than the pending amendment in the nature of substitute furthermore this perfecting amendment to the text of the measure may be amended by either perfecting amendment or substitute amendment in the second degree but second degree perfecting and substitute amendments may not both be pending simultaneously once perfecting amendment is offered to the text of the measure further amendments are in order to the amendment in the nature of substitute until the senate disposes of that perfecting amendment and any amendment proposed to it thus as many as seven amendments may be pending at the same time but only if offered in the following order 1 the amendment in the nature of substitute considered to be an original question for purposes of amendment 2 the first degree substitute for the text of the amendment in the nature of substitute 3 the second degree perfecting or substitute amendment directed to the first degree substitute 4 the first degree perfecting amendment to th amendment in the

the perfecting amendment to the amendment in the nature of substitute 6 the first degree perfecting amendment to the text of the measure and 7 the second degree perfecting or substitute amendment directed to the first degree perfecting amendment to the measure the order in which these amendments must be offered if they are all to be pending is dictated by their relative precedence and primarily by the principle that perfecting amendment and an amendment to it has precedence over substitute amendment and an amendment to it this principle applies to the amendments depicted in figure 6 whether the substitute in question is the amendment in the nature of substitute or the first degree substitute for that amendment should all seven amendments be pending simultaneously the order for acting on them is the reverse of the order for offering them first the senate perfects the original text of the measure considering and acting on any second degree amendments one at time before acting on the first degree amendment if and as amended other perfecting amendments to the measure then may be offered amended and acted on second the senate disposes of the perfecting amendments and amendments to them to the amendment in the natu re of substitute third the senate turns to the amendment to the first degree substitute and then to the first degree substitute as it may have been amended

addition to amendments to measure senators may also offer motions to commit or recommit the measure to committee such motion may be offered even when an amendment tree is full motion to commit or recommit would send the bill to specified committee if it is successful and may be offered with or without instructions motions that include instructions typically contain language that would instruct committee to amend the bill those instructions may be amended to two degrees first degree amendment to the instructions and second degree amendment to the amendment this procedure is not common and may be indicative of an intent to fill the amendment tree g20g142g156g157g155g146g140g157g146g152g151g156g561g152g151g561g3g150g142g151g141g150g142g151g157g156g561

senate imposes number of other restrictions on the amendments that its members may offer several of these restrictions are matter of precedent and apply to all amendments it is not in order for instance to offer an amendment that is substantially the same as an amendment that already has been offered and disposed of unfavorably for example an amendment that has been tabled however senator may offer part of previously rejected or tabled amendment as separate amendment and an amendment that has been rejected or tabled may be reoffered as part of later amendment that proposes other

cloture see modification withdrawal and division of amendments under some circumstances the substance of an amendment that has been offered and agreed to may be proposed second time for example if the senate has agreed to an amendment to substitute for part or all of the measure an amendment with the same effect also may be proposed to the text of the measure that the substitute would replace in this way the effect of the amendment is certain to survive regardless of the fate of the substitute once the text of measure or first degree amendment has been amended it is not in order to propose an amendment that simply would rea mend the text already amended with certain limited exceptions made by the congressional budget and impoundment act however senator may offer second amendment that takes bigger bite out of the measure or first degree amendmentthat is an amendment that reamends text that already has been amended but does so in the process of proposing substantive change in larger part of the text for example after the senate has adopted an amendment that changes provisions within section of measure substitute for the whole section is in order similarly after substitutes have been adopted for several sections of title senator may move to strike out the entire title but once the senate agrees to an amendment for the entire text of measure or first degree amendment further amendments to that text are in order because there is part of the measure or first degree amendment that has not already been amended an amendment that would amend measure in several different places is actually series of amendments that may be considered bloc without objection or by unanimous consent second degree amendment should affect the same portion of the measure as the first degree amendment to which it is offered by the same token while substitute is pending for part of measure any perfecting amendment to the measure should deal with the same part of the measure that the substitute would replace g9g142g155g150g138g151g142g151g142g156g156g561g138g151g141g561g20g142g149g142g159g138g151g140g162g561 rule xvi of the standing rules of the senate require that first degree amendments be germane only when offered to general appropriations measures and rule xxi lists the same requirement when cloture has been invoked some statutes also impose germaneness requirementfor example section 305b of the congressional budget and impoundment act prohibits non germane amendments to concurrent budget resolutions amendments to budget reconciliation bills also must be germane under all other circumstances there is rule limiting the subjects of amendments senators may impose germaneness requirement on themselves as part of unanimous consent agreements an agreement that limits and divides control of the time for debating measure and all amendments thereto may include an additional provision that amendment that is not germane to the provisions of the said bill shall be received senators who wish to protect their right to offer nongermane amendments may object to the inclusion of the germaneness provision or request that their proposed amendments be specifically exempted under the terms of the agreement alternatively the senate usually includes in animous consent agreements the requirement that amendments to specific bill must be relevant to be relevant an amendment must not introduce httpwikileaksorgwikicrs98853g22g145g142g561g3g150g142g151g141g146g151g144g561g18g155g152g140g142g156g156g561g146g151g561g157g145g142g561g21 g142g151g138g157g142g561 g561

that may be offered to general appropriations measures general appropriations bill is measure that appropriates funds for more than single specific purpose or program the regular annual appropriations bills some supplemental and deficiency appropriations bills and joint resolutions making continuing appropriations have generally been held by the senate to be general appropriations bills rule xvi of the senate is devoted to the subject of appropriations measures and amendments to them because of the longstanding practice that general appropriations are enacted into law as house bills much of this rule is framed in terms of senate amendments to housepassed appropriations bills these practices have been fluid however prior to the mid1990s the senate appropriations committee typically reported general appropriations bills in the form of the housepassed bill with series of individual amendments adopted in their markup in recent years particularly for appropriations measures on which the house had not acted initial senate action has sometimes been in the form of an orig inal bill reported from the senate appropriations committee in current practice the appropriations committee has typically reported general appropriations bills in the form of the housepassed bill with committee substitute generally the provisions of rule xvi are designed to preserve separation between the process of appropriating funds and the process of enacting substantive legislation including authorizations and reauthorizations however each of the restrictions in the rule is modified by exceptions derived either from the rule itself or from precedents in some respects these exceptions are so major that the senate cannot be said to enforce strict separation between appropriations on the one hand and authorizations and other substantive legislation on the other certainly the restrictions on amendments to general appropriations measures are not nearly as severe in the senate as they are in the house paragraphs 1 3 and 7 of rule xvi address the relationship between authorizations and appropriations paragraphs 2 4 and 6 restrict the inclusion of other legislative provisions in general appropriations measures paragraph 1 deals with appropriations amendments whether recommended by senate committee or offered by senator in his or her individual capacity under the terms of this paragraph amendment may propose to add or increase an item of appropriation unless it meets one of four conditions such an amendment is in order 1 if it already has been authorized by law or treaty 2 if it would carry out the provisions of bill or joint resolution already passed by the senate during that session even if the measure has not yet been enacted into law 3 if it is recommended by the appropriations committee or senate committee with legislative jurisdiction over the subject of the amendment or 4 if the appropriation amendment is proposed in pursuance of an estimate submitted in accordance with law the senate may consider an amendment making an unauthorized appropriation if the authorization has passed the senate alone or if the appropriation is recommended by the committee on appropriations the appropriations committee is free to propose any

statutory authorization is merely one of the conditions and not necessary one by which an appropriation amendment is eligible for consideration in the senate paragraph 3 requires that when an amendment to add or increase an appropriation is offered at the direction of any other senate committee the amendment is to be referred to the appropriations committee at least one day before it is offered on the floor this procedure which very rarely is invoked is designed to give the appropriations committee an opportunity to examine the proposed amendment but not to prevent the senate from considering it paragraph 3 also provides that the appropriation proposed in any such amendment may not be increased by further amendment on the senate floor paragraph 7 of the rule requires that the reports of the appropriations committee on general appropriations bills must indicate all amendments it is proposing for appropriations that do not have prior senate or statutory authorization other provisions of rule xvi address the inclusion of legislative amendments in general appropriations measures paragraph 2 deals with amendments recommended by the appropriations committee legislative amendments proposed by other committees or individual senators are the subject of paragraph 4 paragraph 2 prohibits the appropriations comm ittee from reporting an appropriations measure containing amendments proposing new or general legislation however the rule implicitly acknowledges that limitation amendments are in orderamendments that impose some restrictions on how appropriations may be expended without for example repealing or amending existing statutory authorities such limitation amendment is in order under paragraph 2 if its effect is dependent on some contingency such as the subsequent enactment of an unrelated measure paragraph 4 imposes similar restrictions on amendments to general appropriations bills other than those recommended by the appropriations committee such amendment may propose general legislation except in the form of limitation and limitation may be tied to the occurrence of contingency in addition this paragraph imposes germaneness requirement on all amendments to general appropriations bills even amendments recommended by the appropriations committee although the precedents cited in riddick s senate procedure do not provide clear and explicit criteria for determining in all cases whether particular limitation amendment is in order paragraph 6 of rule xvi directs that points of order against questionable limitations should be sustained however the senate enjoys somewhat greater discretion when it amends limitation that already has been passed by the house if the house includes limitation or some other legislative provision in general appropriations bill the limitation is subject to germane amendments in the senate even if the amendments would have the effect of changing existing law if the house of representatives opens the door by incorporating legislation in general appropriations bill the senate allows itself the opportunity to walk through that door and perfect or replace the houses language this opportunity does not exist if the senate acts on senate version of an appropriations bill the senates germaneness requirement and the prohibition against legislative amendments apply only to general appropriations measures thus amendments to special appropriations bills which

be legislative in character and effect moreover senate rules and precedents do not prohibit legislative measures from including appropriations but this asymmetry is more apparent than real because the house may well refuse to consider an appropriation originating in the senate also special appropriations bills are rarely used paragraph 8 of rule xvi states that general appropriations bill or amendment to such bill shall be considered if it would reappropriate unexpended balances of appropriationsthat is if it would continue the availability of appropriations that otherwise would lapseunless in continuation of appropriations for public works on which work has commenced the rationale underlying this prohibition is that money should be appropriated anew each year so that congress can accurately gauge the annual costs of federal activities paragraph 5 of the same rule prohibits amendments to general appropriations bills that would provide funds for private claim unless the proposed amendment would carry out the provisions of some existing law or treaty

point of order against an amendment at any time after the amendment is offered but before the senate begins to act on it when an amendment is being considered under unanimous consent agreement limiting debate point of order may be made against the amendment until at least all of the proponents time for debating it has expired or has been yielded back in either case point of order may not be made against only part of an amendment if point of order is sustained against any portion of an amendment the entire amendment is tainted and is out of order however the senator offering an amendment may modify it even while point of order is pending against it so long as the senate has not already taken some action on the amendment see modification withdrawal and division of amendments rule xx provides that most questions of order ar to be decided by the presiding officer but he or she may submit any question of order directly to the senate instead some questions of order must be decided by vote of the senate itself not by the presiding officer for example only the senate as whole may decide whether measure or amendment is out of order on the ground that it is unconstitutional similarly rule xvi requires that questions of germaneness raised against proposed amendments to general appropriations bills shall be submitted directly to the senate and decided without debate when point of order is to be decided by the presiding officer senators have right to debate it although the chair may entertain as much or as little debate as he or she chooses points of order to be decided by the senate generally are debatable unless rule provides otherwise as in the case of questions of germaneness on general appropriations bills time agreements on measures usually limit debate relating to points of order and questions of order are not debatable when the senate is operating under cloture in most cases proposed amendment may be ruled out of order without affecting the status of the measure to which it is offered for example if an amendment to add or increase appropriations on general appropriations bill is ruled out of order the senate proceeds to consider other amendments to

on the ground that it is legislative in character senator may raise the question of germaneness before the point of order is decided if the senate votes that the amendment is germane the point of order falls automatically the presiding officer does not rule on it the most frequent bases for points of order against amendments are those already mentioned the germaneness or relevancy requirement when in force and the restrictions on amendments to general appropriations bills under rule xvi in addition points of order may be made against amendments for violating one of several provisions of the congressional budget and impoundment act of as amended the points of order that can be made in the senate under these increasingly complex procedures are identified and described in crs report 97865 points of order in the congressional budget process by james v saturno if the measure itself would violate provis ion of the congressional budget and impoundment act the senate may adopt resolution waiving that provision such resolution protects consideration of the measure but it does not protect amendments including committee amendments that may be offered to it under section 904b of the congressional budget and impoundment act an amendment or provision of measure can be protected against certain point of orders if majority of the senate agrees to motion to waive the applicable provision of the act section 904c requires vote of threefifths of the entire senate not just the senators present and voting to waive other congressional budget and impoundment act and related statutory provisions possible points of order against amendments also may be waived by unanimous consent agreements if an agreement under which measure is considered provides for specific amendment that amendment is protected against the general requirement imposed by the agreement that all amendments to the measure must be germane or relevant any senator may appeal the ruling of the presiding officer on point of order and such appeals are not unusual in the senate when ruling is appealed the senate votes on whether it will sustain the ruling of the chair there are constraints of course on the criteria that senators may apply in deciding how to vote on appeals

any time before the senate takes some action on the amendment under senate precedents the senate has taken action for this purpose if 1 the yeas and nays have been ordered on the amendment 2 the

amendment may be modified even while tabling motion or point of order against the amendment is pending after the senate has taken some action on an amendment it may be modified only by unanimous consent however senator who has lost the right to modify his or her own amendment has another recourse that senator may offer an amendment to his or her own amendment instead this is the only condition under which senator may propose to amend his or her own amendment one senator may modify an amendment offered by another senator only by unanimous consent and committee amendments may be modified only at the direction of the committee or by unanimous consent g25g146g157g145g141g155g138g160g138g149g561g152g143g561g3g150g142g151g141g150g142g151g157g156g561 even under cloture senator who

also eliminates any second degree amendment that may be pending to it even if the yeas and nays have been ordered on the second degree amendment an amendment that has been withdrawn may be reoffered at later time except under cloture one senator may withdraw another senators amendment only by unanimous consent and committee amendments may be withdrawn only by unanimous consent or at the direction

divided into its component parts the presiding officer determines subject to appeal to the senate whether an amendment is susceptible to divisionthat is whether its parts can stand independently when an amendment is divided each part is considered as if it were separate amendment after the senate disposes of one part division the next division is placed automatically before the senate for consideration an amendment may be divided even after the yeas and nays have been ordered on it in such case rollcall vote occurs on each part unless the order for the yeas and nays is vitiated by unanimous consent amendments considered bloc may be divided only by unanimous consent rule xviii also includes an important exception motions to strike out and insert are not divisible consequently the only amendments that typically are subject to demands for division are amendments to add new provisions to measure or pending amendment

amendment if an amendment is tabled it is disposed of adversely and permanently unless the senate reconsiders the vote on the tabling motion tabling an amendment does not affect the status of the measure to which it was offered except under cloture or the provisions of certain rulemaking statutes or by unanimous consent the senate may not vote on an amendment if there are senators seeking recognition to debate it further subject to the twospeech limit of rule xix under these circumstances the motion to table offers two advantages it may be offered by senator who has the floor at any time after debate on the amendment has begun and the motion is not debatable so tabling motion can be used to end debate on an amendment but only if the senate is prepared to reject the amendment if tabling motion is made and defeated debate on the amendment may resume another motion to table the same amendment may not be made unless the amendment has been changed significantly or substantial period of time has elapsed in practice normally three days under unanimous consent agreement that limits and divides control of the time for debating an amendment motion to table is not in order until at least all the proponents time on the amendment has expired or has been yielded back at which point the senate may be ready to vote on the amendment itself as result tabling motions are somewhat less frequent and useful when amendments are being considered under the terms of unanimous consent agreements in practice the senate usually votes on amendments and motions to table amendments either by voice vote or by rollcall vote division votes occur infrequently the constitution provides that rollcall vote may be demanded by onefifth of the senators present quorum being present since quorum of the senate is 51 senators the minimum number required for demanding rollcall is 11 unless the number of senators actually present was ascertained shortly before the demand the yeas and nays may be demanded on an amendment at any time that it is pending before the senate but not before it is offered nor while an amendment that has precedence is pending except by unanimous consent rollcall vote may be demanded even after voice or division vote has occurred but before the result has been announced in practice however rollcall votes normally are ordered while debate on the amendment is still in progress the yeas and nays must be ordered separately on tabling motion even if rollcall already has been ordered on the amendment proposed to be tabled the yeas and nays on measure may be ordered at any time it is before the senate even while an amendment to the measure is pending the senate acts on all amendments and tabling motions by majority vote of the senators present and voting even if offered during consideration of measure or matter such as constitutional amendment that requires twothirds vote for final action the constitution requires that quorum majority of all senators must be present for the senate to conduct business but the senate assumes that quorum always is present unless majority of senators fail to respond to quorum call or fail to participate in rollcall vote consequently voice or division vote in which only few senators participate is still valid unless challenged

process in number of important respects first the cloture rule imposes time limit on the amending process after the senate has considered matter under cloture for total of 30 hours further amendments may be called up for consideration and the senate proceeds to vote on any pending amendments and then on the matter on which cloture was invoked the thirty hours for consideration may be increased by threefifths vote of all senators second senator may offer more than two amendments until every other senator has had an opportunity to offer two amendments this provision is intended to give every senator chance to offer some amendments during the 30 hours of consideration under cloture third to be in order under cloture amendments must be submitted in writing to the journal clerk by certain deadlines before the senate votes on the cloture motion specifically any first degree amendment must be submitted by 100 pm on the day after the cloture motion is filed any second degree amendment must be received at least one hour before the senate begins to vote on the cloture motion the difference between these two deadlines is designed to give all senators roughly one day to examine the first degree amendments that may be proposed and to frame any second degree amendments they may wish to offer fourth after cloture is invoked all amendments must be germane to the matter under consideration the presiding officer also is empowered in extreme circumstances to rule amendments out of order as being dilatory fifth the reading of an amendment is dispensed with automatically not by unanimous consent if it has been reproduced and available for at least 24 hours sixth unanimous consent is required to modify amendments except for changes in page and line numbers that may be required if the matter under consideration is reprinted after cloture is invoked finally once an amendment has been submitted in writing it may be called up by any senator thus any senator may call up any amendment that is eligible for consideration under cloture but once an amendment has been withdrawn under cloture it may not be reoffered consequently if one senator offers and withdraws an amendment another senator may not bring the same amendment back before the senate for vote unless he or she also had submitted it in writing before cloture was invoked
