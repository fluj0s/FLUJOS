from the high commissioner 8 december 2005 mr ole naiko director investment promotion tanzania investment centre shaaban robert street dar salaam mr stewart middelton silverdale farm moshi i wanted to bring to your attention statement by mr stanislaus mpaze the tic manager in moshi his statement is carried in the nipashe newspaper of 7 december and in the guardian newspaper of 8 december i enclose translation of the nipashe article and copy of the guardian one in the guardian article mr middelton is not given his full name but referred to only as david stewart but there is question that it is he i am disturbed as is mr middelton that mr mpaze should go public on an issue damaging to mr middeltons reputation when either mr mpaze is not in full possession of all of the facts or has been misled about their substance the truth is this mr middelton did apply while ago to be registered as an investor he collected the necessary forms and was told that he needed to provide more detailed feasibility study he intended to do this but was unable to proceed because of serious harassment by tanzanian businessman mr benjamin mengi who is mentioned in the guardian article despite having acquired his farm in moshi from mr mengi entirely legally the latters activities have prevented mr middelton from registering his lease without this he was not able to register as an investor but bona fide investor he is he currently provides employment for 120 tanzanians and is trying to generate valueadded exports for the tanzanian economy he is doing this in complete conformity to tanzanias laws and in response to president mkapas invitation to investors to come to tanzania and generate growth jobs exports and skills moreover he is doing this in the agriculture sector which is as you know particular priority for the tanzanian government instead of being helped he has been harassed at every stage not only have attempts been made to seize his farm illegally but those attempts have been assisted by the moshi police and judiciary mr middelton was falsely arrested 10 days ago details are inaccurately recorded in the 2 articles taken under armed police escort before magistrate in moshi who clearly knew nothing about the case charge sheet was provided at his first hearing and comprehensible charge sheet has since been provided i have written to the tanzanian police and dci adadi rajabu has helpfully responded to my concerns by asking his regional police commissioner to investigate and report to him but this harassment is very long standing and has adversely effected mr middeltons business and sadly his perception of tanzania as safe destination for investment the united kingdom is both major investor in tanzania and its largest bilateral development partner we are concerned to see tanzania continue on the road to reform laid out by president mkapa with at its heart diversified economy led by the private sector the tic exists as part of those reforms and to encourage that economic change it is therefore doubly distressing to find tic regional office going public in such negative way in case which does not reflect well on the rule of law in moshi i am sure that you are not aware of the circumstances i would be therefore be most grateful if you would take the time to investigate them and perhaps to speak directly to mr middelton his mobile phone number is 0744 374346 i am sure he would be happy to give you background details on the case and would greatly welcome as would i your intervention i am copying this letter to mr middelton as well as to dci adadi rajabu and dr sadikiel kimaro at state house both dci rajabu and dr kimaro know of the case and are being helpful many thanks for your help andrew pocock cc dci adadi rajabu dr sadikiel kimaro economic advisor to the president mr stewart middelton silverdale farm pic pic pic
