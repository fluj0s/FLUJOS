developments background1 successive us administrati ons have identified irans support for radical islamic movements as key justification for contai ning and applying sanctions against iran during the 1980s iran attempted to xport its islamic revolution to lebanon afghanistan sudan algeria and the persian gulf states during the 1990s iran has built ties to palestinia n islamic movements opposed to the arabisraeli peace process after the soviet union broke up in 1991 us analysts and policymakers feared that iran would attempt to use its varied ethnic linguistic religious and cultural ties to central asia to cultivate proiranian radical islamic opposition movements in the region tajikistan which does not border iran but whose people are of persian origin and azerbaijan which shares with iran the predominance of shiite islam appeared to be natural targets for increased iranian political and religious influence the worst fears of some in the united stat and central asia about irans regional intentions apparently have not been realized irans revolutionary purists who wanted to take advantage of the soviet collapse to push irans ideology quickly lost out to iranian pragmatists who saw central asia as an export market and potential avenue to frustratehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs9886crs2 2gertz bill intelligence agency highlights threat of antiamerican terror in tajikistan washington times december 9 1997 us attempts to isolate iran irans leaders apparently also believed that political meddling in central asia which russia considers its sphere of influence could jeopardize its ties to russia russia has been major supplier to iran of conventional weapons including submarines tanks and comb at aircraft as well as nuclear reactor under construction in june 1998 iran llegedly tested an in termediaterange missile of north korean design repor tedly with russian assistance since 1992 iranian leaders have been stressi ng to their central asian neighbors the economic benefits of dealing with iran ir an argues that it has the most developed transport network and wellequipped ports on th persian gulf and sea of oman and that rail lines could be easily extende d some in central asia ve looked at iran as market for raw materials and i ndustrial products such as cotton fiber currently iran still is minor trade partner for the states of the region but it has established economic commissions with most of the states to expand trade irans emphasis on economic cooperation has been reinforced since th may 1997 election of relative moderate mohammad khatemi as irans president either by design or lack of opportunity iran has not developed significant political influence in the central asian countries iran provided some support to coalition of islamic and democratic movements that briefly seized power in tajikistan september december 1992 iran also has provided sa nctuary to tajik islamic opposition leaders such as akbar turajonzada and reportedly has built up an intelligence network there2 at the same time iran has built ties to the g overnment of imoma li rakhmanov and helped broker ceasefire september 1994 and fu rther peace settlement june 1997 in the internal conflict in tajikistan the united states accepted statement in the communique of the p8 summit in denver in june 1997 praisi ng irans mediation role in tajikistan iran also has tried to mediate in the di spute between armenia and azerbaijan over the disputed nagornokarabakh territory over the last few years iran has worked to improve often contentious rela tions with azerbaijani presid ent heydar aliyev and has offered only minor support to proir anian islamic part in azerbaijan among the other central asian states turk menistan has devel oped the warmest ties with iran president niyazov in june 1997 termed iran the closest friend and neighbor of turkmenistan and the two count ries opened major rail link in may 1996 uzbekistans relations with ir an earlier cool have warmed somewhat uzbekistan openly backed may 1995 us trade and investment ban on iran in 1997 after irans apparent goodfaith mediation efforts in tajikistan uzbekistans president islam karimov said he supported expanded trade and tran sport ties with iran ka zakstan and kyrgyzstan have consistently been less concerned than the othe r central asian states about irans intentions in the region and have stead ily broadened economic ties with the islamic republic energy relationships as it became apparent in the mid 1990s that the expected iranian effort to gain influence in central asia was not materializing the central asian states began to see iran as viable and desirable partner to he lp them exploit the resources they would needhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs9886crs3 3one grouping competing for the project is led by the us firm unocal the other is led by the argentine company bridas to develop economically according to the us energy departme nt proven and possible oil reserves in the caspian region are 171191 billion barrels of oil and 564665 trillion cubic feet of natural gas proven reserves are much smaller but are still comparable to north sea oil reserves and north american gas reserves the ndlocked central asian states were anxious to devel op alternatives to russia as transit route for exporting their energy resources iran has argued that the shortest and least expensive route to export these resources runs through iran to bolst er this view and to discourage us energy firms from proceeding with projects iran has maintained that exploitation of oil and gas resources in the caspian sea and related uses cannot move fo rward until the status of the sea is worked out azerbaijan has led obj ection to this position in part because its caspian sea projects are more advanced than those of other littoral states despite widespread concerns about irania n foreign policy irans political stability gives iran an advantage in competing for projects over some regional countries such as afghanistan two energy teams3 are vying for the right to build gas pipeline from turkmenistan to pakistan through afghan istan although the clinton administration endorses such efforts it admits that transaf ghan pipeline is unlikely as long as inter factional strife conti nues in that country major ener gy projects that involve iran and central asian states either under way or planned include those discussed below in mid1997 kazakstan conducte d test swap of oil to iran under plans for iran to use the kazak oil in its northern refi neries and to then export an equivalent amount of its own oil from persian gu lf terminals in the south crediting kazakstan for the shipments technical and other problems however have put this project on hold on december 29 1997 the president of iran mohammad khatemi and of turkmenistan saparmurad niyazov in augurated 125mile pipeline linking the two countries gas transport networks initially iran will use the turkmen gas in its northeast to offset the 160 million iran f unded to construct th pipeline under may 1997 memorandum of understanding be tween turkey and turkmenistan the turkmen gas will eventually be exported through iran to turkey when an iran turkey pipeline agreed to in au gust 1996 and now under construction is completed one day earlier khatemi and niyazov were joined by turkeys prime minister mesut yilmaz in endorsing plan by roya l dutch shell to study the feasibility of larger 940mile gas pipeline from turkmeni stan to turkey through iran the energy firm envisions that pipeline as eventually transporting gas from central asia and iran to europe kazakstan is in discussions with iran fo r the construction of an oil pipeline from kazakstans oil fields to irans persian gulf coast iran is offering to finance construction of that pipeline for kaza kstan the pipeline to iran would cost fraction of that envisioned in an alternat pipeline corridor strongly backed by the united states that would avoid iran by running from baku azerbaijans capitalhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs9886crs4 4this report was requested by the conference report on fy 1997 foreign aid appropriations pl 104208 to turkeys

out of seven currently developing azerbaijans oil nd gas resources in june 1998 the main foreign oil consortium in azerbaijan azerbaijan international operating consortium aioc which includes some us firms acknowledged it had begun talks with iran on oil swap arrangements in june 1998 iran solicited bids for 400 million oil pipeline from irans caspian port of neka to irans northern refineries the plan is intended to encourage oil swaps between iran and caspian region oil producers and could eventually form part of new energy route from the ca spian to irans persian gulf ports turkmenistan has transporte d some crude oil by road and rail through iran to persian gulf ports however asian economic turmoil has reduced this trade and turkmenistan has shifted to western expor ts through georgian and russian ports us policy the financial attractiveness of energy expor t routes through iran has run up against the commitment of the administration and congress to constrain irans financial and military capabilities an april 1997 state department report on caspian energy development4 stated that the united states strongly opposes activities which significantly contribute to irans revenues and petroleu m sector increasing the funds available to support international terrorism and developmen t of weapons of mass destructi on chief congressional backer of this position has been senator sa m brownback who said in november 5 1997 speech on central asia that if the floodgates open through iran the eastern caspian will certainly fall into the iranian sphere of dominance and the south caucasus will lose out on its opportunity to prosper in october 1997 sen brownback introduced bill the silk road strategy act of 1997 s 1344 that provides incentives for the central asian states to cooperate with each other and with the united states rather than with iran the bill was repor ted to the full senate on june 23 1998 while trying to persuade the central asian states to exclude iran from major energy projects the administration pparently has sought not to interfere with the overarching objective of energy development in cent ral asia in may 1995 president clinton imposed us ban on trade and investment with or in iran and in any territory or marine area apparently referring to portions of the caspian over which ir an claims sovereign rights or jurisdiction however the ban sp ecifically allowed for licensing on caseby case basis us participation in temporary marketbased swaps of crude oil from the caspian sea basin in support of energy projects in turkmenistan azerbaijan

already banned from making such investments in iran under march 1995 and superseding may 1995 executive order kazakstan one us firm mobil corp has already applied for us license to engage in oil swaps with iran decision has been announced on that application some observers believe th overarching goal of promoting central asian development coupled with us desire to reach out to the more moderate new president of iran has made the administration hesitant to apply the iranlibya sanctions act pl 104172 ilsa to central asian energy projects that include iran 5 the ilsa law signed august 5 1996 re quires us sanctions on foreign firms that make substantial inve stments over 20 million in one year in irans energy sector6 at july 23 1997 hearing of the house international relations committee state department officials said that the irantur keyturkmenistan project discussed above was not sanctionable under that law because rkey had agreed to purchase gas from turkmenistan not iran as currently constituted iran will earn only transit fees from the project whether or not it purchases iranian gas turkey maintained that its pipeline with iran was not sanctionable under ilsa because iran and turkey were each constructing portions of the pipeline on their re spective sides of the border many outside experts agreed with the turkish interpretation that this did not meet the definition of sanctionable investment stipulated by ilsa the international energy community was further encouraged by may 18 1998 us decision not to sanction september 1997 d eal between iran and total sa france gazprom russia and petronas malaysia to develop irans south pars gas field the administration judged the deal to meet the criteria for ilsa sanctions but it waived the sanctions on national in terest grounds and indicated that similar deals by eu firms would also receive waivers many experts viewed the administration waivers as an effort not only to avoid trade frictions with the eu but as part of us effort to signal positively toward iranian president mohammad khatemi some observers believe that imposing sanctions under ilsa could undermine the more moderate khatemi as he is attempting to consolidate his position in tehran in late 1997 and especially following the may 18 ilsa waivers the administration has sought to counter the widespread interp retation that it is softening its position on central asian energy routes through ira n apparently recognizing the widespread interpretation of us policy the administration sought to articulate more clearly its policy on energy projects that transit iran on october 23 1997 in testimony before the subcommittee on international economic polic export and trade promotion of the senate foreign relations committee under secretary of state stuart eizenstat said let be clear we do not support any pipelines th rough iran carrying either iranian oil and gas to western markets or that of any other country referring to the july 23 testimony about the iranturkey pipeline eizensta t said this announcement has been widely misinterpreted to mean that the united states has approved pipeline across iran this is definitely not the caseshould we find evidence of investment activity which could enhance irans ability to develop its own petroleum resources we will take appropriate actions under ilsa httpwikileaksorgwikicrs9886crs6

kazakstan s president nursultan nazarbayev he reportedly told president clinton he would support that route over one that transits iran if the united states could rrange financing for the trans caspian route by october 19987 during turkmen president saparamurad niyazovs april 1998 us visit the administration similarly dvocated alternatives to transiranian oil and gas shipments and proffered some study aid but niyazov reporte dly reiterated his support for iran as one of multiple transshipment routes contemplated for largescale turkmen energy exports on june 3 1998 two weeks after the ilsa waivers under secretary of state eizenstat testified before the house inte rnational relations committee that the united states remains strongly opposed to oil and gas pipelines which transit iran and that as policy matter we will continue to encourage alternative routes for the transport of caspian energy resources such as tran scaspian pipelines and the bakuceyhan routewe will carefully examine any proposal s for transiranian pipeline construction for possible implications under ilsa and any other relevant laws and take appropriate action in view of our strong opposition to such pipelines we intend to continue to challenge them despite the strong eizenstat and other u s statements many in the oil industry continue to believe that us resolve to press for routes that exclude iran is weakening they received some support for their analys is from june 18 state department press briefing by department spoke sman jamie rubin in answer ing reporter questions rubin suggested that the united states opposed reliance on iran as an export route saying that the united states does not believe it is in any countrys best interest to have iran as the only transit corridor for caspian oil and gas the statement left open the possibility that the united states might acquiesce to the development of some routes than transit iran some us officials stress that the eizenstat and other statements are more authoritative statements of us policy while others believe the rubin characterization represents an effort to signal gradual change in us policy on this issue
