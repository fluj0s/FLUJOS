has enjoyed two of the longest peacetime expa nsions in history with unemployment inflation and interest rates all falling something must have changed in household finance credit cards are among the usual suspects credit cards figure prominently in the debate over bankruptcy reform credit card lenders argue that bankruptcy makes it is too easy for debtors to avoid paying their debts creating an incentive for reckless or fraudulent borrowing andexacerbating recent losses to credit card loan portfolios they support legislationhr 2500 and s 1301 that would require some debtors to repay portion of what they owe opponents of such proposals including some consumer groups argue thatthe highpower marketing campaigns of credit card issuers amount to an irresponsible extension of credit to house holds with low incomes and little financial sophistication many of whom are then thrust into bankruptcy by any unforseeneconomic trouble does bankruptcy cause excessive losses to lenders or do lending practices cause bankruptcies credit card debt has grown rapidly since the early 1980s butit is still small share less than 11 of all household debt which is dominated by mortgage and home equity debt however the interest charged on credit cards is high and moreover it is sticky that is cr edit card lenders have not cut their rates when the general level of interest rates fa lls reasons for this stickiness may lie in structural and permanent features of the market or in unique historical circumstancesin the credit card industrys development in any case dollar of credit card debt is more expensive than dollar of other debt since 1989 the aggregate debt burden debt payments as percentage of income of american families has been flat however the debt burden has fallen for upper income families and risen for lowinco families financial distress when more than 40 of income goes to debt service has also increased among lowerincome families have credit cards played role in these trends the debt burdenarising specifically from credit cards app ears to be minor 05 of income in 1995 but somewhat higher and rising for lowincome households could credit cardborrowing by lowincome families though small in the aggregate be straw thatbroke the camels back and source of increased bankruptcy filings the percentage of families using credit cards to borrow has increased since 1983 with lowerincome families leading the rise however the median amountborrowed by lowincome families has not risen significantly the expansion of creditcard loan volume is primarily attributable to upperincome borrowers increasing theirbalances and for these borrowers the overall debt burden has been falling the available aggregate data do not show that credit card debt has caused major shift in

since credit cards function as lender of last resort for many of those in financial distress3 given the nature of credit card debt and its treatment in bankruptcy one would expect some correlation

cards have been at the center of the debate over the ongoing epidemic of personal bankruptcy theincrease in personal bankruptcy since the early 1980s during period when theunited states has enjoyed two of the longest economic expansions ever recorded inpeacetime is puzzling single factor can be identified with confidence as the principal cause but something must have changed in household finance 4 credit cards are among the usual suspects even though credit card debt represents fairly small fraction of total household debt5 its rate of growth since 1980 has been the fastest of any component of that total in addition to growth in the volume of lending the credit card industry has been ch aracterized by rapid change in other areas the number of major credit and debit cards in circulation has grown from justover 100 million in 1980 to about 500 m illion ten million more american families had credit card debt in 1995 than in 1983 6httpwikileaksorgwikicrs98277crs3 7for examples of these arguments and rebuttals see us congress senate committee on the judiciary subcommittee on administrative oversight of the courts the increase in personal bankruptcy and the crisis in consumer credit

serial 10474 458 pthe proportion of households with access to this form of credit has increased following direct mail and telephone solicitations by card issuers that havenumbered in the billions and technology has created new uses for the cards at the gas pump in foreign cities in supermarkets on the internet etc and has made their use moreconvenient for instance clerks longer look though ledger of bad or stolen card numbers before each sale so that they have become nearly indispensable to many households even those that do not use the cards toborrow the relationship of credit cards to bankruptcy is controversial credit card lenders argue that the current bankruptcy code is too lenient toward debtors and encourages abuse since quick easy and relatively painless way to avoidrepayment of unsecured debt is available many consumers are said to choose to file bankruptcy rather than live within their means the existence of the bankruptcy option following this line of reasoning causes irresponsible andor fraudulentbehavior by borrowers which inevitably driv up loan losses credit card issuers have been strong supporters of needsbased bankruptcy and other reforms designedto shift the costs of personal bankruptcy from creditors to debtors 7 opponents of such proposals however see the causal relationship flowing in the opposite direction they argue that th marketing tactics of credit card lenders the ubiquitous mass mailings offers of p reapproved lines of credit low initial interest rates etc amount to forcefeeding very expensive form of credit tohouseholds with little financial sophistication many such households take on debtburdens that they cannot repay or which at least put them closer to the edge so that any setback to their financial situation drops them into bankruptcy court if lenders experience high loss rates in this view th ey are only reaping what they have sown and in any case they are compensated for ri sk by the high interest rates they charge does bankruptcy cause excessive losses to lenders or do lending practices cause bankruptcies this report considers the evidence that may shed light on these questions the following sections examine 1 the significance of credit card debtin terms of the total picture of consumer finance 2 the growth of and competitive conditions in the credit card industry in particular the issues of why credit card interest rates are so high and whether th credit card market has expanded principally through marketing to lowincome highrisk households and 3 changes in thedebt burdens of american households d ebt

federal reserve balance sheets for the us economy and release g19 these figures which are not adjusted for inflation show that revolving credit has been the fastest growing type of household debt since 1980 revolving credit in turn is dominated by bank cr edit card lending as is shown in figure 2 below which sets out revolving credit by holder commercial banks and pools ofsecuritized assets loans which have been packaged as bonds and sold to investorsand which are longer carried on the originating banks books account for about 80 of the total loan volume however revolving credit remains relatively small fraction of total household borrowing which continues to be dominat ed by home mortgage debt since 1980 households have taken on about 465 billion in additional revolving card debt buthttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98277crs5 figure 2 revolving credit outstanding by holder 19801997 over the same period mortgage and home equity loans outstanding have grown by nearly 3 trillion source federal reserve release g19 why then does the bankruptcy debate focus on credit card borrowing rather than on mortgage debt one answer is that mortgages are little affected by thebankruptcy process the lenders right to foreclose if the loan is not repaid survivesbankruptcy another answer more germane to this report is that credit card interest rates are among the highest if not the highest charged by mainstream lenders adollar of credit card debt will require gr eater share of the borrowers income than dollar of other debt credit card debt became even more expensive relative tomortgage debt when the tax reform act of 1986 took away the deductibility of credit card interest payments it may be th erefore that credit card debt raises debt burdens disproportionately to its share in total household borrowing why are credit card interest rates so high there are two parts to the question of credit card interest rates the first is why have rates been so high the second is what impact do these rates have onhousehold finances that is are they so high that they cause financial distress and lead to bankruptcies the first questi on has been the subject of much research independent of the bankruptcy issue that research is summarized here the price of loan the interest rate charged to borrowers is determined by several factors the interest rate must yield enough revenue to cover the lenderscosts cost of funds administrative costs etc and it must include risk premium to cover the possibility of borrower defaults the size of the premium varies according to the lenders perception of the credit risk involved in particular loan or class of loans credit card loans are at the riskie r end of the scale they are unsecured ashttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98277crs6 9administrative costs are also higher for credit card lending than for other types of loans because of the large numbers of accounts and transactions see canner glenn b and charles luckett developments in the pricing of credit card services federal reserve bulletin v 78 september 1992 p 658 10see also us general accounting office us credit card industry competitive developments need to

indeed is likely to increase the size of his debtas his creditworthiness declines source federal reserve high risk premium means that credit card interest rates will be high relative to other rates 9 however one would still expect the absolute level of credit card rates to fluctuate as lenders costs go up and down this has not happened as figure 3above shows credit card rates have been not merely high but sticky they have not followed the general trends in interest rates which raise and lower lenders cost of funds if lenders interest costs go down and th eir interest revenues do not their profits will increase other things being equal the table below presents data on the profitability of credit card operations of depository institutions 10 over the period 1974 through 1996 credit card lending was the l east profitable of the four types of loans however the standard deviation of credit card profits was much greater than for other types of lending profits tend to be quite high or very low even running into negative returns this is what one would expect from any high riskhigh rewardbusiness operation volatile rate of returnhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98277crs7 11senate amendments

contrasts strikingly to the period beginning in 1983 at the end of th recession of the early 1980s and ending in 1993 before the onset of the record char geoff rates of the last few years over that 11year period credit cards average profitability was the highest of the four lending operations while the variability of returns was half that of the longer periodduring the shorter period the average intere st rate paid by credit card borrowers was stable despite downward trend in the general level of interest rates the combination of aboveaverage profits and rigid prices is unusual if above average returns are available new competitors should enter the market and bycompeting for market share drive prices down until profit levels fall into the normalrange new competitors did enter the mark et but they did not compete on price there was considerable suspicion of pricefixing in the credit card industry in 1991the senate passed measure that would have set ceiling on credit card rates 11 to most economists it seemed unlikely that anticompetitive collusion or price fixing could explain the stickiness in interest rates the credit card industryconsists of thousands of lenders 6800 in 1997 each of whom decides individually what rate to charge consumers 12 there are significant barriers tohttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98277crs8 12continued the average rate that has been inflexible some nders adjust their rates as the general level of interest rates changes while others offer lower rates to selected customers the mystery is why such lenders do not dominate the market and why competition does not force othersto emulate them 13this analysis draws heavily on canner and luckett op cit and ladermann elizabeth whats special about recent credit card problems journal of lending and credit risk management v 80 september 1997 p 2124entry it is relatively simple and inexpe nsive for any bank to become member of the visa or mastercard associations nonbank corporations like general motors andatt also issue bankcards competition is also present from other cards like searsdiscover and american expresss ultima from bank atm cards and from cards issued by merchants several explanati ons for why credit card rates did not fall have been put forward these focus on 1 par ticular historical circumstances in the development of credit card markets and with more direct relevance to the credit cardbankruptcy question 2 consumer behavior and 3 nonprice competition historical accidents number of unique histori cal circumstances have been suggested as reasons why credit card rates remained high and inflexible between1983 and 1993 13 until the early 1980s interest rates were capped by state usury ceilingsbecause of inflation credit card rates during the 1970s were generally set at the legal maximum thus there was experience of price competition basedon interest rates when the limits were removed capital expenditures related to computerization in the industry may have beenhigh in the 1980s resulting in above normal administrative costs the heavy demand for credit as the recession of 198082 ended may haveallowed lenders to increase their loan volume as much as they wished withouthaving to compete for market share banks may have overestimated the risk premium by failing to anticipate that the expansion of the 1980s would last as long as it did the risk premium for credit card loans ma have increased in tandem with the rise in bankruptcy rates shown in figure 1 above with the result that ratesheld steady as the cost of funds declined taken together these factors suggest that in normal times credit card interest rates will rise and fall as other rates do nd that recent rate rigidity does not signal failure of competition in other words th behavior of rates and profits during the 19831993 period was an anomaly that will not be repeated the evidence to date on this claim however is mixed the aver age rate declined from the 1718 range to 1516 between 1992 and 1994 but has fl uctuated very little since however other interest rates have been relatively stable since then as well other analyses ofrate rigidity focus on permanent features

16actually three reasons firm likes to cut prices and for credit card lenders it is particularly painful because lowering rat across the board reduces income from all continuedconsumer indifference to interest rate levels lawrence ausubel in 1991 article that has become touchstone fo r much subsequent research on the topic sees in the persistence of high rates and high profits failure of competition14 credit card issuers he concludes have exer cised market power behaving like monopolists despite market structure easy entry many sellers in which competitive conditionsought to prevail his explanation is ba sed upon consumer behavior users of credit cards have not acted in accordance with the assumptions that underlie economicmodels of competition in other words consumers have not res ponded to lower interest rates removing the incentive for lenders to compete on pri ce this seems paradoxical why would borrowers not flock to the lender with the lowest interest rates in his answer ausubel divides credit card applicants in to two groups one group expects to borrow and pay interest the second expects to us the card only for convenience and to pay the bill in full each month the first group is sensitive to the interest rate charged the second is not because its members do not expect to pay any interest at all why do banks not compete by lowering intere st rates to attract as many of the first group as possible there are tw reasons first people who dont mind borrowing at high interest rates are likely to be poor credit risks they may be infinancial distress they ma be consumers who are unwilling to pace their level of consumption to their incomes or they ma be financing some risky entrepreneurial project for which they cannot secure credit elsewhere lenders face an adverseselection problem if they lower interest rate s they will find themse lves with riskier pool of loans second and most important to ausubels analysis many of the second group do end up borrowing contrary to their expecta tions in consumer surveys about half of households claim that they always or nearly always pay their credit card bills in full each month banks however report that about 75 of credit card accountsincur interest charges 15 this disparity suggests that large number of credit card borrowers do not act in their selfinteres t by demanding low interest rates because 1 they do not expect ex to borrow and 2 they are unwilling to admit to themselves ex post that they are borrowing or perhaps expect their indebtedness to be shortlived these unexpecting borrowers are the credit card companies preferred customers but since they do not think of themselves as borrowers lenders cannotattract them by lowering interest rates these consumers will focus instead on such features as the annual fee charged the ngth of the grace period before interest is assessed the credit limit and various enhancements rebates frequent fliermiles and the like in sum from the lenders perspective cutting rates is counterproductive for two reasons 16httpwikileaksorgwikicrs98277crs10 16continued outstanding loans unlike say home mortgag where lower rate applies only to credit

continuedlow rates attract less reliable borrowers with the undesirable result of increasing the lending institutions credit risk exposure and the best credit risks ignore offers of lower rates this analysis runs counter to fundamental assumption about how markets work that consumers can make rational decisions in their own economic selfinterest it requires not only that many cr edit card users make an initial mistake i wont use the card to borrow but that th ey keep making essentially the same error i will pay off the whole debt this mont h and wont have to pay interest next month the notion of persistent economic irrationality on the part of large numbers of consumers which ought not to exist in conventional microeconomics may have implications for the high rate of personal bankruptcy consumer groups whoattribute bankruptcies to over aggressive marketing of credit cards often portrayconsumers as victims of forces and urges they cannot control credit counselingwhich both lenders and consumer groups fa vor does not involve just the techniques of balancing household budget but at times mimics alcoholics anonymous andother selfhelp groups that operate through catharsis and spiritual transformationfor example overspending with credit cards says the consumer federation of america is an obsession that can get out of controlif you want to see grown person cry sit in on one of my counseling sessions and watch cut up the credit cards says be tty matthews consumer credit counselor yes we do we cut them in half 17 ausubels analysis does account for the stickiness of credit card interest rates but there is another explanation for the fa ilure of consumers to demand lower rates an explanation that is consistent with the assumption of consumer rationality switching costs consumers paying interest on an unpaid credit card balance have an incentive to seek out lower rates the bigger the balance the stronger is the incentive however consumers who owe large amount on their current card and who would benefit most from lower interest rate may face switching costs asfollows if they try to open an account with credit card issuer offering lower rate that issuer will not know whether their inten tion is to refinance their existing debt or to take on additional debt as result thei r applications are more likely to be turned down in addition switching cards may i nvolve giving up favorable treatment from the present lender such as higher credit limits granted to those with good longterm repayment records from the lenders point of view the adverse selection problemagain emerges the applicants responding to offers of lower rates are likely to bethose whose debt levels are already high 18httpwikileaksorgwikicrs98277crs11 18continued loretta j mester

borrowers who think wall street journal february 20 1998 p a1the switching costs argument posits that consumers are not irrationally indifferent to high interest rates but that they face obstacles

the practice of switching accounts rapidly from one card to another to take advantage of low rates offered for some introductory period 19 to summarize each of the explanations fo r rate stickiness has problems but all imply that high rates need not signify illegal collusi on among lenders however even though lenders have sound and plausible reasons for maintaining high rates the question remains what impact those rate s have on consumer finances the next section considers the part credit card debt plays in the aggregate household debtburden household debt and access to credit cards trends in the aggregate household debt burden to family in financial trouble the amount of debt is generally more important than its composition and the amount of bt service payments required month by month is more important than the amount outstanding what has happened to the total debt burden during the ongoing surge in personal bankruptcy filings thefederal reserves latest survey of consumer

table also includes as measure of families in financial distress the percentageof families whose debt payments exceed 40 of their incomes the aggregate debt burden for all families as measured by the ratio of debt payments to total income has been essentially constant since 1989 within theincome distribution however there has been shift families with incomes below50000 devoted more of their incomes to debt payments in 1995 than in 1989 while those with incomes above 50000 devoted less this need not mean that upperincome households are reducing their aggreg ate debt levels in the case of credit card debt as will be seen below they clearly are not it may mean instead that their incomes are growing faster than their debts conversely those in the lower part of the income distribution may have experien ced either falling incomes or rising debts or both there is question in other wo rds whether these trends in the burden of debt follow from changes in the pattern of borrowing or from increasing income inequality table 3 measures of the family debt burden httpwikileaksorgwikicrs98277crs12 ratio of debt payments to income and families in financial distress 19891995 incomeaggregate

with low incomes which lack savings and other financial resources to weather economic adversity is there straw that hasbroken the camels back while the median debt burden has grown for lowincomefamilies have they gained greater access to credit cards the next section takes upthis question by returning to the issues of growth and competition in the credit card industry competition and access to credit cards to the casual observer that is to anyone with mailbox or television set it appears that credit card issuers compete rather vigorously if competition is notbased on price what form does it take in 1995 and 1996 returns on the credit card operations of banks were negative in 1997 the bad news continued there is now talk of general retrenchment in the industry 20 this development is not out of accord with economic theory which predicts that in free market excess pr ofits will be competed away lending markets in the united states have in ny case been prone to boomandbust cycles how did this happen during period when the rates charged to borrowers held steadyand when an important component of lenders costs the cost of funds to banksreflected by the general level of interest rates had fallen and remained low apossible explanation is that competition among credit card lenders took the path of lowering credit standardshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98277crs14

question of credit standards is directly related to the bankruptcy reform issue if banks in search of profits have voluntarily assumed higher credit risk by lending to those whom they would previous ly have deemed unacceptable risks their contention that lenient bankruptcy laws ar to blame for rising loan losses invites skepticism that credit card borrowing is now more widely available would seem self evident to the casual observer introduced above deluged everyday by unsolicitedoffers of credit in addition the shift of commercial banks lending business frombig corporations to small households has been one of the clearest trends in 20 th century finance21 but an expansion of credit card lending which has certainly occurred22 does not necessarily indicate decline in credit standards available data however do shed some light on the r ecent evolution of the credit card market data from the federal reserves survey of consumer finances on the percentage of families reporting credit card debt and the median dollar value of suchdebt are presented in table 5 ausubels research discussed above suggests thatcredit card debt may be significantly underre ported by survey respondents but there is reason to think that the degree of such wishful thinking by consumers should have changed markedly between 1989 and 1995 in other words the figures ought to give roughly accurate picture of the change in the incidence of credit card debt even if they understate the true percentage of households that carry such debt the first set of figures in table 5 shows steady increase in the percentage of families with credit card debt not the sa as families with credit cards looking at the breakdown by family inco the rate of increase is inversely related to the level of income the proportion of lowin come families with credit card debt has increased substantially that of highinco families has grown less or in the case of families at the top of the income scale has shown consistent pattern of growth this may be attributed to several factor s highincome families were probably more likely to have had credit card debt before 1989 so there was less room for growthin addition some families in the upper income brackets may have substituted homeequity loans where rates are lower and interest is tax deductible for credit card borrowing nonetheless the more rapid growth in the incidence of credit card debt among lowerincome families does suggest policy of extending credit to households whopreviously were denied access it is inte resting that for families with incomes below 10000 the incidence of debt grew rapidly between 1989 and 1992 but much moreslowly between 1992 and 1995 this pattern suggests typical lending cycle inwhich the volume of loans expands

reached by 1997 study by peter yoo of the federal reserve bank of st louis increases in credit card debt are largely attributable to increased average credit card debt per househol d not from more households with access to credit cards moreover househol ds in the top half of the income distribution account for most of th growth of credit card debt even though lowerincome households increased their access to credit cards andtheir average debt at faster rate th an the total population so most of the increase in credit card debt between 1983 and 1992 is attributable tohouseholds with previous credit card experience and with aboveaverageincomes not to inexperienced lowincome households 24 returning to the issue of bankruptcy refo rm the data in table 5 do not show that lowering credit standards to accommodate lowincome and other things being equal highrisk borrowers is mainly res ponsible for the growth in credit card loan volume there may have been general loosening of credit standards consistent with the cyclical nature of most lendi ng operations but there is obvious evidence that lowincome financially unsophisticated households were the specialbeneficiaries or victims these observations provide little support for thecontention of antireform groups that irresponsible greedy and reckless lendingpolicies have led to record bankruptcies summary of data and conclusion the data considered thus far the av ailable data do not provide any direct way to assess the impact of credit card lending on the rise in personal bankruptcythat began in the early 1980s we have seen that the incidence of credit card debthas increased significantly among lowerincom families and that the aggregate debt burden of such families has risen simultane ously however credit card debt does not appear to have played leading role in the growing debt burden of these families the data do not show that the median family credit card debt either as dollar figure or as the percentage of family income that debt service requires has reached level that justifies alarm credit card debt desp ite an impressive rate of growth over the past decade remains small percentage of household debt and the families with the greatest amount of debt outstanding are those with the highest incomes andconsequently the greatest ability to repay still personal bankruptcies continue to soar the conclusion must be that analyses based on aggregate average or median statistics are of limited value inidentifying the causes of personal bankr uptcy as group bankruptcy petitioners must be unrepresentative in their levels of debt or in their debtincome ratios this is surprise despite claims that the stig ma of filing bankruptcy has declined only scattered and fragmentary information
