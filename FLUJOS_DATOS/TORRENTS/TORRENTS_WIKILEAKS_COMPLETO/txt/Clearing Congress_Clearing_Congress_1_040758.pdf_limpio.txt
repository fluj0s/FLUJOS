the clearing congress lectures shoreham hotel washington dc the fact of clearing lecture given on 4 july l958 lrh enters to resounding applause thank you very much now youve got all discombobulated laughing thank you welcome to the clearing congress im glad youre here too this is really rather memorable occasion this is the first congress where we cango straight down the line and say this is how it is done these are the important facts these parts of scientology cannot be done without and the other parts we can sure forget about at this congress we can bury all of my crimes chuckle without even headstone for eight years now weve been struggling along trying to make the grade trying to keep the show on the road and trying to alter this thing called chuckle called civilization civilization that collection of gadgets which makes everybody helpless laughing and we have made an enormous amount of progress and that progress is due as much to you as to so thank you eight years ago it was pretty thin look terrible facts arose and smacked us in the face yes i have been able to handle some human beings in such way as to produce new human being otherwise i wouldnt have known about this state of being if i hadnt done it but then i tried to explain how it was done the people i explained it to were not stupid that had nothing to do with it its just that the language and selection of importances had not yet been brought to bear to communicate the subject adequately we had in book one simply more less than rather adequate description of the reactive mind the mental image picture the engram secondary and so forth we had ways to run these things but those ways were not the ways used to clear now thats very interesting that i could be guilty of an oversight to that degree and only having accomplished the fact again and communicated itsuccessfully can i bring up this much guilt i have guilt complex of course laughing and here we have here we have state of affairs where all of these materials can be communicated where the elements are found to be rather simple where the general state of affairs in telling somebody how to do it is rather easy and in addition to that in addition to that we have ways and means of changing persons viewpoint sufficiently so that he can clear somebody and that that takes some doing thats rather interesting because there are some people who start out to set somebody free that is what they think they think well ill set this fellow free then half way through the intensive they say well i dont know im not so sure should i set him free or shouldnt i well in view of the fact that im deadin my head yet he might go buzzing around or he might take over my wife or my bodyclearing course lectures 4758 1 the fact of clearing2 gee whiz he might even get down to assuming my social security card and that would be terrible and therefore therefore i dont know and at that moment you get the introduction of few minor innocent flubs little flubs they dont amount to much knock an ashtray off the desk inadvertently running help you know tell some way you couldnt possibly help anybody laughing were all guilty of it some time or another i found myself auditing somebody who has criminal record the like of which the fbi never dreamed of the fbi thinks theres such thing as criminal mind thats always big joke to theres criminal mind and theres noncriminal mind i could never figure this out theyve never shown noncriminal mind laughing its terrible thing to sayvery uncharitable but its simply comment on j edgar j edgars an awfully good guy stupid but awfully good laughing now where we have where we have human beings we have human beings chuckle now that profound statement chuckle needs little amplification what do you mean by human being well where everybody is so equal and where everybody has the idea that everybodys so crazy we get human being lets look this over lets look this over carefully lets see society which is dedicated to the proposition that all men are equal jefferson didnt say that he said that all men are created equal under law or with equal rights under law he didnt say all men were equal if you went up to tom and said tom whats this ihear about you being equal hed say to whom laugh but this proposition of superequality gets into the wheels when we get super agreement going an obsessive agreement we all have to agree with some hidden mores that we know not what of and if we dont know what this hidden standard is that were in agreement with then the only thing we can do is go into agreement with all of the things we think exist and if we think some of these things exist whether they do or not we still agree with them and we get the lowest order of philosophic concept which is everything is equal to everybody and you get the science of physics and modern civilization now where do we get the idea that anybody would be better off if he was changed if we see everybody in state of disability and superagreement with criminality and beautiful state of enturbulance where we have society that teaches people if youre genius youre crazy how do you make genius well you drive somebody crazy obviously thats what it adds up to doesnt it we get this sort of situation where everybodys idea of everybody else becomes himself lets look at that heres mr famous mr very famous fellow almost as famous as pat pending chuckle mr is certain that everybody around him is very evil and that they are gonna get him one way or the other now mr has choice if he is also saddled with superagreement obsessive agreement making equality necessity but to be this way himself now we ask this question does this evil character actually exist thats one of the first things we have to ask in clearing does this evil character exist it seems like we have synthetic personality in existence which isnt really anybody but is simply everybodys idea of how bad the other fellow is this is pretty complicated see hes got the idea that this other fellow is so bad that he cannot help but criticize him violently but because he is equal to this fellow over here then of course he himself has to assume these characteristics of superlativeclearing course lectures 4758 1 the fact of clearing3 evil you see that we get generals admirals politicians all sorts of people who have an idea that the enemy is so bad or the fellow man is so bad or something else is so bad that they cant possibly live with it and they therefore got to cut it to pieces its very tricky thing it has vast bearing on clearing they got to cut the evil being to pieces yes but at the same time they have an equality complex by communicating with him they therefore go into agreement with his evil characteristics and the only thing they have left is an evil synthetic personality which they themselves have to wear to be like everybody else and to be normal this is one of the one of the simplest and easiest tricks that is played in culture so what are you trying to do when youre clearing people youve got to find the fellow himself and you also as you go up the line not an attribute of clear but an attribute of ot have to give him certainty on the other fellow now unfortunately an auditor is senior to clear because he already has to have an idea of what the other fellow is really like once he takes scoop shovel and unburdens this personality that this fellow thinks he has to wear so if everybody in the whole society was wearing secondary synthetic useless you know some people are not imaginative enough to be evil quite remarkable chuckle takes little imagination hes wearing this coat you might say that was never anybody and he says is everybody and all you have to do is get him to take off his coat relax and be himself how do you do that the auditor lets say hes dead in his head case in terrible condition sits there and picks up all the somatics of the preclear goes to bed at night and says you know he had cognition there i wonder if thats whats wrong with laughing he has to have some kind of an idea that the other fellow that the other fellow is alright well this is quite remarkable and in the process of auditing him he sometimes gets restimulated to the point where he says maybe this fellow isnt quite that alright maybe i ought to keep him dead dumb and pat him on the face with shovel because maybe he is maybe were wrong about this the odd part of it is that person whos cleared somebody clears people isnt that interesting its very easy all you have to do in order to clear people is just clear somebodyand youll be able to clear people is there anything wrong with that yes its clearing the first one chuckle therefore major breakthrough took place when somebody else cleared somebody but myself that was an immediate major breakthrough because it showed other people that other people could do it and gave them considerable confidence now auditors have to learn individually each and every one of them that they can do it then and theyll just go on doing it it becomes very simple very simple once youve done it well trying to build up bridge to the point of where somebody would clear the first one without much confidence without much real concept of what the other fellow was really like that was the trick and thats what weve done in eight years its taken eight years to do that i apologize because thats very long period of time eight years great many things have happened in these eight years but ill point out to you that it cant be too long period of time because all during this period of time weve mostly had just one president in the united states that is if weve had one laughing thei think the beginning of this era i dont think very much was added to the various sciences i think they came out and made public the hydrogen bomb andclearing course lectures 4758 1 the fact of clearing4 that was just little more effective and efficient way of killing more people faster which i think is the basic goal of all science its at least the basic goal of governments war is that condition where you can kill the mostest with the leastest the fastest therefore the end goal of all wars is the depopulation of earth so therefore we get the end product of any government which has an impulse toward war as having people you want to go over that logic again slowly youll find out its quite sound chuckle so therefore the basic activities of the government must consist of getting rid of people well now thats not our activity we are not interested in getting rid of people we are interested in getting rid of synthetic people ever see one of these of course you have these apa graphs these nice 8 12 by 11 sheets graphs that shows blue line and so on people have begun to build up mystic quality concerning these graphs they believe this graph is something very difficult well they have to believe that because sometimes when they see their own they say hey look im not that bad and do you know its perfectly true they are not that bad do you know what that graph says that graph says this is what we call valence this is synthetic personality this is this mans belief of other men worn by himself and when it creeps along the bottom then you have to get special longleaded pencil to get it up to the bottom line you are merely reading valence but that valence really never existed it is picture of whatthis fellow thought the other fellow was like im not making any comment on that great noble triumphant subject of psychology im making comment on that subject at all well leave that for the second hour laughing well ask the ladies to leave and ill dig up my marine corps vocabulary and well work it over right now well be pure and we will merely say chuckle psychology what does it teach man man consists of that hes an animal that hes incapable of creation that he has all sorts of hidden impulses which are liable to come to the surface at any moment along with that we got psychoanalysis i pronounced it right that time laugh its the first congress i ever have and this says man is basically beast below the level of the sensor which is theonly thing which keeps him on the straight and narrow path we have this ravenous monster and if you read the books of this particular subject you are struck with this fact that the only normal sexual intercourse comes about through super education and threat of punishment chuckle and that all other sexual activities are really the order of the day and are down there in the super unconsciousreconscious mind thats quite interesting isnt it what are these people doing they are teaching people what coat they must wear to be equal and they get this shoddy messed up smeared torn tattered and battered jacket and they say put this on and youll be normal then we cant call these things sciences we can call them operations and therefore we are somewhat new on the face of earth in that we are actually trying to look at man without pitch were trying to look at man without introducing into the interpretation number of resistances to clearing him without introducing number of evil factors by which we can dam him and so perhaps we succeed but well only succeed if we carry it out across the whole broad face of earth and tear up all of these tattered smeared ideas of the other fellow and thats quite project thats quite project includes the chinese the russians the indonesians the ceylonese and the colored races in africa and psychiatristsclearing course lectures 4758 1 the fact of clearing5 chuckle includes all races matter how because as long as you have priesthoods as long as you have the racial concepts which seek to retain men into evil in order to make him good which is one of the more interesting propositions that anybodys ever heard of you still have barrier to true civilization on earth so were starting out at that point today its an interesting point to start on its its an interesting thing to come out here and say to you well were all out on top now its all finished thats all thats it thats it here we are you dont have to worry about it anymore oh this is the day we go to work do you think that the assembly of tools repairs cars it certainly doesnt only i seen some fellows particularly plumbers whocan assemble tools for very long time well ive been assembling tools for an awful long time and weve finally gotten some cars fixed but but really the basic time has been spent on the assembly of tools and thats what were covering here this is quite remarkable to have achieved this point since it was not necessarily achieved through the field of science it was not necessarily achieved solely through the field of religion it was not achieved through the field of philosophy ornithology materialism or any other particular field this has been this has been proposition of hacking through an impenetrable jungle which was simply the accumulation of several thousand years of ignorance and it was strictly hacking job you just took machete and you went to it and when we finally got down to point where there was path through the jungle and we reached cliff on the other side and saw there broad sea it was interesting but it was very simple sea we were looking at it didnt have monsters in it or anything else it was sea it was all very calm its all very nice but every time for while that we led somebody up you leading your friends up to this and you say look you see all that stuff thats jungle that doesnt have any real bearing on existence at all its just superstition and ignorance and stupidity and all that sort of thing and were gonna we want you to walk up this line of course i realize that this path is not well marked you have to look at this tree for half hour to find out whether or not theres blaze on it not well marked path but all were askingyou to do is walk up this path and go over there to look at the cliff and take look at the sea and its beautiful sight and they say oh oh not for not for very often they say this why well they know its not for the personality that theyre wearing but did anybody ever wear the personality that theyre wearing its totally an invented thing just as every barrier which exists between man and an ignorant superstitious ill warlike violent state is series of shadows these things are not real even when you run into them head on theres something wrong theyre made out of papermach or something like that its not real view but its symptom of our society that we would rather look at delusion than truth oh thats very broad statement isnt it rather look at delusion than truth theres evidence to support this ooh yes im afraid so you can show people great travelogue and they stay away from their television sets in droves but show them gunsmoke chuckle dumas senior had the idea he said he was gonna write all of history up in novel so that it was totally palatable and everybody all would find out all about history very good idea in other words if you fed them fact through delusion hed have it made its an idea but is it workable idea actually and essentially is it workable idea im afraid im afraid that truth doesnt have to be shepherded in by the ushers of superstition fearclearing course lectures 4758 1 the fact of clearing6 delusion altered clause ah im going too far there chuckle chalices incense smoke latin hymns truth doesnt have to come in this way its not absolutely necessary but we garland truth with tremendous amount of verbiage because thats the only thing that happened to truth is it became garlanded with tremendous amount of verbiage dont you see and the person who drags in this poor shattered tattered damsel called truth you know and thinks to get her on the stage at all you have to pile her up with with fir boughs and pack sacks and hula costumes or garbled it isnt necessary all you have to do is show people the possibility that truth exists and then ask them whether or not this item is true and if they find that this item is true then they willrecognize truth people do recognize truth when they see it but another little factor enters in sometimes you only get the synthetic personality to look and if only the synthetic personality is looking its primary characteristic is that it cant confront truth these are the barriers we face in clearing people these are the barriers they are not very formidable numbers of people are not very formidable but tremendous piles of lies fears and terrors can become rather formidable since i point out to you that man has not walked through these barriers for the last many thousands of years if ever in this universe so we must consider these things to be quite formidable i think its his fear alone of these things which keeps him from being able to be happy now is it possible that man is happy ifwe look if we look over any of the great seekers after truth they were all driven in the direction of search by the unhappiness of man they looked around and saw that man was not happy they found out that sick man was sick he hurt and he didnt want to hurt they looked around and saw that people were starving when they didnt want to starve and they were faced with this terrible puzzle why is it man has all these evil things and he doesnt want them of course in the philadelphia lectures i covered this many years ago that which you want in the universe you dont get and that which you dont want you of course you can have rather easily one of the little rules that goes along and you would be surprised wherethis rule enters in i found out where that entered in the other day just why that was to most people affinity is consideration of distance oh boy thats deep one isnt it think it over in other words if you like something and something is compatible and you think its fine you want it out there lrh pointing to space outside himself well if you dont want it at all where do you put it well obviously only one place you could put it would be right there pointing to the top of his headlaughing so the basic law of affinity is responsible for this condition in this universe man does not want to be unhappy he does not want to be sick and just why he is is not logical man is not doing or being really in the aggregate of things he wants to do or behes doing or being things that he must not or has to be he is being prevented from being himself one way or the other and all these shadow barriers are to him much more formidable much more solid than anything else i swear some girls idea of the evilness of marriage is much more solid to her than that wall and girl who has this idea of the terrific evilness of marriage never get married having nothing to do with marriage and you start running her on 8c she can walk through 8c she can reach over and touch the wall whyclearing course lectures 4758 1 the fact of clearing7 can she touch the wall because the walls not there and she could practically walk right straight through the wall but this idea of marriage is something that someone should never commit boy thats solidugh ugh interesting isnt it how people make the solids of their own universe the barriers of their own imprisonment man has right man definitely has right to certain happiness he isnt going to experience that right under the circumstances of his own past he cant he cant hes too wound up in this and that its not the mores of the society that prevent him its all of these delusions about how bad the other fellow is you have police because other people are so bad i investigated the police one time i became cop thats the best way to investigatesomething become it for while you know you can go too far with that sort of thing laughing but where do we have where do we have in essence here cave into the societywhat could cave society in well all you have to do is have police force and society would start caving in the police force constitute constant reminder that men are evil which is constant reminder that we must agree with these evil men you see how this would work neat little trick now that doesnt say that we are so starryeyed as to believe that at this time we could dispense with all police or could we now you have to make up your mind which way you are going to go with the society if youre thinking about new society of one kind or anotherand if you say well this society would be totally unregulated then we would be proposing an anarchy and all the anarchists tell us that the only way society would work as total freedom without the government would be if everyone in it were perfect i dont know whether we propose when we talk about cleared society whether wed propose or not to have an anarchy thats beside the point thats up to the people who get cleared but i dont think youd wind up with an anarchy i think youd wind up with much finer level of agreement and cooperation because i think youd then be able to realize the rest of the dynamics the cops are there only because the rest of the dynamics arent there so if you put those back into society then youd get society the idea of police officer of the state of being of the criminal is one of the more interesting studies you wouldnt believe this study unless youd been cop for while you wouldnt believe this i had hardened criminals walk into horrible bar crammed into the back between two cockroach dens you know hardened criminals cop killers you know they come in i pat em on the back have drink boys mind the peace they would cop yelling cop thats fakei looked like cop i was wearing cops uniform little different cops see couple of these guys come in and they say hmmm evil beings what are you people doing here next thing you know why the nightclub starts to whirl chairs start to go down with crash the proprietor is very unhappy and war has commenced well i think there are certain things that you can appeal to in men definitely certain things that you can appeal to in men which make them more or less revert to their basic selves they take off their coats in other words thats very thin principle it has occasionally worked and theres one religion which is based exclusively on that principle that if you can reach the soul or being of person just ppanng when he becomes well youve got it made that religion i dont know if youve heard of them or not its calledclearing course lectures 4758 1 the fact of clearing8 christianity chuckle all you have to do is appeal to as some of their various organizations have said the christ spirit of man oh i dont know about the christ spirit but if you appeal to the basic man why you get somewhere and sometimes you have to appeal and appeal and appeal and appeal laughing and after youve duplicated the auditing question enough times youve gotten there quite amusing quite amusing to look over look over the number of struggles we have had to find out the few things we have to know but i suppose when youre climbing over barricades why youre liable to get your clothes covered with creosote now and then and when youre smashing down jungle plants youre certainly going to get splattered with little chlorophyll and you carry it long for alittle while until you take bath and you say what do you know ive gone all the way through this jungle and theres just one little piece of stuff here thats the only piece of stuff and we went through eight miles of jungle and swamp and so forth and we find only this little piece of stuff duplication duplication gee chuckle you know and then you promptly forget about the eight miles of swamp and jungle and so forth you promptly forget all about that then you say to someone else you see they havent been through it you come up to them and say to them hey look at this duplication and they say yeah what about it you say well see all those eight miles of swamp theyre not true theyre not true they say theyre not theyre in over their heads in quicksand someones lying to yousay duplication is important but i say mud is and so we get the birth of science mud chuckle now wherever we look in society as it struggles along it picks up arbitraries with which to bolster up hidden ideal that is never expressed we get these arbitraries piling up piling up laws customs everybody forgets what theyre supposed to prevent and at last we have this mass which simply has one common denominator prevent and when you have person totally prevented you have human being but what would you really have if you had somebody who was totally prevented youd have somebody who couldnt help and who couldnt reach out on the rest of the dynamics and so couldnt have civilization because youcouldnt have third dynamic could you thats as easy as this in other words this system of preventing everything in order to bring out good civilization succeeds in killing the thing it was supposed to bring out right so there must be another way and better way and that way we have today in scientology in our in our walkings along the line weve gone through many vicissitudes theres hardly one of us present myself included who hasnt been human somewhere along these last right years these were not lapses from grace however these were repetitions of habit chuckle and its little bit hard to make it all the way but the funny part of it is that somebody who simply starts along this road would just get started along this road and sayslook there are few truths had astonishing things happen to them remember the old article dianetics evolution of science if more people got hold of that article and read it and all of sudden got well boom here was an odd phenomenon i know of three separate cases that got hold of that article in hospital bed and read it got up called for their clothes left and havent had recurrence years afterwards now the simple idea that there is way out or that there is truth or that truth can be realizedclearing course lectures 4758 1 the fact of clearing9 that itself is tremendously potent force so for those elements in society which are trying to kill all truth that would be the first thing to attack the fact that there might be road out ummm road out there you are in the middle of the swamp jungle chuckle and there youre gonna stay everybody who tells you there is road out must perforce by definition be faker and quack which is almost direct quote of the better business bureau brochure on curing anything they say you always know faker if he tells you he can cure something think that over for moment thats direct quote out of the better business bureau literature you get the state favoring favoring very strongly only those persons and elements which use which well talk about later in this congress which use violence and which seeks to bury people in they cannot ever believe that there is road out and you know the society is so sure of itself that it has everybody trapped right there in the mud that theyve forgotten to pay the guards and theyve all left thats right its an amazing thing theres guards on the stockade any more only everybody thinks there are before you suddenly tell them to pick their head up little bit and see if they see the glint on rifle barrel any place or reach out there and see if they really feel any barbed wire or walk over this way to see if they really do fall in any quicksand and its with great amazement that somebody will take this delicatetiny step well i dont know and we get the phenomenon of dianeticsevolution of science yanking people out of hospital beds we just made them look up and feel around here to see if there were any barriers anymore if the guards were still on duty and they arent in other words nearly every barrier we have and nearly every duress that man has experienced that kept him in an aberrated state is practically unenforced today we have more inquisition we have skygarbled we have more arrests because of religious beliefs in this country you know it was amazing first it went this way over in europe for while all you had to do was have bible read in your house to be burned at the stake you know it was just that bad thats all you had to do or you appeared in field and listened to preacher and finger snap you had it right then dragged the body right off andmounted it up they were very interesting about this we think of people being burned at the stake they didnt just burn them at the stake you know that they very often took ice and packed in their heart and face so that they would live longer while they were burning these were nice people these were good people they were painfully good now these people who were doing this sort of thing of course thought that this was the right thing to do that they were being the best possible people in the best possible world doing this sort of thing and these fellows who were listening to preacher in field or cracking bible in the house or something like that they thought these people were being very very evil because they were breaking through barriers that they knew by experience were tremendously necessary to thecontinued existence of the society at large and so they gave these punishments but these sort of things arent done anymore they do it in cruel little ways little tiny ways they take some industrialist of some place or another that was trying to get on fine with the politicos you know and this industrialist hardly reads or writes but hes good guy he makes all sorts of things and so on and the politicos say well hes harmless and i exchanged few presents and few thingsclearing course lectures 4758 1 the fact of clearing10 like that all of sudden this becomes major crime well theres great deal of hope for country where that becomes major crime chuckle now does this mean then that we are favored by the time and place of the emergence of scientology yes we are definitely favored we only have to walk slight tightrope there are few people around who say oh and theres some laws that say that you mustnt heal anybody of anything and so on people dont take them terribly seriously anymore and if you pay the least little bit of lip service to this sort of thing why you go right straight through england by the way is freer than the united states on this line you can say youre gonna heal somebody go ahead and heal somebody over there and nobody screamsin the united states you say well were going to were going to prevent his being sick or something like that chuckle but were not up against tremendously violent environment at this time and therefore there is every reason to believe that what we know can bloom and grow and can spread and communicate we are also favored by the fact that the world at time previous has had more communication channels there are tremendous communication channels in existence today what theyre being used for is quite something else but that they exist is certainly the case for instance its only been the last couple of decades you can pick up the phone and call almost anybody you wanted to in the world and it certainly has only been inthe last decade that most people in the western nations began to have television sets i understand that more people have television sets in russia even than they have shoes that might be some of john foster dulless problem and the system but theres some possibility of it being true heres rather favored time heres rather favored time for all this to happen because although nobodys going to say keep em all in the mud and nobodys going tremendously to object if you start lifting few people out of the mire and if you start lifting everybody out of the mire nobodys really going to object as i say the police are off the stockade now is there any other thing that makes this favored time well its the fact that man might ceaseto exist almost in his entirety this factor operates however not as preventer but as catalyst to doing what were trying to do and this catalyst is of course the threatened presence of war atomic fission that sort of thing man can do such thorough job on wiping out man now that we actually should put little bit of speed on the ball so i could say off hand that were probably just little bit late maybe even eight years late people used to come romping into the foundation and they used to say where are all the clears i dont know what they expected in truth if i just point down to an empty space in the air of the hall and say theres one now laughing we probably would have started great religious revival in america chuckle but it wouldnt have been based on any truth so itwouldnt have been any good nevertheless it is fitting here in this first hour of this clearing congress that we point up the fact that there is such thing as clear that were doing this all over the world there are as many or more clears now in england than in the united states clears are appearing down in south africa the various you might say field offices are doing very very fine angeles is doing beautiful job new york is just getting under way i wish few of you people up there around new york would go in and get yourselfclearing course lectures 4758 1 the fact of clearing11 clear so we could say to all these clears from new york as matter of fact there are none at this time but that should be expected new york being new york chuckle and the job thats being done on this is tremendous its gorgeous piece of work thats being done the world around and much of this work now get that is being done on indifferent communication lines somebody flew in the other day from new zealand he said were doing something wrong were not getting any clears doing something wrong he came all the way from new zealand to spend the day and then go home again and sure enough they were doing something wrong they were running help something on the basis of tell way people are never helped anywhere and they had an emeter that theywere trying to check people out on that didnt work and they had to come all the way back here to find out the emeter didnt work but they got these points on clearing technique straightened out they got the emeter straightened out he got little bit of subjective reality on couple of the processes he went back home and within sixty hours of his arrival at home he sent cable made my first clear new zealand well the point im making here the point im making here is this is happening all over the world it is happening very successfully and we do have clears we have got show on the road and you are here and we also have congress do we thank you end of lecture
