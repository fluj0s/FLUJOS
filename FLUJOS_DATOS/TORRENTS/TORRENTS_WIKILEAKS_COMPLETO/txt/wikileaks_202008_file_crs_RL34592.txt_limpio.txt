conversion crs11 factor the law specifies formula for calculating the annual update to the conversion factors this formula would have resulted in 101 cut effective january 1 2009 however section 101 of the mmsea increased the update to the conversion factor for medicare physician payment by 05 compared with 2007 rates for the first six months of 2008 the update formula would have required
