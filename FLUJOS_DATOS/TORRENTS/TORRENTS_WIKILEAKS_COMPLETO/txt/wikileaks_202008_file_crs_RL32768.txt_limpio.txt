march 16 2006 nonna noto specialist in public finance government and finance division congressional research service the library of congress estate and gift tax revenues several measurements summary the question of whether to permanently repeal the federal estate tax or to retain but alter it remains topic of congressional interest this report presents variety of data measuring the payment of estate and gift taxes to help inform the debate the most recent irs data are for estate tax returns filed in 2004 they show that the 3494 gross estates of 5 million or higher accounted for just 014 of decedents and 116 of taxable returns but 613 of estate taxes paid the 30276 taxable estate tax returns filed in 2004 represented 124 of deaths the tax rate on estates of 5 million up to 20 million averaged 29 of the gross estate this is period of changing estate tax laws the taxpayer relief act of 1997 tra pl 10534 provided for gradual increase in the exempt amount under the estate tax from 600000 for 1997 to 1 million in 2006 the economic growth and tax relief reconciliation act of 2001 egtrra pl 10716 superseded those changes and raised the exempt amount to 1 million for 2002 and 2003 15 million for 2004 and 2005 2 million for 2006 through 2008 and 35 million for 2009 egtrra repealed the estate tax entirely for 2010 but the law sunsets on december 31 2010 unless new legislation governing the estate tax is enacted the estate tax will be reinstated in 2011 with an exempt amount of 1 million from 1998 through 2004 taxable estates as percentage of deaths remained relatively constant in the three highest gross estate classes over 5 million the rising exempt amount eliminated large number of smaller estates from 600000 up to 1 million in gross size from being taxable in fy2005 estate and gift tax revenues of 248 billion represented 11 of total federal revenue and 27 of individual income tax revenue cbo has estimated estate and gift tax revenues from fy2006 through fy2016 under current law annual revenues are projected to be 28 billion in fy2006 reach 29 billion in fy2009 and then drop to 22 billion in fy2010 and 20 billion in fy2012 if the estate tax returns in

have estimated revenue losses through fy2016 from congress acting in 2006 to permanently repeal the estate and generationskipping transfer taxes and modify gift taxes starting in 2010 for the years prior to fy2011 both sources predict modest revenue losses resulting from older people paying fewer gift taxes and fewer income taxes on capital gains in anticipation of repeal after repeal treasury

and gift tax revenues several measurements the question of whether to permanently repeal the federal estate tax or to retain but alter it remains before the 109th congress this report presents variety of data available about revenues collected from federal estate and gift taxes to provide background material for the debate the text discusses the numbers presented in 12 tables the first section of the report presents the most recent distributional data available from the internal revenue service irs for estate tax returns filed in 2004 it shows the amount of estate tax paid by each of five categories of size of gross estate both separately table 1 and cumulatively table 2 it also presents the average size of gross estate the average estate taxes paid and the average tax rate as percentage of the gross estate for each of the five size categories table 3 the second section of the report describes the substantial increases in the applicable exclusion amount or exempt amount under the estate tax scheduled from 1997 through 2009 the repeal of the estate tax scheduled for 2010 and the reinstatement of the estate tax with lower exclusion amount in 2011 if changes are made to current law it also presents the scheduled decrease in the maximum marginal estate tax rate table 4 the third section of the report examines the relationship between the increase in the applicable exclusion amount or filing threshold and the number of estate tax returns that were filed and taxable as well as the total amount of tax paid from 1998 through 2004 table 5 it traces the differing patterns of the number of taxable returns by size of gross estate in both absolute numbers table 6 and measured as percentage of deaths table 7 the fourth section reveals that less than half of all estate tax returns filed from 1998 through 2004 were taxable table 8 the percentage of taxable returns was higher the larger the gross estate size class there was large drop in the percentage of returns that were taxable within each size class between 1998 and 2004 the fifth section of the report presents data on actual estate and gift tax revenues collected from fy1999 through 2005 comparing them to total federal revenues and to revenues from individual income taxes table 9 gift taxes as percent of combined estate and gift tax revenues fell sharply after egtrra was enacted table 10 the fifth section also presents the january 2006 congressional budget office cbo projection of revenues from estate and gift taxes from fy2006 through fy2016 under current law table 11 finally it presents estimates published by the treasury department in february 2006 and the joint committee on taxation in march 2006 of revenue losses from fy2006 through fy2016 if the sunset provision crs2 of egtrra were removed in 2006 thereby permanently repealing the estate tax and generationskipping transfer taxes and modifying the gift tax effective in 2010 table 12 distribution of estate tax payments in 2004 by size of gross estate the estate tax is considered the most progressive part of the us tax system that is the tax that falls most heavily on the wealthiest members of society the distribution of estate tax payments is highly concentrated in the largest gross estate size categories estate tax returns filed in 2004 paid total of 215 billion in estate taxes as shown in the first row third

column 2 column 4 column 3 divided by column 2 increases in the applicable exclusion amount the period from 1997 through 2011 marks time of changes in the estate tax laws brought about by the taxpayer relief act of 1997 tra pl 10534 and the economic growth and tax relief reconciliation act of 2001 egtrra pl 107 16 in particular these two laws provided for increases in the applicable exclusion amount under the estate tax as shown in the first column of table 4 egtrra also provided for gradual decrease in the maximum marginal estate tax rate as shown in the second column of table 42 the applicable exclusion amount has two important implications first federal estate tax return must be filed if us decedents gross assets3 equal or exceed the applicable exclusion amount for the year of the decedents death that is why the applicable exclusion amount is sometimes called the tax filing 2 taxable estate values below the maximum cutoff are subject to table of graduated marginal tax rates starting at 18 for the first 10000 the lower range of marginal rates is incorporated in the unified credit consequently taxpayers are only likely to pay attention to the marginal rate that applies above the applicable exclusion amount 3 including taxable gifts given during the donors lifetime crs5 threshold second each estate tax return receives unified transfer tax credit equal to the tax that would be due on the applicable exclusion amount4 thus the transfer of an amount of assets up to the applicable exclusion amount is free from federal tax for every estate egtrra referred to the applicable exclusion amount as the unified credit effective exemption amount it is sometimes called the exempt amount for short the applicable exclusion amount is not indexed for inflation nor is it set with an explicit target of taxing only certain percentage of the population for example the wealthiest one or two percent instead congress has intermittently changed the dollar amount from 1987 through1997 the applicable exclusion amount remained at 600000 under provisions of the economic recovery tax of 1981 erta pl 9734 the taxpayer relief act of 1997 tra pl 10534 phased in relatively gradual increase in the applicable exclusion amount from 600000 in 1997 to 1000000 in 2006 the applicable exclusion amount rose to 625000 in 1998 650000 in 1999 and 675000 for 2000 and 20015 in addition the taxpayer relief act provided for the applicable exclusion amount to increase to 700000 for 2002 and 2003 850000 for 2004 950000 for 2005 and 1 million for 2006 and beyond however before the provisions of tra were fully phased in they were superseded for tax years 20022010 by the provisions of the economic growth and tax relief reconciliation act of 2001 egtrra pl 10716 egtrra raised the applicable exclusion amount to 1 million beginning immediately in 2002 and 2003 it increased the exclusion in large increments to 15 million for 2004 and 2005 2 million for 20062008 and 35 million in 2009 it repealed the estate tax and generationskipping transfer tax entirely for the estates of decedents dying in 2010 but the provisions of egtrra will sunset on december 31 2010 unless new legislation governing the estate tax is enacted beforehand in 2011 the law will revert to that in effect prior to june 7 2001 the estate tax will be reinstated with an applicable exclusion amount of 1 million the amount that tra had provided for 2006 and beyond and the familyowned business deduction will be reinstated 4 the unified credit is applied against both estate and gift tax obligations 5 the taxpayer relief act also created new exclusion from the estate tax for qualified familyowned businesses that was in effect from 1998 through 2003 the exclusion was limited to total of 1300000 in combination with the applicable exclusion amount the familyowned business exclusion was converted to deduction by the internal revenue service restructuring and reform act of 1998 pl 105206 under egtrra the family owned business deduction was repealed in 2004 when the applicable exclusion amount for all estates was increased to 1500000 for more information see crs report 95444 history of

relief reconciliation act of 2001 egtrra pl 10716 d the revenue act of 1987 pl 100203 provided for 5 surtax to offset the benefits of both the graduated tax rates on taxable estate values below 3 million and the unified credit or applicable exclusion amount such that the effective rate of tax on the entire estate was 55 as the result of clerical error in the final text of tra of 1997 later adopted by congress the surtax was intended to offset the benefits of only the graduated tax rates and not the unified credit relationship between the filing threshold and the number of taxable returns the tax law that applies to an estate is the law in effect in the year of the persons death6 however the estate tax return is not due until nine months after the 6 assets are typically valued at their fair market value as of the date of death however they may be valued as of the alternate valuation date six months after the date of death or the date of distribution of the property from the estate if earlier the alternate valuation date might be elected by the executor if the assets have lower value on that later date for more information see crs report 95416 federal estate gift and generationskipping taxes continued crs7 persons death and an extension of six months is not uncommon as consequence estate tax returns filed in given year are most likely to reflect the tax law in effect in the preceding year it has been estimated that of the estate tax returns filed for decedents dying in given calendar year roughly 5 are filed in the same calendar year 75 to 80 in the next year and the remaining 15 to 20 in later years7 it follows that estate tax returns filed in any given calendar year will include few returns of people who died in that year mostly the returns of people who died in the previous year and some returns from deaths in prior years that are filing under an extension8 the applicable exclusion amount or tax filing threshold may well differ among the years represented for each filing year from 1998 to 2004 the second column of table 5 shows the applicable exclusion amount for both the prior year top number and current year bottom number for example estate tax returns filed in 2001 will generally reflect filing threshold of 675000 the threshold in effect for both 2000 and 2001 in contrast estate tax returns filed in 2002 will include mainly the returns of decedents that fall under 2001 law when the threshold was 675000 as well as some under 2002 law when the effective filing threshold was 1 million estate tax returns filed in 2003 will generally reflect filing threshold of 1 million the law in effect for both 2002 and 2003 estate tax returns filed in 2004 will generally reflect the 1 million threshold in effect for 2002 and 2003 but also some under the 15 million threshold in effect for 2004 an increase in the applicable exclusion amount would be expected to reduce the number of estate tax returns filed the number of returns that were taxable and the amount of estate tax paid relative to what they would otherwise be whether these numbers decline absolutely depends in large part on whether the increase in the exclusion amount outpaces the growth in the value of assets held by decedents as shown in table 5 even as the filing threshold was increasing in annual increments of 25000 from 600000 in 1997 to 625000 in 1998 650000 in 1999 and 675000 in 2000 the number of estate tax returns filed and the number of taxable returns continued to rise the increasing pattern holds whether measured as absolute number of returns or as tax returns as percentage of deaths in the prior year reflecting the ninemonth grace period for filing returns this suggests that asset values were generally rising more rapidly than the filing threshold over the 19972000 period the number of estate tax returns filed rose from 97856 or 423 of deaths in 1998 to 108322 or 453 of deaths in 2000 the number of taxable estates rose from 47475 or 205 of deaths in 1998 to 51999 or 217 of deaths in 2000 6 continued description of current law by john r luckey 7 david joulfaian estate taxes and charitable bequests evidence from two tax regimes unpublished research paper dec 2004 p 10 8 complex returns may be granted an extension longer than six months crs8 the numbers barely dipped in 2001 when the 675000 filing threshold was fully phased in this suggests that the filing threshold had caught up with the growth in asset values but the number of returns filed dropped by 9 between 2001 and 2002 when the filing threshold increased by much larger step from 675000 to 1 million the number dropped by noteworthy 33 in 2003 when the million dollar threshold was fully phased in this suggests that at the 1 million level the tax filing threshold had moved ahead of the value of assets held by decedents in 2002 between 2003 and 2004 the number of returns filed dropped by just 5 as the higher 15 million filing threshold began to take effect between 2001 and 2003 both the total number of returns filed and the number of taxable returns fell by approximately 40 the total number of returns filed fell from 108112 to 66042 or from 450 of deaths to 270 of deaths the number of taxable returns fell from 51842 to 30626 or from 216 to 125 of deaths some of this decrease was caused by decline in asset values in addition to the large increases in the tax filing threshold from 675000 in 2000 and 2001 to 1 million in 2002 and 2003 the last column of table 5 shows that the total estate tax paid generally moved in the same direction as the number of taxable returns with both rising from 1998 to 2000 and falling from 2000 to 2003 in percentage terms the total estate tax paid rose more than the number of taxable returns from 1998 to 2000 20 increase in taxes compared with 10 increase in the number of taxable returns but dropped less than the number of taxable returns from 2000 to 2003 15 decrease in taxes compared with 41 decrease in taxable returns net estate tax paid increased slightly from 207 billion in 2003 to 215 billion in 2004 reflecting the legislated decline in state death

2004 is traceable to the three smallest size categories under 5 million the first row of table 7 shows how the increase in the tax filing threshold reduced the number of taxable estates measured as percentage of deaths in the 600000 to 1 million size of gross estate class at first gradually from 1998 to 2001 and then markedly in 2002 and completely in 2003 and 200411 the second row of table 7 shows how the number 10 this percentage is sometimes expressed relative to the number of adult deaths in the previous year the number of adult deaths age 20 and over plus deaths for which age is unavailable was 976978 of all deaths for the years 1997 to 2002 consequently using total deaths instead of adult deaths as the denominator does not make much difference in the percentage 11 some estate tax returns are filed several years after the decedents death in its publicly released data for returns filed in given year the irs excludes those late returns for which the gross value of the estate was less than the filing threshold in effect for the prior calendar year in 2003 for example 6498 returns were filed with from 675000 up to 1 million in gross assets of which 2365 were taxable these returns are not included in the publicly released data for returns filed in 2003 this practice somewhat understates the total number of returns filed the number of taxable returns filed and the amount of tax paid by the 600000 to 1 million gross estate size class for the 19982004 period examined in this report but it gives closer picture of what is occurring under the tax laws most pertinent continued crs11 of taxable estates in the 1 million to 25 million size class grew from 1998 to 2001 reflecting growth in asset holdings and more than offsetting the decline in the lowest size class by the 2002 and 2003 filing years however the increase in the tax filing threshold to 1 million and the decline in asset values had started to reduce the number of taxable returns in the 1 million to 25 million size class the downward trend in this size class continued in 2004 as the 15 million threshold began to take effect the combined losses in the two smallest size classes under 25 million caused most of the drop in the total from 2001 to 2002 and all of the drop from 2002 to 2004 the number of taxable returns in the 25 million to 5 million class rose from 1998 to 2000 fell in 2001 and 2002 but rose back to its 2001 level in 2003 and 2004 row 3 reflecting fluctuations in net asset values in contrast there was noteworthy stability in the number of taxable estate tax returns as percentage of deaths in the three largest size classes for all but one of the six years examined estates in the 5 million to 10 million range represented 09 of deaths row 4 and estates in the 10 million to 20

included as long as the gross assets in the estate exceed the filing threshold in effect for the year prior to filing irs excludes from its tabulations returns filed that were not required to be filed because gross assets were below the filing threshold in effect for the year of death crs12 the tax filing threshold has increased to 15 million in 20042005 and 2 million for 20062008 the numbers presented in tables 1 and 2 in the first section suggest that these increases can be expected to dramatically decrease the number of tax returns required to be filed and the number of returns that are taxable from 2005 to 2009 through their effect on the 1 million to 25 million size class the decline in estate tax revenues should be less than proportional to the decline in the number of taxable returns the scheduled further increase in the filing threshold to 35 million in 2009 is likely to moderately reduce the number of returns filed and taxable in the 25 million to 5 million class between 2009 to 2010 unless it is offset by major increase in asset values less than half of estate tax returns were taxable many estates face the administrative burden of filing an estate tax return even though they owe estate tax just under half of estate tax returns filed each year from 1998 through 2004 were taxable overall the percentage of total returns filed that were taxable dipped slightly from 485 in 1998 to 480 in 19992001 to 451 in 2002 and then rose slightly to 464 in 2003 and 483 in 2004 as shown in the first row of table 8 compare this with the percentage of individual income tax

tax filing threshold the applicable exclusion amount are required to file an estate tax return but are likely to owe little or tax for tax returns filed in 2004 when the prevailing threshold was 1

the percentage of taxable returns fell 138 points from 839 to 701 the percentage taxable also fell by from 85 to 120 percentage points for the four size categories from 1 million to 20 million the previously large 600000 to 1 million class with the lowest rate of taxability 354 in 2002 was eliminated by the rise in the tax filing threshold to 1 million and then 15 million its removal from the

from both estate and gift taxes and reported by fiscal year rather than calendar year it looks back on actual data for fys 19982005 and forward to projections through fy2016 because of the ninemonth grace period for filing estate tax returns the revenues for particular fiscal year are most likely to reflect the tax laws in effect for the prior numbered calendar year for example revenues collected during fy2005 which ran from october 1 2004 until september 30 2005 are most likely to reflect the estate and gift tax laws in effect during calendar year 2004 recent experience revenues from federal estate and gift taxes peaked at 290 billion in fy2000 as shown in column 1 of table 9 revenues then began falling in part as result of changes in the tax law described previously which substantially raised the crs14 applicable exclusion amount and modestly lowered the maximum tax rate and in part because of decline in asset values between fy2000 and fy2003 estate and gift tax revenues fell by 7 billion or 24 from 290 billion to 220 billion in fy2004 reflecting recovery in asset values revenues rose by 13 back to 248 billion where they remained in fy2005 estate and gift taxes contribute small share of total federal revenues measured relative to other federal revenue sources estate and gift tax revenues peaked in fy1999 at 15 of total receipts column 2 of table 9 and 32 of individual income

gift taxes percentage calculations by crs gift taxes versus estate taxes the gift tax is levied on the taxable transfer of assets during the donors lifetime the gift tax is due by april 15th of the year after the gift is made under the taxpayer relief act of 1997 tra the applicable exclusion amount for lifetime taxable gifts plus bequests rose from 600000 in 1997 to 675000 million in 2001 the same graduated tax rate structure that applied to estates applied to gifts above the exclusion amount on cumulative lifetime basis however under the economic crs15 growth and tax relief reconciliation act of 2001 egtrra the exclusion amount for lifetime gifts is scheduled to remain at 1 million even as the applicable exclusion amount rises to 35 million by 200913 furthermore the gift tax is scheduled to remain in effect when the estate tax is repealed in 2010 the maximum gift tax rate will be capped at 35 equal to the maximum individual income tax rate on taxable transfers over 500000 through fy2001 gift taxes accounted for significant percentage of estate and gift tax revenues however since the adoption of the economic growth and tax relief reconciliation act egtrra in 2001 with its announcement of estate tax repeal in 2010 there has been substantial decline in the revenue collected from gift taxes the last column of table 10 shows that gift taxes accounted for 14 to 17 of combined estate and gift tax revenues over the fy1998fy2001 period however over the fy2002fy2004 period gift taxes accounted for only 6 to 9 of combined estate and gift tax revenues gift tax revenues fell by more than half from the range of 33 to 47 billion per year in fy1998fy2001 down to the range of 14 to 19 billion in fy2002fy2004 column 2 of table 10 forecasters predict that gift tax revenues will remain low in the years remaining prior to fy2011 and will be higher in fy2011 reflecting gifts made in 2010 before the return of the estate tax in 2011 13 under the gift tax there is an annual exclusion per donor per donee this exclusion amount is indexed for inflation and rounded down to the nearest 1000 the exclusion was 11000 in 2005 and is 12000 in 2006 there is an unlimited exclusion

from permanent repeal among its revenue proposals for fy2007 the bush administration once again proposed to permanently extend the provisions of egtrra that are scheduled to sunset on december 31 2010 egtrras extension would make permanent the modifications to the gift tax and the repeal of both the estate tax and the generation skipping transfer tax now due to take effect for 2010 only in february 2006 the treasury department published its estimates of changes in federal receipts expected each year from fy2006 through fy2016 if legislation to repeal the sunset provision of egtrra with respect to the estate and gift taxes were enacted in 2006 to become effective in 2011 the joint committee on taxation jct released its estimates in march 2006 both sets of estimates are presented in table 12 crs18 the relatively modest estimated revenue losses from fy2006 through fy2010 stem primarily from projected decline in gift tax revenues the estimates are based on the assumption that taxpayers would immediately begin to reduce taxable gifts during their lifetimes if they knew that the estate tax would be permanently repealed in 2010 in addition the treasury department projected that the enactment in 2006 of permanent repeal of the estate tax effective in 2010 would modestly affect revenues from the individual income tax in two different ways first treasury assumes that lifetime charitable donations and accompanying tax deductions would fall thereby increasing income tax revenues second and larger in effect it assumes that capital gains realizations by the elderly would fall thereby decreasing income tax revenues for all but one year in the forecast period fy2006fy2011 treasury projects that net reductions in income taxes would add to the decrease in revenues from gift taxes14 these negative effects on gift and income tax revenues are expected to continue from fy2011 onward if the estate tax is permanently repealed jct assumes further that following estate tax repeal some deductions that would otherwise have been claimed on the estate tax return will instead be claimed on the last income tax return of the decedent thereby reducing income tax revenues this could include deductions for endoflife medical expenses and estate administration expenses the expected accompanying losses in income tax revenues are reflected in the fact that each year from fy2010 on the total revenue losses projected by both treasury and jct from permanent repeal of the estate tax shown in table 12 exceed cbos estimates of estate and gift tax revenues under current law shown in table 11 for the years prior to full repeal of the estate tax the treasury department estimated revenue losses ranging from 11 billion in fy2007 to 27 billion in fy2010 fy2011 reflects period of transition from estate taxes for decedents dying in 2009 to estate taxes in 2010 and beyond for fy2011 treasury estimated revenue loss of 238 billion for the years reflecting full repeal of the estate tax treasury estimated revenue loss of 531 billion for fy2012 rising annually to 703 billion in fy2016 the fiveyear revenue loss estimate for fy2007fy2011 is 314 billion the 10year revenue loss estimate for fy2007fy2016 is 3390 billion 14 these conclusions are based on comparison of two sets of revenue change estimates for fy2006fy2011 published in the us budget for fy2007 see us executive office of the president office of management and budget analytical perspectives budget of the united states government fiscal year 2007 washington gpo 2006 table 173 p 265 and table 174 p 269

of this report in contrast the estimates in table 174 receipts by source for proposed legislation under estate and gift taxes include only the effects on estate and gift tax receipts the difference between the two series indicates the estimated effects of changes in income tax revenues crs19 the jcts estimates of revenue losses are lower than the treasurys for the years prior to total repeal fy2010 and earlier but larger than the treasurys for the subsequent years reflecting total repeal this reflects differences in their assumptions about the baseline as well as behavioral responses the
