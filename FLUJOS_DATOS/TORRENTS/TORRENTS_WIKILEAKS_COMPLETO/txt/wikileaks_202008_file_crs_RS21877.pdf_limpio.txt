nations other than import commerce bu t that broad mandate contains an exception for otherwiseimmunized conduct that 1 has direct substantial and reasonably foreseeable effect on the us market us import trade or commerce or us exporters and 2 such effect gives rise to claim under the sherman act 4 the ftaia language and the legislative history that produced it have been inconsistently interpreted by various federal courts of appeals in den horske stats oljeselskap as v heeremac vof for example the us court of appeals for the fifth circuit held that ftaia did not authorize suit in us courts by norwegian oil company asserting that it had been overcharged for heavylift barge services in the north sea even though global antitrust conspiracy among providers of oil platform services had resulted in inflated prices including pri ces in the united states for those services5 statoil has sufficiently alleged that the defendants conduct that is the agreement among heavylift service providers to divide territory rig bids and fix prices had direct substantial and reasonably foreseeabl effect on the united states market the agreement compelled americans to pay s upracompetitive prices for oil these allegations are sufficient to satisfy the first requirement of the ftaia but statoil fails to show that this effect in any way gives rise to its antitrust claim6 the us court of appeals for the s econd circuit on the other hand found that ftaia did sanction the use of us courts by nonus person to pursue an antitrust claim where the defendants conduct adversely impacted us comme rce notwithstanding that the adverse effect on domestic commerce was not the basis for plaintiffs injury7 opting for an interpretation of ftaia that focuses on the acts deterrent effect on violations of us antitrust law as had the dissent in den norske in the fifth circuit the second circuit ruled that our markets suffer when the foreign scheme is not deterred because the domestic

report at 10 the damage provision in the antitrust law is found at 15 usc 15scheme course of conduct in the unite d states would aff ect all purchasers of the target products or services whethe r the purchaser is foreign or domestic8 the empagran case foreign plaintiffs who claimed that global cartel to fix vitamin prices sufficiently affected the prices they paid for vitamins purchased abroad to bring their claim within the ftaia exception see the argument accepted by the second circuit in kruman v christies supra were not successful at the district court level plaintiffs argue that congress intended only to limit recovery under the ftaia to conduct that had some domestic effect nd that it did not intend to limit the courts jurisdiction to cases where plaintiffs injuries involved those domestic effects plaintiffs may indeed have remedy against these defendants abroad however the issue here is not whether these defendants are in fact guilty of the conduct alleged but whether this court has jurisdiction over these plaintiffs claims9 that critical question was answered by the district court in the negative moreover as the court noted there is not yet any customary international law of antitrust that was violated by defendants conduct10 reversing the us court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit held that it is sufficient for ftaia purposes if the an ticompetitive conduct violat the sherman act and the conducts harmful effect on united states commerce gives rise to claim by someone even if not the foreign plaintiff who is before the court11 the fifth circuits view in den norske was overly rigid the court stat ed but the second circuits opinion in kruman v christies seems to reach too far it opined nevertheless the dc circuit acknowledged that its ruling was probably somewhat closer to the latter than the former12 the appeals court relied as we ll on the legislative history of ftaia to support its middle ground albeit fairly liberal juri sdictional interpreta tion of the act it noted in support of its position that the house report had menti oned with approval the supreme court opinion in pfizer inc v government of india13 which found that allowing foreign governments to sue for treble damages would further the deterrent effect of the antitrust laws damage provision14 and although the court admitted of possi ble alternative inte rpretations of the reports language concerning imports nd purely foreign transactions it foundhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21877crs4 15 house report at 11 quoted at 315 f3d 353 16 the decision was 80

states or in transactions in united st ates commerce and the relevant transactions occurred entirely outside us commerce 124 sct at 2364 18 we can find good answer to the basic question why is it reasonable to apply this law to conduct that is significantly foreign insofar as that conduct causes independent foreign harm and that foreign harm alone gives rise to the plaintiffs claim 124 sct at

court because the court did not have quorumadditional support for its position in language in the type of domestic effect section of the report the domestic effect that may serve as the predi cate for jurisdiction must be of the type the antitrust laws prohibit15 in the supreme court justice breyer for unanimous court16 continued to focus upon anticompetitive pricefixing activity that is in significant part foreign that causes some domestic antitrust injury and that independently causes parate foreign injury17 although the court of appeals d in effect said that it does not matter whether plaintiffs harm is wholly independent of the domestic effect in this case higher domestic prices for vitamins the supreme court decision stands for the proposition that it does matter18 justice breyer quotes from the house repor t to emphasize that ftaias general non applicability to us export commerce indeed extends to transactions within between or among other nations such foreign transactions ie transactions between two foreign firms should for the purposes of this legislation be treated in the same manner as export transactions that is there should be american antitrust jurisdiction absent direct substantial and reasonably foreseeable effect on domestic commerce or domestic competitor19 concurring with the district court opini on and therefore the interpretation given ftaia by the fifth circuit in den norske the court concluded that the exception does not apply where the plaintiffs claim rests solely on the independent foreign harm20 and reversed the court of appeals ruling the opinion accorded much weight to the pr actice of interpretin g ambiguous statutes to avoid unreasonable interference with the sove reign authority of othe r nations presuming that congress did not intentionally act in violation of the customary international law that discourages the unreasonable exercise of prescriptive jurisdiction with respect to person or activity having connecti ons with another state21 us courts have held at least since the opinion in united states v aluminum company of america22 that application of us antitrust laws where foreign conduct has adverse effects on us

us the sellers could not have maintained their international pricefixing arrangement and t hat they the foreign plaintiffs in this case would not have suffered their foreign injury 124 sct 2372 28 the dc circuit opinion written by the dissent er in that courts prior decision rested upon continuedno good answer to why american law should pply to conduct that causes harm to us commerce or exporters23 it cited and quoted with appr oval respected treatises critical summary of the court of appeals opinion as one that would effectively allow united states courts to provide worldwide subject matter jurisdiction irrespective of any harm caused by challenged transaction to us commerce it does not seem excessively rigid to infer that congress would not ve intended that result24 in addition for practical reasons the court di d not agree with plaintiffs that there is minimal likelihood that affirmance of the c ourt of appeals decision would unduly interfere with other nations interests first with the possible exception of statutes prohibiting price fixing there is not yet anything like universal agreement concerning either practices to be made unlawful under competition ws or appropriate remedies for those practices deemed to be illegal second veral foreign nations f iled briefs with the c ourt to underscore their assessments that extending the reach of us antitrust law in the way envisioned by the court of appeals would upset balance of comp eting considerations that their own domestic antitrust laws embody25 third even the united states filed brief in opposition to the decision below arguing that serious damage would be done to the amnesty program and therefore to antitrust deterren ce under which the department of justice offers substantial immunity to members of antitrust conspiraci who come forward to expose unlawful activities if those entities were exposed to potential private trebledamage liability finally the court dismissed as inapplicable all six of the cases plaintiffs respondents in the supreme court cited in their attempt to illustrate that cour ts have in fact found jurisdiction to hear cases similar to this one in three the court noted the plaintiff was the government and in the three involving private pl aintiffs either the issue of harm to foreign plaintiffs independent of harm to us comme rce was not discussed or the court specifically found nexus between the foreign rm and injury to us commerce the upshot is that pre1982 case provides si gnificant authority for application of the sherman act in the circumstances we here assume26 the court noted that although its opinion and reasoning assumed the independence of plaintiffs foreign harm from harm to us commerce plaintiffs contrary assertion27 was never addressed by the appeals court accord ingly while it vacated the lower court opinion the court remanded the case so that the dc circ uit could consider that issue on june 28 2005 the appeals court rejected that argument affirming the original district court opinion supra page 328httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21877crs6 28 continued the proposition that although empagrans but for argument set out in note 26 supra was plausable it was simply not sufficient to br ing foreign anticompe titive conduct within the ftaia exception that allows claims based on cert ain us foreign trade activity that gives rise to sherman act claim basing its conclusion on principles of prescriptive comity the dc circuit held on remand that the statutory language gives rise to indicates direct causal relationship that is proximate causation and is not satisfied by the mere butfor nexus the appellants advanced empagran sa v f hoffmanlaroche ltd f3d slip opinion at 7 emphasis added 29 124 sct at 2373justice scalia joined by justice thomas concurred specifically to emphasize that the courts interpretation of ftaia is the only one consistent with the principle that statutes should be read in accord with the customar deference to the application of foreign countries laws within their own territories29
