largest investment banking firm was battered by what its officials described as sudden liquidity squeeze related to its large exposure to devalued mortgagebacked securities on march 14 the federal reserve system announced that it would provide bear stearns with an unprecedented shortterm loan this was rendered essentially moot when on march 16 major commercial bank jp morgan chase agreed to buy bear stearns in an exchange of stock shares for about 15 of its share price of year earlier price that translated to 2share to help facilitate the deal the federal reserve agreed to provide special financing in connection with the transaction for up to 30 billion of bear stearnss less liquid assets during the weekend of march 22 in the wake of criticism from bear shareholder and employees employees own about onethird of the firms outstanding stock over the 2share price bear stearns and jp morgan renegotiated the terms of the deal jp morgan will purchase 95 million newly issued shares of bears common stock at 10share in stock exchange in response to the changed deal conditions the fed altered the terms of its financial involvement it got jp morgan to agree to absorb the first 1 billion in losses if the collateral provided by bear for loan proves to be worth less than bear stearns original claims instead of its original agreement to absorb up 30 billion the fed will now be responsible for up to 29 billion the feds unprecedented role has generated widespread debate on the implications of such an intervention some including senate banking housing and urban affairs committee chairman chris dodd have argued that in order to avoid potential systemic financial risk the involvement made sense but others including senator richard shelby ranking member of the senate banking committee have concerns that it tells the market that the fed is willing to help large and failing financial enterprise setting bad precedent in terms of corporate responsibility the senate banking committee held hearing on april 3 2008 solely devoted to issues surrounding the acquisition of bear stearns this report will be amended as events dictate

mortgagebacked securities on that day it also received word that it was getting an unprecedented loan from the federal reserve system fed the funding would take the form of 28day fed loan to be channeled through the large commercial bank jp morgan chase jp morgan the decision was unprecedented never before had the fed committed to bailing out financial entity that was not commercial bank the action was criticized by some members of congress but gained support from chairman christopher dodd of the senate banking housing and urban affairs committee which has fed oversight 1 bears liquidity crisis and the resulting fed intervention largely viewed as an effort to stabilize the firm and to avert wider financial panic sent alarms throughout the stock markets over bears fragility and more broadly over the potential precariousness of other major financial institutions the day of the announcement bears stock lost almost half of its value and the stocks of other major wall street firms also tumbled these concerns then spilled over into the broader universe of stocks the dow jones industrial average broad index of the overall stock market lost nearly 200 points slightly more than 15 of its value the feds actions were characterized as shortterm fix at the same time bear executives were also seeking buyer to purchase the highlyleveraged firm which was also one of the nations largest underwriters of nowtroubled mortgagebacked securities on march 16 two days after the announcement of the fed intervention jp morgan agreed to buy it this report provides an overview of bear

clearing services asset management and private client services as is also the case for its wall street and commer cial banking peers as housing prices took off and the mortgage industry surged earlier in this decade bear became actively involved in aspects of this market it was vertically integrated involvement that ranged from the purchase and operation of residential mortgage originators to packaging and underwriting vast pools of mortgages into structured securities products broadly known as mortgagebacked securities mbs such products would in turn be sold to institutional investors such as hedge and pension funds while some were retained by the bank itself 1 in recent memory the fed only approached this kind of specific nonbank intervention in 1998 when it helped organize rescue of longterm capital management ltcm large usbased hedge fund concerned about the possible dire consequences for world financial markets if the failing ltcm collapsed fed officials were instrumental in convincing group of us and european financial institu tions to inject several billion dollars into the hedge fund they did so and in exchange collectively received majority share

dramatic financial travails in june 2007 the firm announced that two of its hedge funds that were significantly invested in subprime mortgages were in trouble in an attempt to keep them afloat bear poured 16 billion into the funds nonetheless soon afterwards the f unds lost all of their value and were allowed to wind down by various accounts the funds meltdown signaled the start of collapse in the vital element of trust that must exist between firm like bear and its many customers in october 2007 bear agreed to needed 1 billion capital investment from chinas governmentcontrolled citic

market doldrums that are product of problems that originated in the housing and mortgage markets crs report rl34182 financial crisis the liquidity crunch of august 2007 by darryl getter et securitization allowed mortgage lenders to bypass traditional banks securitization pools mortgages or other debts and sells them to investors in the form of bonds rather than leaving loans on lenders balance sheets the mbs market developed in part because longterm fixed rate mortgages held in banks portfolios place banks at significant risk if interest rates rise in which case the banks interest costs could exceed their mortgage interest earnings mbs were popular with investors and banks because it allowed both to better diversify their portfolios but because the mbs market was growing rapidly in size and sophistication accurate pricing of its risk was difficult and could have been distorted by the housing boom there are several forms of mbs the simplest are called passthroughsinterest and principal payments from homeowners are collected by the lender or service firm and passed through to the owner of the mbs more complex securities are created by pooling mbs as well as mortgages and by giving investors menu of risk and return options mortgage pool may be split into parts calle d tranches to allow cautious investors to purchase safer portions and aggressive investors to purchase the riskier highreturn tranches eg tranches that bear initial losses finally mortgage cash flows may be combined with derivative instruments that link payment levels to the performance of financial variables such as interest rates or credit conditions these securitiescombinations of traditional bonds and derivativesare called structured products the growth of securitization meant that more loans could be originated by nonbanks many of which are not subject to examination by federal bank examiners and not subject to the underwriting guidances issued by federal financial regulators 3 2 david smith and dominic rushe bear stearns the banking twister heading your way the uk sunday times march 16 2008 3 crs report rl34182 financial crisis the liquidity

the feds announced rescue on march 14 2008 fixed income traders reportedly began hearing rumors that european financial institutions had ceased doing fixed income trades with bear fearing that their funds might be frozen if bear wound up in bankruptcy number of usbased fixedinco and stock traders that had been actively involved with bear had reportedly decided by march 10 to halt such involvement4 that development placed firms that still wanted to do business with bear in quandary in the event that bear did succumb they were likely to be in the difficult position of explaining to their clients why they had ignored the rumors on march 11 major assetmanagement company ceased doing trades with bear5 the same day however the bears chief executive officer alan schwartz wrote that the firms balance sheet liquidity and capital remain strong6 that same week many other firms began exercising extreme caution in their dealings with bear as the firm saw the exodus of growing number of its trading counterparties some hedge fund clients demanding that bear provide cash as collateral on trades they had done with the firm withdrew funds from their accounts with the firm hedge funds that had used bear to borrow money and clear trades were withdrawing cash from their accounts some large investment banks stopped accepting trades that would expose them to bear and some money market funds reduced their holdings of shortterm bearissued debt conc erned that the firms ability to pay claims was looking less assured number of institutional investors with credit default swaps insurance policies that protect against corporate bond defaults purchased from bear were attempting to undo those trades bear had developed sizeable market in swaps this ongoing activity contributed to precipit ous and alarming drop in bears cushion of liquidity reserves by the afternoon of march 13 the firms ceo was convinced of the severity of the problem after deliberating with other senior company staff and company lawyers call was made to james dimon ceo of jp morgan the nations second largest bank in stock market capitalization as the clearing agent for bears trades jp morgan was familiar with bears collateral position and thus seemed like good prospect for lending to the firm 7 later jp morgans ceo and other jp morgan senior officials held conversations with representatives from the fed the conclusion was that something needed to be done because failure at bear could have widespread financial repercussions by the evening of march 13 bear had been unable to secure emergency financing or negotiate strategic acquisition deal officials from the firm and the securities and exchange commission the principal bear regulator then informed officials from the fed that bear had lost far more of its liquidity than it had previously been aware of th fed then sent team of examiners to look at bears books overnight early on the morning on march 14 cadre of financial regulators including new

provision of the federal reserve act allows it to lend to nonbanks if at least five of its seven governors approve provision that has not been used since the great depression with two governors seats vacant and one governor out of the country and inaccessible the fed invoked special legal clause allowing it to approve an overnight loan to bear with only four governors the arrangement would involve providing collateral based financing to bear through jp morgan which would be used as conduit since as commercial bank it already has access to the discount window and is also under the feds supervision exact terms were not disclosed but the loan amount would only be limited to the amount of collateral bear could provide jp morgan would have incurred risk from the transaction but the fed

significantly battered by the mortgage meltdtown agreed to acquire bear for 236 million in the preceding days bear executives were both preparing for possible chapter 11 bankruptcy filing and pursuing purchaser for either all or parts of the firm the idea was that securing an immediate acquirer before trade resumed on monday march 17 would allow the firm to avoid li kely mass withdrawals by its

1 of the 170 share price that bear stock had fetched year earlier the boards at both bear stearns and jp morgan quickly approved the deal as did the fed and the office of the comptroller of the currency the deal needed the approval of shareholders at both bear and jp morgan at bear schism between its bondholders and its shareholders had reportedly arisen after the announced sale interested in keeping the firm out of bankruptcy and protecting their investment in it bondholders were generally said to be supportive of the sale but many shareholders including some employees with an equity

proposed sale for example during the last week of march the wayne county employee s retirement system of michigan and the police and fire retirement system of the city of detroit sued bear stearns its directors and jp morgan and asked the delaware chancery court to initially issue temporary restraining order blocking bears plan to issue stock representing 395 of its stake the court refused to do so and after the shares were issued on april 8 the pension funds changed their request and asked for preliminary injunction to stop jp morgan from voting any of the newly acquired shares on april 9 judge on the court responded by ordering temporarily pause to the lawsuits accepting the investment banks argument that fighting simultaneous lawsuits in delaware and new york where other suits are pending

of the agreement the fed will purchase up to 30 billion of bear stearns assets through limited liability corporation llc based in delaware that it has created and controls upon its creation two loans will be made to the llc the fed will lend the llc up to 29 billion and jp morgan chase will make subordinate loan to the llc worth 1 billion the feds loan will be made at an interest rate set equal to the discount rate 25 when the terms were announced but fluctuating over time for term of 10 years renewable by the fed jp morgan chases loan will have an interest rate 45 percentage points above the discount rate using the proceeds from that loan the llc will purchase assets from bear stearns worth 30 billion at marked to market prices by bear stearns on march 14 the fed reported that the portfolio supporting the credit extensions consists largely of mortgagerelated assets in particular it includes cash assets as well as related hedges the cash assets consist of investment grade securities ie securities rated bbb or higher by at least one of the three principal credit rating agencies and lower than that by the others and residential or commercial mortgage loans classified as perfo rming all of the assets are current as to principal and interest as of march 14 2008 all securities are domiciled and issued in the us and denominated in us dollars the portfolio consists of collateralized mortgage obligations cmos the majority of which are obligations of governmentsponsored entities gses such as the federal home loan mortgage corporation freddie mac as well as assetbacked securities adjustablerate mortgages commercial mortgagebacked securities nongse cmos collateralized bond obligations and various other loan obligations the llc will own these assets and will liquidate them in order to pay back the principal and interest owed to the fed and jp morgan chase the llcs assets purchased from bear stearns are the collateral backin g the loans from the fed and jp morgan chase private company blackrock financial management has been hired to manage the portfolio neither bear stearns nor jp morgan chase owe the fed any principal or interest nor are they liable if the llc is unable to pay back the money the fed lent it the new york fed explained that the llc was created to ease administration of the portfolio and will remove constraints on the money manager that might arise from retaining the assets on the books of bear stearns jp morgan chase and bear st earns will not receive the 29 billion from the llc until the merger is complete in the meantime jp morgan chase and the fed have delegated control of the assets to the llc including the right to liquidate them before the merger 19 the unprecedented fed intervention has triggered widespread debate over the actions merits the two predominant and opposing views are as follows intervention made sense because of the threat of increased market instability if bear went down it was argued by some including treasury secretary henry paulson20 that the feds intervention was wholly justified in pursuit of the larger goal of ensuring financial stability by averting potentially far reaching spillovers into the larger financial world if bear were to collapseoften called systemic risk one concern was that such failure would unleash 19 ibid p 78 20 andrew clark bear stearns saved

substantial pessimism and uncertainty another concern involved the 46 billion in mortgages mortgagebacked and assetbacked securities as reported on november 30 2007 held by the firm if bear failed it would likely have to liquidate such assets large fraction of which held somewhat questionable valuations based on what it said were estimates derived from internally developed models or methodologies utilizing significant inputs that are generally less readily observable 21 large stream of such assets released into riskaverse markets with leery and anxious buyers would be likely to force many institutions with similar assets into substantial asset write downs the outcome of all of this could be financial meltdown the intervention helps shield th firm and the markets from the consequences of running badly performing firm moral hazard occurs when entities do not bear the full cost of their actions thus becoming more likely to repeat them and major concern here is that with fed intervention neither bear nor the markets in general would benefit from the painful but important lesson that failed firms should simply be left to their own fate for example if after the bear intervention another wall street firm like lehman also found itself on the ropeswould there be an expectation that it also would be rescued these kind of arguments are often used to challenge the widely held belief in too big to failthe idea that the largest and most powerful financial institutions are too large part of the financial system to let fail in the case of bear stearns more aptly put variation on this might be that it was too widely connected to clients and counterparties to fail defending the feds role during april 2 nd testimony before the joint economic committee fed chairman ben bernanke observed our financial system is extremely complex and interconnected and bear stearns participated extensively in range of critical markets with financial conditions fragile the sudden failure of bear stearns likely would have led to chaotic unwinding of positions in those markets and could have severely shaken confidence the companys failure could also have cast doubt on the financial positions of some of bear stearns thousands of counterparties and perhaps of companies with similar businesses given the current exceptional pressures on the global economy and financial system the damage caused by default by bear stearns could have been severe and extremely difficult to contain moreover the adverse effects would not have been confined to the financial system but would have been felt broadly in the real economy through its effects on asset values and credit availability to prevent disorderly failure of bear stearns and the unpredictable but likely severe consequences of such failure for market functioning and the broader economy the federal reserve in close consultation with the treasury department agreed to provide funding to bear stearns through jpmorgan chas over the following weekend jp morgan chase agreed to purchase bear stearns and assumed bears financial obligations some congressional observers such as senate banking committee chairman

appears to have been justified22 several members of congress have publicly expressed some concerns over the merits of the feds role for example senator sam brownback commented that the federal reserve acted swiftly and decisively during the bear stearnsjp morgan marriage however i am concerned when taxpayer money is used to rescue sophisticated private investment and commercial banks from the consequences of the banks own strategic decisions i am interested in learning more about how the federal reserve will quantify the financial risk to the taxpayer resulting from the feds recent and any future actions to help private companies 23 echoing this theme representative scott garrett observed that government isnt supposed to be in the business of picking winners and losers24 and at an april 3 senate banking committee hearing on bear stearns senator richard shelby ranking member of the senate banking committee reportedly expressed general concern that the feds actions would create moral hazard which encourages firms to take excessive risk based on the expectations that they will reap all the profits while the federal government stands ready to cover any losses if they fail25 outside of congress number of observers have also criticized the fed for example writing in the dow jones capital market report financial columnist jim murphy rebutted the assertion that rescuing bear stearns was necessary to avoid systemic repercussions he observed that here is the problem with the bailout of bear stearns the assumption behind the operation is that bear stearns is global investment bank and brokerag that offers goods and services not offered by the many other global investment powerhouses this is simply untrue bear stearns offered nothing and offers nothing that isnt offered by say jp morgan chase and merrill lynch to name but two huge investment banks and brokerages had bear stearns been allowed to fail the damage would have been limited to bear stearns shareholders including the firms employees the collapse of bear stearns didnt really put much of dent in the capital of the blueblood investors and institutions who were said to be the mainstays of the firm in fact of course it was the flight of the big plungers to other wire hous that triggered the near collapse of bear stearns 26 former fed chairman paul v olcker is similarly critical observing that the federal reserve has judged it necessary to take actions that extend to the very edge of its lawful and implied powers transcending in the process certain longembedded central banking principles and practices what appears to be in substance direct transfer of mortgage and mortgagebacked securities of questionable pedigree from an investment bank to the federal reserve seems to test the timehonored central bank mantra in time of crisis lend freely at high rates against good collateral test it to the point of return 27 22 william neikirk fed action awaited on size of rate cut markets hope likely rate cut
