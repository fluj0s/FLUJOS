tradeoffs written in response to previous letter to the editor in correspondence aviation week and space technology october 8 2007 p 8 17 ibid p 7analysis potential future of craf craf presents benefits nd opportunities for both the dod and the us airline industry by all accounts it appears to be symbiotic relationship yet as circumstances change pressures and divergin g interests may emerge that could bring changes to craf cost factors the primary benefit that craf imparts to dod is its relatively low cost when compared to procuring and maintaining larger organic fleet for example 1996 government accountability office gao report noted that craf provides up to half of the nations strategi c airlift capability without the government having to buy additional aircraft pay pers onnel costs or maintain th aircraft during peacetime15 all factors that re main relevant today while craf is relatively inexpensive some may point out that commercial aircraft have opera tional limitations when compared to dods organic airlift fleet for example commercial aircraft ca nnot carry outsized cargo conduct special missions such as airdrop or support speci operations forces also commercial aircraft tend to congest ai rfields because of longer ground times resulting from lack of roll onroll off capability and reduced ramp maneuverability further potential hostile fire effectively deters civilian crews from entering combat zones however commercial aircraft typically have longer range and are optimized to efficiently transport passengers and cargo pallets16 gao references the use of craf during operation desert storm to illustrate crafs cost advantages the use of craf aircraft during an activation is not free dod pays rates based on weighted average carrier costs but the cost is minimal in comparison to the costs of acquiring and supporting airc raft paying and training aircrew and other expenses of maintaining standby military airlift capability amc paid the carriers about 15 billion for using th eir aircraft during the operation purchasing additional military aircraft to provide similar capability would cost from 15 to 50 billi on according to air force officials depending on assumptions used for aircraft replacement cost17 rand study finding the right mix of military and civil airlift issues and implications also includes discussion of the costeffectiveness of craf for very small cost the dod has had on call very substantial airlift capacity replacing crafs 1992 stage ii capability with militarystyle transports would have cost the dod about 1 billion annually 1992 dollars over the past severalhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33692crs6 18 jean gebman et finding the right mix of military and civil airlift issues and implications volume 1 executive summary rand santa monica ca1994 p 21 19 micheline maynard airlines moving more troops this month new york times january 25 2005 20 rand op cit p 22decades replacing the stage iii capab ility would have cost about 3 billion annually 18 the rand analysis points out that to have adequate airlift for major crisis dod maintains military airlift fleet with total capacity four to five times greater than the average daily use costs associated with acquiring and maintaining this excess airlift capability must be routinely incurred even if the full capacity is rarely used as dods procurement and operations and maintenance accounts come under increasing pressure it may appear attractiv to increase the size of craf in lieu of procuring and operating certa in fraction of the air force strategic airlift fleet recent events may suggest that growing use of commercial aircraft for everyday dod needs is already in evidence in ja nuary 2005 for example it was reported that commercial airlines moved twice as many us troops overseas as they moved in january 200419 contracting with air carriers to commit their aircraft to wartime needs is cheaper in sense than purchasing and ope rating additional air force cargo aircraft however craf is not free and it costs mo re once activated rand points out that although holding reserve capacity in the craf is far more cost effective than holding the reserve in the military airlift fleet the government has financial incentive to use its own resources for which it has already committed funds in crisis to the extent that they are c onveniently available rather than give additional business to craf carriers20 other government commercial arrangements craf is not the only means by which dod transports troops by civil aircraft through the general services administration gsa the us government negotiates and lets contracts to commercial airlines to fly government employees on official us government business federal em ployees including dod civilian and military personnel traveling on govern ment business are obliged to fly with these contracted airlines at the official g overnment rate dod also char ters commercial aircraft to satisfy peacetime mobility needs in july 2006 the us central comma nd had initiated pilot program commercial and government air program to enlist commercial air cargo carriers to deliver military supplies into af ghanistan and iraq the pilot program is hoped to deliver up to 20 of dod car go to the region and to save dodhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33692crs7 21 jason sherman centcom taps commercia l air

1 2008 p 8 25 ibid p4approximately 9 million per month21 dod hopes to dramatically reduce its flight costs by creating competition among carriers for the work and by leveraging excess cargo capacity on regularly scheduled commercial flights this trial program could be viewed as something of an alternative to craf or an indication that more craf would be welcome potential changes in dods airlift requirements and force structure the increased scope and pace of military operations following the terrorist attacks of september 11 2001 have increased the air forces mobility needs and made commercial air carriers more pr ominent component of this capability22 potential changes in dods strategic airlift requirements and air mobility force structure may affect the craf program23 dod airlift requirements dod periodically examines the state of its current air mobility fleet and quantifies future airlift requirements to determine whether current force structure is sufficien t to meet the presidents national security strategy dods most recent air mobility requirements study mobility capability study mcs was completed in decem ber 2005 however during congressional testimony general arthur l lichte commander of the air forces air mobility command pointed to changes that have ccurred since the mcs was completed that include the increase of 92000 ground forces the repositioning of dod force structure overseas and the growth of the armys future combat system24 further dod has reduced the number of c5 galaxies planned for upgrade with new engines and other enhancements that were expected to bolster capability of the c5 fleet to levels required by mcs2005 as result general lichte stated that the current program of record for the air forces stra tegic airlift fleet of c5s and c17s falls short of the organic strategic airlift capability of 3395 million ton miles day mtmd requirement25 the mcs called for the same level of craf contribution to total airlift capabilities 205 million ton miles per day of the overall 545 million ton miles perhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33692crs8 26 unlike previous mobility studies dods mobility capabilities study 2005 did not provide specific quantitative estimate of airlift requi rements some have asserted that this omission reduces the value of the mcs and have called for another requirementsdriven studyday objective as required in the prior study26 however dods projected use of craf to fulfill total airlift needs has in creased from roughly 12 mtmd in the late 1980s to roughly 20 mtmd in 2005 further this increase in capacity has occurred gradually and many view dod s requirement for craf as being stable over this 19 year span as figure 1 indicates commercial airc raft committed to craf exceed dod requirements thus any foreseeable increases in craf requirements are unlikely to result in shortfalls of commercial aircraft committed to craf source air force magazine february 2003 p 28 figure 1

requirement shortfalls for example in march 2008 general rton schwartz commander of us transportation command stated that base d on the c5 reliability enhancement and reengining program being reduced and recertified by dod he believes dod needs fleet of 111 c5s and 205 c17s28 further the air forces fy2009 unfunded priority list contained re quest for 15 additional c17s29 in contrast the administrations fy2009 budget request did not contain funding for new c17s nor did it request funding to close the c17 production line30 however during congressional testimony gen sc hwartz cautioned that too large of an organic airlift fleet could potentially hurt the craf prog ram in the future when he stated one of the things that you hold accountable for is sort of maintaining the balance between the organic fleet and the commercial capability and as i mentioned in my opening remarks i cau tion about overbuilding the organic fleet because if that occurs it can competes in peace time with that preference cargo the incentives that we offer our commerci partners and so thats one of the reasons that i believe 205 is the right number of c17s31 bc17 because air force budget limitations make additional largescale procurement of c17s difficult to fund so have suggested the design of commercial version of the c17 aircraft bc17 that might become part of the craf fleet however is there
