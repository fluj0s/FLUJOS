stressing that the us is currently focused on the diplomatic track he shared usg thinking about the siniora government in lebanon and urged that the us and israel continue to consult on lebanon end summary the security assistance mou and israels qme 3 s dagan observed that the signing of the mou on security assistance could not have come at better time and stressed that israel appreciated americas support the under secretary agreed about the timing noting that the us israel and likeminded countries were facing multiple threats around the world and that the middle east is very dangerous region he said that the mou serves as concrete reminder that the us stands by its longterm security commitments to its friends and is ready to help them with their needs the under secretary noted that the middle east is now at the heart of american interests because egypt also plays vital role in the region the us would also renew its security assistance commitment to that country us relations with the gulf states were longstanding and america would stay true to those friendships as well the under secretary stressed that the usg is committed to israels qme he noted that the majority of systems and equipment that the us would sell to egypt and other arab partners would replace items that had been sold to those countries in the past dagan reviews middle east pakistan turkey 4 s assessing the region dagan said israel sees itself in the middle of rapidly changing environment in which the fate of one middle eastern country is connected to another dagan then said he was concerned about how long pakistani president musharraf would survive he is facing serious problem with the militants pakistans nuclear capability could end up in the hands of an islamic regime turning to iran dagan observed that it is in transition period there is debate among the leadership between rafsanjani and ahmadinejad and their respective supporters instability in iran is driven by inflation and tension among ethnic minorities this dagan said presents unique opportunities and israelis and americans might see change in iran in tel aviv 00002652 002 of 005 their lifetimes as for iraq it may end up weak federal state comprised of three cantons or entities one each belonging to the kurds sunnis and shias 5 s dagan said that the gulf states and saudi arabia are concerned about the growing importance of iran and its influence on them they are taking precautions trying to increase their own military defensive capabilities referring to the gulf security dialogue gsd dagan warned that these countries would not be able to cope with the amount of weapons systems they intend to acquire they do not use the weapons effectively 6 s dagan said that jordan has successfully faced down threats from the muslim brotherhood and hamas and that egypt is struggling with the question of who will replace president mubarak he said he sees hope for the palestinians and that israel looks at syria and lebanon and sees only instability further afield it looks at turkey and sees islamists gaining momentum there the question he asked is how long turkeys military viewing itself as the defender of turkeys secular identity will remain quiet 7 s if israels neighborhood were not unstable enough dagan observed it did not help that russia is playing very negative role in the region he observed that all of these challenges have to be addressed globally they could not be dealt with individually returning to jordan as an example he noted that the more than one million iraqi refugees in jordan were changing jordanian society and forcing it into new relationship with saudi arabia this is evidenced by saudi king abdullahs recent visit to jordan which implies greater understanding between the jordanians and the saudis discussion of the gulf security dialogue 8 s turning to the gulf security dialogue gsd dagan said that enhancing the capabilities of the gulf states is the right direction to go especially as they are afraid of iran such us commitment will be stabilizing factor in the region dagan clarified that he would not oppose us security assistance to americas arab partners he expressed concern nevertheless about the current policies of those partners especially with regards to syria and iran dagan added that if those countries must choose between buying defensive systems from the us or france then he would prefer they buy systems from the us as this would bring them closer to the us 9 s dagan observed that the challenge facing the us now is how to unite the gulf states under shared policy and pointed to qatar as the weakest link in the chain trying to play all sides under secretary burns replied that the us is trying to get qatar and its neighbors to look at issues from regional perspective and to focus on threats in unified way acting pm assistant secretary mull expressed understanding for israels frustration with how the region looked but stressed nevertheless that if america did not engage the gulf states through the gsd the situation would become much worse it is critical to get the gulf states focused on the iran threat and to adopt regional approach to countering it encouraging and supporting their counterproliferation efforts would be crucial dagan said he agreed with this approach stressing that the threat of radical islam is real iran dagan reviews israels five pillar strategy 10 s dagan led discussion on iran by pointing out that the us and israel have different timetables concerning when iran is likely to acquire nuclear capability he clarified that the israel atomic energy commissions iaec timetable is purely technical in nature while the mossads considers other factors including the regimes determination to succeed while dagan acknowledged that there is still time to resolve the iran nuclear crisis he stressed that iran is making great effort to achieve nuclear capability the threat is obvious even if we have different timetable if we want to postpone their acquisition of tel aviv 00002652 003 of 005 nuclear capability then we have to invest time and effort ourselves 11 s dagan described how the israeli strategy consists of five pillars political approach dagan praised efforts to bring iran before the unsc and signaled his agreement with the pursuit of third sanctions resolution he acknowledged that pressure on iran is building up but said this approach alone will not resolve the crisis he stressed that the timetable for political action is different than the nuclear projects timetable b covert measures dagan and the under secretary agreed not to discuss this approach in the larger group setting c counterproliferation dagan underscored the need to prevent knowhow and technology from making their way to iran and said that more can be done in this area d sanctions dagan said that the biggest successes had so far been in this area three iranian banks are on the verge of collapse the financial sanctions are having nationwide impact irans regime can longer just deal with the bankers themselves force regime change dagan said that more should be done to foment regime change in iran possibly with the support of student democracy movements and ethnic groups eg azeris kurds baluchs opposed to the ruling regime 12 s dagan clarified that the us israel and likeminded countries must push on all five pillars at the same time some are bearing fruit now others would bear fruit in due time especially if more attention were placed on them dagan urged more attention on regime change asserting that more could be done to develop the identities of ethnic minorities in iran he said he was sure that israel and the us could change the ruling regime in iran and its attitude towards backing terror regimes he added we could also get them to delay their nuclear project iran could become normal state 13 s dagan stressed that iran has weak spots that can be exploited according to his information unemployment exceeds 30 percent nationwide with some towns and villages experiencing 50 percent unemployment especially among 1730 year olds inflation averages more than 40 percent and people are criticizing the government for investing in and sponsoring hamas saying that they government should invest in iran itself the economy is hurting he said and this is provoking real crisis among irans leaders he added that irans minorities are raising their heads and are tempted to resort to violence 14 s dagan suggested that more could be done to get the europeans to take tougher stand against iran under secretary burns agreed and suggested that israel could help sipdis by reaching out to the europeans dagan said that israel is already doing this and would continue to do so dagan reiterated the need to strike at irans heart by engaging with its people directly voice of america voa broadcasts are important but more radio transmissions in farsi are needed coordination with the gulf states is helpful but the us should also coordinate with azerbaijan and countries to the north of iran to put pressure on iran russia he said would be annoyed but it would be fitting as russia appears bent on showing the us that it cannot act globally without considering russia 15 s under secretary burns stressed that the usg is focused on iran not only because of its nuclear program but also because it supports terrorism and shiite militias in iraq the us approach is currently focused on the diplomatic track and increasing pressure on iran through sanctions work in the unsc helps to define the iranian nuclear threat as one that affects international security and not just that of israel while unsc members russia china and qatar will water down efforts to increase pressure on iran it is still worthwhile to push for third sanctions resolution in the meantime the us will encourage the europeans japan and south korea to implement unilateral sanctions against iran outside the unsc framework the us tel aviv 00002652 004 of 005 will continue to encourage banks and financial institutions to slow down their operations in iran and financially isolate it regarding military pressure the under secretary noted that the us has deployed 12 carrier battle groups in the gulf over the last six months and that president bush has stated that he will interrupt irans activity in iraq as for outreach to the iranian people the voa is now broadcasting programs in farsi and the usg is trying to get more iranian students to visit the us to promote peopletopeople relations pakistan israel worried about musharraf 16 s on pakistan dagan said that president musharraf is losing control and that some of his coalition partners could threaten him in the future the key question dagan said is whether musharraf retains his commanderinchief role in addition to his role as president if not he will have problems dagan observed that there has been an increase in the number of attempts on musharrafs life and wondered whether he will survive the next few years under secretary burns replied that south asia has assumed vital importance in american foreign policy since september 11 the us is committed to denying afghanistan as safehaven for taliban and alqaeda activity the usg will continue to support pakistani president musharraf and is seeking to boost his military defensive capabilities at the same time the us is encouraging pakistan and afghanistan to work with each other militarily turning to india under secretary burns noted that usindian economic cooperation is growing and that the usg is working effectively to reduce tensions between india and pakistan lebanon dagan urges caution 17 s dagan urged caution with respect to lebanon noting that the results of efforts there to bolster the siniora government would impact syria and iraq the us and israel he said are on the edge of achieving something in lebanon and so cannot afford to drop their guard what is necessary is finding the right way to support pm siniora he is courageous man dagan said syria iran and hizballah are working hard against him dagan noted that much of what is animating the leadership of lebanon to take on syria is personal hariri jumblat and others had their parents executed by the syrians this antisyrian sentiment has forged an alliance based on personal and national interests siniora has worked well with the situation but dagan suggested that the odds are against him under secretary burns replied that the us is trying to give pm siniora as much support as possible and that we would continue to consult closely with israel on lebanon he noted that he would return to israel in october meeting participants 18 sbu accompanying under secretary burns in the meeting were
