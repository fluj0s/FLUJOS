recession is one of several discrete phases in the overall business cycle the term may often be used loosely to describe an economy that is slowing down or characterized by weakness in at least one

the generally recognized arbiter of the dates of the beginnings and ends of recessions with all statistics it takes some time to compile the data which means they are only available after the events they describe moreover because it takes time to discern changes in trends given the usual monthtomonth volatility in economic indicators and because the data are subject to revision it takes some time before the dating committee can agree that recession began at certain date it can be year or more after the fact that the dating committee announces the date of the beginning of recession just as it

the national bureau of economic research confirmed what many had suspected for some time that the economy was in recession they announced that the economy had reached cyclical peak and that recession had begun in december 2007 the term recession may often be used loosely to describe an economy that is slowing down or characterized by weakness in at least one major sector like the housing market when economists use the term however they try to do so consistently recessions typically have common characteristics and so economists try to identify the beginning and ending dates of recessions in order to further their overall understanding of the economy g25g145g138g157g561g146g156g561g138g561g20g142g140g142g156g156g146g152g151g501g561 recession is one of several discrete phases in the overall business cycle the beginning of recession is known as business cycle peak and the end of recession is referred to as business cycle trough in 1946 arthur burns and wesley mitchell published study of business cycles and offered definition intended as guide for further study business cycles are type of fluctuation found in the aggregate economic activity of nations that organize their work mainly in business enterprises cycle consists of expansions occurring at about the same time in many economic activities followed by similarly general recessions contractions and revivals which merge into the expansion phase of the next cycle 1 this definition requires both expansions and recessions to be apparent in many economic activities at about the same time which would seem to exclude an economy exhibiting weakness in single market more recently economists at the national bureau of economic research nber issued memo with slightly more precise definition recession is significant decline in econo mic activity spread across the economy lasting more than few months normally visible in real gdp real income employment industrial production and wholesaleretail sales recession begins just after the economy reaches peak of activity and ends as the economy reaches its trough between trough and peak the economy is in an expansion expansion is the normal state of the economy most recessions are brief and they have been rare in recent decades 2 this is the generally accepted view among economists of what constitutes an economic recession there is also commonly cited rule of thumb that is referred to in the press that rule is that recession is two consecutive quarterly declines in real gross domestic product gdp but this rule does not always apply for example there was recession beginning in march 2001 and 1 arthur f burns and wesley c mitchell measuring business cycles national bureau of economic research 1946 p 3 2 business cycle dating committee memo national

quarterly declines in real gdp in any case an important distinction is that recession is period of declining output and not just period of slower economic growth it is possible for gdp growth to be positive yet so slow that the unemployment rate rises this is sometimes referred to as growth recession

that was founded in 1920 in the beginning its focus was on the macroeconomy busin ess cycles and longterm growth but now it seeks to promote research on wide variety of topics for many years the nber itself determined the dates of swings in the business cycle in 1978 however separate business cycle dating committee was formed the members of the committee are appointed by the president of the nber and they are now responsible for determining the dates of the beginnings and ends of recessions4 the current members of this committee are robert hall chair director of nber s program of research on economic fluctuations and growth and professor at stanford university martin feldstein president emeritus of nber and professor at harvard university jeffrey frankel director of nbers program in

is growth in real gross domestic product gdp gdp statistics are compiled each quarter and thus there is time lag between the first month that is reflected in the data and the release of the data for

later on as well it is not inconceivable that first release of data that showed decline in real gdp would later be revised to show an increase even so those using the rule of thumb that two successive quarterly declines in real gdp constitutes recession would have to wait for the release of the second quarter data in august to establish that recession began at the start of the year because of the time lag associated with the release of gdp data and because business cycle turning points are associated with months rather than quarters the dating committee relies on number of monthly economic indicators among the more important monthly indicators the committee looks at are personal income employment and industrial production even in the case of monthly indicators it may require several months of data to establish change in trends when there is recession not all of the economic indicators may show change in trend at the same time historically some indicators such as housing starts and the stock market tend to slow or decline in advance of recession and some like the unemployment rate tend to react to changing conditions with lag with all statistics it takes some time to compile the data which means that the statistics are only available after the events they describe moreover because it takes time to discern changes in trends given the usual monthtomonth volatility in economic indicators and because the data are subject to revision it takes some time before th dating committee can agree that recession or an expansion began at certain date table 1 shows for recent

phase of the business cycle and its announcement was when recession was found to have ended in march 1991 but was not announced until 21 months had passed the shortest delay was five months after the expansion ended in january 1980 of the eight examples shown here four were not announced until at least year had elapsed

characteristics they also have many common aspects thus they are the object of economic analysis both individually and collectively because they are undesirable economists study them in the hope that they can advise policymakers how to avoid them to do so it is important to agree on chronology and it may not be an inconvenience to economists that it takes time to establish one policymakers on the other hand are more concerned with the present and the immediate future if they hope to avert or mitigate the consequences of recession they cannot wait for an official declaration by then the recession may be history although there can be significant delay between the onset of recession and the dating committee determination there is often little doubt that the economy is or has been in recession well before the announcement 5 for policy measures to have mitigating effects they must be timely policymakers may not have the luxury of holding themselves to as strict definition of recession as economic analysts g3g158g157g145g152g155g561g5g152g151g157g138g140g157g561g11g151g143g152g155g150g138g157g146g152g151g561 brian w cashell specialist in macroeconomic policy
