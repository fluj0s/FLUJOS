payroll taxes on covered earnings being covered by social security means that worker is employed in job or is selfemployed and contributes portion of his or her earnings to social security workers not covered by social security are either covered by similar eligible contributory system offered by thei r employers outside of social security do not have high enough earnings for mandatory participation or have another special exemption the type of workers exem pt from coverage are provided below workers exempt from the tax state and local government workers participating in alternative

workers earning less than 1500 year in 2006 and those under age 18 for whom househol d work is not their principal occupation selfemployed workers with annual net earnings below 400 social security taxpayers in 2003 covered workers contribute to social secu rity by paying payroll taxes on their earnings wage and salaried workers of ten have their contri butions deducted from each paycheck they receive while selfemployed must report earnings regularly with the social security administration table 3 provides the number of covered workers that contribute to the social security sy stem as of december 2003 the total number of taxpayers is much lower than the sum of the two coverage groups because approximately six million individuals overlap coverage and engage separately in both wage and salaried work as well as in selfemployed workhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs9427crs6 table 3 social security taxpayers taxpayers by coverage group number number of wage and salaried taxpayers 1451 million

employees social security tax rates covered wage and salaried workers c ontribute 765 of their earnings below the taxable maximum earnings threshold explained below to the social security system employers of covered workers c ontribute to the system an additional 765 of the earnings of each employee the payroll taxes levied on workers and their employers are called fica taxes after the legislation that created them the federal insurance contribution act selfemployed workers contribute roughl 1530 of their net earnings to the system the payroll tax levied on the lfemployed are known as seca taxes for the selfemployed contribution act fica and seca tax rates are displayed in table 4 on paper it appears that the selfemployed are subject to tax rate that is double that of wage and salaried work er essentially equaling both the employee and employer fica portions however the selfemployed receive two breaks that are not offered to wage and sala ried workers and their employers the first break is that not all of lfemployed workers earnings are subject to seca taxes only 9235 of net earni ngs are subject to seca taxes meaning that 765 is exempt the second break is that onehalf of the tax payments made in the form of seca contributions are deductible for income tax purposes table 4 social security tax rates type of employment and tax of earnings fica rate is paid by employee and employer 765 each seca rate is paid by selfemployed 1530 source social security administration website electronic fact sheet httpwwwssagovpubs 10003html the selfemployed now compute the

taxable covered workers contribute the proper percen tage of their earnings by either the fica or seca tax however not all ear nings are subject to fica and seca taxes there is maximum taxable earnings threshold which rises each year with overall wage growth earnings above the cap are not subject to the oasdi portion of the fica and seca taxes the earnings above the cap however are subject to the hi dedicated portion of the fica and seca taxe s the wage cap is effective for both the employer and employee oasdidedicated portions of the fica tax recent wage cap limits are shown in table 6

to th payroll tax rate which amounts to the sum of both the employer and employee shares of the fica tax rate however the selfemployed benefit from two breaks that reduce their overall tax burden first selfemployed workers are only require d to make 9235 of their net earnings subject to the seca tax rate wage and salaried employees have the fica tax rate applied to all 100 of their earnings second selfemployed workers can deduct onehalf of their seca tax payments from their income taxes for example if hypothetical selfemployed person had 35057 in net earnings an amount equivalent to the average wage earner in the economy they would pay seca taxes on 32375 of those earnings 9235 of 35057 when the 153 seca tax rate is applied to 32375 the result is seca tax burden of 4953 in computing th effect of the income tax deduction onehalf of the 4953 tax burden 2477 is used for calculation purposes assuming that this hypothetical selfemp loyed worker with 35057 in net earnings is in the 15 marginal income tax br acket 2477 income tax deduction is going to result in tax savings of an additi onal 372 15 of 2477 the net real tax burden in this example would be 4582 instead of 4953 without the income tax deduction and 5364 153 of 35057 w ithout the income tax deduction and the exemption from net earnings these computations are included in table 7 to illustrate the tax burdens of both
