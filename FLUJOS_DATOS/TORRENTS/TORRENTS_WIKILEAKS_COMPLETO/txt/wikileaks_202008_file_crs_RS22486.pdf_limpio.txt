with new delhi5 however there are signs that following the 2005 launch of usindia global partnership and plans for b ilateral civil nuclear cooperation new delh i intends to bring its iran policy into closer alignment with that of the united states yet india is home to sizeable constituency urging resistance to any us pressure that might inhibit new delhitehran relations or which prioritize rela tions with the united states in disregard of indias national interests while top indian leaders state that friendly new delhitehran ties will continue concurrent with or even despite growing usindia partnership some observers see such rhetoric as incompatible with recent developments6 indian policy toward ir ans nuclear program the indian government has made clear th at it does not wish to see new nuclear weapons power in the region and in this cont ext it has aligned itsel f with international efforts to bring irans controversial nuclear program into conformity with non proliferation treaty and iaea provisions at the same time new delhis traditional status as leader of the nonaligned movement its friendly links with tehran and domestic constituency that includes tens of millions of shiite muslims have presented difficulties for indian policymakers there are also in new delhi influential leftist and opposition parties which main tain high sensitivity toward indications that india is being made junior partner of the united states these political forces have been critical of proposed usindia civil nuclear cooperation and regularly insist that indias closer relations with the united states should not co at the expense of positive ties with iran the current indian national congressled coalition government has thus sought to maintain careful balance between two sometimes conflicting policy objectives indias main opposition the bharatiya janata party has voiced its approval of the present governments policy toward irans nuclear program there were reports in 2005 that india woul d oppose bringing irans nuclear program before the security council and was likely to abstain on relevant iaea board votes7 however on september 24 2005 in what ma ny saw as the first test of indias position new delhi did vote with the majority and the united states on an iaea resolution finding iran in noncompliance with its international obligations the vote brought waves of criticism from indian oppositi on parties and indepe ndent analysts who accused new delhi of betraying friendly count ry by capitulating to us pressure in january 2006 the us ambassador to india explicitly linked progress on proposed us india civil nuclear cooperation with indias upcoming iaea vote saying if india chose not to side with the united states he believed the usindia initiative would fail in

should not be interpreted as detracting from indias traditionally close relations with iran overt us pressure may have made it more difficult for new delhi to carry out the policy it had already chose n some independent observers saw indias iaea votes as demonstrating new delhis st rategic choice to strengthen partnership with washington even at the cost of its friendship with tehran in july 2006 the house passed legislation hr 5682 to enable proposed us civil nuclear cooperation with india the bill contained nonbinding language on securing indias cooperation with us policy toward iran an

from pakistan during the conflict following the war iran began rebuilding its conventional arse nal with purchases of tanks combat aircraft and ships from russia and china major purchases from india were reported during this time however iran reportedly turned to india in 1993 to help develop batteries for the three kiloclass submarines iran had bought from russia the submarine batteries provided by the russians were not appropriate for the warm waters of the pe rsian gulf and india had substantial experience operating kilos in warm water there have been expectations that iranindia military ties would further expand under the 2003 new delhi declaration in wh ich the two countries decided to explore opportunities for cooperation in defense nd agreed areas including training and exchange of visits10 some experts see this as pa rt of broad strategic cooperation between two powers in the persian gulf and arabian sea but the cooperation has generally stalled since it was signed and s not evolved into noteworthy strategic alliance instead the coopera tion appears to represent ma nifestation of generally good indoiranian relations and an opportunity to mutually enhance their potential to project power in the region india had reportedly hoped the declaration would pave the way for indian sales to iran of upgrades of iran s russianmade conventional weapons systems major new iranindia deals along these lines have not materialized to date but iran reportedly has sought indian advice on operating irans missile boats refitting irans t72 tanks and armored personnel carriers and
