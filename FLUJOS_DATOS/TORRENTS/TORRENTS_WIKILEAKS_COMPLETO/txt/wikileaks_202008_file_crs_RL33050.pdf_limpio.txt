legislative context the context within which conferees will consider the two versions of hr 3199 includes three elements first concern about current dhs practices in allocating homeland security

resources based on risk and vulnerability and third the provisions of hr 3199 as passed by the house which would establish riskbased method for distributing grants1 current dhs practice since fy2003

factors dhs should use in determining state and local allocations of homeland s ecurity assistance since population could be considered risk factor it is possibl that dhs could allocate funding in fy2006 in the same manner as it allocated funding in fy2003 fy2004 and fy2005 dhs secretary michael chertoff testified however before the house homeland security committee in april 2005 that funding to st ates and localities for homeland security assistance should be based on specific risks instead of states population percentage of the national population18 dhs secretary chertoff however did not specify what risk factors should be used policy questions the development and implementation of riskbased di stribution formula including or excluding guaranteed ba and minimum amounts raise some policy questions that may confr ont conferees on hr 3199 guaranteed minimum versus guaranteed base both hr 3199 as passed by the house and pl 10990 would guarantee to each state certain percentage of the total appropriation housepassed hr 3199 would guarantee each state minimum pl 10990 guarantees each state base on the surface the two terms may appear to be similar but they differ in that each is associated with distinctive allocation method minimum as defined in hr 3199 is the smallest amount each state would receive after riskbased state allocations are determined were the riskbased calculations to result in any state allocation less that the statutorily defined minimum the allocations of states receiving more than the minimum would be reduced proportionally so that all states would receive at least the minimum base as defined in pl 10990 is an am ount guaranteed to each state without regard to risk after allocation of base amounts to states pl 10990 silent on how the remainder of total appropriations is to be allocatedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33050crs6 the present allocation of federal homeland security assistance and the allocation method in pl 10990 which includes base was criticized by the 911 commission which referred to the base as revenue sharing without regard to states risk of terrorist attacks some however argue that the base allocation is way to ensure that each state receives some sort of homeland security funding and is prepared at some level for terrorist attacks as conferees negotiate to resolve h ouse and senate differences on hr 3199 they may opt to consider whether to gislate the grant allocation method with guaranteed base or guaranteed minimum that is they may choose to decide whether to provide every state with the same amount of base funding and then allocate the remainder of total appropriations based on risk or b to allocate total appropriations based on risk and then if state does not receive certain amount or percentage minimum provide additional funding to the state to meet this amount or percentage with pr oportional reduction of funding to the other states comparison of funding and base amounts table 1

fundamental policy question associated with riskbased funding is what risk factors to use in determining the allocation of federal homeland security assistance examples of possible risk factors incl ude perceived threats homeland security capabilities population size critical infrastru cture assets and tr ansportation assets to accurately assess the risk factors one would need to determine the threat to the population critical infrastructure nd transportation nd determine the consequences of such threat additionally the homeland security capabilities needed to prevent respond to and recove r from terrorist attacks and natural and technical disasters would need to be assessed the methods of threat and vulnerability assessment suggest variety of factors that might be used in devising riskbased funding formula for allocating homeland security assi stance to states and localities see appendix for list of possible threat homeland security capability population critical infrastructure

terrorism rather than on natural and technical disasters the majority of dhss grant programs emphasize preparing for responding to and recovering from terrorist attacks23 as an example the administra tions fy2006 budget request proposed that assistance to firefighters grant program fire applications that enhance terrorism response capabilities should be given priority24 as conferees negotiate house and senate differences on homeland security grant funding they may be asked to consider not only the grant allocation method but also the inclusion of specific natural and technical disaster risks in the funding distribution formula possible issues in c onsidering this type of change include potential implementation difficulties in adding natural and technical disaster risks to the

prior to september 11 2001 the federal governments role in supporting emergency preparedness and management was limited primarily to providing guidance and grants for planning mitigation and equipment before largescale disasters like floods hurricanes and earthquakes and response and recovery assistance after such disasters since september 11 2001 the federal government has awarded billions of dollars to state and local governments for planning equipment and training to enhance the capabilities of first responders to respond to terrorist attacks and to lesser extent natural and accidental disasters27 the gao report stated as well that offi cials from four first responder agencies reported that dhs required too much emphasis on terrorismrelated activities in requests for equipment and training the first responder agencies also reported that they had greater need for assistance in preparing for natural and technical disasters than for terrorist attacks28 also the national commission on terrori st attacks upon the united states recommended in the 911 commission report that dhs should make homeland security funding contingent on adoption by emergency response agencies of an all hazards incident command system ics29 on september 14 2005 the 911 commission issued status report on its r ecommendations and stated in the event of terrorist attack or natural disaster clear lines of command and control for responding authorities are ssential to minimize civilia n and responder casualties30 further allhazards emergency planning was emphasized by president bush in televised speech on september 15 2005 he said our cities must have clear and uptodate plans for responding to natural disasters and disease outbreaks or terrorist attack for evacuating large numbers of people in an emergency and for providing the food and water and security they need31 the conferees might be urged to review the purpose and authorized activities of the dhs homeland security assistance

nov 2002 wollongong australiab increased funding to empg fire and ccp b ecause these programs provide allhazards protections on the other nd the conferees might opt to maintain the current focus of the majority of dhs homeland security assistance programs on terrorism threats the inclusion of natural and technical disaster factors in funding formula might result in states and localities being better prepared for all hazards not just terrorism an allhazards f unding approach could allow st ates and localities to train conduct exercises and purchase equipment that is suited equally to natural and technical disasters and terrorist attacks this allhazards approach however might arguably result in funding formula that provides disproportiona amount of funding to st ates and localities that have low threat of terrorism but high threat of natural and tec hnical disasters if congress were to include natu ral and technical disaster ri sks in the funding formula it might consider prioritizing state and local recipients based on risks natural and terrorist that threaten hi ghly populated states and cities economic sectors and critical infrastructure of national importan ce the objective of this prioritization would be to ensure that homeland secur ity funding considers not only natural and terrorism risks but also the na tional consequences of the risks evaluating potential risk factors in considering risk factors however congress is faced with question of what criteria to use when assessing potential riskbased formula variables risk factors include threats the entity threatened and the consequences of the threat to the specified entity the assessment of potential risk factors is appropria tely considered against the following criteria 32 1 validity do the factors serve as measures or indicators of threats the vulnerability of the potential target or pot ential consequence if catastrophe strikes the target for example does higher popul ation density indicat greater vulnerability to an attack involving weapon of mass dest ruction what attributes associated with densely populated areas such as numbers of law enforcement personnel on duty the presence of sensors cameras and other t echnology would reduce the validity of the factor 2 relevance what is the relationship between the factors and the identified items or characteristics is the relationship straightforward or is it murky for example the total number of vehicles tr aveling through midcity tunnel would probably not be especially pertinent to consideration of the risk of hazardous material accident the number of commerc ial trucks carrying hazardous material however would be more relevanthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33050crs16 3 reliability the quality of the source of the information used in risk assessment process requires consideration for example population data from the us census bureau are generally regarded as reliable and are used in variety of formulas for allocating aid grants 4 timeliness the currency of the data affects the quality of the discussion on potential risks for example daily intelligence reports that provide information on current terrorist threats would be considered more timely than monthly or quarterly report 5 availability data necessary for the risk f actors use as formula variable should arguably be readily and publicly ava ilable intelligence information that has been classified by the federal government and not shared with state and local officials would fail to satisfy this criterion authority to select risk factors who should identify the risk factors th at will determine funding is another fundamental policy question housepasse d hr 3199 proposes risk factors that dhs is to consider but it proposes to give large degree of discretion to dhs even though the house version of hr 3199 proposes list of risk factors for the first responders grants board to evaluate and prioritize it proposes that the dhs secretary use discretion in th final determination of ri skbased funding allocations to states and localities pl 10990 doe s not identify any risk factors for dhs consider thus providing dhs with complete discretion in determining what factors to use in allocating homeland security assistance one might argue that this discretion could result in dhs using population as the only risk factor in determining shsgp and letpp state allocations given the importance of data availab ility and timeliness as criteria congress may not be in position to accurately determine specific risk factors however because of its oversight responsibilities c ongress might opt to review dhss risk based methodology and riskbased distributi on formula the oversight could address the weight given to risk factors specific threats to key assets and critical infrastructure and plausible consequences to identified th reats on the other hand by allowing large degree of discretion to dhs in allocating federal homeland security assistance congress may not be able to determine at least in open hearings the reasoning behind the distribution of funding to states and localitieshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33050crs17 33 see federal emergency management agen cy 2004 major disaster declarations available at httpwwwfemagovnewsdisastersfemayear2004 visited sept 28 2005appendix potential risk factors discussion examples of possible risk factors incl ude perceived threats homeland security capabilities population size critical infrastru cture assets and tr ansportation assets in order to accurately assess risk one would need to determine the threat to the population critical infrastructure assets and transportation assets among other factors and determine the c onsequences of such threat additionally the homeland security capabilities needed to prevent re spond to and recover from terrorist attacks and natural and technical disast ers would need to be assessed threats homeland security threats facing the nation can be divided into terrorist attacks and natural and technical such as an accide ntal chemical spill disasters for terrorist threat to be valid intelligence or other indicators would have to show the plausibility of the threat the riskassessment criterion of availability of data may be crucial here restricted access to data due to for example security classification of intelligence information may cause some to question the validity of the threat additionally dhs is responsible for preparing for responding to and recovering from natural and technical disast ers one could argue that recent history has shown the nation is threatened more by natural and technical disasters than by terrorist attacks the 67 major disaster declarations in 2004 and hurricanes katrina and rita lend credibility to this argument33 potential terrorist threats include the following biological and chemical agents wmd incidents sniper and shooting incidents and car and suicide bombers potential natural and technical disaster threats include the following hurricanes flooding earthquakes landslides and accidental hazardous material

vulnerabilities and the consequences of terrorist attacks and natural and technical disasters once the assessments are completed government officials first responders and other key stakeholde rs can

terrorist attacks and disasters counterterrorism training natural and technical disaster training identified personnel with assign ed prevention response and recovery tasks personnel protective equipment interoperable communicati ons equipment and plans emergency medical response plans and equipment and hospital mass casualty plans and equipment population population population referring here to the number of people in each state relative to the nation as whole is arguably suitable factor since relatively larger number of people can be considered greater risk population density population density here the average number of persons per square mile in each state can be considered viable factor since weapon of mass destruction wmd attack in an area with high population density could result in greater number of casualties than in an area with low population density critical infrastructure nuclear power plants and nonpower reactors nuclear power plants have been identified by number of observers as potential terrorist targets these in clude decommissioned nuclear power plants and nonpower reactors whic h are typically used in research and training facilities34 seaports given the possibility of wmd smuggling and the consequent potential for disrup ting the national economy many observers have identified seaports as type of critical infrastructure that should be risk factor chemical facilities given the probable consequences of terrorist attacks on chemical facilities or the theft of toxic chemical agentshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33050crs19 chemical facilities could be risk factor especially due to the location of some chemical facilitie s in high population density areas military facilities pointing to the september 2001 terrorist attack on the pentagon in arlington virginia some observers suggest that military facilities should be included in riskbased distribution formula such facilities may contain large numbers of military personnel highvalue equipmen t and volatile chemicals and explosives such as ammunition federal facilities some observers cite the 1995 bombing of the alfred p murrah building in oklahoma city as evidence that civilian federal facilities are potential terrorist targets the consequences of terrorist attacks on federal facilities would worsen if the attacks disrupted the federal response to attacks or led to the disruption of vital federa l government operations dams dams could be included in riskbased dist ribution formula since terroristcaused explosion could potentially release high volume of water into populous areas destroy any ectrical energy production at the dam and cause significant economic damage electrical power plants nonnuclear the likely economic and psychological consequences of rrorist attacks on electrical power plants might be consideration in designating power plants as risk factor food and agricultural centers terrorist attacks on the nations food supply and agricultural producti on might be risk considering the possible economic and psycholog ical effects of the attacks oil and natural gas refineries and pipelines even though the majority of oil and natural gas re fineries and pipeline distribution systems are located in low populati on density areas terrorist attacks on them could have severe economic and environmental consequences financial centers one could point to the elevation of the homeland security advisory system to high in august 2004 when financial institutions were identified as possible targets of terrorist attacks as reason to c onsider the centers risk factors additionally an interruption of ope rations in the nations financial centers could have possibl economic consequences transportation assets rail and mass transit systems arguably the 2004 and 2005 terrorist bombings of trains in madrid and london could cause some to identify rail and mass transit systems as risk factor bridges and tunnels given the nations vast number of bridges and tunnels considering every one of them risk factor is not feasible major bridges and tunnels such as the brooklyn and golden gate bridges and the ho lland tunnel might be considered risk factors due to their cultural significance additionally bridges and tunnels that are important links in transportation routes for large numbers of persons might qualify as risk factorshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33050crs20 airports one could point to the ptember 2001 terrorist attacks and the use of commercial aircraft as weapon as valid argument for considering airports risk factor not only are airports at risk of terrorists boarding aircraft and us ing them as weapons but also some may argue an attack on crowded airport or the shooting down of an aircraft while it is landi ng or taking off further increases the risk and the consequences of an attack other factors stadiums and arenas because they conentrate large number of persons in relatively small cation stadiums and arenas especially during significant events such as sports championship games could be considered risk factor educational institutions arguably the psychological consequences of terrorist attacks would be greatly increased if terrorists were to target educational institutions at the elementary secondary or college level given the sense of vulnerability parents would experience following any such attack educational institutions might be considered risk factor how ever like bridges and tunnels the vast number of educational institutions in the nation might hamper the assessment of risk to these institutions skyscrapers and large commercial buildings as with the attack on the pentagon in september 2001 the attack on the world trade center towers with its economic and psychological consequences arguably identifies skyscrapers and large commercial buildings as valid risk factors international borders and coastlines it can be argued that states with international borders and coas tlines face greater risk of terrorist attacks because terrorists may have greater access to such states tourism due to the potential for mass casualty incidents and economic damage from terrorist attacks tourist locations are possible risk factor in addition to the location of tourist destinations the tourist population could possibly be considered risk factor
