for released sex offenders summary monitoring the movement of sex offenders in communities continues to be of interest to congress state legislatures nd local governments in response to some citizens concerns congress passed the adam walsh child protec tion and safety act of 2006 pl 1 09248 whic h among other provisions provides for mandatory registration of sex offenders who are rel eased from prison closer scrutiny of them and community notification of their whereabouts through the community notification process the pub lic has more knowledge of wh ere sex offenders reside at least 23 states and hundreds of local gove rnments have passed ws to prohibit sex offenders who must register as such fro m living within specified distance of particular area often rest ricted areas include parks playgrounds recreation centers swimming pools schools bus stops libraries convenience stores and other facilities that serve large numbers of persons under 18 years of age with passage of the adam walsh act congress sought to ensure through the registration process that released sex offe nders are monitored properly so that they are longer threat to the public opponent s of state and local residence restriction laws argue that they greatly affect th ability of sex offenders to obtain housing employment education and health services the inability of many released sex offenders to obtain work and other servi ces contributes to their becoming homeless consequently without an address for ffenders it becomes very difficult for law enforcement to track them on the other hand proponents of the laws state that their primary concern is protection of childre n from predators not the inconvenience of some sex offenders possible oversight issues related to residence restrictions include their impact on public safety and how regi stration provisions of the walsh act are actually implemented to determine if they conform to congressional intent findings of studies commissioned by colo rado and minnesota influenced their approach to residence restriction laws colorado chose not to enact residence restriction law the colorado study addr essed safety issues raised by living arrangements of sex offenders in the community it found that for sex offenders under the supervision of criminal justice re sidence restriction ws may not deter the offender from sexual reoffending and s hould not be considered as method to control sexual offending recidivism it also found that sex offenders with good support systems had lower recidivism rates than those with poor or support system in addressing resi dence restriction for sex ffenders minnesota enacted law but does not impose sp ecific distance restrictions on where sex offender can live it requires the agency responsible for supervising high risk offender to consider the proximity of the offenders residence to other high risk offenders as well as to schools the minnesota study examined the effect of using housing restrictions to reduce sexual recidivism this study f ound that when offenders seek victim through direct contact the offe nders were more likely to leave their neighborhood to commit an offense nd that residential proximity is not major factor in reducing sexual recidivism but that social or relationship proximity is this report analyzes the issue of reside nce restriction laws for released sex

strangers rarely sexually ffend young juveniles in 2000 strangers were reported as offenders in 3 of sexual assaults of victims who were under age 6 5 of the sexual assaults of youth from 6 through 11 years of age and 10 of assaults of juveniles from 12 to 17 years of age according to doj the vast majority of sex offenses against minors are perpetrated by someone the child knows such as biologically related immediate family member relative friend or babysitter2 yet many people remain fearful that child is more likely to be sexually assaulted or abducted by stranger than from someone the child knows in the past few years the media have gi ven national coverage to number of sex crimes perpetrated by strangers against children including those against jetseta gage of cedar rapids iowa 2005 jessica l unsford 2005 sarah lunde 2005 and carlie brucia 2004 all of florida elizabeth smar t of utah 2002 and samantha runnion of california 2002 in addition two notable sexual assaults by repeat sex offenders against young adult women dru sjodin in north dakota 2003 and alexandra nicole zapp in massachus etts 2002 were widely reported3 both federal and state governments have enacted laws with provisions that increase penalties for crimes against children require sex offenders released from prison to register and require law enforcement to monitor them with passage of these laws

sex offende rs be more closely monitored consequently to protect pub lic safety many states counties and municipalities have passed laws that restrict where released sex offender can live and sometimes work these state and municipal laws vary greatly sometimes conflict with each other and do not always recognize the various risk levels of sex offender reoffending possible issues for congress are whether residence restriction laws for released sex offe nders actually protect public safety and whether sex offender registration and community notifi cation provisions of the adam

residence at the state and local level elected officials have responde d to the concern of some re sidents by passing laws and ordinances that use the registration and community notification requirements of the walsh act to identify sex offenders and to prohibit them from living in certain areas the objective of these legal restrictions is to deter child sex offenders from having direct access to children depending on the state where the sex offense occurs however residence restriction laws can apply to individuals who have been convicted of wide range of offenses from rape of child

question of how to respond if sex offender attends church the state law does not define l oitering consequently it is unclear whether sex offender on the re gistry can attend worship or bible study join support groups or particip ate fully in church activities15 legal challenges to georgias residence restriction law included charges that it denied due process violated religious fr eedom and interfered w ith property rights16 on november 21 2007 in the case of mann v department of corrections 17 the georgia supreme court ruled that residence restrictions could constitute regulatory taking of property however in the same case the court found that as applied to business owner restriction on the owner working at his place of business need not be found to be such taking passage of an iowa state residence rest riction law which pr ohibits sex offenders from living within 2000 feet of school or childcare center was followed by cities and counties passing stringent ordinances that bar sex

residence restriction violation in ohio is injunctive relief19 state studies while state laws that restrict where sex offenders can live loiter and work are widespread questions remain as to whether the public is safer as result of them before enacting resi dence restriction laws for sex offenders few states commissioned studies to determine if the laws were likely to reduce the chances of child being victimized by sex offender colorado the state of colorado authorized the colorado division of criminal justice office of domestic violence and sex offender management to research whether there is relationship between the living arrangements of sex offender where the offender lives and th commission of sexual crimes the study focused on random sample of released sex offenders in the denver metropolitan area who were under probation supervision as well as an allinclusive sample of those living in shared living arrangement sla20 over 15month period21 the colorado study found that highrisk sex offenders living in slas had significantly fewer violations than those in other living arrangements sex offenders in the study who reoffended while being supe rvised did not live any closer to schools or child care centers than those who were not recidivists further the study found that sex offenders who committed criminal offense while under the supervision of the criminal justice system seemed to be randomly scattered throughout the study areas that is they did not appear to liv any closer to schools and child care centers than other types of offenders consequently the study c oncluded that restrictions on where sex offenders who are under correctiona l supervision reside may not deter the sex offender from reoffending and should not be considered as method to control sexual offender recidivism22 the colorado study also examined the support system for sex offenders it defined support as h aving someone significant to the offender andor roommate who attends

reoffense patterns of 224 recidivists released between 1990 and 2002 who were reincarcerated for sex crime prior to 200625 to determine if the 224 cases might have been affected by re sidency restrictions the study used the following four basic criteria offenders had to establish direct contact with the victims rather than gaining access to victim through relationship with another person girlfriend fiancee wife acquaintance contact with the victim had to occur within at least one mile of theoffenders residence at the time of offense the location of the initial contact with victim had to have beennear school park daycare center or other prohibited area and the victim had to have been under 18 years of age when the offense occurred among other factors examined in this study were the relationship between the victim and the sex offender the distance between the offenders residence and the location of the offense whether nd what physical force was us ed and whether the offender had used alcohol or drugs using these cr iteria the study concluded that none of the 224 sex offenses would likely have been deterred by reside nce restriction law26 some results of the minne sota study include of the 224 sex offenses 85 occurre d in residential location for example the offenders or the victims home while 15 took place in public location half of the sex offenders gained access to their victims through collateral contact with for instan ce girlfriend wife coworker friend or acquaintance and fourteen percent of the sex offende rs were biologically related to their victims

officials claim the local restrictions are ineffective and hard to enforce32 their objections include concerns that enforcement of these restrictive regulations could uproot so many sex offe nders

state and local residence restriction laws for released sex offenders may have some surprising and perhaps unintended c onsequences for both law enforcement and sex offenders impact on law enforcement in the case of law enforcement these laws can impact plea agreements plea agreements are often made in sex offender cases because without them cases must go to tr ial and thus must re ly on victims who may not wish to testify some prosecutors report having more difficulty convicting alleged sex offenders because once offenders discover that they will be subject to residence requirements if they are convicte d they resist plea agreements to the extent this is accurate it could reduce prosecutors chances of getting conviction for sex crime42 parole and probation officer s complain that they have to find housing for offenders and local residen ce restriction laws make it much more difficult for them to do so california law states that an inmate who is released on parole shall be returned to the county that was the last gal residence of the inmate prior to his or her incarceration43 notwithstanding this provision the law provides that an inmate may be returned to nother county if that would be in the best interests of the public44 reportedly mike jime nez president of the ca lifornia parole officers union has stated that it will be impossibl for parole agents to enforce jessicas law in certain areas and encouraging transient living arrangements just allows sex offenders to avoid it altogether45 according to this report in san francisco all homes are within 2000 feet of school

2007 p a1 proponents some supporters of restrictiv residence laws for sex offenders defend them by stating that while enfor cement of the laws may inconvenience some sex offenders their primary purpose is to protect children from predators53 some proponents of residence rest riction laws argue that while there are studies indicating that residency limits on sex offenders reduce the number of sex crimes common sense and public anxiety make it smart idea to ban former offenders from areas where children gather54 others believe more time needs to elapse before the value of residence restriction laws can be determined and that it is too early to consider repeal of such laws55 opponents those who oppose restrictive re sidence laws for sex offenders argue that there is correlation betw een someones residence and likelihood of reoffending56 moreover they argue that this legislation does not protect children from being victimized by people they know who comprise from 80 to 90 of all child sex abuse cases57 some law enforcement officials in iowa reportedly described state and local residence require ments as feelgood laws which heap work on law enforcement while doing nothi ng to make children more safe58 according to the southern center for human rights and some law enforcement officers rather than protecting children georgias reside nce restriction law actually made them more vulnerable because it drove sex offenders from urban areas into isolated and poorly monitored ones59 opponents of restrictive reside nce laws charge that they are too inclusive failing to make distinctions among sex offenders depending on the state sex offense can range from exhib itionism urinating in public incest rape and pedophilia they urge that these laws should target offenders who

the new york times october 3 2005 p b1state that they unfairly target persons who have served their sentence and turned their lives around61 alternative proposals for monitoring released sex offenders using residence restrictions to prohib it released sex offenders from living in areas children frequent is not the only wa to potentially deter sex offenders from sexually reoffending some alternative proposals to this approach include improving how an offender is targeted for special monitoring reducing the size of the restricted area improving the support system for an offender and bette r educating the public about who is more likely to sexually vi ctimize minor there is some support for using global positioning systems gps to monitor sex offenders gps enables law enforcement to detect sex offenders cation and whether the offender has entered restricted area some believe that this system is well suited for tracking sexual predators and other violent highrisk offenders others however express concern about the high cost of using gps for tracking purposes62 proposal supported by both the iowa county attorneys association and the iowa state sheriffs and deputies associ ation would allow sex offenders to reside where they wish but would require them to acquire written permission before entering safe zones around schools or ch ildcare centers another proposal would refine and enhance provisions of residence restriction laws that target sexual predators providing for the most serious offenders to be tracked closely and increasing funding for prevention efforts that would be directed at both adults and children63 it has also been suggested that offlimit areas need to be made smaller in doing so it would be easier for offende rs to find housing outside the zone and there still could be buffer around childrens areas64 laura ahearn director of parents for megans law advocates long er prison sentences and some form of supervision for life for convicted sex offenders65 shared living arrangement sla for re leased sex offenders as used in the colorado study discussed earlier in this report is another possible approach to monitoring sex offenders under sla two or three sex offenders reside in house that has been approved in advance by the treatment provider and supervising officer the sex offenders must notify the appropr iate authorities if housemate has contact with children or violates any other rules cited advantage of sla is that it allows for both the treatment and mon itoring of sex offenders httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34353crs16 conclusions research on whether residence restriction laws actually reduce the recidivism rate of sex offenders is limited the results of studies commissioned by two states however provide some unders tanding of the relationship between where sex offender resides and xually offends the colorado st udy indicated that restricting where sex offender who is under supervis ion lives may not deter the offender from sexual reoffending and should not be used as method to control sexual recidivism in addition the study found that sex offe nders with good support system violated fewer rules and had lower reci divism rates than those with poor or support system the minnesota study found that sex offenders who seek direct contact with victim usually leave their neig hborhood to co mmit an offense to minimize the chance of being recognized also the minnesota study found that social or relationship proximity had greater impact on sexual recidivism than residential proximity residence restrictions for sex offenders ma not be the most effective way to protect public safety in light of the findings of these two studies the debate on the use of residential proximity to protect the public from sex offenders may be expanded to include social or relationship proximity as well as other factors because of residence restriction laws x offenders often end up in rural areas many rural areas lack the law enforcem ent personnel and res ources to adequately monitor sex offenders consequently some sex offenders are poorly monitored and may more easily threaten public safety federal courts and generally state courts have rule d that efforts to protect the public have higher value or priority than sex offender registra nts need to freely choose place to live because hundreds of jurisdictions have enacted residence restriction laws often the ws are confusing to sex ffenders and cast doubt in the minds of some on whether they are indeed protecting the public from sex offenders the legality of many local residence restriction ordinances is being challenged especially if they exceed or conflict with st ate laws for instance new jersey state law megans law prohibits the registrati on status of sex offender from being used to deny housing or other accommodations this law has enabled the state of new jersey to legally challenge local residence restriction laws the georgia supreme court found that as applied to homeown er residence restri ction could constitute regulatory taking of property however in the same case the court found that as applied to business owner restriction on the owner working at his place of business need not be found to be such taking of property in the walsh act congress directed the attorney general to conduct study that evaluates the effectiveness of monitoring and restricting the activities of sex offenders to reduce sex offe nse recidivism among othe r considerations the study is to specifically evaluate the effectiveness of monitoring and restricting the activities of sex offenders including restrictions on th areas in which sex offenders can reside work and attend school many state and local residence re striction laws conflict with each other and do not recognize the different risk levels of sex offenders reportedly as result of these laws some sex offende rs are not registering as required under the walsh act and consequently are not bein g monitored possible oversight issues include monitoring and restricting the activities of sex offenders especially wherehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34353crs17 they can reside work and
