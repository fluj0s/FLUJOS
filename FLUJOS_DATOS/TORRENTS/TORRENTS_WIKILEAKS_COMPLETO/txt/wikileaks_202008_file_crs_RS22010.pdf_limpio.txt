wikileaks document release httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22010 february 2 2009 congressional research service report rs22010 social security transition costs laura haltzel domestic social policy division july 25 2007 abstract some policy analysts have suggested that prefunding social security beneﬁts through individual accounts ias could improve the solvency of the current system thus reducing or eliminating the need for higher taxes lower beneﬁts or increased borrowing however there is general agreement among economists that any transition to prefunded system results in additional costs socalled transition costs in the shortrun most social security tax revenues are immediately used to fund payments to current social security beneﬁciaries therefore system of individual accounts that is funded by diverting part of the current social security tax into individual accounts will worsen the ﬁscal imbalance of social security and the overall budget at least temporarily over 75year period individual accounts could improve the unfunded liability of the social security system by 08 trillion or worsen it by up to 46 trillion depending on how the account is structured however beyond the 75year actuarial period the beneﬁt oﬀset feature of most individual accounts would ultimately cover these transition costs and improve the longterm solvency of the social security system leading some to refer to transition costs as transition investmentshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs220101 the analysis in this report presents the effe ct on solvency of the ia component of reform proposals int the 108th congress see table 1 since the ssas office of the chief actuary has not published actuarial memoranda on any of the social security reform proposals introduced in the 110th congress we are unable to update table 1 of this report accordingly as the analysis in table 1 is based on the 2003 and 2004 trustees report assumptions we use these assumptions throughout the report order code rs22010 updated july 25 2007 social security transition costs laura haltzel specialist in social security domestic social policy division summary the chief actuary of the social security administration ssa forecasts that under current law the social security trust funds will be depleted in 20421 many members of congress have expressed concern that restoring the program to longterm fiscal balance will impose burdens on future generations by requiring them to pay higher taxes accept benefit cuts or undertake substantia l government borrowing to pay the full benefits promised under current law some policy analysts have suggested that prefunding social security benefits through individual accounts ias could improve the solvency of the current system thus reducing or eliminating the need for higher taxes lower benefits or increased borrowing however there is general agreement among economists that any transition to prefunded system results in additional costs socalled transition costs in the shortrun most social security tax re venues are immediately used to fund payments to current social security be neficiaries therefore sy stem of individual accounts that is funded by diverting part of the current social security tax into individual accounts will worsen the fiscal imbalance of social security and the ove rall budget at least temporarily over 75year period i ndividual accounts could improve the unfunded liability of the social security system by 08 trillion or worsen it by up to 46 trillion depending on how the account is structure d however beyond the 75year actuarial period the benefit offset feature of most individual accounts w ould ultimately cover these transition costs and improve the longterm solvency of the social security system leading some to refer to transition costs as transition investments this report will be updated as legislativ developments occurhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22010crs2 2 social security is longer purely paygo system under purely paygo system the annual taxes taken in from current workers and employers approximately equal the annual benefits paid out however in the 1983 social curity amendments the social security payroll tax was increased in order to build social secu rity surplus which was intended to improve the ability of the program to pay benefits in the fu ture particularly to the baby boom generation this partial build up of reserves is referred to as partially advance funding since its inception in 1935 financing for the oldage survivors and disability insurance oasdi program more commonly known as social security has been based primarily on the concept of payasyougo or paygo2 under the paygo system the social security contributions of todays workers fund the social security retirement survivor or disabled worker benefits of todays beneficiaries congress selected this method of financing because of the great num ber of older americans who were living in poverty at the time of the great depression congress decided that this generation of older persons should receive so cial security benefits desp ite not having contributed to the system because of the severity of the economic situation at th time and because most of them would not have been able to find employment and then contribute to the system long enough to be ligible for benefits as result of the paygo system most of social securitys annual revenues are immediately paid out as benefits to current retirees survivors or disabled workers social securitys annual revenues come from three main sources the payroll tax on earnings the fica federal insurance contributions act tax and the seca selfemployment contributions act tax inte rest earned on the treasury bonds held by the trust funds and revenues from the taxation of social secu rity benefits in 2003 social security revenues equaled 632 billion and social s ecurity outlays totaled 479 billion or 75 of revenues thus in 2003 social secur ity had surplus of 153 billion or 25 of revenues these social security surplus dollars are not held by the social security trust funds rather according to law surplus receipt s are credited to the social security trust funds in the form of specialissue nonmark etable treasury bonds the actual surplus dollars are held by the us treasury where they become part of the general revenue pool and can be used to increase spending redu ce taxes or reduce the government debt unless these dollars are used to reduce governme nt debt they are not really being saved to pay for future social security benefits in recent years the social security surpluses have been used to offset increased spending or reduced taxes since the rest of the governments budget has been in deficit many economists have ggested that switching from paygo system to fully prefunded system would increase the governments ability to pay future benefits because payroll taxes contribut ed to social security would increase savings instead of being spent by the government what are transition costs shifting from paygo system to pre funded system creates transition costs under prefunded system the do llars that are contributed by today s workers are used to pay benefits for todays workers when they retire currently todays workers contributions are being used to pay benefits to yesterdays workers thus in order to transition from paygo to pref unded system additional dollars must be found to continue payment of benefits to yesterdays workers most of the proposals that were introduced in the 108th congress would use system of individual accounts to accomplishhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22010crs3 3 prefunding can be accomplished in number of ways not only through ias for example if social securitys trust funds were invested in the market directly the surpluses would longer be spent by the government and the government coul d redeem real assets to pay benefits in future years 4 not all individual accounts would necessarily tail transition costs however these plans are financed on paygo basis and do not achieve prefunding of benefits for example in notional account system such as the one in sw eden the taxes paid in by todays workers are still paid out as benefits to current retirees the difference between this ia system and the ias being proposed in the us is that instead of actually taking contributions and investing them the system uses virtual account that record s the contributions and tracks what the growth would be had they been invested then when the individual retires the ia is paid out as if it had actually been invested and earned interest to ffset the additional cost to the government of paying out possibly higher returns on the contri butions these plans often simultaneously reduce the traditional defined benefit at retirement because new revenues are needed to fund the ias there are up front transition costs this prefunding3 any use of individual accounts to pr efund social secur ity benefits will necessarily impose additional costs at least temporarily because the nation will be paying for the social security benefits of current retirees and making contributions to current workers individual accounts4 many social security reform proposals th at include some type of individual account ia would redirect part of the currentlaw payroll tax into the individual accounts and are thus known as carveout accounts this diversion of revenues from social security would reduce the revenue available to pa annual benefits and would create an additional funding gap between currentlaw revenues and currentlaw ob ligations this additional cost is called transition cost because it aris as result of transition to system of individual accounts to the extent that the moneys diverted to the ias are smaller than the annual social security surplus in any gi ven year the carveout will not affect the annual payment of benef its but it would affect the annual revenue surplus and thus the accumulation of trust fund surplu ses reducing the trust f und surplus absent other changes to the program would hasten the date of social security insolvency if the funds carvedout of social security taxes exceed th annual social security revenue surplus it would hasten the date of insolvency furthe r because not only would the trust funds stop accumulating additional surpluses but trust fund bonds would have to be redeemed to cover benefit payments to current recipients in order to ffset the revenue lost to the social security trust funds by carving out pa rt of the social security tax and directing it into individual accounts add itional revenues would have to be raised either through increased taxes reductions in government sp ending or increased government borrowing transition costs are not unique to indi vidual accounts funded by carveout of social security taxes there would also be transition costs to system of addon individual accounts where ll revenues dedicated to fina ncing the currentlaw system continue to go for that purpose as with the carveout accounts contributions to fund addon accounts would have to be raised through increased taxes reductions in government spending or incr eased government borrowing under both carveout system and an ddon system of ias additional revenues must be found to fund the accounts under carveout sy stem revenues are needed to continue to fund currentlaw benefits or re imburse the trust funds as result of thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22010crs4 5 model 2 also included number of changes to the social security defined benefit for additional information on model 2 please see crs report rs21095 social security report of the presidents commission to strengthen social security by dawn nuschler 6 ssa office of the chief actuary memorandum to daniel patrick moynihan and richard d parsons cochairs presidents commission to strengthen social security jan 31 2002 7 for example see bush rules out higher payroll tax for social security the wall street journal dec 10 2004 8 this estimate is of the oasdi program on an open group basis meaning that it takes into account all contributions and benefits paid to pa st current and future participants through 2078revenues diverted to fund the ias under an addon system there is additional cost to the current social security sy stem but new revenues still woul d be needed to fund the ias directly in both cases the revenues needed to fund the ias represent an additional cost to the government as whole to individua ls the economy or all three depending on the source of the contributions how large are the transition costs the size of the transition costs will depend on the number of individuals who participate in the system and the amount contributed to the individual accounts the greater the number of people participating and the larger the contribution to the accounts the greater the transition costs will be in recent months numerous press reports have cited transition costs of pproximately 1 trilli on2 trillion over 10year period the president has not yet proposed specific refo rm proposal but some have suggested that the starting point for discussion would be model 2 of the 2001 presidential commission to strengthen social security model 2 would permit workers to contribute an amount equal to 4 of their oasdi taxable earnings 87900 in 2004 up to 1000 indexed to wages after 2002 into an individual account5 the ssas actuaries estimated in 2001 that the government would have to cont ribute 750 billion to 12 trillion over the first decade in constant 2003 dollars in order to fund the individual accounts depending on whether 67 or 100 of eligible workers participated in the accounts respectively6 some have argued that the 1 trillion2 trillion needed to transition to system of individual accounts is small relative to the unf unded liability of the cu rrent system cited in many newspaper artic as nearly 11 trillion7 however this comparison is misleading since the 1 trillion2 trillion figure is an estimate of the transition costs over 10 years while the nearly 11 trillion 104 trilli on figure is an estimate based on funding the program on an infinite horizon in order to obtain valid comparison of the costs of making the transition to system of individual accounts relative to the costs of maintaining the current system the period upon which the comparison is made must be equal and the costs must be discounted over time the soci security actuaries have estimated that the present value of the currentlaw unfunded obligation is 37 trillion over the 75year actuarial period that is the basis for all of their reform estimates8 the unfunded obligation is the difference between benefits which have been promised under current law and those that the system will be able to pay from currentlaw revenues by comparison over the same 75year period the net present value of the costs of the individual accounts proposed in model 2 excluding any reductions to currentlaw benefits that are not condition of pa rticipating in the individua l account system range from 15httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22010crs5 9 for example see final report of the presid ents commission to strengthen social security 10 for example see would borrowing 2 trillion for individual accounts eliminate 10 trillion in social security liabilities the center on budget and policy priorities dec 13 2004 trillion to 22 trillion depending on the level of partic ipation in the accounts thus the difference in costs is not the differen ce between 1 trillion2 trillion and 104 trillion but the difference between 15 trillion22 trillion and 37 trillion will transition to an individual account system result in savings to social security some observers have argued that the tran sition costs for new system of individual accounts is small relative to the contribu tions these accounts could make to social security solvency in the very longrun9 others argue that the individual accounts simply make the solvency situation worse10 one reason for these differing conclusions may be the timeframe used for the analysis the ssa actuaries selected 75year period for analysis of the programs solvency because it was felt that this was generally long enough to cover the anticipated retirement years of those currently in the work force others including the presidents commission have ar gued that the 75year period does not take into account the projected current law insolvency and the poten tial benefits of ias in the 76th year and beyond they propose using ither longer measurement period or an alternate accounting method such as an increasin g ratio of the number of years of benefits that can be funded at the end of the actuarial period most social security reform proposals w ould reduce social security benefits for those who participate in an individual acc ount in many cases including model 2 the increased value of the individual account itself does not reduce the unfunded liability of the current system the savings come from additional reductions in the social security benefits that individuals will r eceive if they have participated in an ia regardless of the type of investment and the act ual rate of return earned these reform proposals rely on these benefit offsets to pay for the upfront transition costs and reduce the costs of the social security system however as is evident from table 1 over the 75year period used by the social security actuaries to evaluate the systems solvency many individual accounts would make the solvency problem worse during this period the benefit offsets are not large enough to cover the ia trans ition costs thus it would be inaccurate to portray policymakers choices as either the currentlaw unfunded liability or the ia transition cost the cost of the transition to individual accounts is separate from and in addition to the systems current unf unded liability over this period for example with just the individual account component the 75year unfunded liability under model 2 would increase from 37 trillion to 52 trillion or 60 trillion however beyond the 75year actuarial period thes benefit offsets could improve social security solvency the main reason for the delay in realizing these savings is the time it would take for participants in the ia system to retire for example 21year old worker who enters the workforce in 2004 and c ontributes to an ia will not receive social security benefits until 2045 at the earliest th us while the costs of funding the ia are immediate the benefit offset designed to pay for funding the ia will not be realized until many years into the future we are unable to provide an estimate of an ias contributionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22010crs6 to solvency in the very long run because the official social security administration actuarial analysis stops at 75 years however in most cases by the 75th year of the ia the annual benefit offsets resulting from the ia are large and increasing to the extent that the present value of future benefit reductions exceeds the present value of the upfront additional costs of the ias over longer time horizon the accounts could contribute to reducing the unfunded liability of the current social security system

of the chief actuary available at httpwwwssagovoactsolvency indexhtml notes to isolate the net effects of the ia from the remainder of the reform proposal the calculation counts as transition cost the dollars put into the ia by the government and subtracts any dollars taken from the ia to help pay benefits over the 75year actuarial peri od this difference is the net transition cost these costs are then calculated in present value terms in or der to take account of the discounted future value of money this present value calculation assumes that tr ansfers to costs and from the ia offsets are made at the end of the year and assumes real interest rate of 3 which is consistent with the intermediate assumptions of the 2003 and 2004 trustees reports in the cases of reforms introduced in 2001 or 2002 the cost and savings streams were first converted from constant 2001 or 2002 dollars into constant 2003 dollars using the cpiw
