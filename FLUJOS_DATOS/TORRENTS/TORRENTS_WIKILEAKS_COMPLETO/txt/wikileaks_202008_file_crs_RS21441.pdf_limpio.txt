experience with past investigative program of the fede ral bureau of investigation fbi beginning in the early 1960s soviet intelligence services apparently sought to systematically collect unclassified information available in us libraries particularly scientific and other technical libraries the practice seems to have included research by soviet agents and the employment of innocent

and are forbidden to disclose the existence or specifics of the order press accounts of the library communitys misgivings mention features introduced by section 215 as well as those that predate its enactment they refer to the fact that fisa court proceedings are conducted behind closed doors and that record holders and other custodians of the tangible items c overed by fisa order are bound to
