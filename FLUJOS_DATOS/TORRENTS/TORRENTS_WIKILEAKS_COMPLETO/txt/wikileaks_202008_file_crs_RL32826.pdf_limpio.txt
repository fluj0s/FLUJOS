how best to help speed medical devices to consumers if they are safe and effective and correct them or keep them from consumers if they are not medical device may be anything from tongue depressor to pacemaker in order to be legally marketed in the united states medical devices must be approved by the food and drug administration fda the agency responsible for protecting the public health by assuring the safety efficacy and security of human medical devices and other products fda s center for devices and radiological health cdrh is prim arily responsible for medical device review the regulation of medical devices can affect their cost quality and availability in the health care system during reviews fda classifies devices accordin g to the risk they pose to consumers if premarket review is warranted by the potential risk manufacturer must demonstrate that its device is safe and effective or substantially equivalent to device already on the market fda requires product manufacturers to register their facilities list their devices with fda and follow general controls requirements manufacturers of fdaapproved devices are required to report serious adverse events associated with the use of their devices to fda in addition tracking is required for some medical devices the medical device approval process is currently funded through direct fda appropriations from congress and increasingly through user fees collected from applicants fda s authority to collect user fees originally authorized in 2002 pl 107250 has been reauthorized in fiveyear increments it will next expire on october 1 2012 under the terms of the fda amendments act of 2007 pl 11085 number of medical device related topics are of interest to members of the 111 th congress these include the

dimensions to the central medical device issue confronting congress how to speed medical devices to consumers if they are safe and effective and correct them or keep them from consumers if they are not the goals of device availability and device safety may exert opposite pulls with implications for consumers the health care system and the economy investment in medical device development reportedly reached new high of 2934 billion in 2006 and climbed dramatically again in 2007 to 4120 billion however investment slowed considerably in 2008 reaching only 285 billion during the first three quarters of the year 1 the products generated by the nations venture capital backed biotechnology and medical devices and equipment sectors supported nearly 494000 highskilled highwage jobs in 20062 manufacturers make decisions about pursuing new devices based in part on the cost of their development additional regulatory requirements may escalate these costs while other incentives such as tax breaks or market exclusivity extensions may diminish them if the device development cost is too high the eventual result may be that consumers are denied access because new products are not developed or brought to market access problems have led to proposals for and the enactment of incentives to develop medical devices for rare diseases and pediatric populations however if the regulation and oversight of device development are not stringent enough unsafe or ineffective products may reach the market and cause harm to consumers troubles related to medical devices can have serious consequences for consumers problems with the procedures and equipment for hiv human immunodeficiency virus and hepatitis c laboratory tests led to hundreds of incorrect test results in 2004 3 defects in other types of medical devices such as pacemakers defibrillators and coronary stents have caused patient deaths 4 consequences such as these have raised questions as to whether adequate enforcement tools resources and processes are in place to ensure that marketed devices are safe the federal agency primarily responsible for ensuring the safety and effectiveness of medical devices and certain other products drugs and biologics for example is the food and drug administration fdaone agency within the department of health and human services hhs manufacturer must receive fda permission before its device can be legally marketed in the united states fdas center for devices an d radiological health cdrh is primarily responsible for medical device review one other center the

which are not discussed in detail have consequences for medical device regulation for example questions have arisen as to whether fdas budget is adequate for the agency to carry out its mission10 reports have emerged of fda scientists alleging that politics influenced medical device approvals and that agency scientists morale was declining11 in addition in several well publicized instances fda representatives failed to respond in timely and candid manner to congressional inquiries 12 in order to fully understand the medical device related legislative issues that congress faces some background information is illustrative this report provides an overview of the following medical devices and their manufacturers the history of fdaaa and other laws governing medical device regulation and the medical device approval process the final section surveys the devicerelated legislative issues of interest to congress

because of the wide variety of items that are categorized as medical devices they may be si mple tools used during medical examinations such as tongue depressors and thermometers they may be hightech lifesaving implants like pacemakers and coronary stents they may be machines used for diagnostic purposes like cat scans and eeg machines they may even be test kits used in laboratories or by consumer at home such as tests for pregnancy or blood glucose levels according to law medical device is an instrume nt apparatus implement machine contrivance implant in vitro reagent or other similar or related article including any component part or accessory that 1 does not achieve its primary intended purposes through chemical action within or on the body of humans or other animals 2 is not dependent upon being metabolized for the achievement of its primary intended purposes and 3 is one of the following recognized in the official national formulary or the united states pharmacopeia or

the cure mitigation treatment or prevention of disease in humans or other animals or intended to affect the structure or any function of the body of man or other animals13 the medical device market is highly fragmented surgical and medical supplies make up the largest sector followed by in vitro diagnostic products ivds which are laboratory tests cardiovascular devices orthopedic devices and diagnostic imaging14 although the largest companies dominate the market for devices in terms of sales it is often the small companies that make significant contribution to early innovation small companies often partner with larger companies to bring products to market because they often lack access to capital and the resources to conduct clinical trials and navigate the regulatory and reimbursement hurdles these characteristics of the medical device industry distinguish it from the drug industry which is less fragmented larger and dominated by larger companies the us medical device industry as whole is much smaller than the us pharmaceutical industry with estimated earnings of 816 billion in 2007 compared to the drug industrys estimated 2058 billion 15 as result device companies often do not have the economic or financial resources of multibillion dollar drug companies these distinctions between device and drug manufacturers may be relevant in some regulatory discussions incentives and requirements placed on drug manufacturers are sometimes applied to device manufacturers as well on which they may have markedly different impact

come under federal scrutiny until congress passed the federal food drug and cosmetic act ffdca of 1938 pl 75717 at that time few medical devices existed in 1966 the fair packaging and labeling act pl 89755 required all consumer products in interstate commerce to be labeled accurately and truthfully with fda enforcing the provisions on regulated medical products including medical devices the medical device amendments of 1976 mda pl 94295 was the first major legislation passed to ensure safety and effectiveness of medical devices including diagnostic products before they could be marketed the amendments required manufacturers to register with fda and follow quality control procedures in their manufacturing processes some products were required to undergo premarket review by fda while others had to meet performance standards before marketing devices already on the market in 1976 preamendment or grandfathered devices did not have to undergo retrospective approval for marketing instead they were to be broadly classified by fda into one of three regulatory classes based on the risk they posed to the patient 13 federal food drug and cosmetic act 201h 21 usc 321 at

certain enforcement actions such as device product recalls for products that did not comply with the law in 1997 the food and drug administration m odernization act fdama pl 105115 mandated the most wideranging reforms in fda practice since 1938 for medical devices provisions included measures to accelerate premarket review of devices and to regulate company advertising of unapproved uses of approved devices in 2002 the medical device user fee and modernization act mdufma pl 107250 amended the ffdca to enact three significant provisions for medical devices 1 it established user fees for premarket reviews of devices 2 it allowed establishment inspections to be conducted by accredited persons third parties and 3 it instituted new regulatory requirements for reprocessed singleuse devices mdufma was amended and clarified by two laws the medical device technical corrections act mdtca pl 108214 and the medical device user fee stabilization act of 2005 mdufsa pl 10943 and had its user fee provisions reauthorized by fdaaa 16 in 2007 fdaaa amended the ffdca and the public health service act to reauthorize several expiring programs including the medical device user fee act and to make agencywide changes several of which have implications for the regulation of medical devices17 fdaaa created incentives as well as reporting and safety requirements for manufacturers of medical devices for children required that certain clinical trials for medical devices and some other products be publicly registered and have their results posted 18 created requirements to reduce conflicts of interest in advisory committees for medical devices and other products19 and made certain other amendments to the regulation of devices 16 see crs report rl34571 medical device user fees and user

they commercialize with fda and for most devices must obtain the agencys prior and continuing permission21 fda grants this permission when manufacturer meets regulatory premarket and postmarket requirements the premarket requirements which are the subject of this section vary according to the risk that device presents ivds have their own unique premarket requirements fda may grant manufacturer permission to market device after conducting premarket review based on an application from the manufacturer there are numerous types of applications manufacturer can submit to obtain such permission which are described later in this section first however this section presents some fundamental concepts and terms of art that will help readers to understand the details of the various application processes these include safety and effectiveness approval and clearance including substantial equivalence to predicate device and device classification including types of controls

effective the evidence required to meet the safe and effective standard varies according to the characteristics of the device its conditions of use the existence and adequacy of warnings and other restrictions and the extent of experience with its use22 fda considers there to be reasonable assurance of safety when it can be determined that the probable benefits to health that result from use of the device as directed by the manufacturer outweigh any probable risks 23 investigations for safety can include animal studies human studies andor laboratory studies24 fda considers there to be reasonable assurance of effectiveness when valid scientific evidence suggests that the target populations use of the device according to the manufacturers instructions provides clinically significant results25 valid scientific evidence includes that from controlled clinical trials other carefully defined clinical investigations case histories and other reports of significant human experience evidence can be collected by the manufacturer or representative and can be abstracted from medical literature 20 the term manufacturer is used throughout this report for simplicity but regulations also apply to any person organization or sponsor that submits an application to fda to market device 21 certain medical devices that present only minimal risk such as plastic bandages and ice bags can be legally marketed upon registration alone these lowrisk devices are deemed exempt from premarket review and manufacturers need not submit an application to fda prior to marketing them manufacturers of exempt devices are still typically required to comply with other regula tions known as general controls 21 cfr 862892 22 21 cfr 8607c2 23 21 cfr 8607d1 24 21 cfr 8607d2 25 21 cfr 8607e1

effective and meet any premarket review requirements fda may have one path consists of conducting clinical studies comparable to those required for new prescription drugs this process generally used for novel and highrisk devices is typically lengthy and expensive it results in type of fda permission called approval the other path is to prove that device is safe and effective by demonstrating that it is substantially equivalent to device that is already on the market predicate device 26 this type of process is unique to medical devices it is typically used for new devices that make incremental improvements or modifications to previous versions it results in fda clearance and tends to be much less expensive and less timeconsuming than seeking fda approval substantial equivalence is determined by comparing the performance characteristics of new device with those of predicate device to be considered substantially equivalent fda must determine that the new device has the same intended use also called indications for use as predicate device27 in addition the new device must either 1 have the same technological characteristics as the predicate 2 have different technological characteristics that do not raise new questions of safety and effectiveness or 3 be least as safe and effective as the predicate the manufacturer selects which predicate device to compare with its new device however fda has the ultimate discretion in determining whether comparison is appropriate here is an example of how device might be cleared through determination of substantial equivalence if manufacturer wanted to market blood glucose test for diabetes it could apply to fda for determination that the new device is substantially equivalent to blood glucose test for diabetes that was sold in 1972 fda has classified these devices in the code of federal regulations cfr as follows note the device classification process is described at the start of the next section 21 cfr 8621345 glucose test system identification glucose test system is device intended to measure glucose quantitatively in blood and other body fluids glucose measurements are used in the diagnosis and treatment of carbohydrate metabolism disorders including diabetes mellitus neonatal hypoglycemia and idiopathic hypoglycemia and of pancreatic islet cell carcinoma b classification class ii the manufacturer would likely ask fda to clear the new device based on evidence that it was substantially equivalent to the device described in the cfr rather than based on largescale clinical study to obtain fda clearance the manufacturer would need to demonstrate two things first that the new device did not present new questions of safety and effectiveness second that it had the same intended use as the older device ie intended to measure glucose 26 to be predicate device must have either been on the market before 1976 when the mda took effect or it could have been cleared for marketing after 1976 but must have the same intended use as device classified in the cfr 27 the statement of intended use is general description of the diseases or conditions that the device will diagnose treat prevent cure or mitigate including description where appropriate of the patient population for which the device is intended 21 cfr 80792a5 and 81420 b3i

poses to its intended patients the target population when it is used or misused28 the risk categories known as classifications are class i ii and iii which represent low moderate and highrisk categories respectively see table 2 since the mda was enacted the agency has classified over 1700 distinct types of devices and organized them in the code of federal regulations cfr in 16 medical specialties referred to as classification panels such as cardiovascular devices or ear nose and throat devices fda can classify new device based on comparison with legally marketed device by regulation or by recognizing that if falls into classification panel if unsure what classification product would receive manufacturer may make formal request for classification to fda devices classification determines the type of regulatory requirements that manufacturer must follow29 these regulatory requirements known as controls are described in more in the descriptions of class i ii and ii devices that follows g5g149g138g156g156g561g11g561 devices in class i are those for which general controls are sufficient to ensure their safe and effective use 21 cfr 8603c1 general controls the minimum regulations that apply to all fda regulated medical devices include five elements30 establishment registration registration with fda of companies required to do so under 21 cfr 80720 such as manufacturers distributors repackagers and relabelers and foreign firms device listing listing with fda of all devices to be marketed good manufacturing practices gmpmanufacturing of devices in

presumed to be marketable they did not need to undergo premarket review and could be legally unless and until fda required their removal as required by the mda fda classified the preamendment devices and used them as the basis for creating the classification panels and as the first cadre of predicate devices that could be used to demonstrate substantial equivalence 29 the term manufacturer is used

marketing application the manufacturer must make if anyis determined based on the risk of that the device poses if used according to the manufacturers instructions under the terms of mdufma and fdaaa manufacturers must pay fee for most types of submissions31 generally speaking according to the ffdca manufacturers are prohibited from selling an adulterated product32 are prohibited from misbranding product33 must register their facility with fda and list all of the medical devices that they produce or process process which now requires fee under the terms of fdaaa must file the appropriate premarket submission with the agency at least 90 days before introducing nonexempt device onto the market and must report to fda any incident that they are aware of that suggests that their device may have caused or contributed to death or serious injury very few applications are actually denied approval instead an application may be deemed not approvable in its current form typically because the data that the manufacturer provides are not sufficient to demonstrate safety and effectiveness applications that are not approvable are usually withdrawn by the manufacturer before denial is rendered

to establish procedures for meeting with manufacturers prior to preparing submission 34 the procedures aim to speed the review process by giving fda and manufacturer the opportunity to address questions and concerns about the device andor the planned studies that will be used to support the marketing application before the studies are initiated and the application is submitted for example the preide process an ide is an investigational device exemption that allows manufacturer to conduct clinical trial on medical device is an informal presubmission process the preide process is socalled in name only submitting preide does not mean that manufacturers are required to submit subsequently an ide application 35 the preide process is simply means for fda and industry to engage in dialogue about new device before study is initiated or marketing application is submitted 31 see crs report rl34571 medical device user fees and user fee acts by erin d williams 32 device is adulterated if it includes any filthy putrid or decomposed substance or if it is prepared packed or held under unsanitary conditions the fdc act further states that device is adulterated if its container contains any poisonous or deleterious substance or if its strength purity or quality varies significantly from what the manufacturer claims for higher class devices device can be considered adulterated if it fails to meet performance requirements outlined in its approval or if it is in violation of other good manufacturing practice requirements 33 device is misbranded when all or part of the labeling ie the fdaapproved printed material providing information about the device is false misleading or missing 34 for guidance on the procedures established see early collaboration meetings

medical device that will be marketed in the united states the standard for clearance of traditional 510k is substantial equivalence with predicate device though usually for class i or ii devices an older preamendment class iii device may sometimes use 510k submission 510k could also be used for currently marketed devices for which the manufacturer seeks new indication eg new population such as pediatric use or new disease or condition or for which the manufacturer has changed the design or technical characteristics such that the change may affect the performance characteristics of the device there are several types of 510ks traditional abbreviated special and novo in traditional 510k the manufacturer submits information about the performance of the device under specific conditions of use it also contains information about the design of the device characteristics of device components representations of packaging and labeling description and summary of the nonclinical and clinical studies that were done to support the device performance characteristics description of means by which users can assess the quality of the device and information about any computer software or additional or special equipment needed several administrative forms are also required 36 most of the studies supporting 510k submission are not true clinical studies while fda prefers to see data on performance of the device in the actual intended population substantial equivalence in many cases means only that the device performs in similar fashion to the predicate under similar set of circumstances as result many devices never have to demonstrate safety and effectiveness through clinical studies fda may take any of the following actions on 510k after conducting its review 21 cfr 807100a find the device substantially equivalent to the predicate and issue clearance letter find the device not substantially equivalent nse and issue an nse letter prohibiting marketing or request

the manufacturer may at any time withdraw its 510k fda has 90 days to review traditional 510k37 abbreviated and special 510ks were new approaches to premarket notification that came from fdama of 1997 intended to streamline and expe dite fdas review for routine submissions meeting certain qualifications thus leaving more reviewer time for more complicated submissions an abbreviated 510k uses guidan ce documents developed by fda to communicate regulatory and scientific expectations to industry guidance documents have been prepared for many different kinds of devices and are available on fdas website all guidance documents are developed in accordance with good guidance practices ggp 21 cfr 10115 and many with public participation or opportunities for public comment38 in addition to issuing guidance documents fda can either develop performance or consensus standards or recognize those developed by outside parties 21 cfr part 861 in an abbreviated 510k the manufacturer describes what guidance document special control or performance standard was used and how it was used to assess performance of their device other minimum required elements are the product description representative labeling and summary of the performance characteristics fda typically reviews an abbreviated 510k in 60 days the quality system regulation qsr 21 cfr 82030 is the regulation that describes the good manufacturing practice gmp requirements for medical devices see the manufacturing section of this report for more detail on qsr special 510k utilizes the design control 39 requirement of the qsr and may be used for modification to device that has already been cleared the modifications should not affect the safety and effectiveness of the device the special 510k allows the manufacturer to declare conformance to design controls without providing the data this type of submission references the original 510k number and contains information about the design control requirements fda aims to review most special 510ks in 30 days under the ffdca novel devices lacking legally marketed predicate would automatically be designated class iii fdama amended section 513f to allow fda to establish new expedited mechanism for reclassifying these devices based on risk thus reducing the regulatory burden on manufacturers the novo 510k though requiring more data than traditional 510k often requires less information than premarket application pma discussed below in novo 510k process the manufacturer submits traditional 510k for its device however because there is predicate device or classification the agency will return decision of not substantially equivalent within 30 days the manufacturer submits petition requesting reclassification of its device into class ii or i as appropriate within 60 days fda will render decision classifying the device according to criteria in 513a1 of ffdca with approval fda issues regulation that classifies the device if the device is class ii special controls guidance 37 the fda time clock ie review cycle begins when fda receives the 510k and ends with the date that fda issues either request for additional information or decision more than one cycle may occur before fda issues its final decision 38 fda continually accepts public comment on any draft or final guidance document 39 design controls are series of predetermined checks verifications and specifications that are built into the manufacturing process to validate the quality of the produc t throughout the process these can include defining the personnel responsible for implementing steps in the development and manufacturing process defining specifications and standards for assessing the quality of the materials that go into making the product designing specifications for accepting and rejecting different batches or lots of final product and requirements for maintaining appropriate records

type of device marketing application required by fda for new andor highrisk devices pma approval is based on determination by fda that the application contains sufficient valid scientific evidence to assure that the device is safe and effective for its intended uses 21 cfr part 814 pma must contain the following information among other things administrative requirements summaries of nonclinical and clinical data supporting the intended use and performance characteristics detailed information on the design of the device and description of the device components instructions for use representations of packaging and labeling description of means by which users can assess the quality of the device information about any computer software or additional or special equipment needed literature about the disease and the similar devices information on the manufacturing process and assurance of compliance with qsr in contrast to 510k pmas generally require some clinical data but can also use studies from the medical literature paper pma approval is based not only on the strength of the scientific data but also on inspection of the manufacturing facility to assure that the facility and the manufacturing process are in compliance with the quality systems regulations qsr 21 cfr part 820 fdama made it easier for manufacturers to submit the required sections of pma in serial fashion as data are available modular pma when pma is first received fda has 45 days to make sure the application is administratively complete if so fda formally files the application if not the application is returned fda then has 75 days to complete the initial review and determine whether an advisory committee meeting will be necessary advisory committees comprised of scientific medical and statistical experts and industry and consumer representatives can be convened to make recommendations on any scientific or policy matter before fda 41 they allow for interested persons to present information and views at an oral public hearing before the advisory committee 21 cfr part 14 fda typically accepts advisory committee recommendations for an application approvable approvable with conditions or nonapprovable however there have been cases where the decision has not been consistent with the recommendation eg where the conditions for approval are so burdensome as to practically present nonapprovable situation cdrh will hold joint advisory committee meetings with other centers where necessary after fda notifies the applicant that the pma has been approved or denied notice may be published on the internet 1 announcing the data on which the decision is based and 2 providing interested persons an opportunity to pe tition fda within 30 days for reconsideration of the decision though fda regulations allow 180 days to review the pma and make determination 21 cfr 81440 in reality the review time could be much longer pursuant to 40 guidance for

specific laboratory standards governing certification personnel proficiency testing patient test management quality assurance quality control and inspections clia categorization defining regulatory requirements on the laboratory testing process do not always match fda classification defining regulatory requirements on the tests kits or systems themselves for example waived test under clia is the simplest test to perform usually by an untrained user with the smallest margin of er ror as such they receive little to oversight under clia however fda may designate such test as class iii so that it undergoes rigorous review to insure that it performs as advertised ie with small margin of error in the hands of an untrained user most ivds are exempt from ide requirements because the benefits and risks to the patient from use of ivds are indirect ie due to the use of the test result in patient management fda requires that the companies demonstrate analytical test performance in patient samples that would test along the continuum of positive and negative for the marker of interest in addition fda requires support for the clinical validity of the test ie evidence that the biological marker that the test is detecting actually is associated with the disease or condition that the company wishes to market the test for in predictable way for some of the applications seeking clearance for an ivd biological markers that the test purports to measure may be relatively well characterized with respect to disease and patient population such as the link between glucose measurement and diabetes in these cases analytical studies using clinically derived samples eg blood specimens from healthy and diabetic individuals suffice to show that the test is actually detecting the marker sometimes clinical samples can be supplemented by carefully selected artificial samples particularly if disease condition or marker is rare for example if fda were to review genetic test to measure genetic markers for drug metabolism they may require the manufacturer to use actual patient samples to demonstrate that they can detect common markers fda may however allow the company to use artificial or spiked samples to test for rare markers so that the company would not have to test an overly burdensome number of clinical samples in this type of submission the manufacturer could use medical literature to support the clinical validity of the biological marker to the disease and would not have to conduct clinical study to demonstrate that the test measures the marker and the marker is associated with the disease for other ivds the link between analytical performance of the test in its ability to detect biological marker and the clinical validity of the marker is not well defined in these circumstances new clinical information may be required fda rarely requires prospective clinical studies for ivds but regularly requests clinical samples with sufficient laboratory andor clinical characterization to allow an assessment of the clinical validity of new device for example company seeking to market test for new tumor marker may use wellcharacterized archived patient samples collected as part of completely separate study to demonstrate that their test can classify patients in predictable way clinical performance is usually expressed in terms of clinical sensitivity and clinical specificity when compared to disease or health state or agreement when compared to performance of predicate device or reference method for most pmas manufacturers identify surrogate endpoints such as tumor shrinking or reduction in tumor marker and establish the device performance in relation to those rather than to disease outcome such as improved survival

surveillance when problem arises with product regulated by fda the agency can take number of actions to protect the public health initially the agency tries to work with the manufacturer to correct the problem on voluntary basis if that fails legal remedies may be taken such as asking the manufacturer to recall product having federal marshals seize products or detaining imports at the port of entry until problems are corrected if warranted fda can ask the courts to issue injunctions or prosecute individual company officers that deliberately violate the law when warranted criminal penalties including prison sentences may be sought each center has an office of compliance oc which ensures compliance with regulations while pre or postmarket studies are being undertaken with manufacturing requirements and with labeling requirements the objectives of cdrhs ocs bioresearch monitoring bimo program are to ensure the quality and integrity of data and information submitted in support of ide pma and 510k submissions and to ensure that human subjects taking part in investigations are protected from undue hazard or risk this is achieved through audits of clinical data contained in pmas prior to approval data audits of ide nd 510k submissions inspections of irbs and nonclinical laboratories and enforcement of the prohibitions against promotion marketing or commercialization of investigational devices any establishment where devices are manufactured processed packed installed used or implanted or where records of results from use of devices are kept can be subject to inspection the oc also reviews the quality system design and manufacturing information in the pma submission to determine whether the manufacturer has described the processes in sufficient detail and to make preliminary determination of whether the manufacturer meets the qsr if the manufacturer has provided an adequate description of the design and manufacturing process preapproval inspection can be initiated inspection is to include an assessment of the manufacturers capability to design and manufacture the device as claimed in the pma and confirm that the quality system is in compliance with the qsr postapproval inspections can be conducted within eight to twelve months of approv of the pma submission the inspection is to primarily focus on any changes that may have been made in the device design manufacturing process or quality systems the compliance offices work closely with the office of regulatory affairs ora 55 which operates in the field to regulate almost 124000 business

to fda any correction or removal of medical device that is undertaken to reduce health risk posed by the device recall may be total market withdrawal or may be of portion of product such as single lot in rare instances where the manufacturer or importer fails to voluntarily recall device that is risk to health fda may issue recall order to the manufacturer 21 cfr part 810 when recall is initiated fda performs an evaluation of the health hazard presented taking into account the following factors among others whether any disease or injuries have already occurred from the use of the product whether any existing conditions could contribute to clinical situation that could expose humans or animals to health hazard assessment of hazard to various segments of the population eg children surgical patients pets livestock etc who would be exposed to the product assessment of the degree of seriousness of the health hazard to which the populations at risk would be exposed assessment of the likelihood of occurrence of the hazard assessment of the consequences immediate or longrange of occurrence of the hazard following the health hazard assessment fda assigns the recall classification according to the relative degree of health hazard class i recalls are the most serious reserved for situations where there is reasonable probability that the use of or exposure to product will cause serious adverse health consequences or death class ii recalls are for situations where the use of or exposure to product may cause temporary or medically reversible adverse health consequences or where the probability of serious adverse health consequences is remote in class iii recall situation the use of or exposure to product is not likely to cause adverse health consequences in addition to warning letter or recall fda may also issue public notification or safety alert eg dear doctor letter to warn healthcare providers and consumers of the risk of the device in question the main page for recalls market withdrawals and safety alerts for all fdaregulated products is httpwwwfdagovopacom7alertshtml 57 recall does not include market withdrawal or stock recovery market withdrawal is firms removal or correction of distributed product for minor violation that does not violate the law and would not be subject to legal action by fda eg normal stock
