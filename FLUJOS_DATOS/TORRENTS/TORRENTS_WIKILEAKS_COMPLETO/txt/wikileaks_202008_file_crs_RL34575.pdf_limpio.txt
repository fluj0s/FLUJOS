april 30 2003 quotin g statement by congressman overton brooks dla on the floor of the house durin g consideration of amendments to sscra this bill springs from the desire of the people of the united

normal business affairs while away it likewise arises from the differences in pay which soldier continuedthe servicemembers civil relief act scra summary and proposed amendments introduction1 the soldiers and sailors civil relie f act of 1940 sscra provided civil protections and rights to i ndividuals based on their servi ce in the us armed forces on december 19 2003 congress enacted p l 108189 the servicemembers civil relief act scra in response to the in creased utilization of reserve and national guard military units in the global war on terrorism and as modernization and restatement of the protections and rights previously available to servicemembers under the sscra2 much like with the sscra the scra has been amended since its initial passage and proposed changes c ontinue to be introduced in congress congress has long recognized the n eed for protective legislation for servicemembers whose service to the nation compromises their ability to meet obligations and protect their legal interests during the civil war congress enacted an absolute moratorium on civil actions br ought against soldiers and sailors during world war i congress passed the soldie rs and sailors civ il relief act of 19183 which did not create moratorium on gal actions against servicemembers but instead directed trial courts to apply princi ples of equity to determine the appropriate action to take whenever servicemembers rights were involved in controversy during world war ii congress essentially reenacted the expire d 1918 statute as the soldiers and sailors civil relief act of 1940 and then amended it substantially in 1942 to take into account the new economic and legal landscape th at had developed between the wars4 congress enacted amendments on several occasions

benefits of sscra to members of the national guard called up by their respective state governors to support federal efforts during national emergencies including the war against terrorism 6 one of the amendments effected by pl 108189 is the change in the name of the act from soldiers and sailors civil relief act ss cra to servicemembers civil relief act scra the name of the act was changed to the more inclusive scra because soldiers sailors marines and airmen are collectively referred to as servicemembers in other statutes hrept 10889 at 35 pril 30 2003 therefore all of the historical and legal background of this act makes reference to sscra instead of scra this report will use the current name of the act scra when maki ng reference to any historical or legal background information 7

is an exercise of congresss pow er to raise and support armies us const art i sec 8 cl 12 and to declare war art i sec 8 cl 117 the purpose of the act is to provide for strength and expedite th national defense by protecting servicemembers enabling them to devote their entire energy to the defense needs of the nation8 the scra protects servicemembers by temporarily suspending certain judicial and administrative proceedings and transactions that may adversely affect their legal rights during military service forgiving of all debts or the extinguishment of contractual obligati ons on behalf of servicemembers who have been called up for active duty is not required nor is absolute immunity from civil lawsuits provided instead it provides for the suspension of claims and protection from default judgments in this way it seeks to balance the interests of servicemembers and their creditors spreading the burden of national military service to broader portion of the citizenry many of the scra provisions are especially beneficial for reservists activated to respond to national crisis but many provisions are also useful for career military personnel9 one of the measures that affects many who are called to active duty is the cap on interest at an annual rate of 6 on debts incurred prior to persons entry into active duty military service section 207 other measures protect military families from being evicted from rental or mortgaged property sections 301 and 303 from cancellation of life insurance sections 402 through 409 from taxation in multiple

that is based on professi onals actions or inaction during period when policy is suspended in the case of claims invol ving obligations imposed by state law on professional person to assure that his or her patients or clients will receive professional assistance in his or her abse nce to serve on active duty the section clarifies that the failure of the professional person to satisfy such an obligation will generally be considered to be breach that occurred before the professional person began active duty in such situation the insurer would be liable for the claim in the event claim arises while the patient is receiving alternate care as arranged by the servicemember for patients during his or her absence the insurer would not be liable for the claim actions against policy holder during suspension of coverage in the event malpractice suit or administrative ac tion is filed during the period when the insurance is suspended the litigation will be stayed until the end of the suspension period the stay only applies where the ma lpractice is alleged to have occurred before the suspension began and would thus be covered by the policy litigation stayed under this rule is deemed to be filed on the date the suspended insurance is reinstated the period of any stay gran ted under this provision is not counted when computing whether or not the rele vant statute of limitations has run in the event that professional person whose malpractice insurance coverage has been suspended should die during th period of the suspension any stay of litigation or administrative action against th person under this section is lifted in addition the insurer providing the coverage that was suspended is to be liable under the policy just as if the deceased person had died while covered by the policy but before the claim was filed reinstatement of coverage the insurer is required to reinstate the insurance coverage on the date the servicemember transmits written request for reinstatement which must occur within 30 days after the covered servicemember is released from active duty the insurer must notify the policyholder of the due date for payment of any premium required

and child custody housing including mortgage nd foreclosure protections and child custody are the two most common themes of the proposed amendments housing in response to subprime mortgage concerns and the increasing number of foreclosures numerous proposals aimed at protecting servicemembers have been introduced in congress propos als range from rent and mortgage relief to extending protections ag ainst foreclosure proposed addition to title iii would create new section addressing rent and mortgage relief for members of the reserve components50 covered individuals would not be required to pay rent under l ease if the member is assigned duty at location sufficiently distant from the prope rty and unable to reside at that property the bill does not define the term sufficiently distant and it is unclear how determination would be made as to what is in fact sufficiently distant to qualify for the benefit or how disputed claim woul d be resolved additionally the proposed section would not require c overed individuals to make any payment of principal or interest on the mortgage during the period of military service all excused payments would be appended to the nd of the term of the mortgage in the same amount as originally due the overall scope of the mortgage provisions contained in the scra are limited to mortgages that originate before the servicemember entered military service expansion of mortgage benefits appear unlikely to benefit career military members in contrast proposed modification to the maximum interest rate protection contained in section 207 would apply to all servicemembers51 the language in the bill would effectively remove the requirement that the debts be incurred prior to the period of military service and specifically identifies mortgages as being covered by the maximum interest rate of 6 while section 207 is titled maximum rate of interest on debts incurred before military service the bill removes the language requiring the debt to have been incurred prior to entering military service the amendment does not change th title of section 207 however child custody early in the second session of the 110th congress pl 110 181 was enacted clarifying that child custody proceedings are covered under the scra provisions against default judgment s and the right to request stay of proceedings52 multiple bills have been introdu ced that would expand the language related to child custody proceedings specifically creating new section addressing child custody within title ii of the scra53httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34575crs26 54 the language of the proposed amendments are similar except that s 1658 does not contain language allowing the court to avoid reinstating the previous child custody order if it isnt in the best interest of the child 55 batie v subway real estate corp 2008 us dist lexis 11458 nd tex february 15 2008 56 the servicemember claimed subway viol ated scra procedures in two different proceedings before state courts by failing to 1 properly serve plai ntiff 2 appoint an attorney for plaintiff 3 notify the court of pl aintiffs status as us serviceman or his deployment abroad 4 apprise plaintiff of the eviction notice and 5 stay proceedings pending plaintiffs return from deploymentunder proposed amendments servicem embers deployed in support of contingency operation are protected from change s in child custody orders courts are prohibited from modifying or amending any pr evious judgment or order or issuing new order that changes custody arrangement existing at the start of the deployment however courts may enter temporary custody order if it is in the best interest of the child if temporar order is entered upon completion of the deployment the custody order that was in effect immediately preceding the date of deployment is reinstated54 if motion for change of custody is filed upon completion of deployment the absence of the member by reason of the previous deployment may not be consider ed by the court in determining the best interest of the child while the proposed amendments would create new section under title ii it appears that it could conflict with the prev ious amendment clarifying that sections 521 and 522 apply to child custody proceedings the protection against default judgments contained in section 521 would not conflict with the proposed amendment in that court is unable to enter permanent change in custody while servicemember is deployed in support of contingency operation any temporary orders entered while the servicemember is deployed would revert to the order that existed on the date of deploy ment and therefore would not be considered default judgment however it is unclear if servicemember may request stay under section 522 in order to prevent the court from entering temporary order changing child custody under the new section jurisdiction and civil enforcement section 102 establishes that the act applies to any judicial or administrative proceeding commenced in any court of the united states each of the states and all territory subject to the jurisdiction of the united states an application for relief when proceeding has already commenced may be made to any court having jurisdiction over the matter however recent opinion from the united states district cour t for the northern district of texas questioned the

of the scra the us district court in determining if it should uphold the state court declarator judgment stated congress envisioned that state courts not federal district courts would decide claims involving scras tenant protections during eviction proceedings57 in declining to overturn the declaratory judgment the court construe d section 102b to mean that jurisdiction is not exclusive in federal court and that the act does not compel federal adjudication of all cases implicating the statutes provisions denying the claim for compensatory and punitive damages the court cited failure of the servicemember to cite any provisions in the scra authorizing damages58 further the court found that even if the servicemember maintains the scra as basis for damages there is provision in scra that authorizes privat cause of action to remedy violations of the statute59 the servicemembers claims were dismissed by the court s 2787 the national defense author ization act for fiscal year 2009 sponsored by senator levin would establis h new title addressing civil liability and enforcement of the scra which would par tially address some of the issues raised in batie 60 the bill would authorize the attorney general to file civil action in any appropriate united states district court when reasonable belief exists that an individual or group is engaged in or has gaged in pattern or practice of conduct in violation of the scra an action may also be filed if denial of protections raises an issue of general public importance the language establishes that authorized relief includes monetary damages including actual and punitive damages to servicemember dependent or any other pe rson protected by the act the court may also impose civil penalty to vindicate the public interest c overed individuals are authorized to intervene in civil action brought by the attorney general and the court may receive damages and reasonable ttorneys fees and costs associated with the claim while the proposed language doesnt ex plicitly state that private cause of action exists under the act it does provide for intervention when the case has been filed by the attorney general the amendment clearly states that damages including actual and punitive damages are authorized forms of relief in civil action filed by the attorney general it is unclear if courts would construe this to mean that damages are available for ll violations of the scra not only those under title iii through private cause of actionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34575crs28
