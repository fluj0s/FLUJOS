defesa mas vêem oportunidade olho nas olimpíadas us faz lobby amplia presença país brasil rejeitou prisioneiros guantánamo sao paulo brazil the brazilian security forces cooperate closely with us intelligence and law enforcement agencies on counterterrorism in the country in spite of denials from the brazilian government us embassy cables released by wikileaks reveal according to secret cable sent to washington in january 2008 by us ambassador clifford sobel the federal police and the brazilian intelligence agency abin monitor suspected terrorists and have arrested some of them on other charges the federal police will often arrest individuals with links to terrorism but will charge them on variety of nonterrorism related crimes to avoid calling attention of the media and the higher levels of the government over the past year the federal police has arrested various individuals engaged in suspected terrorism financing activity but have based their arrests on narcotics and customs charges the brazilian government denies the existence of counterterrorism operations in the country in 2005 meeting with the us ambassador the brazilian most senior intelligence officer minister for institutional security jorge armando felix said that officers were working closely with rmas regional movement alert system passport database to target specific individuals he also said that the government was also appealing to moderate second generation arabs many of whom were successful businessmen in brazil to keep close eye on fellow arabs who may be influenced by arab extremists andor terrorist groups it was in the moderate muslims interest to keep potential firebrands in line and keep the microscope off of the arab community in brazil says the cable sent on the may 6 2005 see cable 05brasilia1207 the brazilian government vigorously rejects claims that there are terrorismrelated activities going on in the triborder area with paraguay and argentina since 2006 the us includes the area as potential threat in its annual report on terrorism in part the rebutal is due to formal disagreement since brazil does not classify hizbollah and hamas as terrorist organizations both organizations have supporters in the triborder area terrorrelated arrests but apart from official discrepancies wikileaks documents show that the brazilian agencies act on leads provided by the us also in the january 2008 cable the main terrorism concern lays not in the triborder area but concerns individuals in sao paulo and the south of brazil despite negative rhetoric in itamaraty and at higher levels of the gob government of brazil brazilian law enforcement and intelligence agenciesprincipally the federal police customs the brazilian intelligence agency abin and othersare aware of the potential threat from terrorists exploiting the favorable conditions existing in brazil to operate and actively track and monitor suspected terrorist activity and follow all leads passed to them brazil doesnt have specific legislation on terrorism partly because of the legacy of the military regime it used to arrest oppositors on charges of terrorism the lack of legisation in brazil annoyes us officials as another cable sent by sobel in abril 2008 shows see cable 08brasilia504 two discourses another document published by wikileaks show december 2009 assessment see cable 09brasilia1540 of the national antiterror policy in it minister lisa kubiske stresses that the us sees two discourses in the brazilian government politically brazil continues to deny the presence and potential threat of terrorists and terrorism in brazil while law enforcement and intelligence monitor and cooperate to counter the threat she mentions the arrest of senior member of qaeda in sao paulo in may as an example in october 2009 the ministry of foreign relations did admit for the first time that terrorists could become interested in brazil because of the award of the 2016 olympics to rio janeiro brazilian law enforcements recognition of the potential threat from terrorism prompted reform of the brazilian intelligence agency abin that could raise the profile of the issue by upgrading the counterterrorism division to the department level says the cable the documents are part of set of 250 thousand 19662010 us embassy files to be released in the coming weeks
