that had been homeless or receiving hud assistance prior to the storm by developing new voucher program and by issuin g guidance to lenders offering protections for homeowners with fhainsured mortgages finally congress has used the community development block grant cdbg program as conduit for providing flexible relief and recovery funds to devastated communities this report details huds

some cases it may not be possible to obtain 100 financing it may often be the case that the cost to repair or replace the property exceeds the appraised value of the property this is the reason that most lenders require borrowers to obtain hazard insurance that covers the replacement cost of the property instead of its appraised value the section 203k program permits borrowers who do not already own homes to purchase and rehabilitate properties in the area that are either abandoned by owners or are being sold by owners who do not want to repa ir them and remain in the area the current fha underwriting guidelines provide that prospective borrowers total debt including the proposed mortgage payment may not exceed 41 of the borrowers gross monthly income in recognition of the fact that borrowers in these programs s ection 203 h and k may have to incur debt to replace personal property the underwriting guidelines are relaxed to permit loans to borrowers whose total debt is up to 45 of gross monthly income the limit may even be exceeded if justified by compensating factors on december 5 2005 hud announced the mortgage assistance initiative mai under which hud will make mortgage payments for up to 12 months on behalf of borrowers who have fha insured mortgages on their homes and who have been displaced or are unemployed because of the recent disasters eligible borrowers must
