crs report rs20898 elections reform overview and issues development of the vss can be divided into four stages the original voting system standards study 19771984 the development of the actual standards 19841990 the update of the standards 19972002 and replacement by the vvsg 2002present overall there was relatively little congressional debate or discussion of this topic in congressional research service the library of congress crs2 available records before the 2000 election1 the work of the fec on voting system standards had been part of its broader portfolio on election administration performed by its office of election administration oea formerly called the clearinghouse recurring issue in those earlier discussions was the appropriate level of priority for the fecs election administration activities in light of its other responsibilities as result of that debate and other factors the election administration activities of the fec were significantly constrained voting system standards study in january 1977 an fec advisory panel recommended the development of voluntary standards2 legislative language on study of the matter was first proposed in the 95th congress as floor amendment to s 926 bill to provide for public financing of senate elections3 it directed the fec to conduct study on future development of voluntary engineering and procedural performance standards for voting systems in cooperation with the national bureau of standards now the national institute of standards and technology nist an impetus for the initiative was contested 1974 senate election in new hampshire in which malfunctions of lever machines were reported4 the httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21156 amendment was adopted and the bill passed the senate but was not taken up by the house the study was next considered during the 96th congress as part of the deliberations on hr 5010 federal election campaign act amendments of 1979 the study was not included in the house version of the bill or discussed in the house administration committee report5 or hearings the committee held between march and july 19796 in fact the house version narrowed the responsibilities of the clearinghouse from the administration of elections to the administration of the federal election campaign act feca7 such narrowing would have reduced the ability of the fec to perform studies such as that proposed for voting system standards while the committee did not explain 1 in developing this report the congressional record from the 95th through the 106th congress was examined as well as records of hearings and reports on relevant bills 2 congressional record 95th congress 1977 26285 3 congressional record 95th congress 1977 26012 4 ibid 5 house committee on house administration

providing information and performing studies in respect to the administration of elections 86 stat 20 the federal election campaign act amendments of 1974 pl 93443 created the fec and placed the clearinghouse within it in 1996 the fec renamed the clearinghouse the office of election administration crs3 the rationale for this change in its report on hr 5010 its report on an earlier bill s 8328 on fec authorization questioned the commission placing priority on the funding of studies which do not relate to federal responsibilities such as redistricting over funding for its basic statutory responsibilities9 hr 5010 passed the house on september 10 1979 with some concern about the narrowing of scope noted in floor debate10 in july the senate committee on rules and administration had also held hearings on amending feca two draft bills discussed by the committee included language originally proposed by senator cannon in 1977 along with some background information although the voting system study itself was apparently not discussed during committee deliberations11 the committee then marked up and reported s 1757 which retained the language on the study12 when the senate considered hr 5010 it amended the bill by substituting version that included language from hr 5010 as well as from s 175713 the substitute contained the study language and restored much of the scope of clearinghouse activities but limited the focus to federal elections14 the language on the study included an additional requirement that the fec absorb the costs15 the amended bill passed the senate and house and was signed into law pl 96187 on httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21156 january 8 1980 also in 1980 pl 96253 was enacted authorizing fec appropriations for fy1981 that reauthorization limited the budget of the clearinghouse to 400000 substantial reduction from the previous budget of approximately 750000 that was the result of house amendment to the original senate version of the bill s 264816 the house administration committee report explained the reduction using similar reasons as it had in the report on s 832 the previous year17 for fy1982 the fec requested 68000 for 8 s 832 passed the

from doing more than conducting survey of state and local elections officials18 however the clearinghouse budget was reduced for fy1982 and for fy1983 the fec requested 50000 for the study19 it was completed in 1984 and transmitted to congress in april20 it called for the development of voluntary standards for voting systems development of the voting systems standards for fy1984 the fec

commission authorization of continued crs5 standards was released in april 1990 but the fec noted that several states had previously implemented portions of the earlier draft standards25 the fec developed plan to implement the vss through cooperative action by the fec nist set of laboratories called the independent test authorities itas state and local governments and voting system vendors under the plan states would adopt the standards and the itas would test voting systems to determine whether they met the standards nists intended role was in accreditation of the itas however the plan did not materialize as originally conceived instead the national association of state election directors nased which was established in 1989 appointed voting systems board to choose itas and administer process for qualifying voting systems under the vss the testing program began in 1994 nased chose the election center professional organization of election officials to serve as the secretariat for voting system qualification updating the standards the fec began project to update the standards in fy1997 in response to httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21156 nased assessment that changes in technology and issues relating to testing required revision of the first version the process received little congressional attention until after the november 2000 federal election see below the fec released draft standards for public comment in 2001 and the final version in may 2002 the total cost was approximately 700000 the revision took broader approach than the original version focusing on the voting medium paperbased versus electronic rather than specific kinds of voting systems it also included new or expanded coverage of some functions and requirements they included accessibility feedback to the voter election management audit trails and broadcasting of unofficial results all of which were part of the congressional debate occurring at that time on election reform as well as telecommunications and certain testing issues replacement of the standards with the guidelines in the aftermath of the november 2000 federal election the process by which the vss were developed and implemented became subject of debate while some observers argued that the existing process worked well others raised criticisms such as the following the standards did not address several important aspects of election administration the revision addressed some but not all of those concerns the approach to developing the standards did not follow best practices in this area as promulgated and practiced by standards organizations 24 continued appropriations for fiscal year 1987 99th congress 2nd sess june 12 1986 hrept 99637 23 25 house committee on house administration subcommittee on elections hearing and markup on hr 4116 federal election commission authorization fiscal year 1993 february 26 1992 5051 crs6 such as the american national standards institute ansi and the institute of electrical and electronics engineers ieee the qualification process created bottlenecks in certifying new systems the vss focused too much on engineering rather than performance and impeded the development of new kinds of voting technology the voluntary nature of the standards at the federal level led to insufficient and inconsistent application by state and local governments the house science committee held hearings on may 22 2001 on the role of voting system standards in improving voting technology and subsequently reported hr 2275 the voting technology standards act of 2001 hrept 107263 the bill would have established commission chaired by the director of nist to develop new standards nist would also accredit testing laboratories and perform research and development the house administration committee reported hr 3295 the help america vote act hrept 107329 and the house passed that bill on december 12 it established the eac to replace the oea and provided statutory basis and process for development of the federal voluntary vss and certification of voting systems with major advisory role for nist including the establishment of technical committee to revise the vss the httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21156 senatepassed version of hr 3295 did not establish mechanism for development of voluntary standards but did require consultation with nist and the architectural and transportation barriers compliance board in any revisions to the vss it also established set of requirements for voting systems involving audits accessibility machine error and prevention of voter error the enacted version of hava contained the requirements from the senate bill and the mechanisms from the house bill for development of voluntary standards now called guidelines and certification of voting systems hava did not however specifically authorize funding for nists involvement and the development of the vvsg was delayed for several months in part for that reason work on development of the first version of the vvsg partial revision of the vss began in 2004 with the appointment of the technical committee draft was released for public comment in june 2005 most of the language was unchanged from the 2002 version of the vss major changes included the following addition of conformance section which describes in general terms those entities expected to conform to the guidelines and what is required of them revised and new standards for accessibility and usability human factors revised standards for security including wireless communications software distribution and validation and voterverified paper ballots used with dres some changes to testing procedures with respect to machine error and discussion of certain best practices for election officials and of some alternative methods for ballot verification by voters work has also begun on second version of the vvsg which would be complete revision the eac also has adopted framework for assuming responsibility from nased for certification of voting systems nist has produced draft handbook for laboratories seeking accreditation and established application procedures
