107204 to remedy weaknesses in accounting and corporate governance exposed by massive fraud at enron corp and other firms criticism of the law which has been fairly widespread among business groups academics and accountants focuses on the costs of compliance which are said to outweigh the benefits several studies and comments have argued that the rising cost of regulation has created incentives for firms to list their shares on foreign markets or to withdraw from the public markets altogether weakening the international competitive position of us stock exchanges specific evidence cited includes the fact that 24 of the largest 25 initial public stock offerings ipos in 2005 took place on foreign exchanges and that there has been boom in the private equity market where us securities regulation is minimal this report attempts to put instances like these in context by presenting comparative data on the worlds major stock markets over the past decade in terms of the number of corporations listing their shares several foreign markets have shown faster growth than the major us exchanges the new york stock exchange nyse and nasdaq however these increases appear to be fueled primarily by growth in the number of domestic firms listing on their own national market s while major foreign markets have seen significant declines in foreign listings as percentage of all listings us exchanges have not been abandoned by foreign companies in significant numbers perhaps the most common reason for firms to delist or leave stock exchange is merger with another firm lower costs of regulation may be side benefit of many mergers but trends in interest rates and stock prices appear to be the primary determinants of merger activity rising number of corporate acquisitions result in the acquired firms going privatebecoming exempt from most regulationbut this trend is also larg ely driven by economic conditions private equity investment has boomed since 2000 because debt financing has been abundant and relatively cheap and because institutional investors have soug ht higher yields than what the stock and bond markets have provided figures on new issues of stock including ipos are volatile and annual data may be skewed by few large deals certain foreign exchanges have recovered more quickly from the 20002002 bear market but on the whole there is little evidence that the us stock market is becoming less attractive to companies seeking to raise capital when the bond markets are included the role of the us securities industry in capital formation appears to be as strong as ever the data surveyed here suggest that rising regulatory costs have not precipitated any crisis in us markets and that the outcome of global competition among stock exchanges depends more on fundamental market conditions than on differentials in regulatory costs this report will be updated if events warrant

sarbanesoxley act of 2002 pl 107204 was enacted in response to massive accounting fraud at enron and long list of other us corporations the law sought to improveor restorethe effectiveness of the gatekeepers who are supposed to ensure that investors receive accurate information about firms whose securities are traded in public markets under sarbanes oxley corporate executives directors auditors accountants attorneys and regulators are all held to more stringent standards of accountability criticism of sarbanesoxley has focused on compliance costs which to some observers outweigh the benefits of improved governance and regulation 1 since direct measurement of those costs and benefits within single business is impossible much of the debate has looked to the securities markets where excessive regulatory costs should be mirrored raising the costs of complying with us securities regulation as sarbanesoxley unquestionably did creates incentives both for firms whose securities are listed on us stock markets and for firms weighing the costs and benefits of going public and obtaining such listings2 firms in the first group including nonus companies that find compliance costs excessive may choose to delist their shares and become privately held businesses or list on foreign stock exchanges where securities and exchange commission sec regulations do not apply firms in the second group may decide to avoid sec regulation by remaining private and seeking funds outside the public securities markets from private equity investors for example they also have the option of going public in foreign country if significant numbers of firms have decided since 2002 that the costs of us regulation exceed the benefits of access to us public securities markets with their traditional advantages of deep liquidity and low transaction costs some or all of the following would be expected decrease in the number of firms domestic and foreign whose shares are listed on us exchanges either in absolute terms or relative to foreign stock exchanges an upward trend in delistings reflecting companies that choose to leave the us public markets and falling off in the number of new listings on us exchanges as the initial public offering ipo market shrinks or moves offshore several recent comments and studies have cited evidence that us stock markets have indeed become less competitive and have suggested that expensive regulation may be partly to blame 3 few would argue that sarbanesoxley or us regulation in general is solely responsible for the 1 for an overview of criticisms see henry n butler and larr ribstein the sarbanesoxley debacle how to fix it and what weve learned mar 13 2006 available at httpwwwaeiorgeventsfilteralleventid1273 summaryasp 2 throughout this report public is us ed to describe companies that sell their securities to the general public and thereby come under sec regulation and the markets where those securities are traded private or privately held on the other hand refers to corporations that do not report to the sec because their stock is not available for sale to small investors 3 see eg committee on capital markets regulation

include several longterm trends such as 1 the growth of foreign stock markets particularly in countries like china and germany without long traditions of widespread stock ownership 2 the lowering of legal and regulatory barriers to crossborder investment and trading and 3 the role of computer technology in reducing communications information and transactions costs however policy recommendations to address the perceived decline in competitiveness tend to focus on regulatory relief since there is little congress or regulators can realistically do to reverse financial globalization or technological progress two facts often put forward are that in 2005 only one of the 25 largest ipos took place in the united states and that goingprivate transactions have reached extremely high levels both in number and value of deals 4 in late 2006 senator charles schumer and new york mayor michael bloomberg argued that while new york remains the dominant globalexchange center we have been

end of september 2006 the market value of shares listed on these exchanges was about 456 trillion but this was not evenly distributed there was top tier of six exchanges each with more than 3 trillion in market capitalization 6 two of these were american the new york stock exchange nyse and nasdaq two japanese the tokyo and osaka stock exchanges and two european the london stock exchange and euronext7 these six accounted for 313 trillion in market capitalization or 709 of the total there is second tier of exchanges whose market capitalization fell between 1 trillion and 2 trillion the toronto stock exchange the deutsche börse the hong kong exchanges the bme spanish exchanges and the swiss exchange these five markets combined accounted for 67 trillion in market capitalization nearly the same as the remaining 40 exchanges which added 66 trillion or 144 of the total table 1 and figure 1 set out these figures 4 remarks by treasury secretary henry m paulson on the competitiveness of

competition as framed by senator schumer and mayor bloomberga struggle to become or remain the worlds financial capitalit makes sense to focus on the top tier without ignoring the possibility that the second tier markets may rise to the level of global competitors either through growth of the domestic corporate sector merger with other exchanges or costsaving innovation indirect evidence for this assumption is provided by the recent behavior of the nyse and nasdaq which have responded to competitive pressures by pursuing mergers with euronext and the london stock exchange respectively this

an exchange it applies to be listed exchange listing standards are not uniform but generally include requirements regarding corporate governance practices financial size or condition number of shares available for trading and minimum share price in addition listing on an exchange brings company under the jurisdiction of the national securities regulator 8 other things being equal therefore an exceptionally onerous regulatory regime ought to discourage growth in the number of listings table 2 presents figures on total exchange listingsboth domestic and foreign companiesfrom the end of 1995 through september 2006 for the largest stock markets figure 2 rebases the same data as an index the number of listings at the end of 1995 is set at 100 and shows the percentage change in the number of listed firms over the period euronext is excluded from the chart since it was formed by merger in 2000 hong kong is substituted9 glance at figure 2 suggests that the major us markets have not fared well over the last decade nyse listings have barely risen while nasdaq listings have fallen sharply however factors other than international competition may explain this the fall in nasdaq listings reflects the end of the dotcom bubble when thousands of listed firms that had never made money and that in retrospect probably never should have gone public collapsed 8 for foreign firms the full range of regulation does not necessarily apply foreign companies listing on us exchanges for example are subject to more stringent reporting requirements when they are raising capital in us markets ie selling new securities to us investors than if they are simply seeking venue for secondary trading of shares issued elsewhere 9 for other second tier exchanges consistent data is also problem the canadian spanish and german markets all underwent mergers since 1995

before and after the bust makes it difficult to argue that any single factor including the response to the enron scandals had major impact nyses listing policy appears to focus on quality rather than quantitythe exchanges annual financial statement for 2005 describes nyse listing standards as the most stringent of any securities marketplace in the world and notes that all standards are periodically reviewed to ensure that the nyse attracts and retains the strongest companies with sustainable business models 10 in other words the nyse may not see growth in the number of listings as

handful of stocks traded on exchanges in more than one country in september 2006 by contrast the tabulation of the world federation of exchanges showed that of 40888 total listings on global exchanges 2738 represented foreign companies 11 companies seek foreign listings for two reasons better access to foreign capital markets and to seek more liquid secondary or resale market for their shares which aids capital formation in their home market12 exchanges seek foreign listings as source of fee income and for the prestige of being an international financial center competition for foreign listings

the earliest point in the world federation of exchanges data series at the end of 2002 shortly after the enactment of sarbanes oxley and at the end of september 2006 several features of figure 3 are striking first international crosslisting is much more common in europe than elsewhere as might be expected given the historical economic interdependence of european states and after more than decade of economic integration policies14 in the asian markets on the other hand nearly all listings are domestic the trend over time is also interesting in every market other than the us exchanges the percentage of foreign listings has fallen since 199515 the decline is most pronounced in the uk and german markets where the percentage of foreign listings was well above us levels in 1995 but is now very similar on the nyse and nasdaq the percentage of foreign listings climbed between 1995 and 2002 and has since held steady figur 3 f or eign listings as p er centa g of t otal 1995 2002 september 2006 source world federation of ex changes the data in figure 3 do not provide clear support for claim that regulatory costs have driven foreign firms away from us stock markets one might argue that the percentage of foreign listings on nasdaq and nyse would have conti nued their upward trend had us regulation not been tightened in 2002 but is that likely given that foreign listings appear to be in decline on major markets around the world more natural inference from the data would be that nasdaq continued nyse group inc nyse to eliminate listing fee applicable to issuers transferring from other markets press release nov 29 2006 14 euronext and the bme spanish exchanges are excluded because consistent and comparable data are not available over the period the september 2006 percentage of

foreign listings since 2002 while other markets have been losing them with the data in figure 3 in mind we might suppose that in the markets shown in figure 2 where total listings have risen faster than in the united stateshong kong london and tokyogrowth was driven by new listings of domestic companies in table 3 which breaks out new foreign and domestic listings on the six largest markets we can observe this process directly g16g142g160g561g14g146g156g157g146g151g144g156g561 the data in table 3 show one common feature dropoff in new listings after the peak of the bull market of the 1990s in five of the six markets there were fewer new listings in 2001 than in 2000 the exception was the nyse where the decline began earlier and 2000 was the trough year this is the predictable result of global bear markettrends and levels of stock prices affect the prices investors are willing to pay for new shares the decline in new listings is most dramatic on the nasdaq and euronext markets probably because more highly speculative business ventures were taken public there than elsewhere 16 there is consistent pattern among the markets in the recovery from the crash over the 11year period shown in table 3 london and nasdaq are the clear leaders in the number of new listings and particularly in domestic listings since the crash however the two markets have fared differently london recorded record numbers during 2004 and 2005 while nasdaq remains well below the peak levels of the late 1990s both us markets registered sharp drops in new listings during 2003 the year after sarbanes oxley was enacted despite the fact that stock prices as measured by the sp 500 rose 26 during that year regulatory shock might explain some of this or it may be that firms took waitandsee attitude as to whether the recovery in stock prices from the trough in october 2002 would last according to nasdaqs 2005 annual re port the fluctuation in the number of us ipos on the nasdaq stock market from 2003 to 2005 was primarily due to market conditions over the past few years competition for new listings has come primarily from the nyse although there is also strong international competition 17 in 2004 and 2005 the number of new listings on both us markets rose above the low figure of 2003 16 this assumes that the bulge in euro next listings between 1997 and 2000 is the result of ipo activity rather than acquisition of new listings through merger with other exch anges the wfe data do not make this distinction 17 nasdaq 2005 annual report p 9 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33796

leveraged buyouts subset of corporate mergers in which all public shares are purchased and taken off the market is the elimination of sec compliance costs this market has shown rapid growth since 2001 as shown in table 6 how much of the rise can be attributed to increased regulatory costs several studies have addressed this question by attempting to measure changes in the propensity of us firms to go private before and after sarbanesoxley kamar karacamandic and talley find that small firms were induced to leave the public markets but that large firms were unaffected21 engel hayes and wang find modest but statistically significant increase in the rate at which firms go private in the postsox period with the effect more pronounced among smaller firms22 other researchers address the difficulty of separating the impact of regulatory costs from other factors because buyouts occur for many reasons and sec disclosures to shareholders in public companies will focus on the value of the consid eration to be received compared to current market values it is difficult to determine what role the costs of compliance with sox and other securities laws played in these decisions 23 21 ehud kamar

rise of the private equity market private equity investors purchase companies either private or public and seek to improve operating results by restructuring or by providing capital the activity is not new but is now more significant factor in the market than ever before the growth has been driven by institutional investors searching for higher returns yields on both debt and equity investment in the public markets have been depressed over the past several years bluechip stock indexes remained below 2000 levels until the fall of 2006 while both long and shortterm interest rates have been low by historical standards at the same time there has been glut of international capital seeking investment opportunities making capital abundant at low interest rates 24 as result alternative investments have thrived including private equity funds in short the boom in mergers and private equity has been produced by combination of economic factors and market conditions the boom continued in 2006 as recent business week article attests whats driving this years merger mania is quite different from what prompted aol to plop down 182 billion for time warner inc in 2000 that boom was fueled by inflated stock prices in an overheated equities market that made companies feel like they were playing with funny money this time the drivers are low interest rates low valuations and robust debt markets one telling difference 60 of this years deals have been paid for in cash vs 29 in 2000 the biggest change though is the unprecedented heft of private equity firms morgan stanley estimate s that buyout shops are now armed with at least 2 trillion in purchasing power far more than ever before the number of publicto private deals in 2006 is set to nearly double the number in 2000 to 205 while their value has soared more than tenfold says paul j taubman global head of ma at morgan stanley yet theres still plenty of room for the boom to continue many companies still look cheap 25 preliminary figures indicate that the value of companies taken private in 2006 reached record level 150 billion worldwide with former nyse listings representing 388 billion london 27 billion and

section of listed companies the studies find that they tend to have serious financial problems which might have led to an involuntary delisting by the exchange in addition leuz triantis and wang find evidence that controlling insiders go dark to protect their private control benefits and decrease outside scrutiny particularly when corporate governance is weak and outside investors are less protected29 healthy firms rarely go dark because there is typically strong negative market reaction thus even if the causal link between rising regulatory costs and goingdark transactions is robust the competitive position of us markets may not suffer as result firms going dark are unlikely to be subject to international competition for listing

international exchanges but listing trends are only part of the picture the basic economic function of securities market is to intermediate between savers and businesses seeking investment capital the capacity of an exchange to facilitate capital formation is also an indicator of its competitive position one of the most frequent claims regarding the declining competitiveness of us markets is that they now handle much smaller share of the worlds initial public offerings than they once did of particular concern is the fact that of the 25 largest ipos in the world in 2005 only one took place on an american exchange have rising regulatory costs driven us firms abroad in search of equity capital or have foreign firms that might have considered us offering gone elsewhere to begin with the first question an examination of the 25 largest ipo deals set out in table 7 suggests that the answer is the only firm on the list domiciled in the united states listed its shares on the nyse table 7 is dominated by french five and chinese four ipos most of these deals including the china construction bank corporation the china shenhua energy limited the bank of communications the china cosco holding company and frances electricite france gez france sanef and eutelsat were privatizations of huge stateowned enterprises it seems unlikely that the french or chinese governments would look favorably on foreign listing for these firms the table indicates that most of the ipo firms chose to list their shares on domestic exchanges for example all the chinese firms listed on the hong kong stock exchange and all of the french firms listed on euronext the same holds true for the austrian australian danish dutch german and japanese firms 30 29 why do firms go dark causes and economic consequences of voluntary sec deregistrations p 3 30 ernst young which compiled the list states that the chinese government played role in encouraging firms to list on the hong kong stock exchange in order to bolster

market showing the value of equity offerings on the six toptier exchanges and hong kong secondtier exchange that appears several times in table 7 total equity issues include both ipos and sales of new stock by established public companies these figures show considerable yeartoyear volatility reflecting not only the variability of stock prices which affect the attractiveness of equity sales as means of raising capital but also the skewing of singleyear data by the presence or absence of few very large transactions the ratio of ipos to offerings by established public companies also shows great variation from year to year probably reflecting the impact of large individual transactions in either category preliminary data suggest that 2006 was record year for ipos with global underwriting exceeding 250 billion 32 russian and chinese firms accounted for just over quarter of this total ipo value on euronext was up 60 to 245 billion over 2005 and doubled on the deutsche börse to 88 billion ipos on the nyse raised total of 25 billion in proceeds excluding closedend mutual funds in 2006 there were 18 ipos by nonus companies raising 65 billion33 the nyse continues to be big fish but the ipo pond is growing the most visible international trend is that all markets show significant drop in equity underwriting in 2000 or 2001 with the end of the bull market34 the performance of the two us exchanges since that time is markedly different nasdaq underwritings remain far below the boom levels2005 equity issues were less than 10 of the 2000 peak on the nyse by contrast the 2005 figure was 78 of the 2000 level the post2000 recoveries in equity issuance on the european exchanges have been strong london experienced only mild dropoff and reached record high in 2004 while euronext in 2005 recorded 75 of its 2000 peak very similar to the nyse experience what does table 8 suggest about the competitiveness of us markets the most striking fact is the dominance of the nyse as market for new equity its 175 billion in 2005 underwriting was more than double that of the nearest competitor and in fact accounted for 293 of total global equity issues however the argument is made that the degree of supremacy is diminishingin 1996 the nyse accounted for 383 of the value of global equity issues 35 several factors underlie the growing share of equity issuance going to foreign markets many countries in the world did not have welldeveloped equity markets until recently these include not only china and eastern europe but also france germany and other continental european states where corporate finance was historical ly dominated by universal banks economic liberalization has provided an impetus for the development of equity financing and computer 32 norma cohen and peter smith upsurge in ipos and private deals financial times jan 2 2007 p 15 in the authors view us regulation does not account for the relative decline in popularity of us exchanges rather they argue companies domiciled outside the us increasingly look to their maturing home markets or to the largest capital market closest to them as listing venue of choice 33 nyse group inc 2006 highlights press release dec 29 2006 34 in securities markets underwriting refers to the proce ss by which companies raise capital by selling also called issuing stocks or bonds to investors this is also known as the primary market as distinguished from the secondary or resale market where investors trade securities among themselv and the company that originally issued the securities does not

trading mechanisms of the new york and london exchanges at relatively low cost36 markets have also expanded rapidly in the highgrowth emerging economies of asia and latin america in short the fact that us stock exchanges are losing market share in global equity trading may reflect positive developments elsewhere rather than impediments imposed here by regulatory and other burdens nyse and nasdaq have certainly not been complacent in the face of rising competition on the contrary they have taken steps like the following pursued mergers with major foreign ex changes nyse with euronext nasdaq with london 37 invested heavily in new trading technology to compete with alternative trading systems cheap computerized transaction facilities and restructured themselves as forprofit shareholderowned corporations in part to prevent entrenched exchange constituencies such as the nyse specialists with financial stake in the status quo from blocking innovations needed to remain competitive 36 cheap computer technology has inspired many predictions of the imminent demise of the nyse over the past decade or so 37 in fact the mergers are driven in large part by the european

transactions which result in firms being taken off the public markets and outside the secs regulatory jurisdiction and the share of global ipo volume handled by us markets has fallen especially among the very largest deals however there are alternative explanations for each of these phenomena based on market conditions and global economic trends the drop in nasdaq listings must be viewed in the context of the aftermath of the 1990s bubble when thousands of technology firms were taken public even though they had real prospects of ever turning profit the nyses stable listings figure on the other hand may be due to policy of maintaining stringent listing standards that exclude all but the largest and most financially sound corporations the private equity boom has been driven by market forces including the availability of relatively abundant and inexpensive debt financing the pressure on pension fund managers and other institutional investors to seek returns higher than those offered since 2000 by traditional investment classes and the high compensation levels earned by private equity managers38 research has indicated that rising regulatory costs have discernible impact on goingprivate decisions primarily among small firms particularly those with financial or governance problems growth in foreign equity underwriting appears to reflect growth in foreign economies such as chinas andor the development of equity markets in countries that historically relied on bank financing such as germany corporations continue to show strong preference for listing on their domestic market or the closest major financial center the data do not suggest that many us firms are choosing to list on foreign exchanges or that foreign firms have abandoned us markets in significant numbers since sarbanesoxley was enacted the impact of sarbanesoxley costs is difficult to measure but quantification of the benefits is even more elusive it is worth noting however that international competition among stock markets has not up to now taken the form of re gulatory race to the bottom in which markets attempt to lure companies by offering more lax regulatory regime than their competitors there is equivalent in equity markets to the offshore banking centers and tax havens that thrive in small jurisdictions like the dutch antilles the isle of man or vanuatu this fact reflects market judgement that investor confidence which is nurtured by the perception that exchanges and regulators devote significant resources to the prevention of fraud has real economic value where stock market growth has been fastest as in ndon and hong kong the securities regulators are generally recognized as capable and vigorous the outcome of global stock market competition has different implications for different market participants if us issuers and traders go overseas to take advantage of lower regulatory or other costs the us securities industry will suffer loss of
