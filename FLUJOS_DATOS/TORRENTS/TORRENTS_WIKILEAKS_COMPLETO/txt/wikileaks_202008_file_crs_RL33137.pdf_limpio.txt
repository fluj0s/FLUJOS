the program provides various types of payments including compensation to leas for the federal ownership of certain prope rty funds for school construction and compensation to leas enrolling federally connected children federally connected children include for example children whose parents are in the armed forces as well as children whose parents are employed on federal property such as military installation educating fe derally connected children imposes service burden revenue burden or both on an lea as the lea may not receive the benefit of tax revenues to support their education leas losing or gaining federally connected students as result of the brac recommendations may experience substantial challenges these challenges may be created by the significant changes required by the brac recommendations but may also stem from the structure of the impact aid program for leas experiencing decline in enrollment the leas may need to release staff or consolidate students into smaller number of facilities the structure of the impact aid program will provide these leas with relatively brief period of time to make n ecessary adjustments without loss of funding for leas gainin g federally connected students as result of the brac recommendations the structure of the impact aid program delays these leas from receiving immediate impact aid payments to adjust to the change in

overview of the impact aid program the impact aid program was establis hed in 1950 by pl 81874 and pl 81 815 pl 81874 authorized financial assistance for ma intenance and operations to leas adversely affected by the activities of the federal government the improving americas school act of 1994 iasa p l 103382 which reauthorized the elementary and secondary education act of 1965 esea repealed pl 81874 and pl 81815 and included the impact aid program in esea title v iii the impact aid program was most recently reauthorized by the child left behind act of 2001 pl 107110 extending the pr ogram authorization through 20073 the impact aid program supports va rious types of payments including compensation to leas for the federal ow nership of certain property section 8002 funds for school construction and f acilities upgrades section 8007 and compensation to leas enrolling federally connected children section 8003 the latter is the most relevant payment for the purposes of this report as it provides compensation to districts enrolling military students living on or off base more specifically federally connected children ar children who reside with parent who is member of the armed forces living on or off federal prope rty reside with parent who is an accredited foreign military officer living on federal property reside on indian lands reside in wrent public housing or resi with parent who is civilian working andor living on federal property from the inception of the impact aid program federally connected children have been placed in different categories that are assigned corresponding weights based on the burden they impose on leas the burden imposed by federallyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33137crs3 connected children results from service burden revenue burden or both the service burden is result of leas having to educate federally connected children without receiving the benef it of tax revenues to support their education the revenue burden stems from the existence of federa l property within the lea that is not subject to property taxes the burdens imposed by various categorie s of federally connected children are reflected in the weights assigned to each type of child table 1 contains the current weights for each category of federally connected children table 1 types of federally connected children and relevant weights children attending school

be reduced to correspond with appropriations 5 brac commission report executive summarythus federally connected children whos parents are members of the armed forces and live on federal property whose parents live and work on federal property whose parents are officials of foreign government that serve as foreign military officers and live on federal prope rty or who reside on indian lands carry the highest weight in the impact aid payments for fe derally connected children lesser weights are attributed to federally connected children whose parents are members of the armed forces but do not live on federal property currently to calculate an impact aid payment to an lea the district first identifies the number of students served in each category identified in table 1 the number of students in each category is then multiplied by the appr opriate weight and summed to create the school districts weig hted student count this count is then used to calculate the leas maximum basic support payment and actual basic support payment4 overview of base realignment and closure recommendations the first brac commission was authorized by the defense authorization amendments and base realignment and closure act of 1988 pl 100256 leading to the first round of brac in 1988 th is was followed by the defense based closure and realignment act of 1990 wh ich provided the authorization for subsequent brac rounds in 1991 1993 and 1995 the first four rounds of brac resulted in the closure or realignment of 97 bases the current brac round was authorized by the national defense aut horization act of 2002 pl 107107 the current brac commission received list of recommended actions from the secretary of defense on may 13 2005 it subsequently submitted its recommendations to the administration on september 8 2005 after agreeing with the commissions recommendations the president sent the report to congress on september 15 2005 for approval congress d 45 days to enact joint resolution of disapproval otherwise the recommendations become law on october 27 2005 the house voted 32485 against joint resolu tion to end the military base closure and realignment process sponsored

implement the recommended changes military and civilian staff will move when they do leave leas losing or receiving families as result of the brac commissions recommendations may experience substantial changes7 this section discusses possible effects of the loss of military children on leas followed by discussion of the challenges leas receiving large numbers of students may face leas losing federally connected students as result of brac in calculating payments to leas the u s department of education ed uses student enrollment data from the pr ior school year section 8003a18 therefore leas that experience decline in enrollment as result of brac will continue to receive impact aid funding for student s leaving the lea for the school year following their departure essentially this provides the lea with one year to adjust to the decrease in enrollment allowing time for the district to make decisions related to changes in student enrollment9 for example the decline in student enrollment may necessitate releasing staff or consolidating students into smaller number of facilities beyond this oneyear hold harmless period leas losing federally connected students as result of brac will not receive impact aid payments for the students longer enrolled in the district in some instances the loss of military facility may be translated into new economic development opportunities for the surr ounding community as commun ities explore base rede velopment potential10 depending on the ultimate use of the facility such as an airport port facility or educational facility new families may be attracted to the area increasing student enrollment and potentially generating the need for more teachers and possibly school facilities these changes may takehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33137crs8 11 several communities surrounding m ilitary fac ilities slated for closure such as fort monroe virginia fort monmouth new jersey and fort gillem georgia which

highqualified teachers for more information also see crs report rl30834 k12 teacher quality issues and legislative action by jeffrey j kuenzi 13 as discussed later in this report the ava ilability of impact aid funding for the following school year for these students is dependent upon wh in the school year they arrive relative to student count dates for the impact aid programseveral years to materialize thus potentially failing to generate new student enrollment quickly enough to replace the loss of students to the brac process11 leas gaining federally connected students as result of brac since basic support payments to as are based on prioryear student enrollment data leas that gain students as result of brac will not receive impact aid funding for those new students until they have been enrolled in the district for at least part of school year that is the lea will not immediately receive additional impact aid funding as result of the increa in enrollment while receiving leas have been provided with some advance notice of potential changes through the brac process leas receiving large numbers of students may experience substantial financial burden for the first school year in which the students are enrolled in addition decisions that the lea needs to make that are dependent on impact aid payments such as staffing decisions may be complicated by the timing of the data collection process used to determine subsequent payments and the timing of actual payments leas experiencing large increases in th number of students as result of the brac recommendations may also need to hire several new teachers to meet the educational needs of these students leas may experience problems in finding enough highly qualified teachers as requi red under the child left behind act12 hiring them to coincide with the shift in student population and finding funds for their salaries as previously mentioned impact aid funding for students arriving in the lea as result of the brac will not be available until the following school year at the earliest13 this puts the burden of supporting new staff on the lea for at least the short term it should be noted that pl 81 874 included provisions for sudden and substantial increases in attendance that are not included in current law under section 4 of pl 81874 leas that experi enced at least 5 increase in student enrollment from one school year to the next as direct result of activities of thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33137crs9 14 pl 81874 was signed into law prior to th establishment of the us department of education at the time there was commi ssioner of education who was subsequently replaced by the secretary of education when education was elevated to cabinetlevel position the reference to the commissioner in pl 81874 was not updated 15 the fy2008 laborhealth and human servic eseducation appropriations act pl 110 161 restricts the allocation of secti on 8007 funds to competitive grants onlyunited states and met certain other requirements would have been eligible to receive compensation for serving these new students the increase in enrollment had to result in substantial and continuing fi nancial burden on the lea and the lea had to be making reasonable tax effort and exercising due diligence in availing itself of state and other financial assistance but be unable to meet the increased educational costs invol ved section 4a if these conditions were met leas were eligible to receive funding for the fiscal year in which the increase in enro llment occurred equal to the product of the number of new children enrolled in the lea that the commissioner of education14 commissioner determined to be the direct result of the activities of the united states multiplied by the amount determin ed by the commissioner to constitute the current expenditure level required to provide free public education minus the amount determined by the commissioner to be available from state local and federal sources for the purpose of providing free pub lic education in the subsequent fiscal year leas were still entitled to receive ex tra support for any of these students for whom the lea would not receive compen sation under an impact aid payment for federally connected children these provi sions are not included in current impact aid statutory language another potential problem facing leas receiving large influxes of new students as result of brac may be related to facilities some leas may receive more students than can be accommodated in exis ting facilities the impact aid program provides payments related to school construction nd repair under section 8007 these funds are used to make formula grants and competitive grants for the construction program15 of the total funds appropria ted for this section 40 are distributed to leas that receive funds through section 8003 and meet specific criteria the remaining funds are used to award competitive grants for emergency repairs and modernization emergency repair grants ma be used to repair or renovate facility due to health or safety hazards modernization grants may be used to alter facility to alleviate overcrowding or to provide more modern services eg telecommunications statutory language currently gives higher priority to emergency repair grants than to modernization gran ts and requires emerge ncy repair grants to be awarded based on the severity of the emergency construction grants may only be awarded to leas that are eligible to receive support under section 8003 leas experiencing large increases in student enrollment as result of brac may consider applying for section 8007 grant if they can demonstrate they meet the criteria to receive funding however there will pot entially be delay between when the students arrive and when major adjustments to facilities can be made in addition the total section 8007 appropriation fo r fy2008 175 million for example might not be sufficient to adequately assist all of the leas experiencing large influx of new students with facility issues other federal program would currently providehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33137crs10 16 us department of educa tion office of elementary and

following yeara dedicated source of funding to address facilityspecific issues requiring immediate or near term attention as result of an increase in student enrollment due to brac another issue that may affect leas receiving students as result of brac is the student count process student counts for the impact aid program are due to the ed by january 31 each school year the c ounts must be taken earlier than the 4th day of the regular school year and before ja nuary 31 of that school year if students transfer into the lea after january 31 th students will not be included in the student count used to calculate impact ai d programs for the subsequent school year based on instructions provided to leas by ed for fy2009 impact aid payments leas were permitted to conduct sec ond student count after january 31 2008 but before may 14 200816 leas conducting second c ounts were also required to resubmit their impact aid applicati ons by september 30 2008 fy2009 payments will be based on an average of the two c ounts leas that receive students after january 31 will need to take steps to ensure that this second count occurs while they may not receive full compensation during th next school year for any additional federally connected students received as result of the brac due to the averaging of the first and second counts failure to conduct the second count and the associated paperwork could result in leas receiving impact aid payments for federally connected students enrolling afte r the january 31 count date finally unlike other federa l education programs the impact aid program is not forwardfunded meaning that the earliest that appropriations could be made available to leas is the first day of the fiscal year17 for example the earliest fy2009 appropriations could be pr ovided to leas would be october 1 2008 thus even leas that enrolled large numbers of federa lly connected students as result of the brac recommendations and were able to submit enrollment data to ed that included those pupils would not have impact aid payments for those students on the first day of the new school year in practi ce impact aid payments are often not made as single payment with leas receivi ng multiple payments throughout the school year in addition depending on the budget appropriations process in congress payments could be further delayed if congress does not pass the
