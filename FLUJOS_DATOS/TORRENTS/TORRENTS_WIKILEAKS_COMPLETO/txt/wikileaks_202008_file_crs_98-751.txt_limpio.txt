defense thaad flight testing steven hildreth specialist in national defense foreign affairs defense and trade division summary after two successful intercepts in june and august 1999 the pentagon announced it would scrap the remaining thaad flight tests and proceed to the emd engineering and manufacturing development phase doing so the pentagon and others argue would save some money and expedite thaad deployment somewhat thaad supporters argue that these intercepts have validated the systems major components and that the systems nearterm deployment is now possibility critics continue to argue that thaads checkered test legacy over controlled test range is insufficient for the program to move forward with high confidence and caution that costly system fixes may lie in store for thaad in the future congress has appropriated about 38 billion for the thaad effort since 1989 the administration is requesting 44 billion for fiscal years fy 2000 2005 the total program acquisition cost is estimated at 147 billion this report will be updated after future developments for broader treatment see crs issue brief 98028 background the thaad program is designed to field as soon as possible an uppertier system upper atmospherelower space to hit and destroy attacking theater or mediumrange ballistic missiles1 currently the first thaad units are scheduled to begin delivery in fy2005 and continue through fy2013 the thaad program is in part product of long standing congressional support for developing and deploying effective theater missile 1 for an assessment of global

program is critical to the overall thaad effort and is examined briefly in the following section thaad flight test program the thaad program has experienced numerous schedule delays and test failures both the pentagon and the general accounting office gao have examined the test program because of concern over variety of flight test problems gao recommended in september 1997 that congress pursue slower test and development program before committing to thaad acquisition decision in february 1998 pentagon group panel on reducing risk in ballistic missile defense flight test programs found that numerous technical failures were due to poor design and fabrication inadequate test planning and preflight review as well as the pressure to test in debating the fy 1999 defense bill senator bingaman cited both these reports in criticizing thaads rush to failure and pointed out that the program at that time was four years behind schedule congressional record may 13 1998 s4755 eleven tests have been conducted since 1995 the primary test objectives in the initial tests and the subsequent interceptor test objectives are summarized in the table below it should be added however that each of these tests had numerous other objectives in fact the pentagon stressed that the latest test accomplished most of its objectives the primary 2 see steven hildreth and paul zinsmeister the patriot air

technical advice lockheed martin also accepted costsharing arrangement with the pentagon of 75 million if it failed to achieve three successful intercepts of the remaining five scheduled tests this arrangement placed emphasis on completing the tests earlier rather than later 3 according to the pentagon telemetry data from thaad was lost completely after about minute into the flight hence this has complicated efforts to determine the precise cause of the intercept failure nonetheless bmdo currently believes the likely cause was failure of one of the divert and attitude control system thrusters which began to degrade after about 20 seconds into the flight crs4 because ft9 march 30 1999 failed lockheedmartin was penalized 15 million technically lockheedmartin will not bill the government for 15 million of effort under this particular contract with the second successful test on august 2 lockheedmartin avoided 20 million penalty penalties established in law for additional test failures have apparently been waived with the decision to scrap the remaining flight tests despite the previous test failures the ballistic missile defense organization bmdo praised lockheedmartins efforts specifically bmdo cited improvements in management and program leadership stronger technical support and enhanced engineering quality control procedures many suggested that the recent successful tests are due in small part to these management and quality control improvements currently the us army is preparing for an emd decision possibly late 1999 or early 2000 as part of that decision an independent cost assessment for thaad will have to be completed congressional concerns congress has had much to say about the thaad program there remains overall support for thaad as evidenced in the fy1999 house and senate defense authorization and defense appropriation subcommittee reports funding cuts were generally related to savings due to envisioned delays in testing and acquisition of an early operational thaad capability although both defense committees expressed support for an early deployment concept the house appropriations committee hac raised serious questions about the plan at that time this year congress directed critical questions to bmdo and thaad program managers regarding the flight test program but after the recent successful flight tests congressional concerns about the program as reflected in current defense authorization and appropriations bills may be relieved issues for congress for more than decade congress has wanted to deploy an effective tmd to protect us forces and interests abroad against what many consider variety of nearterm ballistic missile threats the principal weapons candidate for this mission has made significant improvements as demonstrated in the two recent test successes but has thaad demonstrated that it can meet the requirements to defend us troops and assets against fast moving mediumrange ballistic missiles there remain two strong and divergent schools of thought in this regard meanwhile there simply are other nearterm hitto kill technologies available for this mission in the near or midterm future congress recognizing national security need to deal with the threat posed from mediumrange ballistic missiles has made significant budgetary and political commitment to thaad how will the uppertier plan for tmd be affected which states that one of two programs thaad or navy theater wide will be selected as the lead area tmd effort and given more funding and support while the other is put on lower schedule will time and money lead to the deployment of an effective thaad system should the pace and scope of this commitment continue or be adjusted as some have recently crs5 suggested are there advantageous alternative or concurrent technical military or political approaches to counter longrange theater ballistic missiles if the thaad program cannot produce an effective tmd system what are the near and mediumterm implications for us national security and for us troops deployed overseas in areas where troops are threatened by ballistic missiles even if the thaad program is successful the system is likely to be less than perfect what then are the implications of the hostile deployment of theater ballistic missiles with weapons of mass destruction or their threat of use on us military strategy for other versions of this document see httpwikileaksorgwikicrs98751
