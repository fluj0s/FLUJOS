airport which had until that time been under the jurisdiction of kfor was handed over to civilian jurisdiction under icao regulations 9 it is against this background of change that pro curement procedures relating to the following contract have been examined 10 this report relates to the contract for the struction of new car park at pristina airport the value of the contract was 80 1438 it also deals with single source contract to supply and install the li ghting system at the airport car park in the sum of 34501 and second contract to supply and install cover for the automatic barriers in the new car park in the s um of 24864 11 the case concerns allegations of corruption and irregularities in the tender procedures arising out of the procurement and contr act award for the construction of the new car park at pristina airpor t single source contract to supply and install the lighting system at the airpo rt car park and further contract to supply and install cover for the automatic bar riers in the new car park 12 an internal memorandum from doti official 2 and airport engineer 1 dated 10 august 2001 indicates that the initial proposal to provide new car park came from the peap official due to flooding in the area being used as the airport car park at that time although the proposal was postpo ned until the following year to ensure that the tender was launched in an appropria manner and to ensure that necessary funding was in place v investigative details allegation 1 it is alleged that two draft bid evaluation report s for the car park construction indicate that vendor 1 had bid security informat ion in their bid documentation however the company is indicated in the final bid evaluation report and document entitled report about rejection of the companies to have passed the evaluation before being awarded the contract for the construct ion of the car park 13 tender exercise was launched on 16 august 200 2 for the construction of new car park at pristina airport the bid submission adline was 14 september 2002 the tender evaluation process occurred on 17 september 2002 according to an undated letter written by the procurement off icer to the members of the evaluation committee 14 two undated draft bid evaluation reports for th car park construction indicate that vendor 1 had bid security ie that it d not submitted security from its bank to guarantee its participation in the tender however final bid evaluation report dated 30 september 2002 indicates that the c ontractor vendor 1 passed the evaluation and was awarded the contract for the construction of the car park 15 contractual agreement between unmik and vend or 1 dated 1 october 2002 was signed by official 4 pillar iv on behalf of pri stina airport information received from the procurement officer suggests it w as signed by vendor 1 representative during meeting on 5 october 2002 16 when asked about the apparent difference betwee n the two draft bid evaluation reports and the final bid evaluation report in his her interview pristina airport civil engineer who was on the evaluation committee indicated that the first two draft bid evaluation reports related to the tender opening meeting at which heshe was not present therefore heshe could not indica the reason for the comments heshe added that the final bid evaluatio n document dealt with the technical evaluation of the tender and confirmed t hat vendor 1 submitted correct documentation as result of which it was selected as one of the companies that fulfilled the specifications required in the tender 17 the procurement officer indicated that the firs t two draft evaluation bids were given to himher by the evaluation committee as wor king sheets and added that heshe did not view the draft documents as being of ficial documents as they were not signed the procurement officer added the bank guarantee of vendor 1 had all the conditions and they submitted the request for this project but the bank had forgotten to include the guarantee price but refer red to the project which indirectly includes the sum regarding this project this was the first project on which i worked at the airport and we decided that t he bank guarantee would not be decisive factor in the evaluation decision w the committee where i had evaluation right went for technical evaluatio n in deciding which company would do the job this was the verbal decision of the evaluation committee the procurement officer also added since this was one of the first evaluations we tolerated that aspect but regarding the other proj ects we were stricter 18 the itf is unable to verify the procurement off icers statement as it has not seen copy of the bid security in the contract fil in addition the itf was not able to interview vendor 1 since its representativ is potential suspect in an ongoing police investigation itf case 21802 19 bank guarantee for advance payment and perf ormance security have been located in the contract file however they are bot h dated 16 october 2002 after the contract had been signed 20 when asked what type of document vendor 1 had s ubmitted in support of its bid and it whereabouts the procurement officer told th itf the original copy of bank guarantee for offer security was given back to vendor 1 based on the rules since it brought the guarantee for performance and copy has to be here in the file but it can be found at the bank due to data protection provisions the itf was unable to secure copy of it allegation 2 it is alleged in note from airport engineer 3 to the procurement officer dated 26 september 2002 that vendor 2 handed an open envelo pe to the peap official containing documents relating to the companys tend er submission including two disks after the time for submission of bids had cl osed and that the peap official gave the envelope to airport engineer 3 for checkin g 21 note from airport engineer 3 to the procureme nt officer dated 26 september 2002 indicates that vendor 2 handed an open envelope containing tender documents and two diskettes to the peap official w hich heshe then handed to airport engineer 3 for evaluation it is not clear whether the envelopes contained either complete bid or the technical part of the tender documents 22 the note also indicates that the evaluation com mittee were on the point of finishing their evaluation for the new car park th erefore the time for submission of tenders had closed 23 airport engineer 3s note states that the peap official had asked the consulting company to draft the technical specifications and lleges that vendor 2 were improperly given the opportunity to examine the ten der specifications prior to submitting their bid 24 the itf has been unable to contact airport engi neer 3 to discuss the incident despite efforts to trace himher through the author ities of hisher country in addition it was not possible to conduct an intervi ew with vendor 2 representative since heshe is longer based in kosovo 25 letter dated 25 september 2002 from the consu lting company to peap indicates that the company prepared the complete do ssier for the airport car park and submitted it to peap on 14 june 2002 the consu ltant confirmed this to the itf and explained that the consulting company had d rafted the technical specifications and drawings for the car park as an introductory donation to promote its services 26 when the peap official was asked in interview b the itf on what date the incident involving vendor 2 took place heshe gave long convoluted and evasive response the peap official first sought to confuse the issue by suggesting that the documents in the envelope hande d to himher were the technical specifications for the car park produced by the consulting company which formed the basis of the ongoing evaluation be ing undertaken by the evaluation committee it was then pointed out to hi mher that peap had received the technical specifications on 14 june 2002 there fore the evaluation committee would already have been in possession of them following this heshe changed his answer and indicated that heshe was confused and was not aware about the date 27 the peap official added that vendor 2 represent ative brought package tied with string to the airport rather than an open env elope and stated that heshe was informed it contained the technical specificati ons in hardcopy and soft copy as well as the tender documents for the car park nder however heshe could not specify the date on which this was alleged to h ave happened 28 the peap official was asked whether vendor 2 d already submitted bid for the contract to build the new car park the peap of ficial stated i dont remember i believe i dont know but according to the discussion that i had with the divisional manager and airport engineer 3 the latter told us that vendor 2 should be eliminated because they brought the docum ent physically to the airport and heshe must have had the data beforeha nd therefore vendor 2 should not be allowed to compete in the tender 29 this response is contradictory if vendor 2 had not submitted bid by 26 september 2002 then they would have been too late to do so at the date of this incident it should be noted that time for submissi on of bids closed on 14 september 2002 and the memorandum from airport engi neer 3 states that the evaluation had nearly finished the question as to whether the bid was submitted to the airport physically or by other means is imma terial 30 the itf asked the divisional manager whether meeting had been held with the peap official and airport engineer 3 to which he re plied not to my knowledge there are notes of any meeting and the divisiona l manager indicated that heshe did not have any idea what this incident cerned 31 the peap official denied giving the open envelo pe to airport engineer 3 to evaluate indicating only that heshe was present w hen vendor 2 representative gave the envelope to airport engineer 3 32 the peap official was asked why vendor 2 repres entative would have given the document or offer to airport engineer 3 when secti on 2 of the bidding documents at paragraph 142a states that the procur ement officer is the person to whom bids should be submitted the peap official replied vendor 2 brought the technical specifications to be checked by airport engineer 3 and to be delivered to the office of the procurement to th procurement officer for tender procedures 33 having regard to the period during which the in cident took place this is unlikely since the bid opening meeting had already taken pla ce an alternative explanation in the view of the itf for handing th documents to airport engineer 3 is that heshe was member of the evaluation com mittee and the documents represented an out of time or altered bid or tende r specifications which had been irregularly received by vendor 2 allegation 3 it is alleged that singlesource procurement had b een requested for the new car park lighting system when competitive process wou ld have sufficed had the project for the construction of the car park been dequately planned and executed 34 article 31 of unmik finance administrative inst ruction 19992 on public procurement provides that emergency procurement may be used for goods works or services if the need for the procurement i s urgent the conditions giving rise to the urgency were not under the control of n or due to the negligence or other actions of either the requesting or the pro curing entity and the urgency could not reasonably have been foreseen 35 following the tender procedure in september 200 2 vendor 1 was awarded the contract for the construction of the car park and contractual agreement was signed on 1 october 2002 36 less than one month later memorandum from th pristina airport civil engineer to the divisional manager dated 21 october 2002 requested single source procurement for the lighting system at the c ar park the justification for the single source was that the lighting pillars had cable the transformer was obstructed and there was electricity supply for the light 37 the request was approved by the divisional mana ger on 25 october 2002 and authorised as singlesource procurement by staff member of unmik office of the legal adviser on behalf of the kta official on 28 october 2002 38 later memorandum from the divisional manager to the kta official dated 13 april 2003 indicates that the lighting system in the car park had to be inst alled first so that work on the asphalting of the surface and kerbstone could go ah ead as this system was located under the surface of these structures 39 this justification raises the question as to wh the lighting system was not included in the contract for the construction of th main car park 40 when asked why the lighting system was not incl uded in the contract for the construction of the main car park the pristina air port civil engineer stated this is very good question that concerned as well i think that the previous system was not done properly and for that reason it started to be damaged for example the electric cables started to get cut due to the vehicles that were passing there cables were simply covered by gravel and they were not deep enough under ground 41 the pristina airport civil engineer was asked w hether in view of this any tests were carried out on the car park lighting system h she replied i do not know whether test was carried out or t in this regard but i can say that it was very clear that the lighting system was not working due to the fact that the electric cables were cut in many places 42 doti official 2 who left unmik employ before th tender for the car park was launched confirmed this by stating the cable in the car park which was separate from the one connecting the airport to the electricity substation was very ba dly damaged by heavy vehicles by about december 2000january 2001 due the fact t hat it had not been laid sufficiently deep under the ground 43 the peap official in contrast when asked why t he lighting system was not included in the contract for the construction of th main car park stated in the part of the car park which was not being us ed the cables were damaged by kfor and civilian vehicles to the extent that th ey were laid bare we did not include new lighting system because w thought the cables were undamaged there were not too many arguments which indicated the cables were damaged until the work started 44 memorandum from doti official 2 and airport ngineer 1 indicates that the area of ground used as the airport car park also ffered from flooding 45 the consultant from the consulting company th company which designed the car park was asked whether his technical specifica tions included lighting system heshe replied the technical specifications did not include provi sion for lighting system and at that time my contact was the peap official the requirements given to by the peap official were of general nature s uch as the number of car parking spaces and the location of the car park i remember that the poles for the lights were already there 46 in summary the lighting system was not include d in the contract for the construction of the main car park due to poor mana gement and forward planning allegation 4 it is alleged that approval of the contract and th capital expenditure approval for the new lighting system appears to have been reques ted retrospectively ie after the work had been completed 47 capital expenditure approval form for the lig hting system was signed by the divisional manager on 2 november 2002 and countersi gned on 6 november 2002 by the staff member of unmik office of the leg adviser 48 the airport signed contract with vendor 1 to supply and install the lighting system at the airport car park on 29 january 2003 the value of the contract was 34501 49 note dated 30 january 2003 from the procureme nt officer to official 5 pillar iv indicates request was made for official 5s autho risation to enter into the contract 50 routing slip from kta internal auditor to t he kta official dated 6 march 2003 raises concerns at the authorisation of single so urce procurement for the contract to supply and install the lighting system at the airport car park specifically the kta internal auditor asserts that the documentation does not support single source procurement there is evid ence the public procurement rules had been followed and there is evidence th contract had been signed off by the legal department as result the kta in ternal auditor refused to give approval for the capital expenditure 51 analysis of memorandum from the divisional ma nager to the kta official dated 13 april 2003 in response to the refusal of the kt internal auditor to approve capital expenditure for the contract to supply and install the lighting system at the airport car park indicates at item 2 that due to t he necessity to complete the asphalting of the car park the divisional manager gave the go ahead for the work on the car park lighting system prior to receiving capital expenditure approval in any event 52 the note is confirmed by an email from the kta official to the divisional manager dated 14 april 2003 in which heshe reminds the div isional manager that heshe must obtain capital expenditure approval prior to i nitiating procurement contracting and implementation procedures 53 the divisional manager when asked in interview whether heshe obtained financial approval retrospectively stated that is correct from memory this is one of the fe w times i did this because at this time clearance of document by the kta was incr edibly slow to the extent that it would have affected the operational viability of the airport i gave approval for the work to go ahead but did not approve for any mo nies to be paid i took the decision with great reluctance because the previous experience i had had with the ktas slow procedure in approvals would have re sulted in the bad weather setting in before the car park could be partially c ompleted 54 bid evaluation report dated 24 june 2003 ind icates that competitive tender was held for the award of contract to provide c overing for the automatic barriers in the car park the report confirmed that the contract was awarded to the contractor vendor 1 55 contract was signed by the divisional manager on behalf of pristina airport with vendor 1 on 25 june 2003 in the sum of 24 86496 whilst it is note that this was done buy means of competitive tender it should have been included in the tender for the new car park vii analysis of evidence allegation 1 56 two draft bid evaluation reports indicate in th preliminary examination section that vendor 1 had bid security in the first doc ument the wording bid security is written in manuscript and in the secon d the albanian equivalent also indicates the same information neither document is signed nor has the itf been unable to identify the author of the documents 57 in the final bid evaluation report the bid fro m vendor 1 is indicated to have contained complete documentation been technically responsive commercially responsive have the correct bid validity and be ac ceptable for financial examination 58 an undated report detailing the reasons for rej ection of ten companies indicates inter alia that certain companies did not have the ir bid security in the format as requested or that the bid security was not valid s requested in addition the report indicates views concerning the pricing level however the only comment referring to vendor 1 is the word passed 59 four companies are indicated to have bid at high price despite the fact that their prices were lower than the second placed comp any against whose name there was comment 60 the itf has been unable to verify the format of the bank guarantee submitted in support of its bid since copy of it was left on the file however on strict interpretation of the rules based upon the draft valuation report and the procurement officers response in hisher interview dated 6 july 2004 vendor 1 did not submit bank guarantee in accordance with the requirements of the tender rules 61 having regard to the fact that an undated repor t detailing the reasons for rejection of ten companies indicates inter alia that certain companies did not have their bid security in the format as requested or that the bi d security was not valid as requested this suggests that the evaluation of the bids for the car park tender was inconsistent 62 in summary evidence indicates that vendor 1 w hich was awarded the contract for the construction of the new car park did not s ubmit bank guarantee in accordance with the requirements of the tender rule s in addition the decision to award the tender to vendor 1 appears to be based on an inconsistent evaluation of the bids from which it appears to have benefite d 63 whilst noting that this was one of the procurem ent officers first tender exercises at the airport heshe was the procurement speciali st present at the time and therefore responsible for the process allegation 2 64 evidence in the note of airport engineer 3 date d 26 september 2002 suggests that the peap official received an open envelope fr om vendor 2 after the date on which the evaluation was due to take place whic h heshe then passed to airport engineer 3 to evaluate the contents of the envelope appear to have been either technical documents received by vendor 2 with view to affording the company an advantage in the tender for the new car park or an out of time bid by the company 65 the attempt by vendor 2 to obtain an improper dvantage in the tender procedure appears to have occurred with the apparen t knowledge and acquiescence of the peap official whilst it is not ed that the procurement officer excluded the company from the tender it should hav been the responsibility of the peap official to draw the matter to the procure ment officers attention and take appropriate action 66 the peap officials responses in interview when asked about the incident lead the itf to doubt the truthfulness of his evidence and suggest irregular conduct allegation 3 67 the ground on which the car park was to be buil t was known to be prone to flooding and the cables in the area of the new car park were clearly damaged long time before the contract for the main car park was signed in addition the cables for the lighting system had to go under the main car park it therefore represents poor management and forward planning tha t provision was made for lighting system in the contract for the main car park and tests were carried out to see whether the existing car park li ghting system worked prior to work beginning on the car park 68 the conditions required by article 31 of unmik finance administrative instruction 19992 on public procurement to justify an emergency procurement procedure are not fulfilled in this case since the single source emergency procurement arose due to poor forward planning and the urgency could reasonably have been foreseen 69 the persons responsible for these shortcomings are firstly the peap official who proposed the project together with persons res ponsible for checking the main specifications and contract for the main car p ark specifically the airport engineers present at the time airport engineer 2 nd to lesser extent airport engineer 3 who took over in july 2002 70 second contract for canopy over the entry b arriers was tendered using the competitive shopping procedure in june 2003 and c ontract awarded to vendor 1 whilst the tender process appears to comply with competitive procedures it should also have formed part of the main car park t ender allegation 4 71 evidence indicates the divisional manager gave the approval to proceed with the work on the car park lighting system prior to obtai ning the necessary capital expenditure approval viii conclusions 72 evidence indicates that vendor 1 which was awa rded the contract for the construction of the new car park did not submit bank guarantee in accordance with the requirements of the tender rules in addit ion the decision to award the tender to vendor 1 appears to be based on an incons istent evaluation of the bids from which it appears to have benefited 73 whilst noting that this was one of the procurem ent officers first tender exercises at the airport heshe was the procurement speciali st present at the time 74 evidence in the note of airport engineer 3 date d 26 september 2002 suggests that the peap official received an open envelope fr om the company vendor 2 after the date on which the evaluation of the tende rs was due to take place which heshe then passed to airport engineer 3 to evaluat the contents of the envelope appear to have been either technical docum ents received by vendor 2 with view to affording the company an advantage i n the tender for the new car park or an out of time bid by the company 75 this appears to have occurred with the apparent knowledge and acquiescence of the peap official whilst it is noted that the proc urement officer excluded the company from the tender it should have been the re sponsibility of the peap official to draw the matter to the procurement offi cers attention and take appropriate action 76 the peap officials responses in interview whe n asked about the incident lead the itf to doubt the truthfulness of his evidence and suggest irregular conduct 77 the entire process therefore represents poor ma nagement and forward planning in that provision was made for lighting system in the contract for the main car park and tests were carried out to see wheth er the existing car park lighting system worked prior to work beginning on t he car park 78 the conditions required by article 31 of unmik finance administrative instruction 19992 on public procurement to justify an emergency procurement procedure are not fulfilled since the single sourc emergency procurement arose due to poor forward planning and the urgency could reasonably have been foreseen 79 the persons responsible for these shortcomings are firstly the peap official who proposed the project together with persons respons ible for checking the main specifications and managing the contract for the ma in car park specifically the airport engineers present at the time airport engin eer 2 and to lesser extent airport engineer 3 80 second contract for canopy over the entry b arriers was tendered using the competitive shopping procedure in june 2003 and c ontract awarded to vendor 1 whilst the tender process appears to comply with competitive procedures it should also have formed part of the main car park t ender 81 evidence indicates the divisional manager gave the approval to proceed with the work on the car park lighting system prior to obtai ning capital expenditure approval xi recommendations 82 the itf offers the following recommendations it is recommended that unmik considers and reviews the performance of the procurement officer in the conduct of the car park tender exercise for any action deemed appropriate iv0427401 it is recommended that the peap officials failures in respect of hisher actions in the incident concerning vendor 2 and in hisher fa ilure to fulfil hisher responsibilities in the management and forward plan ning of the project for the construction of the new car park be reviewed for ny action deemed appropriate iv0427402 it is recommended that unmik review the roles of th airport engineers present at the time airport engineer 2 and to lesser ext ent airport engineer 3 for any appropriate action deemed necessary iv0427403 it is recommended that the itfs findings concernin g the peap officials evasive and contradictory responses in interview be conside red together with hisher apparent unwillingness to accept managerial respons ibility for any appropriate action deemed necessary iv0427404 it is recommended that unmik review the performance of the divisional manager in approving the contract for the car park lighting system prior to obtaining capital expenditure approval and in light of the fact that the divisional manager has left the mission this report should be placed on his pe rsonnel file for future
