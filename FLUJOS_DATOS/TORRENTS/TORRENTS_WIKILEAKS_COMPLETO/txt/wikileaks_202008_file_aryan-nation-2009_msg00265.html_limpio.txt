captain tãrni was discharged from the army after six years of service the legendary platoon leader and commander was now without any work tãrni was wandering around finland after the war he had lost his home in vyborg now soviet and he really had good civilian education all he had ever wanted to be was soldier because of the peace treaty with the soviets former ss soldiers were not allowed to work in governmental offices the soviets did not trust men trained in germany and fighters against the soviets wearing the ssuniform lauri tãrni could not accept the fact that for finland the war was over he strongly believed the war could have been won by cooperating totally with the germans but instead of fighting in karelia the finnish area stalin had ripped away from the finns marshal mannerheim and the finnish army had switched sides and even started waging war against their erstwhile german allies up in lapland in northern finland â albeit they did so only under massive soviet pressure stalin in early october 44 if you do not attack the germans in lapland within 48 hours the red army will enter finland to help you in the fall of 1944 the germans were leaving his country via southern finland and offered to help any finn as they could the german gestapo officers promised to take as many finnish volunteers to germany with them as wanted to join the decision wasnt difficult for tãrni tãrni left his parents house in vaasa and arrived in the capital helsinki where he and his former ss friend jalo korpela were recruited by the finnish gestapo contact john artur hjãrklund on the 23rd of january 1945 tãrni and 20 other finnish ssvolunteers stepped into kriegsmarine submarine that would take them to germany plans to liberate finland during the lapland war it was widely thought that when the germans left northern finland the soviets would invade this area called lapland for the semiasiatic people who live up there because it was still strategically important area even before the lapland war germanys foreign minister joachim von ribbentrop and reichsfuehrerss heinrich himmler had negotiated with some highranking finnish officers such as lieutenant colonel fabritius to start up an armed resistance movement against the soviets in finland should the ussr occupy the country the lapplanders white people with some asian blood speaking finnougrian language inhabit much of the sparsely populated north of scandinavia they herd reindeer keep to themselves and get along well with the norwegians swedes and finns to their south the rsha reichssicherheitshauptamt reich security head office agreed to recruit finns to organize sabotage and spy activities against soviet military forces in the rsha plan was even afoot to make finland the last nest of national socialist resistance and location that could also offer shelter to some national socialist leaders this information comes from suomen kuvalehti âfinnish pictureâ magazine like the old âlifeâ magazine which published an article about tãrni and his part in organizing resistance movement in finland week 372003 according to this magazine tãrni met with ribbentrop and the germans were willing to appoint captain tãrni as the head of the entire resistance movement in finland in february 1945 tãrni and 30 other finns started their training in newly formed special unit called âsonderkommando nordâ in heringsdorf on the baltic tãrni and the others got trained for counterintelligence sending morse messages and handling powerful explosives and weapons all soldiers got nco training although most of the volunteers were young men with previous war experience after the training the finns were sent to the legendary ss major otto skorzenys âjagdregiment 1â the regiment was famous for its operation that liberated benito mussolini untersturmfuehrer tãrni was now responsible for training the new recruits who were mainly finnish pows captured by germans in the lapland war finns who had changed sides because they were sick of having to obey orders to shoot on soviet demand at the germans their former brothersinarms for years the soviet invasion in the east forced the training center in heringsdorf to be moved to the danish border in flensburg skorzeny the greatest commando who ever lived tãrni felt frustration he wanted action he was discussing germanys military situation with the finnish resistance contact lieutenant colonel fabritius fabritius told tãrni the situation at the front was âchaoticâ fabritius was still negotiating with general kaltenbrunner about antisoviet activities and resistance in finland fabritius went back to finland together with his german gestapo contact fabritius was arrested later for being progerman and he died in finnish prison in 1946 tãrni volunteered for the front with his old ss comrade korpela they were sent to the âeastern frontâ which then sadly was east of berlin but tãrni was eager to get some last blows in against bolshevism berlin aprilâmay 1945 and the return to finland lauri tãrni and korpela reported for military service directly to ssobergruppenfuehrer felix steiner on the 15th of april steiner appointed tãrni hauptsturmfuehrer captain korpela was not appointed the defenders of berlin had terrible lack of weapons tãrni and korpela were only given pistols rifles and one submachine gun tãrni was in charge of an ss company of about 300 men tãrni and his company were fighting on the north side of berlin near schwerin on the 25th of april russian troops broke through in nauen and berlin and its outlying areas were now about to be encircled by huge soviet army tãrni and his company withdrew to small town called pritzwalk with the russians after them in pritzwalk tãrni had combat encounter with the russians but he led the company so well that it gave him and the company time to withdrew to hagenow the russians then encircled tãrni and his company in hagenow on 3rd of may tãrni heard of hitlers death the last picture of hitler berlin 30th of april 1945 the company decided on one last combat operation â to break through the russian lines the breakout was successful but then they ran into american paratroopers on the west of berlin who captured tãrni and his company lauri tãrnis war for berlin was now over his company had not suffered huge losses but it had killed many raping bolsheviks true brotherhood ss soldiers helping comrade during battle somewhere on the eastern front in august 1944 the americans handed tãrni and korpela over to the british army because great britain and finland were still in war they were sent to oldenburg with german prisoners of war tãrni did not plan to stay for long time in the hands of his enemies and after few nights observing the british and their guard practices tãrni made his move and with korpela escaped from the camp the red flag over berlin in april 1945 the picture had to be manipulated after it was taken the soldiers wrists and hands were full of stolen watches from dead german soldiers the soldier who raised the soviet flag was from kazakhstan and not an ethnic russian about 100000 women in berlin were raped most of them several times british historian anthony beevor described it as the biggest ârape warâ ever almost half the rapists were not russians but yellowskinned and slanteyed men from the caucasus mountains and beyond the soviet propaganda minister jew ilya ehrenburg 18911967 encouraged them to rape the âblond witchesâ and break the âracial pride of the germanic womanâ ilya ehrenburg ernest hemingway and german communist writer gustav regler in 1937 communist political commissar during the spanish civil war regler collaborated with the jew willi muenzenberg âcoin mountainâ in yiddish to produce the 1933 brown book of the reichstag fire and the hitler terror which falsely accused hitler of ordering the fire even antihitler historians now consider the book worthless piece of defamation again tãrni was in situation where he had to abandon city he cared about to murdering bolshevists twice his home city of vyborg and now the capital of the german reich berlin however tãrni was not sure what kind of welcome home he would get in finland with the help of various germans tãrni and korpela got to copenhagen and were able to get fake ids and find ship heading for the city of turku in finland from turku tãrni moved to helsinki and worked in electric company that was owned by former ss soldiers and members of the resistance however in the meanwhile the communist police valpo state police had gotten wind of tãrnis return and of waffenss soldiers planning resistance to soviet forces soon valpo was ready to take action against the âtraitorsâ lauri tãrnis story later that of âlarry thorne us army special forces will be continued some finns of the viking division about 1400 finns volunteered for the waffenss between the years 194143 and 194445 few soldiers who decided to stay in the waffenss after 1944 could ever go back home to finland after the war because they were henceforth to considered to be âtraitorsâ they had in fact disobeyed orders to not come home to the finnish army or be discharged after january 1945 there really was small albeit reluctant war between the germans and the finns up in lapland and of course postwar finland had to keep stalin happy by persecuting the former waffenss men or he might invade occupy the country and deport hundreds of thousands of innocent finns to siberia as he had done to civilians and soldiers in the neighboring baltic states besides the red terror stalin could also have brought in russians to settle in and colonize finland as was done with neighboring estonia whose capital tallinn is in fact full of russians they are 26 percent of the country many of these finns who volunteered for the waffenss had served with bravery in the finnish army during the winter war of 193940 and for them it was horrible to be classified by the postwar government as âtraitorâ to the country they had loved and fought for one of the famous finnish waffensssoldier was ulfola olin ssobersturmfuehrer ulfola olin finnish army officer 2nd lieutenant born in 1917 like many finnish men he served in the winter war of 193940 then volunteered for the waffenss in 1941 and decided to

government he decided to stay in germany and married german woman he finally visited finland again in 1968 but returned to germany and he stayed loyal and active in the postwar ss soldiers organization hiag he died in 1995 and was buried in kassel the german cross in gold ssuntersturmfuehrer unto parvilahti was true âpolitical soldierâ in the finnish ss battalion he was openly national socialist and ended his letters with the sacred words âheil hitlerâ parvilahti also created plans for greater finland which like greater germany would reunite all who spoke the mother tongue and he disagreed with finnish army hq on how things were performed parvilahti openly said the finns should cut off the murman railway from the vital soviet port of murmansk to leningradand attack leningrad from the north while the germans were doing so from the south which marshall mannerheim refused to do after the war the soviets captured parvilahti and he spent 10 years in the gulag in siberia with strong sisu finnish for toughness and bravery parvilahti survived the prisoner camps and came back to finland he was not however pleased with the political situation and moved to spain dying in malaga in 1970 where his neighbor was belgian waffenss general leon degrelle later the heroic austrian revisionist gerd honsik lived in malaga now bravely facing 20 years in prison for his poems and books

in the ss after 1943 after the war he was prisoner of the russians his fate is unknown ssobersturmbannfuehrer kalervo kurkiala the father of the finnish ss battalion kurkiala was an admired and appreciated man among the finnish volunteers and among the germans one of the finnish volunteers described his amazing spirit with the words âhis presence gave us the strength to stand the pressure of hard military service so far from homeâ he stayed in germany till the end and was captured by the soviets after his time in pow camp he moved to sweden and died in the 1970s welcome to the eternal brotherhood finnish waffenss volunteers in 1943 over time those soldiers have been forgotten and were despised by the government many of the ss soldiers had only each other after the war and the brotherhood and friendship that were born in the horrors of the front although few are still with us now they always stood in the front lines of the race war defending europe europeans and europeanamericans postwar governments betrayed them but they have stayed loyal to their oath in these moments i can only salute those brave men with the words kunniaa ja arvostusta waffensslle in
