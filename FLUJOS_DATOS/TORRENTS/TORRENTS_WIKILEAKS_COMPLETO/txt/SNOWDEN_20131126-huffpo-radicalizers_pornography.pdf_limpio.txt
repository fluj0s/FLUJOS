material online or using sexually explicit persuasive language when communicating with inexperienced young girls using portion f the donations they are recehing from the susceptible pool to defray their own personal expenses charging an exorbitant amount f money for their speaking fees and being singularly attracted by opportunities to increase their stature or being known to base their public messaging on questionable sources or using language that is contradictory in nature leaing them open to credibility challenges ts si rel to usa fv ey issues f trust and reputation are important when considering the validity and appeal f the message it stands to reason that exploiting milner abilities f character credibility or both f the radicalizer and his m essage could be enhanced by an

radicalizers m essage by contacting him using his publiclyknown contact information significant proportion f the audience associated with the specified englishlanguage radicalizers is located in pakistan yet none f these radicalizers appear to have any communicants in common in addition communications profiles f these englishlanguage radicalizers reveal that very few f the contacts noted w ere associated with terrorism suggesting that the target audience includes indhiduals who do not yet hold extremist views but who are susceptible to the extremist message w llk n w n k i l l i n g f 1
