despite higher taxes and cu ts in nondefense spending the large increase in defense related spending plus the absorption of significant proportion of the manpower pool by the armed forces began generating inflationary pressures as unemployment fell and unused plant capacity diminished the us g overnment attempted to lessen inflationary pressure by encouraging the general public to buy saving

rates on treasury securities at low levels to keep interest costs low the federal reserve c onducted an easy money policy hence the banks had plenty of reserv although this policy kept interest costs low it contributed to inflationary pr essures because the money supply expanded as war production expanded inflationary pr essures increased dramatically rising employment and extensive overtime

worth of government securities of this more than 54 billion was in the form of war savings bonds bonds alone accounted for 337 billion10 according to most economic historians the war loan drives were successful in encouraging the average workers to purchase war bonds and those with greater financial resources to purchase victory loans thes sales absorbed potential consumer spending that would have exacerbated inflation and expanded black market activity the purchase of war bonds represented much new net savings because sma ll savers had limited alternative saving instruments the war loan drives had strong patrio tic appeal involved 6 million volunteers and utilized extensive donated advertis ing each war loan drive was unique fusion of nationalism and consumerism seeking to stir the conscience of americans it invoked both th eir financial and moral stake in the war the sale of war bonds provided way in which patriotic attitudes and the spirit of sacrifice could be expressed11

bonds congress could decide that specific statutory endorsement of the decision to issue hurricane relief bonds or some other name would add to these bonds attractiveness as savings alternative some funds us ed to purchase these hurricane relief war bonds would likely represent the substitution of these bonds for some other form of savings the us treasury estimates that the us saving bond program is cost effective that is the savings in interest costs exceed the extra administrative costs14 these savings however have an insignificant effect on the total budget the opportunity to buy hurricane relief bonds would give the public direct sense of participation in relief and recovery from the effects of hurricanes katrina and ritahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22305crs6 15 for an estimate these

l market conditions today differ so much from those of the second world war that the war bond model is problematic for hurricane relief debt issue the present economy is vastly different fro m that of the second world war war bonds were then marketed to reduce consumer spending the current economy however has low rate of inflation and low rate of unemployment controls exist on prices wages production interest rate s on marketable treasury secur ities or installment loans goods and services are rationed instead of attempting to redu ce consumer spending many federal officials are concerned about maintaining c onsumer spending moreover the us financial system is mo re complex sophisticated diverse and deregulated than in the world war ii era sma ll savers have an arra of savings vehicles for example they can invest in money market funds and certificates of deposit cds of financial institutions today savings bonds are almost always substitute mechanism for other forms of personal savings
