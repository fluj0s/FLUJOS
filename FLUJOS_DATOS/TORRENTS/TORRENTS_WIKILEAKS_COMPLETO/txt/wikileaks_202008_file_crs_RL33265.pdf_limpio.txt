the united states and foreign governments there appear to have been prosecutions under the act in its more than 200 year history however there have been number of judicial references to the act and it is not uncommon for it to be used as point of challenge concerning dealings with foreign officials although attempts have been made to repeal the act it remains law and at least potential sanction to

states and the various revolutionary governments of france 3 because the united states had not assisted the french revolutionaries to their satisfaction and because the united states had ratified the jay treaty with great britain the french government authorized plunderings of american merchant ships in 1797 president adams sent john marshall charles c pinckney and elbridge gerry as special envoys to france to negotiate and settle claims and causes of differences which existed between the french directory and the united states this mission resulted in the xyz letters controversy and its failure led to such strong antifrance feelings in the united states that preparations for war were begun by the congress after the unsuccessful envoys returned from france dr george logan philadelphia quaker

however received less friendly response from the united states after he returned secretary of state pickering told him that the french decree was illusory general washington expressed his disapproval of logans actions president adams recommended that congress take action to stop the temerity and impertinence of individuals affecting to interfere in public affairs between france and the united states 4 representative roger griswold of connecticut introduced resolution in congress to prevent actions similar to logans resolved that committee be appointed to inquire into the expediency of amending the act entitled an act in addition to the act for the punishment of certain crimes against the united states so far as to extend the penalties if need be to all persons citizens of the united states who shall usurp the executive authority of this government by commencing or carrying on any correspondence with the governments of any foreign prince or state relating to controversies or disputes which do or sha ll exist between such prince or state and the united states 5 the resolution was passed and the committee was appointed on january 7 1799 griswold introduced in the house bill based on the resolution be it enacted etc that if any person being citizen of the united states or in any foreign country shall without the permission or authority of the government of the united

went further than procuring the indictment of flournoy and the purchase of the louisiana territory later that year appeared to cause the separatism issue to become obsolete so far as can be determined there have been prosecutions under the logan act however there have been number of judicial references to the act among which are the following judge sprague of the circuit court for the district of massachusetts mentioned the logan act in two charges that he made to grand juries during the civil war on october 18 1861 he said there are other defenses to which our attention is called by the present condition of our country few months since member of the british parliament declared in the most public manner that he had received many letters fr om the northern states of america urging parliament to acknowledge the independence of the southern confederacy such an announcement ought to arrest the attention of grand juries for if any such communication has been made by citizen of the united states it is high misdemeanor st 1799 c 1 1 stat 613 was especially designed to prevent such unwarrantable interference with the diplomacy and purposes of our government 8 in the second grand jury charge referring to the logan act made in 1863 judge sprague stated we have seen it stated in such form as to arrest attention that unauthorized individuals have entered into communication with members of parliament and foreign ministers and officers in order to influence their conduct in controversies with the united states or to defeat the measures of our government it ought to be known that such acts have been long prohibited by law 9 american banana co v united fruit co10 referred to the logan act as follows doubt in regions subject to sovereign like the high seas or to law that civilized countries would recognize as adequate such countries may treat some relations between their citizens as governed by their own law and keep to some extent the old notion of personal sovereignty alive citations omitted they go further at times and declare that they will punish anyone subject or not who shall do certa in things if they can catch him as in the case of pirates on the high seas in cases immediately affecting national interests they may go further still and may make and if they get the chance execute similar threats as to acts done within another recognized jurisdiction an illustration from our statutes is found with regard to criminal correspondence with foreign governments rev stat 5335 11 burke v monumental division 5212 was case charging union member

said that he has committed moral perjury this is strong language but there is reason to question that it is really meant and that those responsible for its use believe it to be fully justified the truth doubtless is that to them the brotherhood and the roads appear to be almost distinct sovereignties at time when it is at grip with the companies for member to let one of the latter sue in his name for the purpose of preventing the use by it of one of its most efficient means of warfare does to them seem treasonable within the limits of their power they are determined to punish any such proceeding they feel about it as did congress when in 1799 it enacted the socalled logan actmaking it crime for any citizen to have intercourse with foreign government with intent to defeat the measures of his own 13 united states v bryan14refers to 18 usc 5 which is the predecessor of 18 usc 953 that the subject of unamerican and subversive activities is within the investigating power of the congress is obvious conceivably information in this field may aid the congress in legislating concerning any one of many matters such as correspondence with foreign governments 15 united states v peace information center16held that congress had the power to enact the foreign agents registration act of 1938 under its inherent power to regulate external affairs as well as under its constitutional power to legislate concerning national defense and that the act is not subject to any constitutional infirmity the court mentioned similarities between the logan act and the foreign agents registration act and the language used appears to indicate that the logan act like the foreign agents registration act is constitutional citizens of the united states are forbidden to carry on correspondence or intercourse with any foreign government with an intent to influence its measures or conduct in relation to any disputes or controversies with the united states the act under scrutiny in this case represents the converse of the last mentioned statute the former deals with citizens of the united states who attempt to conduct correspondence with foreign governments the latter affects agents of foreign principals who carry on certain specified activities in the united states both matters are equally within the field of external affairs of this country and therefore within the inherent regulatory power of the congress 17 in martin v young 18 which concerned petition for habeas corpus by serviceman awaiting trial by general court martial the principal issue was whether the petitioner could be tried in civil court for the offense charged against him by the army part of the specification stated that petitioner while interned in north korean prisoner of war camp did without proper authority wrongfully unlawfully and knowingly collaborate communicate and hold intercourse directly and indirectly with the enemy by joining with participating in and leading discussion groups and classes conducted by the enemy reflecting views and opinions 13 id at 952 14 72 f supp 58 ddc 1947 15 id at 62 16 97 f supp 255 ddc 1951 17 id at 261 18 134 f supp 204 nd cal 1955

aggressors in the korean conflict19 the court stated that the conduct described in the specification violated at least three criminal statutes under which the petitioner could be tried in civil court one of which was the logan act and granted the petition however the department of justice did not prosecute martin under the logan act pennsylvania v nelson 20 held that the smith act21 which prohibits the knowing advocacy of the overthrow of the united states government by force and violence supersedes the enforceability of the pennsylvania sedition act which proscribes the same conduct the reason given for the preemption is that the federal statutes touch fi eld in which the federal interest is so dominant that the federal system must be assured to preclude enforcement of state laws on the same subject the court mentioned that states are barred by the constitution from entering into treaties and by 18 usc 953 from correspondence or intercour with foreign govern ments with relation to their disputes or controversies with this nation 22 briehl v dulles23upheld certain department of state regulations which provided that passport shall be issued to members of the communist party the court referred to other valid federal statutes which restrict persons in the area of foreign relations we have statutes dealing with persons who act as agents of foreign government or those who have correspondence with foreign government with intent to influence its measures in relation to disputes or controversies with our government or to defeat the measures of the united states24 in waldron v british petroleum co25the plaintiff sued for triple damages under the clayton act for alleged conspiracy of the defendants to prevent the importation and sale by the plaintiff of iranian oil the defendants asserted that the plaintiff had obtained his contract through series of violations of criminal statutes including the logan act the court held that in order to maintain this defense the defendants would have to show that the plaintiff sought to thwart some clearly and unequivocally asserted policy measures of the united states instead of merely statements of opinion attitude and belief of government offici als the defendants were unable to show this further the court noted that another infirmity in defendants claim that plaintiff violated the logan act is the existence of doubtful question with regard to the constitutionality of that statute logan act under the sixth amendment that doubt is engendered by the statutes use of the vague and indefinite terms defeat and measures citation omitted neither of these words is an abstraction of common certainty or possesses definite statutory or judicial definition 19 id at 207 20 350 us 497 1955 21 18 usc 2385 22 id at

it is not necessary to decide the constitutional question furthermore any ambiguity should be resolved in favor of lenity citation omitted 26 the court also indicates that although congress should perhaps eliminate the vagueness of the logan act the act remains valid despite the lack of prosecutions under it the court finds merit in plaintiffs argument that the logan act has been abrogated by desuetude from the absence of reported cases one may deduce that the statute has not been called into play because factual situation requiring its invocation has been presented to the courts cf

congressional attention to the possible need for amendment of title 18 usc 953 to eliminate this problem by using more precise words than defeat and measures and at the same time using language

196435 applied extraterritorially to regulate employment practices of united states employers who employed united states citizens abroad the court in its holding that there was not sufficient evidence to indicate that the act was intended to apply abroad stated congress awareness of the need to make clear statement that statute applies overseas is amply demonstrated by the numerous occasions on which it has expressly legislated the extraterritorial applica tion of statute see egthe logan act 18 usc 953 applying act to any citizenwherever he may be36 united states v deleon37 concerned whether 8 usc section 1326 which makes it crime for an alien who has been previously deported to enter attempt to enter or be found in the united states unless certain conditions are met applies to conduct occurring outside the united states in holding that the statute does apply to conduct occurring outside the united states the court stated more important assuming that the convention convention on the territorial sea and the contiguous zone also provides or ratifies power to regulate certain conduct within the contiguous zone that has substantial adverse effect within the united states that power was assumed to exist well before the convention eg logan act 38 in series of reviews of general courtmartial styled united states v murphy39 the appellant who was charged with committing crimes abroad

from 1975 to the present has found two opinions in the d igest of united states practice in interna tional law continued beginning in 1980 with column in the merican journal of international law in these instances the department did not consider the activities in question to be inconsistent with the logan act one opinion concerned the questioning of certain activities of senators john sparkman and george mcgovern with respect to the government of cuba the department stated the clear intent of this provision logan act is to prohibit unauthorized persons from intervening in disputes between the united states and foreign governments nothing in section 953 however would appear to restrict members of the congress from engaging in discussions with foreign officials in pursuance of their legislative duties under the constitution in the case of senators mcgovern and sparkman the executive branch although it did not in any way encourage the senators to go to cuba was fully informed of the nature and purpose of their visit and had validated their passports for travel to that country senator mcgoverns report of his discussions with cuban officials states i made it clear that i had authority to negotiate on behalf of the united statesthat i had come to listen and learn cuban realities may 1975 94 th cong 1st sess august 1975 senator sparkmans contacts with cuban officials were conducted on similar basis the specific issues raised by the senators eg the southern airways case luis tiants desire to have his parents visit the united states would in an event appear to fall within the second paragraph of section 953 accordingly the department does not consider the activities of senators sparkman and mcgovern to be inconsistent with the stipulations of section 953 41 1976

peoples republic of china to land in california in connection with the visit aside from activities related to the chinese special flights including provision of an escort crew to insure safety of operations in us airspace the us gove rnments role in the visit was limited to the provision by the secret service of personal protective services as required by law to the former president it is the responsibility of the department of justice to make determinations of whether criminal statutes of this sort have been transgressed and whether individuals should be prosecuted under them however the department of state is unaware of any basis for believing that mr nixon acted with the intent prohibited by the logan act in this connection it should be noted that one has ever been prosecuted under the logan act 42 in number of instances people have been alleged often by political opponents to have violated the logan act for example critics have suggested that ross perots efforts to find missing american servicemen in southeast asia have violated the logan act critics alleged that former house speaker jim wright violated the logan act in his relations with the sandinista government in 1984 while campaigning for the democratic nomination for president reverend jesse jackson went to syria to help in the release of captured american military flyer and to cuba and nicaragua the trips by reverend jackson occasioned comments from number of people most notably from president reagan that reverend jackson had violated the logan act other private citizens such as jane fonda have made trips which have been criticized as violative of the logan act but there have apparently been official sanctions taken in any of these instances g5g152g151g140g149g158g156g146g152g151g561 although it appears that there has never been prosecution under the logan act there have been several judicial references to it indicating that the act has not been forgotten and that it is at least potential point of challenge that has been used against anyone who without authority allegedly interferes in the foreign relations of the united states there have been efforts to repeal the act one of the most significant occurring in the late 1970s for example senator edward kennedy proposed in the 95 th congress to delete the logan act from the bill to amend the united states criminal code43 senator james allen insisted on reenacting the act in exchange for promising not to prolong debate over the bill and senator kennedy agreed to this however since the house was unable to consider the criminal reform bill in the 95 th congress the possibility of deleting the act in conference committee was eliminated it is possible nevertheless that the issue of whether the logan act should remain will be considered by another congress 42 digest of united states practice in international law 1976 pp 7576 43 s 1437 95th cong 2d sess 1978
