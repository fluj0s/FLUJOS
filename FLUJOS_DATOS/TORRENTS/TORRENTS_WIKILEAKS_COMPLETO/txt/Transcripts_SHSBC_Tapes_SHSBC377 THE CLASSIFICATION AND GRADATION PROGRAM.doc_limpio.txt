the classification and gradation program lecture given on 14 april 1964 thank you weve had preclears blow but i think i just saw member of the audience blow i just gag just gag im over your heads today how are you today audience fine whats the date audience 14 april fourteen april 1964 ad 14 and want to talk to you about something that is very extremely important to auditors and preclears and so forth along about november the 26th released policy letter that had to do with classification and it called for the classification of preclears and so forth but at the same time this policy letter was not put into effect it was merely proposed and it was expected that auditors around the world would answer up and give their opinions with regard to this classification program they did so and it took long time for everybody to get his answer in and lot of chitchat back and forth on straightening up these various answers and finally we arrived at new programcould longer be called the classification program for the excellent reason that classification is confined to auditors so it becomes classification and gradation program and perhaps shorter better name for it might be the levels program now the levels of scientology became necessary when it was realized that one was taking any pains to bring up the general public right and they were picking them up and throwing them into the middle of lions pit and saying well thats it and all right now whats your service facsimile oh you dont know what that is im sorry well i guess its failed case next oh it wasnt quite as bad as this but pretty near pretty near now oddly enough that wasnt what was giving the auditors trouble i foresaw that that would give the pc trouble but i didnt really foresee what was giving the auditor trouble and what was giving the auditor trouble was what i had justwell i had proposed something that would relieve this troublewhat was giving the auditor trouble is the pc didnt know from nothing and that was what was giving the auditor trouble now i recognized that it would have some bearing on cases and i recognized lot of other things but i didnt realize the extent to which auditors were losing pcs not by throwing them in over their heads but not throwing them in at all and here pcs would sit yakking at each other in coaudits and talking to an auditor and the pc would get over his slight case of lumbosis and hed say well ive been processed well i guess feel better now and wander on off and oddly enough accidentally put my fingers on why auditors were losing preclears and it wasntit wasnt because the pcthis allwas all disclosed in correspondence and reviews of the situation and so onand it wasnt because the pc was being thrown in over his head but because the pc wotnotted what he was being thrown into he hadnt clue now well lets take up why he hadnt clue well theres been the aesculapians and the best thing they did was slip somebody some hellebore or something like that and the fellow had dream see and god came to him in the dream and the god said to him well youre all going to be copacetic now huh pal and then the fellow got well or he didnt get well and mostly he didnt and that was mental treatment and then theresthen theres thethe psychoneurotic analyst and he let the fellow sit there for five years and talk his havingness out you see and then theres this other bunch of guys who have whats called the destruction method of putting guy in an electric shock machine while packing him with ersatz or something and thatthat blew his brains out and then in the western world theres not even tradition of philosophy theres tradition ofthere istheyyou saywhatwhat equivalent western word is there for guru there isnt and yet an indian wouldnt know how to go through his day without knowing this word guru somehow or another you get the idea see we did survey ill give you an idea of the state the public is inwe did survey in washington dc about 1955 which was very intriguing survey because i wanted to knowi thought these birds would realize that the psychiatrists werelets put it in more elegant senselets put it in more elegant sense than it deserves that the psychiatrists were cutting into their racket so we got ahold of all the ministers in washington dc on the idea that they might have some sensibility with regard to all this and asked them if they thought this was the case any time one of their congregation showed the least signs of becoming nervous they instantly rushed him to the electric shock machine seventeen hundred and eight ministers out of seventeen hundred and ten were wildly in favor of the mental hospital and the electric shock machine as soon as possible why the poor dopes they didnt realize that that religious ecstasy was the only thing which kept them whizzing if anybody had suddenly stood up in their congregation and said i embrace the lord or something like that they would have said drdr sparks would you please send wagon over right away quick see in other words the whole field of religion had been eaten up in this particular direction which i thought was rather amazing and everywhere we looked then this member of the publicactually since time immemorialhas had failed help everywhere he looked he saw nothing but failed help so he has tradition of any kind whatsoever of what is treatment what is healing what is ability what is getting better what are any of these things at all and you put yourself up in the field of the human mind and what does he compare you with see neurotic analysm see electric shock machines stick the guy full of needles you know and give him the old biochemical whizbang im using very technical terms as they undoubtedly use them in their private conferences well whatll we feed the suckers this year you know i mean its not quite that crude perhaps they say what will we feedwhat iswhat is latin for sucker now your public has tradition the western world has tradition of selfbetterment and it isnt that theyre suspicious of scientology they wouldnt even know what it was our biggest task has been to define scientology to them and every one of usevery one of us has at one time or another racked his brains into total stupefaction trying to figure out how to communicate this thing to these people why well youre not communicating against any worn or traveled road youre going right straight through the thorn bushes see there is gradient there of any kind whatsoever were putting in the gradient there we are and so there is to begin with common communication ground already established since you cannot of course compare scientology with all of these other things that the public thinks has something to do with mental treatment its mental destruction the whole lot of it andand it doesnt compare so that they cant get their wits wrapped around it thats why theywell you taketake outfits like thelike the ama the bma and that sort of thing their attacks are so crazy because they dont even know what theyre attacking you see theyre in total ignorance of what to attack so therefore their attacks are very stupid indeed theyre actually not very hard to whip because theyre too stupid if you had squad of soldiers out here that were fighting giant who didnt exist and you were sitting on the parapet thereyou were sitting on the parapet you see as an entirely different type of being and they kept on fighting this nonexistent giant why after while all youd have to do is reach out stave put it between their legs and let them fall on their faces they dont even see you they dont even know what theyre attacking they havent any idea whatsoever because they are lost too in this communicationless area theres area of communication so were having to create not only science but communication road in the society were having to chop out the first path and the pc sits there in the midst of all of this confusion getting processed well whats processing to him and there is the biggest auditor failure ive seen somebody after quote two years in scientology still giving all the proper answers for psychoanalysis i think some of you have seen them toogiving all the proper answers for psychoanalysis see try to run repetitive process on this guy you see you say well now re call person you really felt some affinity for just one off the bat here you see well my ids been ticking today yes what can you recall person you felt some affinity well its my id see and iiii recognized in myself yesterday some symptoms of fetishism you say yes but have you felt now after while the guy says uhhuh or something like this while still worrying about his fetishism that he has discovered in himself you see hes still being psychoanalyzed because thats the only comparative understanding he has to scientology he hashe has never crossed the communication bridge to scientology its actually bridge before the bridge whats expected of this fellow well there is one of the largest data that fell out of the hamper in this survey and working this over is that auditors were losing large percentage of the people they were trying to process because they had never undertaken any real communication relationship on the subject of scientology with this pc in other words the pc was completely untrained and if you think this percentage is slight its not its apparently 80 percent there goes your forward progress its just going up in smoke out of ten people you reach two even though thoseeight of those people might have entered into auditing of some kind or another they vanish because they never entered into auditing they entered into psychoanalysis or they entered into something else or they entered into something else and they had idea what they were going into and nobody ever told them what they were in so they just kept redefining it and they finally decided they didnt like christian science so they stopped being audited well of course thats an irrational statement but this is the irrational frame of mind those pcs are in well this is one of the first things that fell out of the hamper next thing that fell out of the hamper just getting on with this was the auditor in the field being upset about his pc having to take formal course and auditors all over the place were taking down flintlock pistols and loading them up ready to blow their brains out over this particular aspect of the thing so that was going too far in the other direction so what was reached here was workable compromise there is route known as the pc known as the preclear but its route by which the pc is educated he does not have to be formally trained he doesnt need any certificates but before he can get out of his grade he has to pass certain training requirements taught to him by his auditor and which will all be furnished along with this as the exact texts that have to do with this which hes supposed to be checked out on before hes permitted to launch himself into the next series of processes in other words compromise was reached here so the field auditor can go on processing his individual preclear and all he need do as far as thisthis pc doesnt have to do any auditingbut as farall he needs to do is make sure that the pc passes his training requirements and these are little booklets which are carried along for each level and they are very simply written and the pc studies them and the auditor has question sheet which he checks the pc out on actually in the logbook which ill speak about in moment there is little checksheet at the beginning of each level and this checksheet has to be completely passed by the pc you see before hes interrupted by this and that what kind of thing going into this checksheet you see well rather minor things like dont have withholds from your auditor or you will get upset with him dont you see what is withhold withhold is now of course these things are filled with definitions of scientology metaphors allegories methods of communication to the individual as to whats going on and what he is trying to do and so forth and it brings the pc up to point of where he suddenly starts to recognize there is something here and that does align with his goals but these goals are so failed as far as hes concerned that he would never even attempt to reach for them unless somebody revived them for him thats actually whats happening hes long sincehas stopped trying to get out of the slough of despond hes quit he quit long time ago see hed like to get over his sporadic earache see thats as close as he can get to freedom is freedom from thats as close as he can get well you can bring him up through these various grades and you will achieve of course much faster auditing results as reason for this he can be taught in other words what is happening whats going on without in the least bit evaluating for him or trying to fix him up so hellcase will run in an educated fashion were not interested in his case running in an educated fashion but we are very interested in having preclear who is being audited by scientology who doesnt think he is in psychoanalytic laboratory or monkey cage or something else dont you see this is the establishment of reality where is he going what is happening what is going on there are some points of life and so forth now the philosophy of life is also put into this zone or area like your arc triangle and little bits and pieces of this particular character things hes never thought about you see now of course this goes up to level vi this goes up to clay table work this only becomes possible because of the late discoveries i have made at level vi it would not have been possible to have done this at all pc never would have gotten through if it had been necessary to actually get together his goals pattern you wont have to do that on the pc so it made possible for classification and gradation which is one of the points of slowdown by the way i had to be absolutely sure this was the case before we could adventure out on this so at level vi this preclear actually would have to be trained on clay table in nomenclature and so forth by his auditor and rather arduously as to what was gpm and what was this and that and really be able to snap and point and pop and so forth and heif he werent trained on clay table as to exactly where was he going and so on the auditor couldnt really ask him any questions about anything but if he is trained on clay table the communication is inevitable he sees the gpm down deep in his mind of course its not down deep in his mindwell way out there hes got these things you seeand hell instinctively recognize the similarities between the things and hell be able to put it together and so forth and so hell be able to follow auditing commands and youll be able to take him on up the line also you arent taking on up the line some ignorant being thats going to fall on his head because hes being taken up the line because by the time he gets to level vi we will have gotten to him on the basis of this is scientology this is what were trying to do and this is where were going to go you get the idea and even if military organization was demanding that you train some ots so they could spy on russiaim sure this will come about i can see it nowi can see one of you now being approached by colonel swivelbottom with awith offend why dont you process some intelligence agents for us dont you see and so forth well you possibly even could process these intelligence agents providing you process them all the way from scratch and they had to pass all their pcs requirements and he wouldnt have any intelligence agents by the time they got to ot thisselfpreventive mechanisms now lets get down to nomenclature here then what is grade grade is something that pc has this of course fits in with his childhood schooling it fits in with the colloquialism make the grade it fits in with lot of things that will communicate all of which have been rather carefully thought out so make the grade and there of course isthere is such thing and actually really as grade 0 there is level 0 but there is grade 0 because who would grade somebody for being man in the street so actually the earliest grade is really grade i and this is assigned to somebody after he has passed the level 0 levels and hes been checked out and so forth you have grade i pc and then of course these grades compare exactly with the various levels of scientology and as hes passed up through these grades he has checksheet for each grade and his instruction material and his auditor has to put him over the jumps on these things you see andhorrible thought just occurred to only i can see this happening some auditor is too busy you see so his pc just has harder time passing through the checksheet than some other pc that hes gotwants to process now you could almost adjust your schedulea horrible thought occurred to i wouldnt advise doing that but be very honest in trying to get the pc through well the pc is not well disciplined to begin with at all and i have found it very difficult to audit an offthestreet pc or even get him to answer sensible question because you say one thing and his language difficulties and barriers relay this toas something else and hes not quite sure which end of the stick hes on or whats happening to him and so forth well by the time you get him up to level ii this is pretty jolly well straightened out by the time hes grade ii pc hes long since been release see that would probablyyour level of release anyway he goes on up through these various grades and each grade has an attainment of certain pc abilities and what we do is work it as an ability scale he isnt having trouble in certain departments of his life that he was having trouble in before in other words we make his conquest of the environment the index of his grade thats quite sensible thatsbecause that gives him finite points of advance he used to get into shaking fit every time he thought about all of the problems he has and now he doesnt get into it he can confront his own problems in life thatsthat would be sampling of what grade accomplishment would be see he can confront his own problems in life well thats very simple gain but yet it is explicit and the individual says well what do you know yes i can and hes now made this grade to that degree now youve got another one thereyouve got another one there he is relatively free or at least not worrying about his aches and pains its another level you see theres difference between hurting and worrying about hurting you get some people who are going around in circles afraid they will hurt afraid they will get an ache or pain you perhaps have even run into somebody although its probably been long time since youve associated with such person who has funny buzzing feeling over his left ear or something and this tells him hes going to be sick in certain way in three days and that he had better promptly go take hot pack for his skull and go to bed with certain brand of hot toddy or something itshes got it all worked out his cure for this buzzing thing over his ear is practically dramatization and youve got him now to point wherenot where nothing buzzes over his ear youve got him to point where he doesnt worry about something buzzing over his ear see this type of thing not unduly concerned about personal physical upsets you see hes just not unduly concerned about these things that would be another type of level dont you see another one is not always dwelling on things that have happened to him in the past now youre getting up around iii you seenot always dwelling on things that have happened to him in the past hes not worrying all the time about the fact he didnt get chance to go to college or something or he isnt spending 90 percent of his time grinding his teeth about his elder brother who did him in you know he isnthe doesnt have all these horrible feelings about the past and so forth which you can say relative freedom from the past its just relativehe just doesnt spend 90 percent of his time worrying about it thats the gain you see youd be surprised how many people are walking around doing just that you see another level is hes stopped trying to make everybody wrong and himself right all the time see of course thats recognizable as iv grade vwell just make that catchall because we actually have got the processes for grade v but we have skidded by them it isnt necessary really to run them in order to attain grade vi which is implants and whole track engrams and so forth these things are all put together the technologys all there theres particular reason to go through that so what you probably do is put the guy through an auditing dustoff at about that period so that he can reallyhe can really preclear see we fix him up so he can really preclear you get it on your auditing checksheet at class vi now he really can preclear at about this point he perfectlyhe feels perfectly free to be asked any question or to say anything about himself or his past you see he feelshes got complete freedom in this department he can receive an acknowledgment and so forth hes also got enough sense to realize the auditor is addressing his bank not him in assessment you know those little points that youve got in other words hes pretty accomplished pc now at this point it would be possible then having come up through all these other levels tofor the individual to tackle headon gpms now if youd taken this fellow right at the beginning and if youd taken him and hes come in off the street and hes thinking all the time iii wonder why shes mad at all the time ii just wonder why shes mad at all this is all that goes through his head for one whole morning you see i wonder why shes mad at all the time i wonder why shes mad at i havent really done anything ive never done anything to her i wonder why shes mad at all the time this is whats called stream of consciousness see this is life to this individual see and we say to this personwe say to this person now were going to count the number of gpms in the series and find out where the series is truncated you see and what are you going to get back youre going to get back i wonder why shes mad at all the time wonder why shes mad at all the time see in other words you have to have certain amount of control and confront of the mind so if you considered thisthese grades gradient scale of confront of the environment composed also of the individuals own mind you recognize that this confrontingness can be improved by training and by processing its basically improved by processing but it nevertheless can also be improved by training he has to get some realization of what hes looking at and therefore he moves up on both of those tracks well that is the route of the pc and any auditor can process pc up to the class that auditor has so it doesnt matter where hes gone if hes gone to class vi why he could take the pc all the way through if the auditors only class i thats as far as he can take the pc thats sensible too now your routes are three in number and the pc is merely the first one of these i frankly dont think the route of the pci dont think that pcs going to get there nearly as fast as the other two routes buthes going to have more trouble and hes going to have more upsets and hes going to have more things he doesnt understand but hell get there hell get there as long as his auditor is patient and everything holds out along the line you see so it is feasible route expressed in these lines your second route is the route of the coauditor now this is something brandnew to you auditors and simply falls into your nomenclature as you and bill coauditing but more recently falls into your nomenclature of getting bunch of people together and have them audit each other well this is something brandnew itmake it noun an individual who isnt classified but has certificate is coauditor he may not charge for his processing he cannot in any way call himself professional he is simply coauditor what is he expected to do why hed probably run some processes on his friends probably run some assists of one kind or another or even some highlevel processes on one another im not making nothing out of this probably audit few of his business associates or something like this or use itand hes even got certificate and hes been through the training courses and so forth but at time has he ever been classified and he cant be classified without being classified all the way that would only be fair to auditors now what is this fellow coauditor now we saw him originallyactually were going over our own evolutionary background we saw the fellow who went to school for 30 days or 60 days or something like that and he got himself certificate and he didnt know from nothing yet he knew more than the man out on the street yet he was actually somebody and he was better thanwasnt he and just because hes attended something for few weeks certificate was put in his hot hand and that was the end of that we saw this fellow it happens inevitably even though you had careful examiners and so forth you would still have few of these people around the coauditor is somebody who has certificate but classification now every once in whilethis plays into your hands very well to this degree you are in lower south amboy have gotten yourself together about twenty people and youve got coaudit running there and because theyre all running as pcs and very lowlevel coaudit you see dont need any certificates or anything youve gotten them trained you havent made that mistake youve educated them up to knowing what they are doing and so forth and then you get very enthused and you put them through an hqs course well great that gives them certificate doesnt it well the number of these people that are goingthats perfectly legitimate up to these pointbut the number of people who are going to go for classification examination over to melbourne or angeles or something like that are very few indeed so that in essence has stopped your coaudit hasnt it they can never be processed beyond this point well supposing you had these twenty people and they were going along with vast enthusiasm and so forth and supposing your classification had gotten up to class iv you pushed your classification up to iv now the point comes about can you teach these people course for certificate well now there would be several ways you actually could do this one is to get them to go to angelesthese are all possible routesor get some instructor to come over from angeles and teach them course making them sweat it out for certain period of time and reach certain requirements dont you see or get special dispensation based on your own record to teach them course yourself do you see you wouldnt be able to charge them money for this or cut corners in some other direction youdit would have to be all very official and formal but nevertheless this is rigged so that you get minimal stoppage of progress with minimal upset because of technical flubs now thats the way the thing is adjudicated are we going to have lot of people in lower south amboy who all have hca certificates who can audit nobody and do nothing dont you see and therefore this course thats going to be taught in lower south amboy under these clathesethese determinations just wont get taught you see because this might be very damaging it might be very upsetting until some arrangement can be made where somebody has guaranteed the fact thatthat theirtheir training was good enough to get them across at that level thats whats being guaranteed here and thats really the sole criterion in this well now these people could go all the way on up sooner or later theyre going to have to connect with or collide with some kind of training course someplace you see but they can go on and they can get their certificates and so forth but iftheyre conspicuously blank in their lower lefthand corner theres nothing in that lower lefthand corner this certificate is certificate and all is fine but it is awful blank in that lower lefthand corner whereas professional auditor certificate is very conspicuously classed in the lower lefthand corner got great big class seal right there bang you see and it says this is professional auditor and that is different well weve lived side by side with thisthese types of auditors and these types of certificates all these years and if all of my thirst for order has been unable to wipe out this particular line i dont expect its going to get wiped out in the future so you just might as well make up your mind that it exists and what you should do to resolve this situation is just make sure that competent auditor is harshly examined harshly trained and is very recognizable see what i mean by that you see so hes pro now this takes the certificate at hcahpa that has always hung therefor some reason or other in the commonwealth and in the united states theres different certificatesand puts them as both certificates in both countries the one certificate the coauditor does not have is hpa hubbard professional auditor he does not have this certificate he only has hubbard certified auditor thats the only certificate he can get at that level which he is of course at once separated out in the sheep from the goats at that level now somebody then who goes through an academy and works straight on through andor returns to the academy for his classification examinationsstudy and examinations as he goes straight on through to his classification examinations from hcohe is given hubbard professional auditor certificate and that separates the sheep from the goats but they dont separate on up the line from that particular point except by designation and classed auditor then is your third route and your classed auditor is of course professional auditor and he has been trained formally and he has been examined thoroughly and he has been given his classification and he is permitted to charge for processing and he is responsible for pcs in his area and he is the one who occupies staff positions and hes the one who operates field offices and hes the one that does the business around the world and thats the way it is working out and so weve paralleled to that degree but now lets take look at the coauditor as route this means that somebody can start coauditing with bessie ann or jane or somebody of the sort and can then one way or another at some degree of competence the best that can be assured move on up on coaudit basis with another person or move on up on coaudit basis with group that is being conducted by professional auditor numbers of plans are possible there but this coauditor is essentially paying for his auditing by giving auditing he receives auditing and he pays for it by auditing and he has preclear logbook just like preclearand so does professional auditor as far as thats concerned but its strictly preclearauditor swapabout turnabout and thats about all except for the assists he gives his boss and his motherinlaw you know this type of usage and hes route then up through the line on this understandingthat he is going all the way up through on coaudit basis of course in any persons life on this planet there can be many vicissitudes there will be period there when he belongs to somebody or others coaudit and then another period when he and joe have pulled off to the side someplace and theyre doing swapabout and then that kind of blew up dont you see and then he decided hes going to have some training on little more formal basis and joes processing now looks pretty corny so he now teams up with fellow named buster and you know itsitsyou know its the way it goes but he nevertheless has some guarantee that hes arriving see hes going over certain lines and hes got some guarantee that hes arriving and then sooner or later hes going to be able to get up within reach either of professional class vi auditor you see that can do something with him and some others on an authorized basis or hes actually going to connect with central organization class vi course for brief period of time and get his lines straight and so forth and go on up all the way thats thethats his route and he can go all the way on that particular route on coaudit basis this by the way is far less expensive than the preclear route and it doesnt shut the door in anybodys face if he wants to keep on going and studying and making the best of it and so on then of course theres the professional auditor route and we understand that route almost too well to say very much about but let add thislet add this to that route the professional auditor starts in and he gets his training one way or the other and he hangs on through this or that and he finally gets classification and so on well the moment that this individual has actually got classification seal what happens to him this meansthis means that he has some kind of selectivity with regard to his coauditing doesnt it so whos going to audit him because hes got classification seal he of course is more in demand and because hes got classification seal he probably audits with somebody with classification seal in other words professional auditor permitting himself to be audited by somebody who didnt know very much about what he was doing doesnt happen too often because he recognizes it too clearly it isnt really that scientologists are harder to process they are less propitiative and more outspoken in other words their recognition of whats going on is so reaching i wish i had had tape many years ago of couple of real oldtime professional auditors coming in over an intercom listening system on their arguments with each other concerning exactly what the bulletin had said and theyd sit there and chew each other out on this basis and they were fumbling through new series of techniques you know and brother if you ever heard pair of people that were lowering the boom on each other on the subject of exact adherence to the exact comma of exactly how it was supposed to be done that pair certainly were and neither one of them were going to go to pieces because it wasnt done right well you get some professional auditor that would be different type of auditing team entirely than somebody who was little bit hazy about it or thought somebody knew best and certainly different type of auditing team than some preclear being audited very different indeed pc sits there and well what the auditor does or says goes dont you see right or wrong he doesnt know anything about whats going on dont you see and therefore the professional auditor is likely to get far more precise processing and errors which occur in his processing are far more likely to be remedied rapidly and he has as ive already mentioned much better choice of auditors and he probably would make it the fastest furthermore he also has source of income if he cares to push it to work which pushes him through training courses if he works it well with his pcs and by the way the literatureyoull be very happy with the literature at this particular field because it points these things out to preclears that the auditor should be of the class to audit them and if he isnt why then you should find that auditor some more preclears so he can afford to get that class and this is very fine because he then goeshe can then drop in on the local academy or something of the sort and get his upperclass training get expert consultation on his cases and discuss all these things with his fellow professionals dont you see and the pcs could help him out in this particular regard in other words it drops hints like you drop anvils dont you seeit makes the way rather easier without having to explain all this and hint around you seeput it right in the text exactly what does go on well the professional then probably will make it the fastest and the quickest and the coauditor will undoubtedly make it fairly rapidly but with few falls by the waysides and spins because somebody was trained but they somehow or another had slipped on their meter reading and they thought the needle should be rising on all assessments of service facsimiles and they took nothing but service facsimiles that drove the tone arm up and made the needle rise because rise was read and it said right there in the emeter manual in other words the very points which we have to clear up with pros coming in here will undoubtedly just become the order of the day with the coauditor you see they make these mistakes alwaystheres certain set ofi dont know if you know it but theres certain set of mistakes that have to be corrected with every auditor who sets foot on saint hill i dont care where hes been trained or anything else we just expect these things will be in error and they will be there will be various points which are awry because they are the frail points in trainingthe points that are easily overlooked the points that are easily forgotten and nobody has ever stressed them hard enough to keep them from being messed up you see so you just expect that intheres certain list of things that one or another of one of these certainly anybody coming in here is just going to have to have his head practically beaten off about before he gets the word you see we expect this well lot of these people will havethose things will just be rife so that will of course slow down their processing to that degree itll throw few more cars in the ditch you might say but theyll make it with fair degree of certainty because they actually are operating on very precise information and the preclearthe preclear of course is the slowest and most expensive of the routes but the least demanding of the individual and knowing man as he is at this particular time and with his tremendous tradition of being able to sit back on an easyin an easy chair and somebody else does it all for himknowing this frame of mind that will be very extensively used route very extensively it will probably outnumber the other routes by fifty sixty times and we do what we can to keep the pc educated so he isnt going it blind at least on what hes supposed to be performing and what hes supposed to be gaining and steering him along the line and do what we can to straighten out any points that might come in his road and beyond that we cant do too much for him now the three routes altogether make the classification and gradation program and the classifications of the professional auditor are just the classifications which have been published theyre already the same classifications and they start in at class i and wind up at class vii and the only other point id like to make here about this program is that thats rougher than roughthose classifications weve suddenly stiffened that up weve stiffened that up like mad it changes the original issue to this degree that an individual its perfectly true can go to an academy for certain number of weeks and get his certificate nownow he wants seal on that certificate well now hes asking to join the club and we have to open up the file drawer and all those infractions he didnt turn in that we were willing to forget about and all of this that and that annoying habit he has of going into screaming peals of laughter when the pc says something which he thinks the pc means to be funny these little points have got to go man do you see its same class i mean its the same level its the same level but hes really got to be there you get the difference and this guaranteesthis guarantees us very high grade of performance at that level well in view of the fact that others are going by without that of course it throws more bearing on the person who is classified so classification really starts meaning something now classification of course isnt promised anybody certificate yeah thats promised people but not classification that isnt promised anybody now what happensthis question will come up speaking of general points now about these programswhat happens if aloysius q doakes of lower cape town all of suddenall of sudden decides having in his hands an hcs certificate that he wants to become professional auditor well there he is see hcs well he of course is going to try to bull his way through on the basis that all hes got to do is take little brushup and an examination and he can have his classification and move over well that route is not that simple in fairness to everybody else who is classifiedin fairness to everybody else who is classified you take an has class i you will see that has to be shifted that becomes coaudit certificate so that becomes merely an has grade i its hqs grade ii and the grade just simply refers to his pcing what about this fellow what about this fellow with his classification now hes up there at level iv he has to pass every classification examination right straight on up to level iv he has to pass them all to level iv in other words hes got to go through just as much mischief as anybody else had to get his class iv otherwise therethis would become very sloppy and upsetting indeed and that it would be very unfair to those people who had been perfectly good all the way up which means quite bit of training all in one fell swoop for this character he would have to get down and grind now we see this here at saint hill we see people coming in here and they somenobody has everhas ever really gotten tough on the subject of exact performance and that sort of thing and theyve let them go away with this and get away with that and it very often takes us quite while to straighten something like this out so itsclassification you might say is solely matter of performance and naturally if somebody cant perform all the way up the line on these various classes there would be point in giving him higher level classification because higher level classification must always take into account the earlier level classifications now with allwith all fairness to one and all and the least interruption of the things which auditors are trying to do and trying to run centers and private auditors with reputations and pcs and all that sort of thing out of this classification and gradation program i think will come great deal of order what do you think all right well ive tried to meet in all of this all the objections that have been forwarded through and i was quite astonishedquite astonished in doing this to get some other disrelated data that i had not expected i hadnt expected any technical data to drop in my lap theres reason for this because this is strictly an administrative program but the basic one was that pcs were failing because they werent taught that was the first one that dropped out whereas i had assumed already that pcs were failing because they were being thrown too far that was my first assumption on the matter that was not the ease it was they actually were not being taught anything and therefore were failing so on that technical datum should give you pause when you suddenly get ahold of pc and this pc doesnt know from nothing well yes you can always pull off your first trick this is what fools the auditor you see you can always pull off your first trick raw meat fat with charge that sort of thing youre working with some altitude you ask them to do this this and this see and with great spectacularity they all of sudden dont have lumbosis or something of this sort now you say all right hes an educated pc oh hell man hes an impressed pc you got this vast difference between these two beings hell tell you yeah that scientology really works what is he saying when he says scientology he doesnt know he doesnt really know what youre doing he doesnt know anything beyond the horizon of that psychosomatic he got away from and your next tryeffort to pull off trick may not be quite so successful it might be indeed quite catastrophic and you might lose this pc merely because the pc got going in this direction and then you didnt ever stop him and start him going in the right direction and he wound up in horrible confusion and so you lost him as pc and then you go around scratching your head saying why did i lose him as pc well you never had pc thats why you lost him as pc you had ahad him originally probably as the subject for miracle he actually would have done almost anything to have gotten rid of this lumbosis and you did almost anything and got rid of the lumbosis and you never made pc and i think that all by itself will be found of considerable benefit because itll increase the extent and stability of the practice and activity of any professional auditor just like that its interesting i also have some data on pcs being trained that comes from way back but we used to push into the hands of pc in one hgc copy of scientology handbook for preclears and we just made them do the exercises this is quite fascinating the studiousness and seriousness and enthusiasm with which these pcs went to work doing those exercises is datum which i am using at this particular time saying the pc should be trained well i will say this that the data must be concise and it has to be very easily understood and it has to be something that is pretty confoundedly personal to the pc for him really to get it straight and it is better taught out of textbook which he has certain lessons to do in before his next session its better taught that way than teaching him in class you dont have then really pc classes you have pc assignments well hes finished it all up and youve handled this last pt problem he had with something or other and something or other and you end your session and then you take ahold of his textbook and you say now youve got pages ten to eleven and half there now weve got those two pages there and i want you to cover those very very thoroughly before the next session thank you very much you see after the guythe guys picking up his hatremember to cover those you know ive just noticed there thatthat you havent done youryouryour pamphlet on problems i just noticed there you havent done your pamphlet on problems and you realize that in another couple of intensives or something like that youre going to be coming up for another grade and we dont want that outstanding now get that done now it gives the pc something to work forward toward instead of the negative gain of his own case which is also quite necessary youll find to keep pc rolling but this pc keeps coming in and taking up half of your sessionwhile youre trying to get it started seehe keeps taking up half of your session with these horrible things that his wife is doing this has been going on for some time youve run several things you cant seem to trace this to anything what in the name of common sense is happening here you see well maybe its some gpm at work or something like that or maybe its service facsimile at work but youreyou would make horrible mistake trying to go into this because youve got grade ii pc well what do you do well at this level there are some good tips on handling his own life youre just tired of these pt problems you see about something or other youve been handling them but actually hes not making any real progress because all youre able to do session by session by session is just to itsa on these confounded problems you see and then this doesnt tell him anything about how to solve his problem but it simply tells him what problem is and that an individual himself must be contributing in some fashionthis lays it down with thud seeto the problem see he must be himself contributing to it and anytime he has severe repercussion from problem its because he himself is unwilling to communicate to somebody about something that he has done with regard to this sort of thing and we lay this down you see we just tell him the truth see now we expect the profea trained auditorwe expect this trained auditorhed know this hell the pc nobody ever bothers to tell him see hed just go on and listen to his itsa and that sort of thing and nobody is saying now listen bud you know because that would be auditor evaluation well book can evaluate without the auditor evaluating cant it you say why dont you review chapter 3 and hed be very appreciative about the whole thing hell come into the session next time and hed say you know i was thinking over about that thing i was reading that and you know there are some little things that iiveive had some critical thoughts about that person i think there are some things and you say yes yes you had some critical thoughts well yes there are some things that i dont think i have ever confided to that person such as the trip to kansas city well this gets to be different situation all of sudden why youre half the session occupied with pt problem that problem evaporates as far as youre concerned without you having actually to do too much or jump up and down and scream dont you see now all trainingnow enough of thatall training and all courses depend on having valuable material or data thats number one requisite youve got to have valuable material or data to impart well youve got that in scientology and the next area of responsibility with regard to this is that it be in form or shape or condition to impart and informto be imparted and to inform others theres responsibility in any zone of knowledge of the communication of that knowledge see not only must you have valuable data but also if youre going to train somebody or take that step then that data must be in state that can be communicated now if that data is in the shape it can be communicated you get to number three which is it must be instructed because the variation and variability of questions which arise as result of stirring up somebodys thinkthink on the subject will take multiplicity of varied patterns and they will have certain questions which nobody could really guess at and which rise up and instruction then takes the zone of handling those things and showing the person where the correct answer to this is so there are actually three steps that have to do with training whether it would be the training of pc or the training of professional auditor one you have to have valuable data to impart two it must be in state or shape to impart and three must be imparted on an instructional basis very possibly the modern university falls down mainly at level onepardon not level one but part one there see do they have valuable data to impart see thats the thing the books of thomas hardy you knowwhats this which wall i told somebody who had taken course like that that id read lot of thomas hardy and he was very interested immediately and so forth and of course i gave him all of thomas hardys potboilers nobody whos ever taken thomas hardy is really ever told that thomas hardy wrote mainly potboilers theyre worse than any pennyaliner stuff that anybody ever tried to grind out see now if theres valuable data to impart there i havent seen it but it wastes lot of time keeps lot of people from doing something else and you can get education boiled down to point where its merely restraint from being active and sure enough modern kindergartens are conducted with that exact definition of why they are therethey are to keep the children from getting underfoot for certain period of the day and if you have all education starting out with premise that were merely starting to keep somebody occupied haha its liable to go rather adrift and of course sooner or later somebody will essay to teach course on thomas hardy now the situation here is then that we in scientology have now really two zones of responsibility the valuable data is there to impart and oneabout the only thing we share at that level now at the present time is just recognition that its valuable data and know that its thereknow that its there thats about all that needs to be done at one because new codification of levels and so on gives certain basic auditing skills pocketapocketapocketa and there are justits just handful that carries the whole load all the way forward you dont get this tremendous randomity that you had before but youre still conveying the entirety of the valuable data so far as an auditing result is concerned so long as you back it up with philosophical understandings well these philosophical understandings of course can come along at the preclear training level but theres valuable data now twothe two and three are where we sit now theres our main interest now itlevel iiit of course has been very difficult for to package up level from one end to the other without totality of finished product you see at the other end because at any time some new data might spring out at the upper end which clarified the lower end and that is what student is mostly victimized by is this was perfectly true and it is still true and everything is just fine on this data of 1956 but now we happen to know that you dont have to know all that you see weve got simplification or lower common denominator which of course alters the data of 1956 well this constant tumble makes the body of data studied by student rather confusing and all of scientology at the present moment is being recodified with great severity and with tremendous attention to pattern and ease of communication of the data for instance there are twelve basic headings of bulletingive you an idea of thistwelve basic headings of the bulletin and they give you everything you have to know about process and to examine that bulletin all the examiner does is convert the heading of any section simply into question in other words what does name of process do that is one of its sections see its this elementary see what does name of process do is simply the examiners question because on the bulletin it says what name of process does so there would never be any worry in students mind about what he was going to be asked about this bulletin its just that question thats going to be asked you see and then you get the definitive words and so forth that follow on down inside one of these sections he of course would be asked the definitions for those words dont you see and hed be asked the right answers for each one of these sections in other words this is very finite zone of learning its very sharp now i dont think there are but about thirty different operations that comprise all levels of auditingwow sounds fantastic that its that small but mary sue and i were burning the midnightdawn and the midnightdawn express and we got together an exact compact listing of the totality of technical material necessary for processing at all levels and itit came out to about thirty operations very small number and evolved this style and type of bulletin and so forth to carry forward this data and the style of type of the bulletin and of course theres the drill which we already have the style ofthe trs and this is being sharpened up and brought right down the grades now what remains there what remains there is number three now of course you contributed knowingly or unknowingly to the precision and conciseness with which this data is being put together because we can guess what questions will be asked about it and whats being thrown wrong and what troubles people have had with it but lets get into number three nowthe instruction of this materialand that becomes the most random area naturally because it is the degree that accuracy is demanded in other words the data is there and its all accurate and if applied works why then what variable comes in on the heels of it well the variability that comes on the heels of it is simply and totally the degree of knowledge of itthe facility and skill of the practice of it that is being demanded of the individual studying it and this becomes quite random factor so that you could toss somebody this bulletin he could read it throughoh yeah this is very interesting and so forth you say all right youve passed the bulletin and then you take somebody else and he reads through the bulletin you say all right now what is this bulletin for and he says well thats for psychosomatics and you say all right very good how is the thing run well you ask the fellow time and time again certain command thats given in there thats the waythats the way its run you say all right not very much demanded of the person now we say all right what is the basicwhat is this process for yes yes yes yes anything else you say nothing else im sorry thats flunked there is one other use this process has out of the 15 listed in that paragraph now these are the materials of scientology now some of this falls into the preclear these processes are being administered so certainly he gets wise to them to the degree that theyre being administered to him he couldnt do them in thousand years but hes familiar with them in that hes been run on them but did you ever ask pc what was run on him month ago thats the surest way to draw blank i ever knew theyll never tell you so we fill him in on the various basic philosophy of existence and the scope of the philosophy of life and so forthit is scientology and its definitions and that sort of thing we can give him this philosophical background but this doesnt train him up very far does it but actually hes being given by being run on and hes being exposed to by having been given some little lessons on the subject the basic data of scientology its all there now lets take the coauditor well sometimes hes trained fast and sometimes hes trained slowly and sometimes heall the time he was on the course and so forth he was having worry about his automobile or something and he couldnt get his mind on his bulletins he of course hasnt got thishes got this data down so he can perform it he might have to go and get hold of bulletin and look at it occasionally to see exactly what it was you see that would be his level of command of the situation of course hes been run on it so hes got subjective reality on it and hes run people on it so hes got an objective reality on it now this is getting up to higher level of precision isnt it all right now lets take the professional level of exactly this same data and this fellow hes got this down and he could be sitting there dead drunk or with hangover or something like this and he could still dish out the auditing command thatnecessary to fit that process and he would put down in spite of anything that was happening in the randomity of the situation the amount of ta which was occurring as result and would suddenly notice that his pc was not running as well as he had been running and that there was some bypassed charge and this randomity probably came from another process which had not been complete or something on the pc there was bypassed charge over there in other words were entering judgment and practice into the situation were adding very precise drill were adding snap and pop into the thing and delivery of precision ofwell precision of presentation and so forth now thatthose are the things which mark the three different routes to otthe amount of knowledge which goes along with them its always the same body of knowledge its the degree which it is understood its the degree that its performed that makes the differences and as long as we make sure that that is what makes the differences and as long as we carry forward our responsibility to that degree where it is supposed to be carried outfor instance lets take somebody in lower amboy and he doesnt give an exact saint hill tone 40 start of session so lets keep him in course for year until he learns how to give an exact tone 40 start of session the way it is expected to be done you get the idea that becomes purely pedantic doesnt it it becomes nonsense because this is not that important point dont you see so we look at this fellow and he gives perfectly adequatehe does know enough to say start of sessionsee thats good he can carry on throughhe knows hes supposed to stay with it he knows hes not supposed to give up along the line someplace hes supposed to run process until its flat you get this sort of an approach all right well youve got an adequate coauditor havent you now because these differences exist then youre going to have differences of speed and youre going to have differences result of this but i think we have covered some of the basic problems which individuals have had moving through and improving in scientology plus the one that preclears are very often yanked fast forward without having done anything at the beginning and gone over their heads i think weve covered some of the basic problems that auditors and preclears have with this program and the only possible excuse that the program may have for existence is will it make better progress in scientology will it make better individuals and will it improve the results which are being obtained will it continue preclear further in his auditing will it see more people moving on up the linethose are the only things that would say whether it was good program or bad program and in my opinion the classification and gradation program definitely will improve this and will bring lot of order to areas that we have had here that have been pretty random in the past so its beenits published now although it is being printed the preclears logbook is being printed and the various papers connected with this are now being assembled on basis of printing were just making sure the logbook is at the state now of just making sure there isnt anything else that needs to be in it before we send it out for estimates on its printing is there anything else that should be in the logbook weve got practically everything including the kitchen sink in there right now you see weve got the auditors code and weve got why hes being processed and weve got definitions weve got the section weve got his checksheets weve gotpractically everything you could think of is in there but somebody may see something we havent got in there yet so thats the state the thing is in but other than that the program actually at this time and at this moment is in effect and should be grooved in and followed wherever possible and should be published rapidly and some very shortcut rapid summaries of this should be released and will be released and available so that people can publish them and get things straight and thats the classification and gradation program thank you very much
