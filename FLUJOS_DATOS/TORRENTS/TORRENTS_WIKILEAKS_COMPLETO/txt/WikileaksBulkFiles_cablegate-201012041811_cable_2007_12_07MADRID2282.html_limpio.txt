by ambassador eduardo aguirre jr for reasons 14 b and c 1 c the ambassador met on december 14 with judge baltasar garzon highprofile investigative magistrate in madrids powerful national court audiencia nacional garzon was upbeat in his comments and said that he has good understanding of us law enforcement and counterterrorism policy even though he does not always agree with it he appreciates the close contact he has with the embassy and said he considers the us friend he also believes we have much to gain from continued collaboration in his view however the us is missing opportunities to cultivate relationships with his five colleagues all fellow investigative magistrates jueces instruccion garzon explained to the ambassador that judges in spain are hybrid of us prosecutor and judge and can lean more to one side or the other depending on their inclination the six investigative magistrates that preside over national courts 16 are respectively santiago pedraz ismael moreno fernando grandemarlaska fernando andreau baltasar garzon and juan olmo the ambassador informed garzon that our embassy legal attache did indeed have good working relationships with some of the other investigative magistrates including olmo who was lead investigator on the march 11 2004 madrid train bombings but that we were always interested in ways to work more closely together in that spirit and because us and spanish judicial laws are quite different garzon said that spain should have judicial attache in washington to streamline cooperation on key cases similar to relationships his country already has in the uk france and mexico embassy comment we continue to work closely with the us justice department and spanish government to gain mutual approval for the position of judicial attache based out of the spanish embassy in washington end comment the alkassar extradition 2 c garzon then provided the ambassador with his thoughts on the pending extradition of syrian arms dealer monzer alkassar reftel he said that the judicial part of the extradition had been settled in favor of the us but that the spanish council of ministers still had to give its final approval alkassar would appeal to the constitutional court on the grounds that his human rights had been violated but the court may not order halt to the extradition during the approximately 30 days it will take to render its decision garzon said it was therefore vital that the council have the chance to decide on the case at its next meeting scheduled for december 28 so that alkassar could be transferred to us custody as soon as possible garzon reminded the ambassador that he had prosecuted alkassar in the past and that he regrets not being able to put him away he believes alkassar will start singing like canary the moment he is in us custody to try and cut whatever deal he can garzon clearly has love lost for alkassar and said i hope you get him 3 c judge garzon ended the meeting by giving the ambassador brief readout of his recent visits to afghanistan and iraq spanish press has reported that garzon is working with spanish public television to put together documentary for broadcast in january that will focus on the current situation in those two countries garzon told the ambassador he was grateful for the treatment and level of access he was given by us officials he said the security situation in iraq has improved but he gives the credit more to the willingness of iraqi sheikhs and tribal leaders to work with coalition forces against the terrorists than to the surge in us forces although spanish press reports have speculated the garzons documentary would be critical of us ct policy the judge did not share specifics on what might be covered in the program comment 4 c judge garzon has been storied and controversial figure in recent spanish history whose ambition and pursuit of the spotlight may be without rival he has investigated everything from corruption in the former spanish government of felipe gonzalez to alleged dirty war atrocities committed by past argentine governments and even went after general augusto pinochet for genocide terrorism and torture madrid 00002282 0022 of 002 however he has never prosecuted anyone associated with crimes committed during the franco dictatorship he clearly has an antiamerican streak as evidenced by occasional scathing editorials in the spanish press criticizing guantanamo and aspects of what he calls the usled war on terror and we are certainly under illusions about the individual with whom we are dealing there is very good chance that his documentary next month will indeed be hatchet job on the us however garzon has also doggedly pursued many important terrorist cases and there have been and will continue to be numerous areas where our interests overlap for instance garzon is very active in investigating terrorist pipelines based in catalunya that feed wouldbe suicide bombers to iraq one of these individuals was recently detained in iraq before committing terrorist act and garzon will soon take his deposition this embassy has good working relationship with garzon and his door has always been open to the ambassador and members of our country team embassy legat has tried to foster relationships with all six of the investigative magistrates with varying degrees of success some are responsive to our outreach and attend embassyorganized conferences and events others do not we will continue to explore ways to deepen our cooperation with these individuals as garzon is correct that they all wield significant authority and latitude to investigate and prosecute cases of interest to the us aguirre
