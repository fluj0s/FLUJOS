compete for customers on the basis of alcohol content the ban cannot directly and mate rially advance this interest because of the overall irrati onality of the governments regulatory scheme9 this irrationality was evidenced by the fact that the ban did not apply to beer advertisements and that the statute required the disclosure of alcohol content on the labels of wines and spirits federal law does not prohib it the advertising of alc oholic beverages on radio or television but since 1936 for radio and 1948 for television the industry voluntarily refrained from advertising hard liquor on radio or television10 on november 7 1996 however the distilled spirits council of the united states said that it would lift the ban but that it had drawn up 26 guidelines for the industry to follow guidelines that will avoid younger audien ce but also allow this industry to compete more effectively 11 the four major television networks announced at the time that they would not air liquor advertisements next in december 2001 nbc announced that it would accept liquor ads but imposed 19 rules to govern them including limiting them to after 9 pm est requiring that actors in them be at

restri ctions on the sale distribution and use of cigarettes and smokeless tobacco in order to reduce the number of children and adolescents who use these products 14 t h r u l d i d n t g i n t f f c t however because federal court ruled that the fda lacked the statutory authority to restrict tobacco advertising15 the supreme court later held that the fda lacked the statutory authority to regula tobacco products at all16 the fda final rule would have restricted tobacco advertising in several ways such as by banning outdoor advertis ing for cigarettes and smokeless tobacco including billboards posters or placards within 1000 feet of the perimeter of any public playground or playground area in public park elementary school or secondary school and per mitting other outdoor advertis ing and advertising in newspapers magazines and periodicals only in black text on white background it would also have prohibited any ma nufacturer distributor or retailer from sponsoring any athletic musical

identification identical or similar to or identifiable with those used for any brand of cigarettes or smokeless tobacco on november 23 1998 attorneys genera l from 46 states the district of columbia

consumer or to competition22 section 12 of the act makes it unlawful to disseminate any false advertisement for foods drugs devices services or cosmetics23 the federal trade commission act does not
