marketing combating fraud and deception summary with increased seafood imports and d ecreased monitoring fraud and deception in seafood marketing is becoming more wide spread the flesh of many fish species is similar in taste and texture and therefore it is difficult to identify species in fillet form especially after preparation for cons umption thus it can be relatively easy to substitute an inexpensive species for one of higher value inaccurate low counts or net weights short weighting result in consumers receiving less for their money than advertised and anticipated overbr eading may cause consumers to pay shrimp prices for excess bread crumbs exce ssive amounts of glaze overglazing can deliberately be used to increase the apparent weight and therefor the apparent value of the delivered product in addition some new treatment procedures by the seafood industry such as carbon monoxidetastele ss smoke are being questioned for their potential to deceive consumers since f ood safety and bioterrorism concerns have taken precedence regulatory agencies have been less able to maintain control of economic fraud the extent of this fraud is not well documented the national fisheries institute nfi has undertaken an initiative to prom ote economic integrity within the seafood industry concentrating on three primary areas transshipment of products subject to antidumping

tampa fl discovered that 17 of 24 area restaurants appeared to be selling less expensive species as grouper12 media investigations have not been limited to the gulf area13 because the laboratories that tested fish samples for media inquiries all used dna sequencing methods nd made fish species identifications based on dna sequences in pub lic databases ther is debate within the seafood scientific laboratory testing co mmunity about the accuracy of these media reports more recent study of new york city restaurants and markets used dna barcode technology14 to determine that 14 of 56 samples collected were incorrectly labeled as higherpriced fish15 common names of fish the correct use of names is crucial for properly identifying seafood because one species may have different

to develop the seafood list compilin g existing acceptable market names for imported and domestically available seafood17 in 1988 fda published the fda guide to acceptable market names for f ood fish sold in interstate commerce the fish list to provide an author itative source of common names to establish order in the marketplace and reduce conf usion among consumers in 1993 fda published an updated expanded seafood list which includes invertebrate species mollusks and crustaceans as well as fi nfish the frequently updated seafood list reflects what fda considers the most appropriate market names for the identification and labeling of seafood and is the agency s primary guidance for naming seafood sold in interstate commerce two main provisions cover the naming of fish section 403 of the federal food drug and cosmetic ac t of 1938 ffdca which addresses branded food and 21 cfr 1025 which sets forth ge neral principles for common or usual names for nonstandardized food common or usual name is the prevalent and meaningful name by which consum ers ordinarily identify the food18 use of either the acceptable market name or the co mmon name in labe ling seafood products assures that identity labeling of the s eafood will comply with fda and national marine fisheries service regulations f da discourages the use of vernacular names as this practice may cause seafood to be misbranded an example of this concern arose several years ago when increasing imports of basa pangasius bocourti from vietnam were marketed in the united states as catfish causing confusion with domestically produced ictalurid catfish fda guidance formerly listed number of fish other than those from the family ictaluridae with the term catfish in their names this prior guidance reflected what fda believed were names for seafood that could be used by importers and domestic distributors and sellers consistent with the food naming provisions of the ffdca to address this confusi on 10806 of pl 107171 farm security and rural investment act of 2002 am ended 403 the food misbr anding provision of the ffdca 21 usc 343 to provide that food shall be deemed to be misbranded if it purports to be or is represented as catfish unless it is fish classified within the family ictaluridae although additional concern relates to the use of lobster in describing items generally identified as langostinos19
