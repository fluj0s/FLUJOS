information in lending the cost of privacy restrictions summary the fair credit reporting act fcra is the federal law that regulates the collection use and disclosure of consumer cr edit information in an effort to provide national and uniform standard for sharin g credit information there are number of fcra provisions that preempt state law one of those specifi c provisions prohibits states from enacting laws that impose additional restrictions on the type of information contained in consumer cred it reports the fcra preemption provisions were set to expire on january 1 2004 but the recently enacted fair and accurate credit transactions act of 2003 pl 108 159 makes these preemptions permanent nevertheless privacy advocates continue to argue for broa der financial privacy laws they are concerned about the heightened risks to consumers from the widespread availability of an individual s financial information such as identity theft or other possible means of misuse from the perspective of economics the availability to lenders of complete and accurate data on past consumer borrowing behavior is considered essential to an efficient credit market the ability of bo rrowers to access credit at reasonable rates is critical to facilitate investment and commerce and thereby sustain economic growth it is claimed that consumers in the united states have more ready access to lowcost credit than consumers anywhere else in the world this is due in part to public policies such as the fcra that support the pooling and sharing of consumer credit data there is growing body of economic res earch suggesting that privacy laws that restrict the availability of credit bureau da ta could impose signif icant economic costs these possible costs include higher interest rates reduced accessibility to credit and lower volume of lending activity furthermore some may argue that credit data limitations bestow anticompetitive advantages to lenders which can also lead to higher loan rates and an increased incidence of default the disciplinary effect from information sharing may also be diminished resulting in higher level of consumer indebtedness and heightened risk of default thus from an economic perspective privacy laws that limit the reporting of credit data could impose significant financial costs on consumers and the economy as whole how these costs are weighed against the benefits of increased financial privacy is matter for legislative debate this report focuses on the potential economic effects of restricting the type of consumer credit

borrowers to access credit at reasonable rates is critical to facilita investment and commerce and thereby sustain economic growth it is claimed that consumers in the united states have more ready access to lowcost credit than consumers anywhere else in the world2 this is due in part to us public policies that support the pooling and sharing of cons umer credit data in particular these policie s have promoted the devel opment of one of the most comprehensive credit reporting systems worldwide there exists at least one credit file for every creditusing individual in th country two billion pieces of data are added to these files each month and ove r two million credit reports are issued each day by us consumer reporting agencies3 the availability of complete and accurate data on past consumer borrowi ng behavior is considered critical for the delivery of an economically efficient allocation of credit in this regard several federal laws pertain to the us credit reporting system

utilization of such information4 in an effort to provide national nd uniform standard for sharing credit information there are number of fcra provisions that preempt state law5 one of the specific provisions pr ohibits states from enacting laws that impose additional restrictions on the type of informati on contained in consumer credit reports6 the fcra preemption provisions were set to ex pire at the end of 2003 which meant that after january 1 2004 states would have been able to enact laws that limited the amount and type of information disclose d in consumer reports however the recently

financial privacy laws they are concerne d about the heightened risks to consumers from the widespread availability of an i ndividuals financial information such as identity theft or other possible means of misuse7 in addition there appears to be general sense of unease among consumers about the potential harms from not being able to control ones own information8 these same concerns have been voiced around the world which is why many countri including australia and members of the european union have enacted privacy laws that limit the repor ting of credit data including information on account balances and credit limits9 however supporters of main taining the current flow of credit information point to growing body of evidence to suggest that privacy laws that restrict the availability of credit bureau data could impose significant economic costs thesehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31847crs3 10 although the restriction of certain types of credit information may affect the incidence of default it is also important to note that default rates are function of several economic legal and regulatory factors therefore one cannot make conclusions about the efficiency of credit market based solely on information concerning consumer default rates high incidence of consumer loan defaults does not necessarily imply an inefficient credit market 11 this report focuses on the potential economic effects of restricting the type of consumer credit information that is reported betwee n financial institutions and credit reporting agencies for an economic analysis of the privacy

advantages to lenders which can also lead to higher loan rates and an increased incidence of default10 the disciplinary effect from information sharing may also be diminished resulting in higher level of consumer indebtedness and heightened risk of default thus fro m this economic perspective privacy laws that limit the reporting of credit data could impose significant financial costs on consumers and the economy as whole how these economic costs are weighed against the benefits of increased financial privacy is matter for legislative debate this report examines the economics of information sharing in consumer credit markets by 1 explaining the role of information in the lending process 2 describing the economic effects of credit reporting and 3 outlining the potential economic benefits forgone by restri cting consumer credit information11 the role of information in credit markets in general the price of loan is base d on the lenders cost of funds plus risk premium the cost of funds is often li nked to shortterm market rate which represents common benchmark for all borro wers regardless of their credit history lenders will often charge an additional risk premium over the market rate as compensation for bearing the risk of sl ow partial or fu lly delinquent loan repayments some losses are expected in an risk group of loans and are in effect paid for by the risk premium the size of this premium depends on the lenders ability to properly assess the creditworthiness of the borrower as result differences across borrowers in the final in terest rate charged are based largely upon the lenders perceived risk of repayment12 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31847crs4 13 for more information see joseph stiglitz and andrew weiss credit rationing in markets with imperfect information american economic review vol 71 1981 pp 393 410there are basically two stages to the lenders assessment process first lender will screen credit applicant to judge creditworthiness by gathering information on the borrowers characteristics such as past payment behavior and overall indebtedness second once the loan has been granted the lender will monitor the borrowers behavior as means of assessing the risk of default over the term of the loan both stages crucially depend on th lenders ability to gather accurate and timely information about an appli cants borrowing characteristics however this information is typically not freely available to lenders borrowers usually know more than lenders about thei r willingness and ability to repay loan thus it is reasonable to assume that there exists some degree of information asymmetry between borrowers and lenders the more accurate information that is available to lenders the better they can measure borrower risk and set loan terms accordingly therefore creditworthy borrowe rs should want to signal to lenders that they represent good credit risk in order to negotiate better loan rms in contrast highrisk borrowers have an incentive to hide their information so as to avoid being denied or charged more for credit when lenders lack the necessary inform ation to distinguish between good and bad borrowers it is said that there exis t adverse selection and moral hazard problems in the market for credit adverse selection occurs when borrowers private information about their own credit risk adversely affect s uninformed lenders for instance with limited credit informa tion there are likely to be more bad borrowers taking loans at any given interest rate moral hazard entails hidden information following the extension of loan to borrower for instance if borrower knows that lender cannot monitor payment behavior this can induce the borrower to make material change in income or spending that affects their ability to repay the loan to illustrate suppose that bank lacked th necessary data to adequately screen and monitor credit applicants one possible solution is to raise the interest rate on loans sufficiently that the bank would be compensated for any loss associated with lending to bad borrower however bad borrower will also be the one most likely to accept higher interest rate since ther is low probability that the loan will be repaid good borrowers are less likely to apply for credit under such scenario which means that the average riskiness of the borrowing pool will increase and the bank will be forced to raise loan rates even more furthermore the higher the interest rate the more likely borrowers will reduce their effort to repay the loan which in turn increases the lenders probability of loss this will cause the market to unravel and perhaps lead to credit rationing since information asymmetry prevents the loan rate from being matched appropriately to actual credit risk13 there are various ways to mitigate adverse selection and moral hazard problems in the market for credit for example collateral can sometimes be required to secure loan in case of nonpayment so borrowers incentives become more aligned withhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31847crs5 those of lenders indeed collateral re quirements are quite common for highvalue consumer loans such as mortgages however this practice can limit the availability of credit to those who do not alread have substantia l assets built up therefore in addition to collateral requirements lenders can use information about borrowers characteristics to asse ss the probability of repayment yet each lender typically has only piece of the borro wers overall credit profile in order to complete the picture the lender could face significant search costs but if lenders acquire the information by exchanging nd pooling it with other lenders then the overall picture is allowed to emerge and each lender has better means of measuring borrowers creditworthiness the cost savings to lenders of pooling borrower information is the motivation for the existence of credit reporting system the economics of credit reporting credit bureaus provide the formal mechan ism by which lenders can pool and share information about the characteristic s of potential borrowers economic theory predicts that the sharing of this information can have significant effects on lending activity first it mitigates adverse selection problems by improving the lenders ability to accurately assess the creditworthin ess of borrowers second it reduces the informational advantages to lenders that can lead to anticompetitive behavior and moral hazard problems and third it di scourages consumers from becoming over indebted by obtaining credit from multiple lenders this section will examine each of these effects in detail mitigates adverse selection consider world where banks only have information about the creditworthiness of their own clients and consumers deal exclusively with their bank for all their credit needs now suppose an individual pplies for credit at bank after being previous customer at bank b since bank has information to measure the applicants ability to repay the loan the bank faces an adverse selection problem however bank b will have informa tion about the applicants borrowing characteristics if bank and bank b committed to share this type of information about their clients then they would be able to better identif which new applicants were good credit risks since lenders re duce the risk premium they charge for borrowers with reliable credit histories information sharing will generally lower loan rates and the incidence of default at both banks reduces anticompetitive advantages but why would bank b want to share this information with bank after all bank b took the initial risk to lend to the pplicant the first time and as result has acquired valuable private in formation about the custome rs credit risk therefore bank b could offer more competitive loan rate than bank or other lenders who do not possess this information this informational advantage is said to conferhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31847crs6 14 for more information see jorge padilla and marco pagano endogenous communication among lenders and entrepreneurial incentives the review of financial studies 101 winter 1997 pp 205236market power to bank b in its pricing of its loans since with information sharing the borrower is likely to face higher rates elsewhere thus bank b will be reluctant to lose this competitive advantage by sharing information with bank similarly bank has acquired valuable private information about the credit risk profiles of its own customers and s the same profit incentive to withhold this information from bank b and other lenders therefore each lender in the market will have comparative advantage in the pricing of their loans to customers relative to other lenders since each lender possesses private information bout their own customers borrowing characteristics in this case lender has an incentive to share information with any other lender but with information sharing each lender can exercise their market power by charging an inefficiently high loan rate to their customers but one that is still below what other lenders are willing to offer to new clients if borrowers know that their fforts to establish good credit history might not lower their lending rates in the future they will have disincentive to repay their loans in timely manner today and in extreme cases default as result both default and interest rates will rise in the market by committing to share information lenders are longer able to unfairly profit from informational advantages since all nders have access to the same information this commitment is enforced by the development of formal reporting system by which credit bureaus are responsible for th collection distribu tion and accuracy of the information in contrast to the case without credit reporting borrowers have an incentive to signal through their repayment efforts that they are good credit risk in hopes of earning better loan terms in the future this reduces the probability of default which lowers interest rates nd increases the total volume of lending14 discourages excessive c onsumer indebtedness in reality though consumers rarely d eal with one bank for all their lending needs dealing with several types of lenders encourages competition and lowers the cost of borrowing to consumers it also benefits lenders since they bear smaller amount of credit risk which allows them to lower the risk premium included in the interest rate they charge but multiple lending rela tionships mean multiple loans and from the perspective of lender borrowers ability to repay loan will also depend on the individuals overall indebtedness at the time of repayment if lenders do not have information about how much credit bo rrower has obtained from various sources then consumers will have an incentive to overborrow posing moral hazard risk to lenders in response lenders will either require higher interest rate to compensate them for the risk of default or deny credit altogether this particular form of moral hazard is eliminated however if lenders agree to exchange information regarding the amount of credit loaned to borrowers by knowing borrowers total debt burdenhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31847crs7 15 for more information see tullio jappelli and macro pagano

cate privacy consumer credit and th regulation of personal information pp 235 236lenders are able to more accurately m easure borrowers credit risk today and monitor the probability of repayment in the future this is why it is important as matter of economics and finance for cred it bureaus to collect information about how much credit borrower has obt ained from various lenders15 the economic costs of credit data restrictions as the previous section discusses economic theory predicts that there are distinct benefits from information sharing in credit markets however several recent empirical studies have attemp ted to test these predictions and quantify the benefits the conclusions from this growing body of literature can be summarized as follows lending volume bank lending volumes are gr eater in countries that have greater degree of information sharing16 there is significant evidence to suggest that the rapid growth in us credit over the past 35 years is related to public policies that have promoted comp rehensive credit reporting17 in 2001 us consumer credit equaled 167 of gross domes tic product wh ich is the highest percentage among most industrialized countries18 accessibility the accuracy and reliability of credit scoring models the means by which lenders determine borro wers credit risk cr ucially relies upon the amount of consumer credit information available19 by providing better risk measuring tools comprehensive credit data has increased the number of consumers who now qualify for credit furthermore the national availability of credit information greatly increases the potential sources of credit to which consumers have access and offers borrowers wider array of choice20 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31847crs8 21 for more

could increase by as much as 70 when restrictions on the type of consumer credit data contained in credit reports reduces the predictive power of standard credit scoring models22 cost of credit securitization process by which banks pool consumer loans and sell them to investors is depende nt upon the complete and accurate credit information of its clients banks use th is information to identify and bundle loans that belong to particular risk groups this common practice reduces the riskiness of the banks loan portfolio freeing up cap ital and reducing the cost of credit23 one analyst has estimated that securitization has lowered us mortgage rates by as much as two full percentage points24 thus recent empirical research suggests that privacy laws that restrict the reporting of consumer credit data could lead to the potential loss of significant economic benefits credit data limitations may increase the cost of consumer credit reduce accessibility and lower th overall volume of lending conclusion from an economic perspective the avai lability of complete and accurate data on past consumer borrowing behavior is critical for assuring the most efficient allocation of credit in the absence of this information there can exist adverse selection and moral hazard problems in the market for credit these problems are significantly reduced if lenders agree to pool and share in formation about the characteristics of potential borrowers recent empirical evidence suggests that comprehensive credit reporting system reduces the cost of consumer credit lowers delinquency rates imp roves consumer accessibility to credit and increases the overall volume of lending but in order to enjoy these benefits consumers give up some degree of privacy and are exposed to the risks associated with widespread financial information sharing such as identity theft how these risks are weighed against the economic benefits of comprehensive credit reporting system is matter for legislative debate
