implant gpms lecture given on 14 may 1963 thank you i appreciate that earned it and this is what may the 14th ad 13 saint hill special briefing course now pcs got his own goal and hes got gpm of his own and so forth and you can find all that and thats routine 3m2 and thats buttoned up piece of technology and recall it as piece of technology and compartment it as piece of technology youre about to get 3n and 3n you are more or less doing at this particular instant its simply stripped down directive routine 3 which uses line plots and is as crude as prop up the hcob may 12th in front of the pc and prop up the copy of it in front of yourself and use that copy as line plot and when you direct the pcs attention direct it by number give number one hundred and fourteen and the pc does so because pcs lose their place very easily and the next thing you know youve got the whole bottom of the thing having missed the whole top and the pcs arc broken and neither of you know why until you suddenly figure out that hes missed the auditor has to be very careful the pc doesnt miss and you dont check the goal and you dont pay any attention to blowdown you run exclusively by rocket read and you just drop all these little bits and pieces actually youre getting items almost as fast as you and the pc can talk and its about one minute and you can tear up bank so fast that it would make your head swim and the pc just does fine because hes not being plowed into it and the only time you random list is when you cant get something to fire you cant get the right item to fire and the way you random list is you carry spare piece of paper over to the side you transfer the item number only to the piece of paper and that is list number one hundred and thirtytwo or whatever it is you see and that coordinates back onto your line plot so you dont write who or what would oppose something or other you just write hundred and thirtytwo whatever it is and you just write the versions of it and you write those very rapidly youre doing goalyoure doing remembered so you do r see rd something like that you see and the best you do with that piece of paper is simply put its date on it at the top just to identify it because its going to be clipped into your auditors report dont you see youve got to identify that piece of paper you want to put your pcs initial on it thats little more thorough and if you want to put number on it thats even more thoroughthat is page number something or other and youve got very proper administration but that in essence is 3n and what you want to do if you want to know what 3n is is just figure out everything that you can drop out of the lineup in order to discharge items everything that can be dropped out of the lineup to discharge items and you just drop it out of the lineup thats all so its just bow bow bow bow now there is still one question which isremains unanswered and i will have to check it out this evening and i havent checked it out yet and that is do you even say would something or other oppose but i can tell you that thats only once for every pair it would be only when you got the terminal and then youd say well would nix absoluteably whatever not to restimulate you all very funny mary sue started gag the other night that im afraid scientologists will be up to for long time to come she said its absolutely fantastical how and i said absoluteable absoluteable you start too much of that thing people who are standing around you who havent been audited will start to wheeze and cough and cave in see these are dynamite words man but if you would just figure what you could drop out ofof the patter itself and still keep wheeling just in the interest of speed still retaining the fact that the items must be found they must rocket read and they must blow why then youve got actually 3n and its amazing how fast it can go now you remember at the congress i told you one minute was goal see good level to hit for and that it would be very fine and we could run all these things very rapidly if we had it at one minute remember that well actually that was fairly accurate prediction i hadnt done it as an auditor i had seen it closely approximated while i was being pc but i thought it was scaled down and was actually putting the pc in bit of danger for while there was listing involved there was unburdening and then i found out what was causing discomfort discomfort was being caused by the inaccurate line plot and the inaccurate statement of the word that was what it was being caused by in other words bypassing items you see and not having the exact expression of the item there that was what was wrong and it wasnt the speed with which the items were being found it wasnt the absence of random listing you see see how that added up so ive been making some tests now of this bow bow bat bap bap bap rap rapid rapid rapid man and i have been hitting minute per item and see signs now because ive just redesigned the line plot because i was doing that writing i was writing the items at one minute see so i know that one minute is easily achieved because you get this mimeographed line plot why of course you canyou dont have to write everything down there your one minute also accounts for occasionally having to fumble see something youdidnt come quite right and you fumble for it and then you get it and i found out pc just comes up shining regardless of what the tone arm did with this reservation when the pc starts suppressing and the auditor doesnt discover that the rising tone arm is from suppression then your rocket reads tend to kind of vanish and they get very small now the proper behavior of rocket read is when the pc says the correct item you should get geewhizzer it should just be absolutely gorgeous you see upwards to half dial you see or greater and then when you call it back to the pcby the way you dont say that rocket reads or anything because youve already given him his item without reading it back to him youll discover that the pc will fumble on this one so you tell the pc to give you this the pc you know number hundred and thirteen something like that pc gives you number hundred and thirteen you look at it mark it on your line plot and say ill now read to you the only rocket reading item on this list or something of this sort forgettable antastical and the pc rocket reads on the thing and you say that rocket read dont even bother to tell him thats your item see just that rocket read fine the pcs happy about it and then you say who or what would oppose what you just got you see and the pc says itbecause hes usually got his place on the line plot you verify thats what he gotsays it you get this gorgeous rocket read then you see and you go through this one two three but youll notice when the pc gives it to you you shouldnt say it first because it should come off piece of paper or something like that see you shouldnt say it first because the pc gets fixated on you and when the pc says it youve got gorgeous rocket read when you call it back you should have rocket read about half that size and when you call it again if you call it again immediately afterwards it just goes this see thats the way it ought to behave so you start sweating around to make this thing rocket read again and if it does rocket read again then youve bypassed some items or something is wrong or the pcs in big suppress or something is all muddled up here it bothers the pc for you to call it again it bothers the pc for you to do so so if you want to do so you say let mei want to check the rocket reads or something that sort of invalidates the item dont you see nevertheless you occasionally will call it again and you will notice that that thing does follow that behavior pattern now if it doesnt follow that behavior pattern as rocket read you know something is pretty awful wrong here someplace pcs on big suppress disagreement with it and that sort of thing or the pc has wandered off some place or another and isnt giving you his attention now thats about the only real difficulty that youll run into pc starts wandering and youll very often will do this trick you will say ill read to you the only rocket reading item on this list forgettable tantastical and the pc says nothing and the meter says nothing and so forth the thing to do is do i have your attention therell be oh oh oh oh oh that one yeah well id already read the next five so forth you know and you say all right you say all right now whatever it was fantastical and the pc bang you got your rocket read in other words you shouldnt first question the fact that the rudiments are all out that the item is wrong so forth see dont take that as your first one just take as your first choice the pc just didnt have his attention on you thats all and youll find these things just blow blow blow bang bang bang bang you just opened up all the valves and steams leaking all over the place and that boilers going to be flat very shortly thats the score of this 3n and youd just be amazed how fast bank bleeds down now when you run into troublewhen you run into trouble and you cant find the next item or something like that the first thing to do is to find out if youre in the right place not chivy up the pc because youve gone from forgotten to forgetting youve missed about threequarters of the bank or something like that very often even seasoned auditor will find himself sitting there running the wrong block of items pcs made mistake youve taken break pc comes back the page is folded some other way the pc starts giving you another block of items entirely all of sudden you dont have rocket reads and that sort of thing well theres usual symptom that goes along with this which you may have heard of called an arc break the usual symptom is an arc break but even if there isnt an arc break there is one that is fairly reliable is the pc feels sick at his stomach when pc feels sick at his stomach item have been missed got it see stable datum or bank has been missed whole gpm has been missed even though youre getting rocket read pc feels sick at his stomach youve skipped skipped items skipped bank youve bypassed things in other words if you really want pc to feel sick omit to find the goal to remember after the goal to forget and start running to go away after youve run to forget give you an example all of sudden the pc feels very queasy hell go on youll get your rocket reads its not running very well but youll get your rocket reads and so forth and the pc will feel sort of green hell feel very pale about the whole thing i mean if he doesnt arc break you better crosscheck what youre doing now the highway youre running is one of the best marked highways anybody ever heard of far superior to english road marking far superior i know everybody thinks english road marking is pretty good but they should see california road marking particularly out in the desert where the signs have fallen into the sand jolla eighteen miles death valley three miles signs all rusty and filled full of twentytwo bullet holes thats usually but the truth of the matter is that your highway is very very well marked now what you are doing is in essence blind flying blind flying you are flying by instrument you can learn to fly by instrument and you will find one of these fine days when youve had lot of these things run that you wont be running much by instrument i just had the interesting experience just few minutes ago of checking out pc who was having difficulty yours by the way who was having difficulty in getting down the line and i didnt blind fly it see i flew on actual perception not of what the pc was doing but my actual perception of what goes on see now i added this datum pc sick at his stomach owww wonder nix forgotten would not fire theres forgotten up the line someplace earlier there are ris earlier there are some ris i was plotting them out last night theres this is not the beginning this is the end end the end and so forth im getting them all plotted up for you and suzie went into revolt she says youre being the guinea pig pc all the time and you get to look at all these things and that sort of thing and i want chance so you tonight i want to get finished through this bank and she did and so forth and she says i want to get back and take look at the beginning of those vestibule implants and that sort of thing and plot them out and by golly we did we got whole hat full of them theres not very many of them back there but theyre enough to really confuse the situation they tell you that the end of the incident you see that this is the end of the incident whereas in actual fact it is the beginning of the incident see and we plotted those out pretty good and we got some beautiful rocket reads so of course immediately just yanking your pc into forgottennix forgotten as pair of course is bypassing all the vestibule implants but you can do it but heres pc all of sudden we couldnt do this with see you can do this without getting the pc very sick its all right he can run but not this pc something was wrong well now the reason you havent found the beginning of the incidentthe reason i hadnt found the beginning of the incident starts several months before the actual implant see its not the day before as you would expect youre captured on exnoo and immediately transported you see and in twentyfour hours theyve got you going to heaven see that isnt the way it is that isnt the way it is apparently youre kept around in cold storage for while and theres about sixmonths lag here of some kind or another they backlog all great insurance companies and great empires have tendency to inbasket outbasket themselves out of pt dont you see and youve probably been in and outbasketed out of pt dont you see thats about all the seriousness there is to it so actually the incident that youre looking for is several monthsprobably differs it does vary from pc to pc you see but its probably several months ahead of the actual implants and if anybody was silly enough to get implanted at the moment he was being picked up to being implanted or something like that of course youve got forgotten or something sitting way up there so you have to scout that sort of thing out but that early sequence doesnt run like the implants it all just runs like an engram and thats why youre learning how to run some engrams and even though you do have forgotten and something or other is occurring up there you can still run those things just like an engram get the sequence of them see get the guy to check them off thats not the vestibule implants they have to be run just the way you run them but what would they be theyd just be somebody saying it or something like this dont you see keyin of some kind so youd have to unsnarl that area and then theres always the chance that you havent got the first incident that youve got the second series or that the pc has as many as six or seven serieses what tough pc he could go back through it that many times see theres always these variations so you want to make sure youve got the first one and that youve got the first of the first one and then youll never have any difficulty at all if you do run into difficulty then its just the rule which i just told you you havent got the first of the first thats all the funny part of it is you can cut into these implants almost anyplace and run bank thats whats amusing about it its very hard on the pc and his body the easiest way to run it is to find the earliest part of the incident and run it all the way on through to the first vestibule implant run the vestibule implant run the first goal to forget dont you see do it all in an orderly fashion and its like sawing butter on hot summer day see theres nothing to it its not hard on the pc at all but every time you miss an itemlet us say your pc has an aversion to able and has suddenly decided thatto make this absolute and its the only thing you can get to fire it isnt what the pc decided but the pcs just dead against it and something or other and all you can get is absolute to fire see ahhhh boy youre going to hit the next bank and the pcs going to be in trouble on that item see and hes going to have lot of mass on that item you see by the time you hit the next bank after that now the pcs got three times as much mass dont you see and you have much less chance of getting the right item to fire and the next bank you hit youre going to have much more mass and the pcs going to feel every time he hits that item or area youre going to errr creak errr see thats how it gets tough inaccuracy equals tough running you want to really pile up the electronic charge on your pc up to the stars just buy few absolutelies and perfectlies and you can sit there and suffer for the pc the pc keeps saying you know its all you cant get nix to fire very often you cant get nix to fire the pc for some strange reason has complete aversion to nix and then the pc is very upset about why he has completewell he has it because its in the implant but for some reason or other you cant straighten this out and you can only get to fire all right run it see do your best but only take what fires do your best and know that about the fourth fifth sixth bank youre going to be running everything on the terminal side is going to start getting little black and by this time however you will have enough charge off that the pc will have reformed his ways and will start calling it nix and after that why it fires as nix but the pc will always thereafter have little bit of trouble with the nix and and so forth little black mass will appear around but this is minor difficulty its only major if you never correct it now you must differentiate between the ideal and the workable and youre going to move too far toward the workable or too close to the ideal youll err in choosing your route its almost impossible to choose it absolutely right youll err in choosing your route perfect run an absolutely perfect run all the way is attainable it is attainable but workable run will get you there i mean one is absolutely and the next is perfectible and the next is superiorably and one is nix and one is and then the next ones the wrong item entirely you just got lock and so forth its very sloppy but remember itll get you there but the more you move from the perfect that is the ideal toward the merely workable the more trouble your pc is going to have now dont expect to run pc without ever having any trouble that is an ideal which is absolutely completely unobtainable pc picks up the line plot for the next session you pick up the same zone for some peculiar reason whatsoever you run forgotting for half an hour without finding it out and of course the banks are so charged up and those root words are so charged up that anything will fire thats the danger and all of sudden hhhaaaaaaaaaaa well if its completely the wrong word youve got choice but to redo it but oh boy thats trouble man thats real trouble because when you go over the bank the second time youre in trouble any time you go over bank second time without the whole thing and everything before its discharged youre in trouble now for instance you could do the whole first dwindling of the top oppterm wrong but getting charge off finish it out to the bottom right then go back and pick up the first incident as an engram get anything thats implanted or talked about there and then moved right on through to the vestibule implants there get all of those and then correct the erroneous top oppterms dwindling do that right now and that would run much better if you do that however you pretty well have to pass the charge down to where you are for some reason or other charge passes on these things if an item is found in the wrong place when put in the right place it will fire again when youve gotten wrong item when you get the right item it will fire again all of those are safeguards so actually everything would fire now the whole gpm has some small fire on it all the way you pass that charge down just by making the pc read the answers rapidly from his own line plot you just ask himyou just ask him the question all right who or what would oppose that who or what would oppose that and he keeps reading you bang bang bang youre just back and forth back and forth youre not writing anything now and youre just passing charge and you can correct all these erroneous items its known as passing charge down the bank so therefore you dont want to go too far into these implants on finding ris get the first one because that improves the pcs ability to confront and remember get the first gpm but you really shouldnt be going much beyond that first gpm before you go back and find that beginning incident and get it all dated and scouted out and get the whole beginning of the thing figured out and everything squared around and the vestibule implants and so forth because that gives you only one bank to pass the charge through to the next bank saves time so good operating plangood operating plan is to take forget blow the charge of it off go on back find the beginning months before and move that right on through totally discharged just clean up all that slick get that real straight get the vestibule implant so this is the beginning that is the end the pc begins to understand all this now there is something there to understand but not these absoluteables you dont care if the pc understands this or not theyre just sound waves who cares electronic beams you know the germans lost world war 1 if for any other reason by always shelling the crossroads at five minutes of the hour and five minutes of the halfhour as the remaining twentyfive minutes of that halfhour you could always move traffic through the crossroads you know you know they always were predictable they had terrific predictability as much as anything else that is what lost them the war world war 11 they had almost made an art out of unpredictability because theyd learned their lesson well fortunately the boys were dealing with didnt learn their lesson as far as this is concerned and they are predictable and either through the carelessness cynicism sloppiness or otherwise they have consistently and continually repeated these patterns not only that they have repeated the patterns of goals im not saying they are different didnt get different goal shifts the patterns are the same the only thing they changed is the additional series and the only danger you face is that youve got second series as the only series on the pc and therefore you havent got the line plot for it yet because i havent been through it and mapped it out its different for instance at that band i indicated on to have game where i indicated there that there might be some items there i was actually getting the items from the second implant series and there the root word of the goal to eat something like that theres whole band in there of eatable boy they sure loved those ables didnt they and that eatable runs as dwindling but those are entirely different adjectives the top second dwindling the formation of that gpm is quite different than the formation of the first serieswhat we call the first series now your dating doesnt mean very much as far as im concerned because it all rocket reads but there are dates in it that i can find anyplace and naturally it would rocket read as heavily charged and significant an area as this would rocket read but i just for some reason or other dont trust the dates but go ahead and get the dates because they are indicative they are indicative you can use those dates to differentiate between whether you got the eargot the pcs earliest implant now i dont care what date you found as long as it means something to the pc now if you get the right date down to the hour and minute itll blow somatics all the way you know the right date digit by digit will just blow somatics all the way right on down to the second only remember when youre dating second you have to date it from specific time of operation you have to date if from for instance 536 today see because the time youre taking to date you see you got forty seconds well you more than got it out of your month you see than its fortytwo seconds fortythree seconds this clock is going on now your minutes go wrong your minutes go wrong because the second that crosses sixty on the seconds of course you had an additional minute and whats weird is you can blow somatics off those minutes and seconds thats the only point im making which is the only thing that gives any confidence in the date at all i know then that the date that is changing is changing because of the advance of time not because its strip in the implant that somebody reads so the keynote of dating is ago now if you date as though the date is in the implant even though the pc reads you stripthis is very common phenomena thetan is always mocking something up to read back to himself if youre dating for series of numbers they arent anyplace remember even though the thetan has got them on strip and dating is just an over and under proposition of getting the gross order of magnitude and then approximations and then dead on its like artillery yougun spotters they fire over and they say its over see fire under and they say its under and then fire little bit over and then little bit under and then they hit dead on and that is the way you date you try to miss the date you try to miss it over you try to miss it under see you get so fixated you forget that in dating you are trying to miss so you want to go over and under and over and under little more over you know so you go well over well under little over little under dead on now when youve got bracket between let us saywell lets take some finite number five thousand and ten thousand you want to know if it is about you see you found out that it was less than twenty thousand you see and that it was greater than one thousand see thats your wide bracket now lets narrow it down and finally by this narrowing we get difference of five thousand we finally find its less than ten and its greater than five we finally find this out with our dating see we could work it up to this line and then we say is it about six or is it approximately seven approximately eight thousand you see approximately nine thousand well you got approximately seven thousand see now we want to know is it greater than seven thousand or less than seven thousand you see because it might be six thousand nine hundred and you find out its slightly greater than seven thousand now is the time to go into your next digit see now you get your hundreds now if you want to knowyou want to know is it more than five hundred less than five hundred you see less than seven thousand five hundred you dont have to keep repeating this other number all the time and you finally get it now one of the things that spoils dating completely is the fact the pc all of sudden rips the date out at you and if youre not on the ball to write that down you ought to be shot because the pc can stand being pawed at with an emeter just so long and he says oh well im thetan i know and he gives you whoa its seventeen million eight hundred and sixtyfive billion seven hundred and thirtyfour thousand seven hundred and sixtytwo bang and ooooo thirtytwo days and five hours and seventeen seconds and it all all reads on the meter you know bang bang you get blowdown hes had somatics everything else thats the date man dont keep pawing around with it you be on the ball to write one of those things down when he hands it to you and you write it down youve got it man thats the date and dont discourage that and you very often get protest from pc if he doesnt give you the date you say is it greater than five thousand less than five thousand the pc says well actually its less than five thousand and you say all right is it greater than five thousand i get read on greater than five thousand pc now begins to read on invalidate suppress and fail to reveal so you have to keep him talking see you have to keep your rudiments in bit on dating otherwise you get mistakes have you thought of any date are you having any disagreement with that date you know well not really actually i thought it was two hundred and thirtyfour thousand seven hundred and sixtyfive was the right figure you havent even gotten to those yet you can almost count on this as mechanism for your pc as well insession you havent squashed him completely so dating gets spoiled the fine art of dating is always being upset by the pcs recognition of the date but thats highly desirable that recognition of the date because when he does give it to you it blows stream of somatics and zoom i cant find anything in these implants that resemble numbers there are numbers there are dates nothing like that i cant find anything in them but i still question it see i still question it im starting to accumulate little bit of evidence now that apparently the two serieses are not just trick sequence see trick sequence you know it would be typical of the situation to say well this is when you were implanted at fortythree trillion and then thisyou know five seconds lateris your implant at seventeen trillion and theyre quite similar well im still prepared to find something like that but apparently evidence is accumulating to the contrary that they were different and what keeps the thetan so loused up in thisall these implants what keeps them so fouled up from one end to the other is the fact that all of his own facsimiles have been pulled into it is one of the marvelous most marvelous groupers that was ever invented and is about the only grouper of that magnitude that the thetan has anything of on the track it is real honest to god grouper now his own facsimiles pull in so you send him to the top of the stairs and hes got railway stations bus stations escalators department store escalators everything dirty stairs clean stairs green stairs pink stairs and they all are sort of dirty gray and he cant see them and theyre shifting and he puts his attention on anything and it shifts and it becomes something else dont you see you say go to the top of the stairs and he sometimes he finally gets to the stairs he rather easily most of the time he gets to the stairs and then if he can just keep these other stairs from coming in on him why hes all right hes got the stairs and then it gets easier and other things blow off and the more charge you take off the easier it is for him to orient it because its that charge which ismakes things collapse now it doesnt matter thetan gets wild ideas about these implants and its very easy for the thetan to read far more complication and far more treachery into these implants than actually exists i know thats funny because boy the treachery couldnt have been greater but he can read more in than actually exists and there is that to safeguard against as an auditor he says well actually i was lured into this store and i had been very active in something or other and the reasonand they had been out gunaing for for some timeand the reason i was implanted with goal to spit was because i had advocated the chew tobacco league and so on and they wanted to get even with and so thats all for the birds and you can just do bother to tell them about it but just let just work him until he gets straight idea of what it really was all about and the more goals you discharge the better idea youll have confront comes up mechanically not by the amount of confronting done on the bank but by the amount of charge removed from the bank confront is proportional to the amount of charge removed from the bank not to the amount of confronting done on the bank so you could spend an awful long time getting the pc to confront this bank because this of all things has interlocked charge and nothing else has interlocked charge except the gpm itself and its charges arent interlocked this way theyre not interlocked savagely this way 3m2 is actually quite easy and quite pleasant compared to anything youre running here but all of these implants lie directly across any hope of freedom or getting better ive seen these things in one fragment or another in pcs now for many many years and didnt really understand what this was you can also get better idea of their technology than itsis true see you can get better idea you can think their technology was better than it was probably it worked out this way some scientific whizbang figured out the wavelength of thetan see and he figured out the wavelengths of various articulate thoughts and figured out how to pull thetan out of his body with actual mestenergy wavelengths this is probably what he figured out high level technical society you see itd make cape canaveral look like childs toy pond you know andbut he figured this out there was big figureout made breakthrough of some kind or another on this probably done from highly mesty level and then knew intuitively that there was something about grouping and knew that the way to get somebody confused was to tell them two things slightly out of phase which were contradictory and then didnt know any more than that and you will inspect the line plot and out of your knowledge of scientology you have tendency to try to correct that line plot see what is the proper gradient here dont you see what would fit in here dont you see the difference is is youre now smarter than they were see similarly knowing scientology you can read more plot into what they were doing than is there see now as far as their knowledge is concerned their knowledge probably ended with this datum they had personal experience on this so this datum was common data this was known by the man in the street that when you kill thetan quote unquote kill see he immediately goes out of his ruddy ead and goes on back to base and picks up another body and in few weeks why youre meeting him as the machine gunner in the spaceship see and now he probably has lot of technology having been killed by you you see he probably knows something about it and therefore hes twice as mad and hes very revengeful and hes very dangerous so when you kill an enemythis is the problemhow do you prevent consequences when you kill one of the enemy see how do you prevent that consequence and this was probably serious enough as problemand has been as problem on the whole track for very long time that it caused them to invest enormous scientific call it well brains yeah lets call it brains they invested enormous scientific brains skill research finance weaponry and so forth into solving this one problem and that was the problem they were trying to solve they didnt know life as whole or the origin of the universe or anything like that but they knew this problem so they went ahead and solved this problem and they also had sequence of dramatization sort of thing they knew something about gradient scale they knew something about that and they figured it out electronically until they could get an articulation of thought on conceptual level something like that although im prepared to find that its simpler than that all right now now when they kill somebody they provided means to pick him up and capsulize him and transport the capsule of all things to an implant station and put him over the jumps everybody when he first goes into this thinks hes walking you know he isnt walking his body is charcoal way back there someplace or another but he hasnt quite lost the illusion dont you see of having body and hes put on something like theta trap or the capsule itself is sent through dont you see hes actually let out of something and is onto pole and the pole rolls through is really what happens youll see the single monorails on the visios youll see the monorails of the poles and the fellow thinks that hes walking here and hes walkinghe isnt walking anyplace hes got pole the pole will move few ris and then stop see and wait for few more ris and then move again and so you get these funny things and it goes downstairs in the first series and through tunnels in the second series of implants anyway their technology level is quite interesting to inspect and at first i was prone to upgrade it but i think it is awesome in the field of weaponry and awesome in the field of knowledge of energy i dont think it was too good in the knowledge of life i think it is full of holes otherwise you wouldnt have found this duplicative sequence see they had the problem however of having to do mass implantations so they just laid it all out on the drawing board and that was the way it was and maybe somebody blew up these implant stations at some time or another and somebody had to lay them out again fromthe plans werent quite as complete now and they laid out different series of ris thats about all that happened they put it all below ground they left nothing above ground and so forth it rather betokens the fact the place was possibly bombed at sometime or another it was hit this of course you know is just on top of mountain and hasnt anything to do with what they want you to believe floating island in the sky which is what i thought it was at first anyway to give you any kind of rundown about this just enoughi was just giving you data when you yourself have perceived quite bit of this you find it much easier to pilot pc through it the only point im making with you and your ownyour activity right at the present time as an auditor is comparable to blind flying but you have very accurate meter and youve got an excellent line plot and youve gotthat thing was really hell to come by but weve got it see and thats right down the line theres couple of little errors in it in that original one theyre mostly typo rather than otherwise theres someone who neversomething or other actually that wording contains is someone who is never ing that is the right wording for that then theres another one down little bit lower on the oppterm side its importance and its actually importances and so on not many errors in it but theyre typographical type errors theyre not plot errors all right and having that material and the fact that your pc will proceed through it willynilly and knowing why pc wont proceed through it is youve missed something knowing the symptoms of that why you can navigate this thing and the navigation of it is repaid by the fact the pcs confront comes up and up and its easier and easier to navigate and the toughest part of it of course is the start of it always and after youve been over the jumps and through it and been over few of these goals and that sort of thing why im afraid that your sneer level will be well up becauseso on im gettingits kind of shocking when you first run into bits and pieces and parts of it you know you kind of go huhhh and your face goes all radiation burn or something like this and you huhhh oh and so forth well i guess thats the way youre expected to feel and ive been through that you know its the ghastly feeling oh these are implants my god how do i tell them you know this kind of feeling and what am i going to do now you see and i realized after about twenty four hours or something like that well thats the way im supposed to feel about them so the devil with it and all of sudden realize that weve been presented with silver platteron the keys to the secrets of the universe just there bang because whatd it do it gave us common first goals it took away all of the scrabble at the beginning of an intensive and in actual fact when you get good at this when you really get rolling hot at this sort of thing youll be able to take pc at the beginning of an intensive and run something like bank session see coo this is how far our technology has moved on up the line you see and you know how it is moved and you know what difference it makes and im awful glad you went through it otherwise you wouldnt have good reality on what there is there to climb see im glad you went through it the thing is problem as i say in blind flying at the present moment but its not the type of flying that goes into the deeper and deeper dark it goes into the more and more light and eventually why youll be proofed against all of its shocks and twists and turns and confusions and its sort of its sort of horrible auditing the thing actually when you first start in and you havent got the bank run and youre running it on somebody you know particularly that lousy bank forget you know and you say the hhhuuhhh what the hell was i saying you know as an auditor you know but thats gone fairly rapidly too and youll strike it occasionally on other goals its almost progress by the square its not lineal gradient progress you know its progress thats very steep you take look at somebody who is only short time ago short time ago has had this and that lot of them have been creaking around one way or this and theyve run half bank see well their viewpoint shifts on the thing and you run full bank on something like this what you dont hear is what it was like before what it was like before youre up against an old phenomenon i remember talking about back in 49 trying to figure out why didnt anybody ever thank you for running one outan engram and i said well it is negative gain its gone you see and in view of the fact that his difficulty is gone hes longer dwelling on it so i called this negative gain so he therefore is very often less appreciative than he should be you know you just get through making somebody firstgoal clear or something like that and they arc break on you you know and why are they arc breaking well youyou are trying to find the start of the next goal or something like that and you miss an item and you feel like saying lookahere what the hell is going on around here you know do this for you you havent done anything for them theyre thats gone now on this side of stuff always collect your fee in advance anyway theits not true that people dont appreciate it theyll all of sudden take long backwards look at this and theyll say hey you know this guys really done job on you know well now one of the thingsone of the things that you have to keep track of as youre going along the line is the fact that withhold at this level or running these particular incidents is longer good enough to clean up session now you bring the pcs tone arm down at the beginning of session as part of 3n with pulling some missed withholds but you straighten out the session at its end if the pc feels rough at all with either overts or ow because the pc actually feels pretty bad for having chopped you up when youre trying to do things for him like that and thats buried and that is what is wrong with pc who stays arc broke hes had an arc break it startled him out of his wits he didnt realize he was going to arc break you miss couple of items you get something backwards or something like that or you distract his attention when hes all worried or confused about something and he arc breaks bang and he surprises himself more than he surprises the auditor and by the end of session he is well cognizant of that as an overt and if you dont get an opportunity to pull the overt aspect of those arc breaks off you make pc pretty confounded miserable because he actually knows that hes acting like heel and it weighs on him i mean he tries to justify acting like heel and all kinds of things go on along the line pcs inevitably arc break but give them an opportunity to recover from them the best recovery on it as general process that weve had for long time is general ow if you just got to run it as process but in actual fact if you just hunt and punch around on what have you done in the session you see and have you done anything in the session you see have you tried to make anybody guilty in the session and all of sudden the pc is quite relieved to get these off if the auditor isnt accusative in asking the question and the pc straightens out then the pc feels much better and the pc will snap back to battery invalidation of an item invalidation of suppression and in suppressions of items and that sort of thing leaves somatics on the bank and so forth anwhereas youd think it would be ideal then to run mid ruds on every item that you find nooo im afraid that would hold up the parade to such an extent that it would ruin the pc so therefore you have to be alert to the rudiments going out and the pc inevitably feels he is being harassed why does he feel he is being harassed because in the incident hes being harassed and he transfers the incident mood to the auditing session hes being confused and harassed so he thinks the auditing session is going to confuse and harass him and there are characters around who wont be audited anywhere close to this and youre going to run into them youre going to run into them theyre not going to come near this they wont be audited on any part of this the only thing that saddens one is just realizing the fellow with the handout to him of freedom from all this is simply choosingshudderto remain in the darkness forever thats awful grim to but as far as my policy is concerned you do all you can to get them audited and when it starts to amount to time which could much better be spent on people who will be audited at that time you forget them you just let them go along with their goal to forget savvy dont pulldont pull the religious gag of the wandered sheep is more precious you know than the decent person dont pull that gag see because it actually has caused enormous trouble and has been terrible stumbling block for the church and so forth they spend ohohohoh any quantity of trying you see trying to get back this wandered sinner you see back into the fold and they turn around and some wolf et up the flock see thats good socialism is doing the same thing you pay any quantity of time to the indigent bum you see who cant work isnt worth anything anyhow and you know you give them big pay and you take care of them you give them housing and so forth and so on he wont work and he wont help anybody he wont do anything for anybody but you just spend all of your legislation all of your finance all of your planning and so forth taking care of that one guy see and then you look around one day and the guys who are working and the guys who are carrying the load are just worked to death and they just fall with exhaustion on the lineup well thats notthats not workable and im not talking about thiswhether this is decent indecent right or wrong nice or not nice im just saying that it isnt workable to spend too much time on somebody who wont be processed now theres one thing you cause an arc break through an auditing error id invest quite lot of time to straighten that out see but how about this guy that youre just spending time on trying to get him audited see ah at some point give it person has certain amount of choice along this line thats my advice to you about this particular problem because youll continuously run into this problem youll have somebody on staff who wont be audited wont be audited wont be audited wont be audited oh all right ill do it aaaahhhoooo terrible i think its all terrible and so forth oh i dont know oh well spend some time arguing about it by all means but dont be late for any otherbodys sessions do you know what i mean when people all of sudden realize that is your policy they wont be quite as retreative they wont behave to be coaxed quite so hard there was somebody raising the devil down in australia the other day he was going to sue the organization because it had run three goals on him and hadnt found all its ris oh come off of it ive survived worse than that any day of the week so i dont know whether it handled the situation but ill tell you what i did write him i said you be good or we wont audit you again ever always remember youre in the drivers seat along this line as an auditor always remember down deep person knows all right well now ive covered great deal of of ground here i wish i had few more hours of lecture after few breaks and so forth to cover some more of the ground but this is rather hard to do i want to give you some sort of an idea of this at all and i am giving you just the bare bones of technical essentials which youll need to carry on at this exact moment the speculative horizon with regard to this sort of thinglet alone actual data weve hadbut the speculative horizon you see just stretches out there you ever been on the pacific ocean you look an awful long distance on the pacific ocean and youll find space you know the speculative horizon is like that its way out man boy i mean weve collidedweve collided with data which is highly debatable as to whether it will be popular or unpopular and im afraid i have to go along with the first foundation decision i made back in 1950 when they had that board meeting and told i wasnt to research on any more past lives i dont think they ever did get that end of the building back together again the bricks are still cracked and i said well psychology and other activities in the field of the mind have always had large eye on popularity and they would actually throw away materials which didnt agree with things theyd throw away the things which didnt agree and thats why theyve not come up with any answers they consult this thing of the popularity of datum the acceptability of datum and have therefore compromised truth so you either accept truth or popularity now this leaves you with only this problem how do you present then if youve resolved that far and got your mind settled in how do you present the truth in its most acceptable form thats the problem youre left with and that will probably require lot of talk about i could have lectured to you today on the probable source of the human race the probable origin of what has been known as religion on this planet now thats thats thats grim thats grim subject thats mighty unpopular subject thats upsetting to one and all now we have the argument just because theres been false heaven with implants on it does not mean that all heavens are false you see we get that immediate argument because if we say heaven somebody is going to think nix heaven then if we say nix heaven there is heaven immediately were going to get the otherthe oppterm in restim and everybody is going to say theres heaven see and so forth and i think we should follow an impartial attitude that says it doesnt matter whether there is actually heaven or notheaven you see we have our own views on this subject or something like that now how did you get on this planet and why and what were you before you came on this planet we could also give considerable talk about this although not too much data is known on it now i have more than good idea of what happened and why youre here and what you were and then therefore what the character of earth has been and why its history has been this particular way and lot of things are falling together and you ever watch one of these animated cartoons where they have well i dont know there is brokenup candy bar or something like that and it suddenly assembles itself you know you see all the parts come in you know like that ive been looking at this huge vista you see of infinite numbers of pieces to the puzzle with good alignment of this that we were all doing on we were doing fine with this alignment and we had these pieces and we could be absolutely sure of these but where did it go over there and where did it go well we better not pay too much attention to that lets get these pieces here and so forth and whats happened to us is horrible an animatedi mean i picked up piece over here that said gpm and worked out the various mechanics of the gpm as they actually exist on the whole track thats perfectly sincere work that isnt out of that implant see and then started to move this piece into the puzzle and we all of sudden got this cartoon assembled everything started racing in toward this puzzle i could more stop it now with barricade i couldnt stop it you see this puzzle is just sitting there assembling see its going click click click click click click and its embarrassing im sitting here with the most unpopular data imaginable you see i feel like saying hey hey dont you realize i got to talk about this you know well thats our problem i imagine weve got this problem for some time to come but remember something therejust regardless of the embarrassments in this regardless of this and that oh i mean i could look around right now and realize there are even embarrassments here about this and so forth you know regardless of all that theres diamonds and jewels falling out of this of great price and you neednt ignore those because they are very very important one of themthe first one you saw was well everybody has common first goal bang there went lord knows how much indefinite auditing see it just went just like that all right there are other things like that happening what weve got here in the field of dissemination i dont know quite what it means yet but its certainly hundred and thirtytwo carat sixty four faceted cut diamond bluewhite because nobody ever had common denominator of dissemination before common denominator of dissemination well people get wilder on this subject than anybody you ever heard of i imagine that weto the end of our lives well never hear the bricks stop being thrown on this subject i imagine that itweve started an armageddon of sorts in the field of thought because this thing is going to have concatenations this thing is extremely painful to some people and extremely exciting to other people and some people say gee you know gosh you know really hey i knew it i knew it you know and he goes off into his personal experience every time the old man picked up strap and so forth and told i was never going to go to heaven i knew it i knew it see i knew there wasnt any such place yeah well those scientologists are right you see and some other person who has gotten big send from religion you see and has actually benefited and has gotten peace and quiet and so forth from existence you know and so forth theyre going to say well those people are absolute barbarians savages and blasphemers dont you see oh man i dont think the brick dust is going to settle for long time on that one i dont think its anything that you could trap i mean i dont think you could stop it i dont think we any longer have the power of saying all right this data is going to be held as confidential were not going to talk about that i dont think we have the power of doing that we could probably withhold it we could try to withhold it we could do something or another at considerable consequences to ourselves i dont wish to risk anybody on this those consequences so the devil with it what does it mean i mean i could lecture to you for number of hours on the subject of what does it mean its the last few days you see of releases one way or the other its culmination its the automatic assembly of this and that well it sure means an awful lot sure means an awful lot and to show you people can do it and that saint hill does turn out good graduates you know youve got new instructor now andstand up moment ann and say hello now ann gotwe make good auditors accs and saint hill and so forth we sure do i take full credit for it and bad auditing take credit for it at all i mean but ann walked into 3n just on the last twentyfour hours or something like this and just got the briefest of briefing and so forth and sailed in on reg last night and ran one hundred and thirtytwo ris is that your first session female voice yes sir thats her first session see pretty good huh so it can be done im not saying where have you been but im saying thats pretty good so it can be done so freedom is in view this is something that then is doable you can do it very easily very well the finite end view of it is right in sight youve got certain technology youve got to learn and so forth but i would say that scientologist did not need too much grooving up on what were doing right this minute in 3n if ann as good an auditor as she is can take very brief momentary briefing oh this is how you do it and sit down and find hundred and thirtytwo ris on pc in her first session of running it and i tore through bank here in the last few hours of auditing and straightened out bank and got mary sue up to firstgoal and so forth so im saying well now theres your got her up to firstgoal clear and shining and so forth and so i now have done it using the exact tools that youre doing and you were using and reality is growing on this thing its getting easier its not quite as difficult to do it is simpler to handle various pcs with it your pcs are not as hard to handle with this as other things its not as hard on pcs all this thing is culminating into the fact that weve got what well we were saying perfectly happily we spend oh i dont know quite few hours to firstgoal clear see we were happy to spend that and we counted on few more goals and the person would be lot better off and so forth man do you know what were looking at right this minute were looking at about two hundred and fifty hours to ot thats another piece that has suddenly fallen into line now you were pretty hot article before you ran into thisuntil you went to heaven you were you were pretty good you knew you lived more than once you could transfer bodies at will you had lot of tricks you were rather prone to be combative you but actually this isyou were way up already compared to where you are now therefore one returns thetan to wiser and better state which is fantastic game you see youll know lot more now with these incidents cleaned up than you ever would have known if the incidents had never been received and although what time youve spent since you received them may have been hell not pun you can make better thetan i mean the guy is better off guy is more experienced he has more direction hell have more judgment certainly his experiential track has been improved and then he suddenly is able to cash in on his experiential track so beings such as we are dealing with right this minute have never been seen before in this universe so this isnt just patchup of the old this is new kickoff of one kind or another now whether those guys that did this are still around whether that empire is still going or whether our own empire is still going these are questions we dont know and probably wont know for some weeks thank you
