divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32173tax preferences for sport utility vehicles suvs current law and legislative initiatives in the 109th congress summary the surge in domestic popularity of large sport utility vehicles suvs since the early 1990s has stirred debate over what steps the federal gove rnment should take if any to mitigate their effects on the environment highway safety traffic congestion and us dependence on foreign sour ces of oil legislative activity in the 108th congress expanded the scope of the deba to include the ways in which the federal tax code encourages the purchase of heavyduty suvs primarily for business use in may 2003 congress passed meas ure the jobs and growth tax relief reconciliation act of 2003 that raised the maximu m expensing allowance under section 179 of the internal revenue code irc for these vehicles to 100000 from may 2003 through the end of 2005 the amer ican jobs creation act of 2004 lowered the allowance to 25000 as of october 22 2004 this report examines current federal ta x preferences for suvs and legislation in the 109th congress that would alter them it will be updated to reflect subsequent legislative activity addressing the preferences one way in which the federal tax code can influence the purchase of heavyduty suvs for business use is through the tax tr eatment of depreciati on for these vehicles under current tax law the depreciation of passenger cars is treated less generously than that of light trucks including many suvs passenger cars which are defined as motor vehicles weighing 6000 pounds or less are considered socalled listed property and thus subject to annua l limits on depreciation allowances by contrast light trucks which are defined as motor vehicles weighing more than 6000 pounds with some exceptions are generally depreciated under different and more favorable set of rules for example suvs considered light trucks are eligible for maximum expensing allowance of 25000 in the 2005 tax year but the maximum firstyear depreciation allowance in the same year for passenger car under irc section 280f is 2960 as result business taxpayer can realize greater reduction in the aftertax cost of vehicle by purchasing heavyduty suv instead of passenger car of comparable value the federal tax code also encourages the purchase of heavyduty suvs by excluding them from the gas guzzler excise tax the tax is levied on domestic sales of new automobiles with relatively poor fuel economy ratings it is paid by manufacturers and importers all light trucks including all suvs are exempt from the tax several legislative proposals in the 109th congress would curtail the tax preference for heavyduty suvs embe dded in current depreciation rules specifically four bills hr 4384 hr 4409 s 1852 and s 2025 would erase this preference by subjecting all suvs with gross weight of more than 6000 pounds to 14000 pounds to the annual depreci ation limits for passenger cars under irc section 280f two other bills h r 2070 and s 2345 take an indirect approach to lessening this tax preferencehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32173contents d m s t i c d m n d f r s u v s n d t h d b t v r t h i r w l f r f f c

utility vehicles current law and legislative initiatives in the 109th congress americans have developed lovehate relationship with sport utility vehicles suvs some view them as symbol of profligate consumption and reckless disregard for highway safety environmen tal protection and fuel economy for others they represent triumph of auto motive engineering and design one that is manifested in their unrivaled combination of ample storage space enhanced passenger safety towing capability bold styling and freedom to explore rugged terrain that is inaccessible for the average passenger car in the decade ending in 2003 suvs became conspicuous presence on american roads streets and highways as their sales and average size and weight steadily increased although many suv owners use them as they would passenger car there are some notable differences in design and performance between the typical suv and the typical passenger car genera lly suvs tend to be taller and boxier many are built on the rigid chassis of pickup truck giving them relatively high clearance between the road surface and the undercarriag partly because suvs tend to have higher center of gravity than passenger cars their ride feels bumpier and more like that of truck despite th availability of the same luxury options found in many automobiles the increasing popularity of socalled crossover suvs which combine some of the attributes and looks of an s uv with the ride and handling of passenger car raises the possibility that over time the differences between the typical suv and the typical passenger car will lessen1 concern over the effects of suvs on air quality highway safety and fuel consumption has spawned continuing bate over whether th federal government should subject these vehicles to more stringent regulatory standards for safety and fuel economy legislative activity by the 108th congress expanded the scope of debate to include the ways in which federal tax policy affects the demand

earning sizable profit margins on domestic sales of such vehicles2 but not everyone was pleased that th newly enhanced expensing allowance applied to large suvs suv critics labe led it an suv tax loophole that would be likely to stimulate increased sales of the vehicles to forestall such an outcome they requested that the allowance be modifi ed so that heavyduty suvs longer qualified for it according to critics the federal government was not protecting or promoting the public interest by granting tax subsidy for the purchase of motor vehicles intended for business use that in their view received poor gas mileage emitted high concentrations of air pollutants and posed significant safety hazards to their own occupants and to pa ssengers in other vehicles3 evidently the 108th congress paid attention to these objections for it included provision to curtail the preference in the final tax bill it passed the american jobs creation act of 2004 ajca pl 108357 under the provision the expensing allowance for suvs not subject to the depreciation limitations for passenger cars under irc section 280f was limited to 25000 for suvs placed in service after october 22 2004 this report

passenger cars 43 and medium and heavy trucks 25 sa of light trucks exceeded those of passenger cars for the fi rst time in 2001 in 1992 by contrast the share of passenger cars was nearly double that of light trucks 63 to 35 propelling the sharp rise in the lighttruck share of domestic motor vehicle sales from the early 1990s through the early 2000s was the increasing popularity of suvs us sales of suvs jumped from less than 1 million units in the early 1990s to around 45 million units in 20035 automobile manufacturers contributed to this growth by spending large sums on deve loping producing and marketing these vehicles6 as one might expect this inves tment was driven by the prospect of reaping substantial profits in 1998 th ford motor company reportedly earned about 24 billion in aftertax profits from sa of just two of its suv lines the expedition and navigator7 an analyst estimated that an suv with 2003 sticker price of 50 000 might yield profit of 20000 or more whereas the profit on minivan would be about onetenth as much8 growth in domestic sales of suvs appears to have slackened in both 2004 and 2005 though lack of data from public sour ces makes it difficult to gauge the extent of the slowdown during that period what might be described as growing split emerged within the domestic suv market between fullsize or heavyduty suvs and crossover suvs sales of the former have been falling while sales of the latter have been rising in 2005 for example us purchases of large suvs were 131 below the level in 2004 whereas purchases of crossover suvs increased 1359 variety of factors explain the drop in sales of full size suvs foremost among them are the advanced age of the design of the current crop of large suvs and changing tastes among car buyers driven partly by rising concern about excessive energy consumption and the upward spike in gaso line prices in 2004 and 2005 nonetheless at least one market research firm jd power and associates is predicting

starting with my2005 all light trucks including suvs will be subject to higher fuel economy standards u nder the rule their average fuel economy would rise from the current requirement 207 miles per gallon mpg to 210 mpg in my2005 216 mpg in my2006 and 222 mpg in my2007 see 67 federal register 7701577029 dec 16 2002 nhtsa announced in april 2003 that the rule had been adopted on march 29 2006 nhtsa released final rule setting new and higher fuel economy continuedin domestic sales of large suvs in 2006 and 2007 to levels seen in 2001 to 2003 driven by the advent of new models of fullsize suvs offering improved fuel economy10 the enormous growth in domestic owners hip of suvs since the early 1990s has fueled lively debate over their effects on highway safety air quality and us reliance on foreign sources of crude il and petroleum pr oducts among other concerns11 critics charge that suvs especially the fullsize models wastefully consume gasoline contribute more to air pollution and global warming than passenger cars and pose significant threat to the safety of their own passengers as well as other people on the road owners of the vehicles retort that large suvs offer greater protection to passengers than do smaller vehicles and are much safer than critics contend they also argue that in democratic society with freemarket economy consumers should be allowed to own heavyduty motor vehicles if they value personal safety more than gas economy sorting fact from fiction in the debate about the welfare effects of suvs can be challenge careful review of the literature on these effects reveals that suvs have accounted for an increasing share of total fuel consumption and emissions by motor vehicles in the past decade or s on average their gas mileage has been lower their emissions of carbon monoxide nd nitrogen oxides higher and their risk of rolling over in an accident greater than most passenger cars12 in addition compared to passenger cars suvs face less stringent federal standards for fuel economy and emissions and their safety reco rd is thought to receive less scrutiny from federal agencies13 but several public announcemen ts in recent years by both federal regulatory agencies and manufacturers of suvs hold the promise that these discrepancies might shrink or disappear in coming years14httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32173crs5 14 continued standards for lightduty trucks in the mode l years from 2008 to 2011 under the rule the current corporate average fuel economy café st andards for light trucks are revised so that they cover vehicles including suvs weig hing up to 10000 pounds the previous standards applied to light trucks that weighed up to 8500 pounds pickup trucks weighing more than 8500 are exempt from the new standards th new standards depend on vehicles size as measured by its socalled footprint which is the product of multiplying the vehicles wheelbase by its track width light trucks w ith smaller footprints have higher standards than larger footprints manufacturers of light trucks have the choice of complying with the revised café standards or the previous st andards during the transition period of my2008 to my2010 starting in my 2011 all manufacturers must comply with the revised standards finally in early december 2003 15 automobile makers from four nations voluntarily agreed to redesign the suvs and pickup trucks they sell in the united states to make them less dangerous to the occupants of passenger cars the announced design changes are to be phased in so that all my2010 light trucks will incorporate them many of the largest suvs and pickup trucks sold domestically will need to be redesigned because the action is being taken voluntarily it is unclear what role federa l regulatory agencies will play in the redesign effort see danny hakim automakers to redesign suvs to reduce risks new york times dec 4 2003 p a1 and lorrie gilbert automakers announce plans to improve designs for vehicle occupant protection daily report for executives bureau of national affairs dec 5 2003 p a37 depreciation of motor vehicles under the federal tax code logical starting point for an examinati on of how the federa l tax code affects the purchase of heavyduty suvs is the tax treatment of depreciation for motor vehicles in general and passenger cars in pa rticular within this treatment lies the most important tax subsidy for the purchase of these suvs for business use it is difficult to comprehend the nature of this subsidy without having good grasp of the current rules for recovering the cost of motor vehicles bought mainly for business use in general business taxpayers c corpor ations shareholders of s corporations members of partnerships and limited liability corporations and sole proprietors are allowed to deduct all ordinary and necessary expens they incur in determining their taxable income in particular tax year one such expense is depreciation which represents the decline in the economic value of tangible and intangible business assets resulting from wear and tear and obsolescence under current tax law the cost of depreciable asset such as building patent light truck or machine tool is recovered over specified peri od known as the assets tax life using an allowable method of deprecia tion eg the straightline or doubledeclining balancehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32173crs6 15 generally most depreciable tangible assets placed in service after 1986 are depreciated under system known as the modified acce lerated cost recovery system macrs under macrs the cost of an asset is reco vered by applying the proper depreciation method the proper recovery period and the proper convention taxpayer may choose to use the straightline method which involves writing off the same am ount of the assets acquisition cost in each year of its recovery pe riod its basic rate is equal to one divided by the number of years in the recovery period otherwise the cost of assets in the 3 5 7 and 10year classes is recovered using the 200 or doubledeclining balance method under this method the basic rate of depreciati on is simply twice that of the straightline method the cost of assets in the 15 and 20year classes is recovered using the 150 declining balance method whose basic rate is 15 times larger than that of the straightline method longerlived assets must be preciated using the straightline method 16 for more details on the expensing allowance see crs report rl31852 small business expensing allowance current status legislative propos als and economic effects by gary guenthermethods15 this period may or may not match an assets actual useful life which is often difficult to gauge usually in bid to spur increased business investment governments sometimes permit business taxpayers to recover the cost of specified depreciable assets well before their economic value has been exhausted such an acceleration in the rate of depreciation for tax purposes courages firms to invest more in the favored assets than they otherwise would setting the stage for faster economic growth in the short term but the economic gains arising from accelerated depreciation often come with significant economic costs specifically such depreciation distorts the allocation of economic resources by encouraging investme nt in favored assets at the expense of other assets offering higher pretax rates of return on i nvestment and into industries that intensively use the taxfavored assets at the expense of other industries where pretax rates of return on investment may be higher accelerated depreciation has these unwanted efficiency effects mainly becau it lowers the user cost of capital for investment in favored assets relative to the user cost of capital for investment in other assets all other things being equal the cost of most tangible depreciable business assets placed in service after 1986 is recovered under what is known as th modified accelerat ed cost recovery system macrs under this system which was put in place by the tax reform act of 1986 pl 99514 new and used automobiles and light trucks including suvs vans and minivans used primarily in trade or business are assigned recovery period of five years their cost may be recovered under any of the allowable depreciation methods the most advantageous of which is the double declining balance method neve rtheless as is explained below an exception to this treatment is made for passenger cars used primarily in trade or business that are regarded as luxurious unde r the federal tax code except for luxury passenger cars the cost of motor vehicles bought mainly for business use may also be expensed under section 179 of the internal revenue code irc16 generally expensing i nvolves writing off or deducting the full cost of depreciable asset in the year when it is placed into service regardless of the assets useful life as result expensing is the most accelerated form of depreciationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32173crs7 17 this amount is indexed for inflation in 2004 through 2007 as result the maximum expensing allowance for firms operating outsi enterprise and empowerment zones and other designated areas was 102000 in 2004 and 105000 in 2005 18 this amount is also indexed for inflation in 2004 through 2007 as result the phaseout threshold for firms operating outside ente rprise and empowerment zones and other designated areas was 410000 in 2004 and 420000 in 2005 19 the 30 and 50 temporary depreciation allo wances were available for new assets that were depreciable under the macrs and had reco very periods of 20 or fewer years they also applied to water utility property computer software that was depreciable over three years under irc code 167 and qualif ied leasehold improvements some property can be placed in service in 2005 still qualify for the allowances specifically the property must be produced by business taxpayer and subject to the uniform capitalization rules under irc section 263a have production period of more than two years or more than one year and cost exceeding 1 million and have recovery period under the macrs of at least 10 years or be us ed in the business of transporting people for hireowing to changes in section 179 made by jgtrra and ajca business taxpayers may expense in single tax year more than 100000 of the cost of qualified assets placed in service from 2003 through 200717 before jgtrra the maximum expensing allowance in that period was set at 25000 with few minor exceptions qualified assets are define d as new and used business machines and equipment including most motor vehicl and packaged or offthes helf software used in the active conduct of trade or business the amount that business taxpayer may expense is subject to two important limita tions dolla r limitation nd an income limitation under the dollar limitation th maximum expensing allowance is reduced dollar for dollar by the amount by which the total cost of qualified property placed in service in tax year exceeds phaseout threshold of more than 400000 from 2003 through 200718 the threshold was fixed at 200000 in that period before the enactment of jgtrra under the income limitation the ex pensing allowance cannot exceed the taxable income taxpayer earns from the active conduct of the trade or business in which the qualified assets are employed assuming change in current law the maximum expensin g allowance will revert to 25000 and the phaseout threshold to 200000 in 2008 and beyond the expensing allowance is regarded as an investment tax subsidy for smaller firms for simple reason the phaseout threshold effectively restricts use of the allowance to firms that are relatively sma ll in asset employme nt or revenue size in addition new but not used motor ve hicles used primarily in trade or business were among the business assets that qualified for temporary firstyear depreciation deductions of 30 under the job creation and worker assistance act of 2002 jcwaa pl 107147 and 50 under jgtrra the 30 deduction applied to qualified property acquired after septem ber 10 2001 and before january 1 2005 and placed in service before january 1 200519 the 50 deduction applied to the same set of assets acquired after may 5 2003 nd before january 1 2005 and

regular macrs property whose cost is recovered under the ads is not eligible for the 30 or 50 tem porary firstyear depreciation allowances under jcwaa and jgtrra respectively 21 for example if the business share of total use for passenger car is 75 then the depreciation deduction that may be claimed in particular tax year is 75 of the maximum allowed under irc section 280f 22 see irs revenue procedure 200513firms of all asset employme nt or revenue sizes and form s of legal organization were able to benefit from them although the depreciation of motor vehicles in general is governed by the rules of the macrs and the expensing allowance the cost of socalled luxury passenger cars used primarily for business is recove red under different set of rules more specifically the depreciation allowances for those cars are subject to annual limits under irc section 280f limits that may exte nd the tax life of passenger car far beyond five years this statutory pr ovision which entered the federal tax code through the deficit reduc tion act of 1984 pl 98369 establishes separate category of tangible depreciab assets known as listed prope rty in general listed property embraces assets whose nature or purpose makes it possible to use them for both business and personal purposes under current law passenger cars and other transportation equipment property used in entertainment recr eation or amusement computers and peripheral equipment and cellular lephones and similar telecommunications equipment are considered listed property there are specific dollar limits on the depreciation allowances that may be claimed for each type of listed property in single tax year ssuming business use accounts for 50 or more of total use of the property20 if business use accounts for 100 of listed propertys use then the maximum depreciation allowance may be claimed for tax year but if business use represents less than 100 of the propertys use then the depreciation allowance must be adjusted to reflect the business share of total use21 in the case of luxury passenger cars the limits under irc section 280f represent the maximum depreciation deductions that may be claimed under combination of the macrs the irc section 179 expensing allowance and the temporary 30 and 50 firstyear depreciation deductions established by jcwaa and jgtrra if applicable for example business taxpayer may claim maximum firstyear depreciation allowance of 10610 if he or she claims the 50 bonus depreciation for new passenger car placed in service in 2004 the maximum firstyear allowance falls to 2960 for new passenger car placed in service in 2005 when the bonus depreciation longer was available22 higher limits apply to electric passenger vehicles built by an original equipment manufacturer and placed in service after august 5 1997 and before january 1 2007 the maximum firstyear allowance for such vehicle placed in service in 2005 is 8880 the limits went into effect in 1984 and have been adju sted for inflation since 1988 although their original intent was to discourage the purchase of expensive cars for business use the limits longer ffectively serve this purpose

treated as passe nger cars for tax purposes since the 2003 tax year more specifically the exclusion applies to vans and light trucks that are modified for business use in way that precludes any personal use the rules were issued in response to numerous complaints from small busine ss owners that current dollar limits on depreciation deductions for passenger cars were making it impossible to write off the cost of basic model van or light truck in the five years permitted under macrshave not kept pace with increases in th cost and improvements in the quality and design of passenger cars23 the federal tax code does not define luxury passenger car instead the worth of such vehicle is determined on the basis of the total depreciation allowances under irc sec tion 280f during the first five years passenger car is used for business purposes for example any passenger car placed in service in 2005 whose purchase price was 13860 or more was deemed luxury car under irs regulations depreciation of suvs under the federal tax code the tax treatment of depreciation for an suv hinges on the vehicles weight and design depending on its weight and the type of chassis upon which it is built an suv may be classified for tax purposes as either passenger car or light truck this distinction is hardly trivial as it can affect the number of tax years required to recover the cost of an suv and the aftertax cost of the vehicle as discussed in the previous section current federal tax law imposes annual limits on depreciation allowances for luxury passenger cars the tax code defines passenger cars as fourwheeled vehicles built on car chassis and made primarily for use on public streets roads and highways and having an unloaded gross vehicle weight ie curb weight fully equipped fo r service but without passengers or cargo of 6000 pounds or less under this defi nition trucks vans minivans and suvs built on an automobile chassis with gross vehicle weight ie maximum total weight of loaded vehicl as specified by the manufacturer of 6000 pounds or less should be subject to the same depreciation limits as passenger cars but this is not the case for all such vehicles trucks including suvs and vans placed in service after july 7 2003 weighing 6000 pounds or less and built on car chassis are exempt from the depreciation limits for passenger cars if they satisfy the requirements for qualified personal use vehicle such vehicle is defined as truck or van that has been modified in such way th at it is unlikely to be used for personal purposes examples of such vehicles are marked police or fire vehicles delivery trucks with seating only for the driver flatbed trucks and refrigerated trucks24 different set of depreciation caps under i rc section 280f applie

of vehicles before the enactment of the american jobs creation act of 2004 27 under jgtrra the maximum expensing allo wance for suvs weighing more than 6000 pounds was not less than 100000 so any such suv bought and placed in service from january 1 2004 through october 22 2004 was eligible for that allowance ajca reduced it to the amount that was in effect in 2003 before the enactment of jgtrra 28

cars for such light truck placed in service in 2005 the maximum first year depreciation allowance is 3260 compar ed to firstyear allowance of 2960 for passenger cars suvs trucks vans and minivans built on truck chassis with gross vehicle weight of more than 6000 pounds are consid ered light trucks for tax purposes and thus exempt from the depreciation limitati ons for luxury passenger cars under irc section 280f26 the exemption originated with the deficit reduction act of 1984 and was initially intended to allow owners of heavyduty working vehicles used in farming or construction or other trades or businesses to recover the cost of these vehicles much faster than would be possible under irc section 280f business taxpayers owning vehicles eligible for th exemption can recove r

likely to claim the expensing allowance provision of ajca modified irc section 179 to limit the expensing allowance that may be claimed for suvs built on truck chassis with gross vehicle weight of more than 6000 pounds specifically it limits the amount of the cost of suvs with gross vehicle weight of more than 6000 pounds and less than 14000 pounds that may be expensed to 2500027 this limitation applies to vehicles placed in service after october 22 2004 under the provision suvs are defined as any fourwheeled vehicle designed mainly to carry passengers over public streets roads or highways that are exempt from the depreciation caps under irc section 280f and whose gross vehicle weight does not ex ceed 14000 pounds because this definition could apply to many pic kup trucks vans and small buses the provision further refines it so that many of these vehicles are eligible for the regular expensing allowance of over 10000028 despite this refinement it appears that pickup

acquisition cost recovered in the first year or tw of its tax life these benefits increase as the proportion expands and depreciable asset s tax life shrinks the fundamental reason lies in the time

suvs how does the current tax treatment of depreciation for motor vehicles affect domestic demand for suvs this questi on cannot be answered with precision because of the many factors that influence sales and the difficulty of isolating the effects of single factor nonetheless there is question that current depreciation rules favor the purchase of heavyduty suvs over lighter suvs or passenger cars of comparable value supporting evidence can be found in the greater tax benefit to business taxpayers from buying an suv exempt from the depreciation caps on luxury passenger cars than from buying vehicle subj ect to those caps this added benefit stems from the accelerated preciation for heavyduty suvs available under irc section 179 the allowance for thes vehicles expanded under jgtrra but contracted under ajca to what it was when jgtrra was enacted the figures in table 1 illustrate the greater tax benefit from purchasing large suv for business use it can be seen in comparison of

flow in the short run by purchasing the suv instead of the passenger car such an inference is warranted because of the differences in the present value of tota l allowable depreciati on deductions and the present value of the associated tax savings among the three cases in general the greater the present value of these deductions the greater the tax savings from purchasing depreciable asset and the greater the tax savings the lower the tax burden on the returns to investment in the asset these savings lower the effective price of depreciable asset30 the present value in 2005 dollars of total depreciation allowances for the suv unde r jgtrra 40000 is 45 greater than the present value of depreciation allowances for the passenger car and the present value for the suv under current law is 35 greater than that for the passenger car although the buyer eventually recovers the acquisition cost of each vehicle the passenger car yields the lowest tax savings in current dollars because it takes 20 years more than the suv under jgtrra and 15 years longer than the suv under current law to recover that cost some may find it surprising that there is only 7 difference between the present value of total depr eciation allowances for the suv under current tax law and the present value of depreciation allo wances under jgtrra after all ajca reduced the maximum expensing allowance for heavyduty suvs from over 100000 to 25000 if anything this result suggests that the decrease in the maximum expensing allowance for heavydut suvs under ajca did little to curtail the tax preference for buying these vehi cles under current depreciation rules is there any evidence that the tax pr eference for heavydut suvs under current depreciation rules has boosted their domestic sales what evidence is available from public sources seems inconclusive on th one hand domestic sale s of fullsize and luxury suvs exhibited surprising stre ngth in december 2003 and january 2004 and some analysts ascribed this strong showing in part to the availability of the 100000 expensing allowance heightened fforts by dealers to make customers aware of it through local advertising cam paigns and the widespread belief that congress would act soon to eliminate or curtail this tax preference31 on the other hand us sales of the heaviest suvs declined by 6 in 2004 compared to 2003 even though for more than 10 months of the year the maximum expensing allowance for the vehicles was 10200032 the decision to purchase motor vehi cle mainly for business use obviously hinges on more factors than the tax trea tment of its deprecia tion of particular importance in the case of small business owners are the income and tastes of the buyer the current price of gasoline and expected trends in this price in coming years and the cost gas mileage safety features and repair record of the vehicles beinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32173crs14 considered assessing the effect of ch ange in depreciation rules on domestic sales of motor vehicle when some or all of the other important factors affecting sales trends are changing at the same time is difficult challenge nonetheless it seems reasonable to assume that domestic demand for heavyduty suvs is greater than it would be if the tax code were to treat th depreciation of these vehicles and passenger cars in the same manner what is uncertain is how much greater public policy in variety of areas especially energy use taxation environmental protection highway safe ty and oil import dependence could benefit from study that evaluates the extent to which the tax preference for large suvs embedded in the depreciation rules boosts domestic demand for them and the social costs and benefits of the adde d sales attributable to the preference gas guzzler excise tax the tax treatment of depreciation for heavyduty suvs is not the only way in which the federal tax code encourages the purchase of these vehicles irc section 4064 which levies an excise tax on domestic sales of new automobiles that do not meet statutory fuel economy standards may offer small business owners and other consumers another incentive to prefer heavyduty suvs to motor vehicles that are more efficient in fuel consumption th is tax is known as the gas guzzler tax the gas guzzler tax originated with the energy tax act of 1978 pl 95618 and the irs issued the first regulations to implement it in 1980 it applies to domestic sales of automobiles by manufact urers and importers who are required to pay the tax irc section 4064 b defines an automobile as any fourwheeled vehicle propelled by fuel which is manufactured pr imarily for use on public streets roads and highways until the passage of th safe accountable flexible efficient transportation equity act legacy for users safetealu pl 10959 in august 2005 the definition of automobiles also stipulated that ch vehicles have an unloaded gross vehicle weight of 6000 pounds or less the act repealed this weight limitation subjecting all vehicl meeting the remaining criteria for an automobile to the tax irrespective of their weight certain vehicles are exempt from the tax namely emergency vehicles such as ambulances and police cars cars with gas mileage rating of 225 miles per gallon mpg nd over and all light trucks including suvs of all weights whether gas gu zzler tax is owed and if so the amount of the tax depends on an automobiles combined city and highway fuel economy rating which is defined as the average number of miles traveled by an automobile per gallon of gasoline as determined by th environmental protection agency the current tax ranges from 1000 for cars with fuel economy rating of at least 215 miles per gallon but less than 225 miles pe r gallon to 7700 for cars with rating of less than 125 miles per gallon these am ounts have been in effect since the enactment of the omnibus budget rec onciliation act of 1990 pl 101508 in fy2004 the tax raised 141 million in revenue up from 71 million in fy2000 the tax arguably serves two intertwine d policy goals it promotes the development manufacture and sale of fuelefficient cars by raising the average cost of producing cars subject to the tax relative to that of cars exempt from the tax athttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32173crs15 33 2000 study issued by the environmental ad vocacy group friends of the earth concluded that domestic and foreign automobile manufacturers avoided paying 102 billion in gas guzzler excise taxes in 1999 and 431 billion from 1995 through 1999 because of the exemption of light trucks from the tax it is not clear from the study what assumptions were made in arriving at this estimate see friends of the earth gasguzzler loophole suvs and light trucks drive off with billions washington 2000 available at httpwwwfoeorg the same time the tax mitigates the negative external effects of driving relatively fuelinefficient cars prominent among these effects is the added air pollution from driving such vehicles to the extent that the burden of the gas guzzler tax is borne by manufacturers and importers it compels them to pay for some of these costs the gas guzzler tax and the demand for heavyduty suvs as noted above the gas guzzler tax does not apply to suvs as result demand for heavyduty suvs is likely to be greater than it would be if they were subject to the tax and buyers were forced to bear its burden since most heavyduty suvs get relatively low gas mileage reta il prices could be as much as 4500 to 7700 higher for many models if current law were changed to subject them to the tax and importers manufacturers and dealers were to pass the full amount of the tax on to buyers it appears that considerable revenue could be raised by modifying the tax so that it applies to all light trucks including suvs according to one estimate the us treasury lost about 10 billion in revenue in 1999 because of the exemption of light trucks from the tax33 domestic sales of these ve hicles totaled 94 million units in 2004 or 12 million units more than the total for 1999 unfortunately the data needed to estimate the additional revenue that would have been raised if the tax had applied to all light vehicles sold in th united states in 2004 are not available from public sources and would be costly to obtain from private sources how would domestic demand for heavydut suvs be likely to respond to the imposition of the gas guzzler tax the answer hinges on the extent to which buyers end up bearing the burden of the tax and the sensitivity of demand for those vehicles to increases in retail prices alt hough manufacturers and importers would be required to pay the tax there is certainty that they would bear the entire burden by accepting declines in the profits they earn from domestic suv sales rather they would be likely to try to shift at least part of the tax to some combination of employees through lower compensation suppliers of materials parts and components through lower prices and buy ers of heavyduty suvs through higher retail prices the distribution of th burden between manuf acturers and importers on the one hand and buyers on the other hand ultimately hinges on the price sensitivity or elasticity of demand and supply for heavyduty suvs to maintain their profit margins on sales of heavydut suvs manufacturers would want to pass the entire amount of the tax on to buyers but their resolve to do so would be constrained by the prospect of losing large numbers of buyers in response to anhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32173crs16 34 kurt ritterpusch finance

producers are more likely to bear most of the burden of tax like the gas guzzler excise tax if demand is more sensitive to price changes than supply in the short run but consumers are more likely to bear most of the burden if dema nd is less sensitive to price changes than supply in the short run the data needed to estimate these sensitivities for heavyduty suvs are not available from public sources and would be costly to obtain from private sources legislative initiatives in the 109th congress to curtail or eliminate suv tax preferences several bills to curtail directly and indirectly current tax preferences for heavyduty suvs have been introduced in the 109th congress it is uncertain whether any of them will receive attention from th full house or senate in coming months efforts to curtail the preferences mig ht encounter opposition from the automobile industry and its allies in cong ress in light of the curre nt federal budget deficit and the prospect of larger deficits in the future key issue in congressional consideration of any of these measures will be its likely revenue effects four such bills would erase the tax preference for heavyduty suvs in current

addition they would increase the limits and expand them to cover vehicles weighing between 6000 and 14000 pounds an indirect approach to lessening the tax advantages of purchasing heavyduty suvs for business use is offered in s 2345 introduced by senator charles grassley on march 1 2006 the bill would not change any of the tax preferences for these vehicles but it would exempt socalled
