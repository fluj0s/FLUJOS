position including details of the expenditure and balance sheet to november 06 and the results of the quarter 2 forecasting exercise 2 action for the board 21 to note the latest financial position and the results of the quarter 2 forecasting exercise 3 overview 31 cafcass total annual budget is 105715m this consists of baseline resource budget of 1008m cafcass income of 0225m plus one off funding of 469m to support it improvements and the change programme in 0607 9 in december cafcass received notification of an additional 297k from dfes 55k relating to post qualification training 42k for contact services manager and 200k for supervised child contact centres these new allocations will be reflected in the december budgets 33 based on 0506 expenditure levels all other things being equal cafcass began the year with budget pressures of 35m to 45m 34 the q2 forecasts remain the most recent forecasts based on these forecasts cafcass is projecting an outturn of between breakeven and 06m overspend this represents reduction on the quarter 1 forecasts and marks the significant progress that has been made across cafcass to address and control the significant budget pressures faced at the beginning of the year and the rising demand experienced during the year number of significant financial and operational risks remain and these are being carefully monitored and managed 13 there have been significant movements in the november balance sheet 14 cafcass continues to show cash shortfall for the year based on the latest forecast submitted to dfes based on current spend levels we believe cash can be contained within this years cash budget however there are risks in relation to carried forward cash commitments depending on the 200708 budget settlement the management accounts 16 table 1 provides details of budget actual expenditure and forecast expenditure by expense category table 2 provides details of budget actual expenditure and forecast expenditure by budget holder regiondepartment 17 the tables show expenditure in november of 86m against budget of 87m an underspend in the month of 1 the cumulative expenditure to date is 670m against budget of 682m an under spend of 11m 16 against budget 18 regional expenditure to november is showing 1 overspend which is in line with q2 forecast national office budgets are showing an underspend to november of 12 compared with 1 under spend outturn forecast at q2 19 the underspend results from slippage across number of national office budgets including the change programme case recording estates fit out kld and communications the underspend on these budgets is in part profiling issue the budgets need to be realigned to match the expenditure profile resulting from the slippage as part of the q3 forecasting exercise we will be reviewing the budget profiles to ensure that budgets accurately reflect the timings of anticipated spend we continue to monitor accruals coverage to ensure that we attain 100 coverage 20 as part of the monthly monitoring budget holders have submitted revised forecasts therefore the q2 forecasts presented at the december board represent the latest forecasts available 21 based on the q2 forecasts submitted by budget holders cafcass is forecasting an underspend of 02m at quarter 2 table 2a based on detailed review by finance taking into account 0607 spend to date and the risks identified by budget holders additional risk of approximately 08m were identified the quarter 2 reported position was an outturn of between breakeven and an overspend of 06m 23 there are number of risks associated with the quarter 2 forecasts which were detail in the december board report these risk still remain valid pay awards revised offer made to the unions results of ballot still awaited demand based on the latest activity statistic demand continues to rise change programe further work will be undertaken in january to ensure commitments are made against any identified slippage pension liability the forecasts ignore the impact of the pension liability and the frs 17 charges in effect assuming movement from the 200506 position 5 the q3 forecasts are due from budget holders on the 26 january and will final q3 results will be available in early february the balance sheet 29 the cafcass balance sheet is analysed and reviewed on monthly basis table 3 provides summary of the balance sheet at november and comparative data for the previous month and the 200506 yearend 30 further fixed asset additions have been made during november as in previous months the additions relate to it projects there has been net decrease in total fixed assets to 4526m after accounting for accumulated depreciation and cost of capital charges to date 31 there was net decrease in current assets from 2822m in october to 2455m in november this has resulted from decrease in debtors due to reduction in the level of prepayments due to an expected decrease in accommodation prepayments and slight decrease in the bank balance due to timing differences 33 creditors increased from 7014m in october to 7195m in november the increase relates to increased accruals coverage by budget holders 0506 accruals continue to decrease and currently stand at 0885m in november the majority of 0506 accruals relate to disputed and outstanding accommodation costs 35 provisions are reviewed on monthly basis and decreased from 0326m in october to 0284m in november this decrease related to the resolution of an outstanding legal case 36 the cafcass pension liability continues to be reported as at 31 march 06 ie 58449m the position as at 31 march 2007 cannot be predicted the value will only be available after the yearend when the 0607 frs 17 valuations have been completed all forecasts produced during 0607 will assume movement in the pension liabilities and use the 0506 values as the most accurate estimate available cash 39 table 4 summarises the cash budget actual drawn down and actual spend for 0607 40 in july revised cash profile was submitted to dfes including the one off funding the budget submitted represented the most realistic estimate of cash spend at that time the revised cash budget is 1062m shortfall of 16m against cash allocation the shortfall represents the savings target in 0607 in cash terms 42 following further discussion with change budget holders revised cash profile is being developed and will be submitted to the dfes in january 2007 factoring in the latest information available based on the spend to date we believe that the cash spend in 200607 will be containable within the cash budget there are however some risk associated with the slippage on spend which may mean that cash requirements relating to 200607 expenditure fall into 200708 our ability to manage this will depend on the 200708 budget settlement 43 the cash spend to date is in line with the drawdown with cash balances minimised the actual draw down to november is 15m less than the original cash profile this represents timing differences in profiled spend much of this relates to the change programme 44 during 0607 cafcass month end cash holdings have been within the dfes tolerance limits they have however been higher than in previous years this is direct result of the high levels of uncertainty in the spending of the one off funding 7 compliance bugetary delegation purchase orderspayment performance 47 november po compliance is static at the october level as at the end of november compliance is 72 by invoice numbers and 74 by invoice value the only outlier in the month is legal and the there are specific reason for this relating to the nature of invoices processed po compliance issues continue to be monitored on monthly basis 48 in line with all government departments cafcass must pay bills in timely manner in 0506 cafcass achieved performance of 815 against the 100 target this area has been targeted for improvement in 0607 with monthly statistics issued to budget holders the year to date statistics show some small improvement on 0506 levels 82 further work will need to be undertaken to identify and address the issues in addition we are looking at ways in which measurement of this target can be improved as the current method does not factor in disputed invoices or posting delays the target continues to be to move towards 9095 which would be in line with other government departments sharon reed head of strategic finance audit 22 december 2006 pic
