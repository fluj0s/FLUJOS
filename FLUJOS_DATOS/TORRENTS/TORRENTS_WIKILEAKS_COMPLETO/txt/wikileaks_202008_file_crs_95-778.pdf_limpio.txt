through the crs weborder code 95778 july 6 1995 habitat modification and the endangered species act the sweet home decision pamela baldwin legislative attorney american law division on june 29 1995 the supreme court in 63 decision in babbitt v sweet home chapter of communities for great oregon upheld the regulation of the fish and wildlife service defining harm for purpos of the take prohibitions of the endangered species act1 the regulation includes significant habitat modification within the meaning of harm the sweet home decision resolves difference between the 9th circuit which had upheld the regulation2 and the dc circuit which had struck it down3 the endangered species act prohibits the take of endangered species and threatened species that are by regulation give n similar protection take is defined in the act as to harass harm pursue hunt shoot wound kill trap capture or collect or to attempt to engage in any such conduct4 there is additional statutory elaboration on the meaning of take beginning in 1975 the secretary of interior through the director of the fish and wildlife service promulga ted regulations that among other things defined harm harm in the definition of take in the act means an act which actually kills or injures wildlife such act may include significant habitat modification or degradation where it actually kills or injures wildlife by significantly impairing essential behavioral patterns including breeding feeding or sheltering5httpwikileaksorgwikicrs95778crs2 plaintiffs in the case were landowners co mpanies families affected by listings and organizations that represented them the case was brought as declaratory judgment action challenging the validity of the regulation on its face rather than as applied in any particular instance and focusi ng particularly on the inclus ion of habitat modification in the regulatory definition the court found that the text of the s upports the regulation in three ways first harm must have some meaning different fro m the other verbs in the series and hence must mean something beyond physical force di rected at listed creature the common meaning of the term is broad and in the context of the it would naturally encompass habitat modification that injures or kills mbers of an endangered species second the purposes of the are broad including the conservation of ecosystems on which endangered and threatened species depe nd third in 1982 congress amended the presumably with an awareness of the thencurrent regulation and the first palila case and not only did not correct the regulation but added the 10 authorization for incidental take permits allowing the taking of listed species in certain circumstances as part of otherwise lawful activities the purpose of which was not taking listed species but that could foreseeably result in take on these points the majority disagreed with the analysis of the dc circuit and with the dissenters and further noted that neither the 5 authority to ac quire habitat lands nor 7 provisions on federal complia nce precluded the validity of the regulation and given the posture of the case the regulation should be upheld in light of the fact that it was reasonable interpretation of the statute by th secretary to whom congress had delegated broad discretion and therefore was entitled to some degree of deference the majority also felt the legislative history of the statute supported the interpretation stated in the regulation the dissent disagreed on this point as well justice oconnor writing in concurrence em phasized that the challenge before the court was facial challenge to the regulation and that the limitation in the regulation to significant habitat modification that causes actual death or injury to identifiable protected animals including preventing particular individuals from breeding and the limitations resulting from the application of ordinary principles of proximate causation which introduce notions of foreseeability would resu lt in reasonable applications she also questioned the application of the regulation in the palila ii case because the actions of the state might not have proximately caused act ual injury or death to living birds justice scalia joined in dissent by justi ces rehnquist and thomas asserted that the effects of the regulation on priv ate property were not supported by the statute first the regulation prohibits any habitat modification that kills or injures regardless of whether that result is intended or foreseeable and matter how long the chain of causality is between the modification and injury sec ond the regulation includes omission as well as commission of actions third because the regulation includes impairment of breeding the regulation encompasses injury inflic ted not only on individual animals but upon populations of species justi ce scalia could find basis for these elements either in the act or in the traditional meaning of take
