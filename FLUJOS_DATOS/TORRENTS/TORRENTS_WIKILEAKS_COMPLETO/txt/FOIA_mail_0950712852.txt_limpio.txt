sending the outline bid submitted last october after reviewing the document my colleagues and i were of the view that teri should go nonexclusive our primary interest is to be part of the project and

be shared with anyone outside the concerned colleagues at teri also i assure you of all possible support teri can provide in developing the final bid we look forward to fruitful association with you

sujata i attach copy of our outline bid from last october it is now evolving rapidly of course in preparation for final submission this gives you quick idea about our consortium and plans you will also see the names and institutes of our partners may i reiterate that this document is confidential and must not be disclosed to anyone outside your immediate colleagues in teri teri was not listed as formal coapplicant nonuk institutions are not eligible to be formal coapplicants but was listed as an affiliated organisation along with about 10 others here in the uk we would propose to do the same in the final bid but say little bit more about where and how teri would interact with us were we to win the centre if you decide to remain exclusively with our bid then i will send you the first draft of our final submission during the next week this will indicate more details about our research programmes and where teri may be seen to interact with us as key overseas collaborator however if you decide to join with both bids imperial and uea then we will simply continue to list you as collaborator but we could not then agree to any further interaction over the next 2 weeks best regards mike at 1045 100200 0530 you wrote dear mike thank you for your email i appreciate your understanding of our position teri is essentially interested in working on the project i can assure you that we will not disclose any information provided by you to the other finalist or anyone else for that matter and maintain strict confidentiality however i did not receive the original bid document or an outline of the proposal we are not clear if teri has been listed as partner upfront or has been mentioned as an associate i would greatly appreciate it if you could let know teris status in the original document this will help in our taking decision on the exclusivity front as yet we are still debating on the matter and have not reverted to the imperial team also who are the other members of the team headed by you we look forward to working with you and hope we are able to reach decision which is mutually beneficial best wishes sujata sujata gupta phd fellow and dean policy analysis

11 web wwwteriinorg mike hulme mhulmeueaacuk 020800 0149am dear sujata i have consulted with colleagues in our consortium and we consider the following to be the position we clearly would prefer teri to affiliate to only one of the two finalists and obviously we prefer that one to be our bid this is espeically the case since we made our initial approach to you last september when there were still seven bids in the making noone else approached you at that stage and therefore we feel we have some preference through prior approach we recognise that you may now consider it in your interest to affiliate to both finalists to cover yourselves either way although we consider there are strong grounds for you not to do so this is your choice of course although were you to do this then i must point out the following two consequences since i believe i sent you last octobernovember copy of our outline bid for the centre i would need to insist that you do not divulge the contents of this outline to imperial college this is clearly case of professional integrity which we are sure you understand b if you indicate that you are also joining with imperial then this effectively precludes any further dialogue between us over the remaining 3 weeks before submission all that we would be able to do would be to name you and your expertise in our submission rather than engage you interactively in shaping 12 of our ideas which was my original intention as our final bid shapes up please let know how you wish to proceed either way i look forward to fruitful association between us in the event of our bid succeeding with the uk research councils best regards mike at 1600 010200 0530 you wrote dear mike teri has presence in london as of 25 january my colleague dr ritu kumar there has been approached by the consortia led by imperial college for teri to join them i am writing to explore the possibility of teri joining both consortia on nonexclusive basis this would of course imply that we do not shareparticipate in the preparation of the bid any inputs provided by teri would be common to both consortia unless it was in response to specific request by particular partner as we have committed to you first we will revert to imperial college for nonexclusive tieup only after discussing the matter with you i am copying this email to my colleague dr kumar looking forward to

colleague thank you very much for your support for our bid to run the new uk climate change centre being established by three of our national research councils we have heard that just two of the seven outline bids have been invited to submit detailed proposals and that the consortium led by uea is one of these two final bids are required by 29th february the uealed bid proposes the new centre to be called the tyndall centre for climate change research named after the 19th century british physicist who experimented with the radiative properties of greenhouse gases john tyndall assuming you are happy to continue sole support for our initiative and on the undertaking that you do not disclose our outline bid to other parties who may be aligned with the other finalist consortium led by imperial college and involving the environmental change institute at oxford and the u edinburgh then i will send you copy of our outline proposal there are number of aspects of this outline bid that we will change and develop before 29th feb and it may be that i am back in contact with you to ask for some additional text of support about some concrete ways the uk tyndall centre could collaborate with your organisation we would also of course welcome any suggestions you may have about such future collaboration best wishes for the new year mike dr mike hulme reader in climatology tel 44 1603 593162
