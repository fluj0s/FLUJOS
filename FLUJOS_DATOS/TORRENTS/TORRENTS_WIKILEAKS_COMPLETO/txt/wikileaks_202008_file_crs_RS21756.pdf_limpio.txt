future has prompted calls for reduction in federal expenditures one proposal for limiting future spending growth would freeze non defense discretionary funding at the fy2005 level even if non defense discretionary spending is held cons tant other spending receipts and the economy continue growing nondefense discretionary spending would decline as share of total expenditures as percentage of gdp in constant inflation adjusted dollars and per capita within few years of the freeze nondefense discretionary spending would fall to unprecedentedly low postworldwarii levels by all these measures as can be seen in table 1 nondefense discretionary outlays accounted for 193 of total outlays in fy2004 although non defense discretionary outlays have increased over the last decade from 177 to 193 of total outlays they still represent less than 1 out of every 5 the federal government spends in contrast mandatory spe nding and net interest paym ents currently account for almost 61 of total outlays their percenta ge of total budget outlays is expected to increase over the next few years as social security and medicare expenditures rise in response to demographic changes and medical co st pressures and as net interest payments rise as result of growing federal debt discretionary spending the congressional budget office defines federal discretionary spending as budget authority that is provided and controlled by appropriation acts and the outlays that result from the budget authority hence the discretionary spending level can be changed through the appropriations process mandatory spending is budget authority provided and controlled by laws other than appropriation acts and the outlays that result from the budget authority hence mandatory spending can be altered only through changes in substantive law nondefense discretionary spending includes among other things funding for the fbi the national park service the national institutes of health nasa most federal education programs broad

projection of freezing all discretionary funding at fy2004 levels would accrue if the freeze in funding was limited solely to nondefense discretionary fundinghowever because freezing nondefense disc retionary spending reduces the size of the expected deficit which in turn slows incr eases in federal debt held by the public net interest payments will be sma ller than they otherwise would be during this period the estimated savings in net in terest payments from freez ing nondefense discretionary spending grow from 1 billion in fy2007 to 6 billion in fy2010 the cumulative net interest savings are 13 billion4 hence the estimated total deficit reduction from freezing nondefense discretionary outla ys would be 154 billion over the period the cbo baseline budget deficit projec tion for the fy2005 through fy2010 period is shown in table 3 as mentioned earlier it seems very likely that an alternative deficit estimate that includes likely future action such as additional expenditures for the iraq and afghanistan campaigns and the extension of at least some if not all of the expiring tax provisions would make the deficit estimates larger table 3 cbo baseline deficit projections in
