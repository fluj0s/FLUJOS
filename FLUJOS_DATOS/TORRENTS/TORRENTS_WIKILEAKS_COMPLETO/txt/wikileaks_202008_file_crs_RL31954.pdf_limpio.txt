governmental ffairs committee on june 4 2003 the committee conducted hearing on the bill following the hearing senators voinovich and thomas carper asked the comptroller general david walker to respond to severa l additional questions hi s response submitted on july 3 2003 included the following comments it is critical that agencies or components have in place the human capital infrastructure and safeguards before implementing new human capital reforms this institutional infrastructure include s at minimum 1 human capital planning process that integrates the agen cys human capital policies strategies and programs with its program mission goals and desired outcomes 2 the capabilities to develop and implement new human capital system effectively and 3 modern effective credible and as appropriate validated performance appraisal and management system that includes adequate safeguards such as reasonable transparency and appropriate accountability mechanisms to ensure the fair effective and nondiscriminatory implementation of the system although we do not believe that dod should wait for the full implementation of the new human capital system at the partment of homeland security dhs we do think that there are important lessons that can be learned from how dhs is developing its new personnel system for example dhs has implemented an approach that includes design team of employees from dhs the office of personnel management opm and major labor unions to further involve employees dhs has conducted series of town hall meetings around the country and held focus groups to further learn of employees views and comments dod needs to ensure that employees are involved in order to obtain their ideas and gain adequate buyin for any related transformational efforts we suggest that dod also be required to link its performance management system to program and performance goals and desired outcomes this helps the organization ensure that its efforts ar properly aligned and reinforces the line of sight between individual performance and organizational success so that an individual can see how herhis daily responsibilities contribute to results and outcomeshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31954crs3 7 us general accounting office posthearing questions rela ted to proposed department of defense dod human capital reform gao03965r washington july 3 2003 8 letter from senators susan collins george voinovich ted stevens and john sununu to senate colleagues july 14 2003 provided to crs by the senate committee on governmental affairs by facsimilein our view it would be preferable to employ governmentwide approach to address certain flexibilities that have broadbased application and serious potential implications for the civil service system broad banding pay for performance reemployment and pension offs et waivers in these situations it may be prudent and preferable for congress to provide such authorities on governmentwide basis and in manner that assures that sufficient personnel infrastructure and appropriate safeguards are in place before an agency implements the new authorities based on our experience wh ile dod s leadership has the intent and the ability to transform the department the needed in stitutional infrastructure is not in place in vast majority of dod organizations in the absence of the right institutional infrastructur granting additional human capital authorities will provide little advantage and could actually end up doing damage if the authorities are not implemented properly by the respective department or agency7 the senate governmental affairs committee marked up the bill on june 17 2003 and on the same day or dered s 1166 to be reporte d to the senate amended on 10 to 1 roll call vote

to their senate coll eagues expressing their support for and sharing their views on the personnel provisions of s 1166 they stated that as template for future governmentwide civilian pe rsonnel reform the personnel provisions in the defense bill must strike the right balance between promoting flexible system and protecting the rights of our constituents who serve in the federal civil service and

language in the proposed regulation that authorized the secr etary of defense to seek reconsideration by mspb of final mspb decision before seeking judicial review was deleted because current mspb rules authorize such review procedures for appeals of adverse acti ons to mspb based on mandatory removal offenses are the same as for other offens except that if one or more mandatory removal offenses is or are sustained the mspb administrative judge may not mitigate the penalty only the secretary of defense may mitigate the penalty within the department if the administrative judge or full board sustains an employees appeal based on finding that the employee did not commit mandatory removal offense subsequent proposed adverse action other than mandatory removal offense based in whole or in part on the same or similar evidence is not precluded this final regulation differs from the proposed one in that it precludes only an administrative judge of the mspb to mitigate penalty for

that it will appeal the decision45 the court held that the process of appealing adve rse actions in the final regu lations would fail to provide employees with fair treatment and therefor were contrary to authority that had been granted in the statute the following regulations were found to be unfair regulations that would authoriz dod to reverse decision of an administrative judge of the merit systems protection board if the department determined that there had been material error of fact or that the decision had direct and substantial impact of the departments national s ecurity

regulation that would prohibit an administrative judge from modifying penalty imposed by th department unl ess such penalty is totally unwarranted in light of all circumstances and required an administrative judge who did mitigate penalty to impose the maximum justifiable one the c ourt quoted from an court decision which held that final regulations of the department of homeland security exceeded statutory authority to say that this dod regulation like similar one for dhs would put the thumbs of the agencies down hard on the scales of justice in the agencies favor regulation that would permit the secretary in his or her sole exclusive and unreviewable discretion to place an employee in an alternative position or on an excused absence if the secretary determined that the employees return ordered by the merit systems protection board would be impr acticable or unduly disruptive to the work environment the cour t found that there was basis in the statute for this authority and conflicted with statutory requirement that interim relief could be granted except by the board regulation that would authorize the secretary in his sole exclusive and unreviewable disc retion to identify offenses known as mandatory removal offe nses that have direct and substantial impact on the departme nts national security mission an employee deemed to have committed one of these

considering the changes made to the caps on basic pay which resulted in the establishment of caps at levels ii and iii of the executive schedule the elimination of locality pay might be viewed as practical matter however senior executives employed by an agency whose performance appraisal system is not certified could be adversely affected by the loss of locality pay total compensation the performance appraisal certification process was established by another statute the ho meland security act of 2002 pl 107296 116 stat 2135 at 2297 which also shifted the cap on total compensation for

system the cap has shifted upward to the vice presidents salary which is 212100 in 2006 the significance of this change has to do with timing for senior executives with certified appraisal systems they are more likely to receive all of their compensation in one year instead of having some payments deferred to the following year which is what occurs when an individuals total compensation exceeds the applicable cap under section 1125c the amendments made by this section took effect on the first date of the first pay period that began on or after january 1 2004 which was january 11 for most
