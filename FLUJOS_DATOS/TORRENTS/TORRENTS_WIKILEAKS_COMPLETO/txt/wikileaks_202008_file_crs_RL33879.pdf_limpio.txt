difficult to meet their mortgage obligations and late payments and foreclosures increased in absolute terms the biggest percentage point increases in mortgage defaults have occurred among subprime borrowersthose borrowers with significant indicato rs of heightened risk of default such as blemished credit history or high debttoincome ratio in relative terms the default rate among prime borrowers with adjustable rate mortgages arms has risen even faster than subprime default rates 2 borrowers may have relied upon the low interest rates and rapid house price appreciation that occurred between 20012005 to continue but now face significant risk of foreclosure as housing markets decline in some areas changes in mortgage contracts and the method of funding mortgages such as interestonly and adjustable rate mortgages could have contributed to housing market stress troubles in the housing market are not relegated to defaulting borrowers however falling prices and slowing home sales affect all home owners 2 subprime default rates can increase more percentage points even though the prime default rate is rising faster because subprime defaults start from higher base

profiles with th result that lenders now offer home loans to consumers who earlier would have been denied mortgage credit these loans are often referred to as subprime loans typically loans to subprime borrowers have higher interest rates and fees than loans to prime borrowers because subprime borrowers have historically experienced higher default rates delinquency and foreclosure rates for subprime loans rose rapidly during the second half of 2006 and the first half of 2007 on april 11 2007 the joint economic committee issued special report on rising foreclosures the report predicted that subprime foreclosures would continue to rise and recommended immediate action to minimize any costs that foreclosures can impose on surrounding communities 3 although the primary causes of foreclosure are traditionally personal financial setbacks job loss or medical calamity the recent rise in subprime foreclosures may be partly due to imprudent underwriting standards during the housing boom that occurred between approximately 2001 and 2005 house prices rose rapidly in certain markets which may have encouraged some borrowers in hot markets to assume more debt than was prudent rapidly rising prices encourage excess debt because once in the home the borrower earns the house price appreciation which can then be used to refinance the house on more favorable terms in order to take advantage of anticipated appreciation some borrowers turned to mortgage products with low introductory payments but which risked higher future payments

slowing housing markets frustrated the plans of some borrowers who used nontraditional mortgages sometimes referred to as exotic mortgages to finance their homes one form of alternative mortgage has an interestonly io introductory period for two three five or more years the borrower pays principal during the introductory period but then payments increase when the io period expires because the remainder of the borrowers payments must pay off the principal over shorter period of time for exam ple 228 mortgage has an io introductory payment for two years but then resets to higher payment for the remaining 28 years of the loan another form of alternative mortgage the adjustable rate mortgage arm employs variable interest rate which adjusts to changes in market interest rate one of the simplest arms offers an initial low rate called teaser at the beginning of the loan and then resets after an introductory period the teaser rate may apply for one year or for as little as one month

since some borrowers with resetting mortgages had planned to refinance their mortgages using continued house price appreciation the recent declines in housing markets and rise in lending standards have resulted in sharply rising foreclosure rates foreclosure rates are rising especially among borrowers in formerly rapidly appreciating regions and among borrowers with arms some of the geographic distribution of mortgage defaults can be explained by the performance of local economies late payments as measured by mortgage bankers association survey are rising among bo rrowers with arms whether subprime or not subprime borrowers with fixed rate mortgages however are not experiencing higher rates of late payment although most subprime arms reset by summer of 2008 there remains large number of

were financed outside of traditional banking channels in process called securitization in securitization lender sells loans quickly rather than keeping them on the lenders books many similar loans are then pooled together in trusts or special purpose vehicles spvs pieces of the funds flowing through the trusts called tranches are sold to investors although securitization may have helped increase the supply of funds available for mortgages and thus held down interest rates for borrowers it may also have facilitated the rise of nonbank lenders operating without federal supervision of their underwriting standards the disproportionate rise in defaults among loans originated and securitized outside federal supervision has caused some to call for greater scrutiny of the process for more information about securitization see crs report rs22722 securitization and federal regulation of mortgages for safety and soundness by edward v murphy one concern is that securitization may have separated the upfront returns of mortgage originators from the longterm risk of securities holders if the securitization process does not have adequate controls mortgage originators could have the incentive to encourage borrowers to take on too much debt because the mortgage originator might not suffer losses if the borrower defaults in the future the securitization community argues that investors are sophisticated market analysts who include contract clauses in securitization transactions to prevent mortgage originators from passing on this risk one proposal to address concerns raised by securitization would make secondary market investors liable for deceptive or predatory marketing by primary lenders some believe that extension of liability to the secondary market referred to as assignee liability would prevent secondary market investors from purposefully remaining ignorant of the marketing strategies of primary lenders in this view if secondary market investors were held liable they would tighten 4 jumbo loans are too large to be eligible for purchase by fannie mae or freddie mac this cap called the conforming loan limit was 417000 until the enactment of pl

after increasing at rapid rate during 20012005 house prices slowed significantly during 20062007 and began to decline significantly in 2008 in several parts of the country such as california and florida the decline in housing markets preceded any loss of jobs in the local communities an unusual condition in other parts of the country such as michigan and ohio increases in foreclosure rates could in part be explained by stresses in the local economy the inventory of unsold homes has become large by historical standards as is the homeowner vacancy rate one indicator of the strength of local housing market is the length of time it takes to sell house if houses are selling more slowly than the rate at which people are offering them for sale then the inventory of unsold homes grows according to the national association of realtors at the beginning of 2005 the months supply of homes on the market was 38 5 months supply is calculated by taking the number of homes currently offered for sale and dividing by the current number of sales per month it is meant to represent the amount of time that would be required to sell the houses that are on the market balanced market has months supply between 50 and 60 according to the national association of realtors the months supply reached 111 in june 2008 and then fell back to 99 by september 2008 6 the existence of glut of unsold homes is also evidenced by rising vacancy rates homeowner vacancy rates measure the percentage of the homeowner inventory that is vacant and for sale according to the census bureau homeowner vacancy rates in the first quarter of 2008 were at 29 the highest level they had reached since the survey began in 1956 7 the slowing housing market is hurting builders and construction workers as the supply of unsold homes has increased builders have begun canceling options to acquire land for new construction and have offered reducedprice upgrades and other discounts on existing homes the result has been even further downward pressure on pri ces and slowdown in new construction for example the national association of home builders confidence index fell more than 50 from 2005 to 2007 the index measures

the office of thrift supervision and the national credit union administration respectively however there is federal regulatory system for mortgage lenders that are not banks savings and loans or credit unions instead these institutions are licensed at the state level where they are subject to state regulation since the recent increase in subprime loans and foreclosures questions have been

enacted in 1974 to effect certain changes in the settlement process for residential real estate15 the law requires lenders to provide to borrowers estimates of settlement costs referred to as good faith estimate gfe list of the actual closing costs must be provided to borrowers at the time of closing examples of settlement costs included in the gfe are loan origination fees or points credit report fees property appraisal fees mortgage insurance fees title insurance fees home and flood insurance fees recording fees attorney fees and escrow account deposits additionally servicers are required to provide borrowers with certain notices each time federally related mortgage loan is sold transferred or assigned to new holder consumers generally find the real estate settlement process confusing and lenders find it cumbersome although respa requires lenders to provide consumers with estimates of settlement costs federal or state law requires the lenders to deliver settlement costs in the amounts stated in the estimates as result consumers often receive unexpected fees at closing and these unexpected fees can sometimes be hundreds and even thousands of dollars more than expected changes to both current gfe disclosure forms as well as the information disclosed within them could arguably lead to less confusion about loan and settlement costs hud has proposed changes to respa designed to enhance the ability of homebuyers to understand mortgage terms and associated costs as well as to enhance their ability to shop for the best deals for more information about huds proposed changes see crs report rl34442 hud proposes administrative modifications to the real estate settlement procedures act by darryl getter in addition to changes proposed by hud legislation has been

requirements the law re quiring loan rate or pricing information was implemented in 2004 currently hmda does not require lenders to report every variable used to evaluate applicants because the

possible for borrowers with poor credit low income or little savings to qualify for mortgage loans predatory lending is term that is sometimes used interchangeably with subprime lending although prime loans also may be predatory however the majority of predatory loans are confined to the subprime mortgage market commentators have had difficult time arriving at an explicit definition of predatory lending joint report issued by hud and the department of treasury offered this definition in predatory lending situation the party that initiates the loan often provides misinformation manipulates the borro wer through aggressive sales tactics andor takes unfair advantage of the borrowers lack of information about the loan terms and their consequences the results are loans with onerous terms and conditions that the borrower often cannot repay leading to foreclosure or bankruptcy 20 drawing the line between valid subprime lending and predatory lending has proven to be difficult task21 determining at what point higher rates and fees and more onerous loan terms become predatory is fundamental factor in adopting appropriate legislation to curb these practices if restrictions on lending practices go too far the availability of credit for those with damaged credit profiles could dry up leaving th em without the option of homeownership on the other hand if the restrictions are too loose then borrowers may be stripped of the equity in their homes by unscrupulous lending practices the unnecessary loss of equity caused by points fees or rates that make loan more expensive than what borrower should qualify for considering the borrowers financial and other relevant characteristics is detrimental to borrowers it can be especially harmful to lowincome subprime borrowers who have little savings other than the equity in their home for more information about predatory lending see crs report rl34259 predatory lending primer the home ownership and equity protection act hoep

more affordable fixedrate loans in order to limit the number of mortgages going into default and reduce the number of homes for sale in an already saturated market 23 to qualify for hope now at least six conditions must be met 1 borrowers must reside in the residences covered by the mortgage 2 borrowers must be current with their mortgage payments 3 the loans must have been taken out between

some overextended borrowers or those facing interest rate resets have had difficulty refinancing their loans on better terms in part because of lack of liquidity in the private market fannie mae and

loans that the gses may purchase as well as the dollar value of individual mortgages that are available for purchase the latter limit is referred to as the conforming loan limit in addition to the need for liquidity another issue is protection for lenders the federal housing administration fha loan insurance program insures lenders against loss from loan defaults by borrowers through fha insurance lenders make loans that otherwise may not be available to borrowers under current law like that for the gs fha is limited in the total value of loans that it may insure as well as the dollar value of individual mortgages that may be insured the 110 th congress has enacted legislation to increase the purchasing power of the gses to raise conforming loan limits and to increase the number

broad regulatory authority over the gses it has the responsibility to review and to approve new types of mortgages it can take over and reorganize an insolvent fannie mae or freddie mac and it has greater authority to set capital requirements for the housing gses the fhfa can also require the gses to dispose of assets and limit their portfolio sizes in addition the fhfa has the authority to reduce the number of federal home loan banks under previous law there had to be at least eight fhlbs the banks can merge and reduce the number from twelve if one or more is in financial difficulty under pl 110289 however the fhfa can reduce this number below eight another change is that the conforming loan limits will increase to reflect the annual change in housing price index maintained by fhfa the limit cannot decline and decreases will be banked and used against later increases in highcost housing areas defined as areas where the median home price exceeds the conforming loan limit the limit is increased to the lesser of 115 of area median or 150 of the national conforming loan limit for example using 2008s conforming loan limit of 417000 the maximum highcost limit would be 625500

affordable housing remains beyond the reach of many however according to the harvard joint center for housing studies in 2006 approximately 81 million lowincome renter households were severely cost burdened paying more than 50 of their income toward housing an increase of over one million from 2001 and an increase from 189 of all renter households to 22159 although moderate income renters were not immune from severe rent burdens lowincome renters faced the greatest burdens over 91 of severely cost burdened renters were in the bottom quartile of the income distribution 60 further hud in its most recent report on worst case housing needs found that 599 million unassisted very lowincome renters either paid more than half their income in rent or lived in severely substandard housing in 2005 representing 550 of all households61 this was an increase from 501 million renters in 2001 476 of all households62 the federal governments role in addressing worstcase housing needs is increasingly in

years both by the efforts of the administration and congress to contain discretionary spending and by concerns internal to the hud budget in his fy2009 budget th president has proposed to hold the growth in nondefense discretionary spending to less than 1 in the coming year and to keep discretionary spending below the rate of inflation 63 the majority of the hud budget is discretionary funding and the president requested large cuts for several programs in fy2009 including housing for the elderly and persons with disabilities and the community development block grant however the presidents fy2008 budget recommended similar cuts to housing programs and congress appropriated over 2 billion more than was recommended by the president for fy2008 for more information about fy2009 hud funding see crs report rl34504 the department of housing and urban development fy2009 appropriations by maggie mccarty et within the hud budget the cost of the section 8 voucher programwhich accounts for over third of the total hud budgetgenerally requires increased funding to serve the same number of people each fiscal year the program is partially pegged to housing costs which have risen faster than inflation in recent years since huds overa ll budget has been constrained any increases in funding for the voucher program have come at the expense of other programs another internal hud budget pressure involves the contribution of the fha insurance progra m fha collects fees from participants and excess fees are used by congress to offset the cost of the hud budget fhas market share has

secretary of hud alphonso jackson the letter noted several allegations made against the secretary and the department for inappropriate contracting practices the letter stated that despite four separate allegations of impropriety as well as damning testimony by senior staff to the hud inspector general regarding secretary jackson inappropriately advising senior staff to take political affiliation into account in awarding contracts the secretary refused to answer legitimate congressional inquiries about his conduct and the use of taxpayer funds at the department the senators argued

in the program and providing the public housing authorities phas that administer the program with more flexibility it is generally agreed by the administration low income housing advocates and pha industry groups that the voucher program is too complex and administratively burdensome however the administration lowincome housing advocates and pha industry groups do not necessarily agree about the best way to reduce that complexity without compromising the level of assistance provided to lowincome tenants in the 109 th congress bipartisan section 8 voucher reform bill was approved by the house but not enacted before the end of the congress hr 5443 similar bill the section 8 v oucher reform act of 2007 hr 1851 was introduced in the 110th congress the bipartisan bill is sponsored by chairwoman maxine waters of the house financial services committee subcommittee on housing and community opportuni ty the bill would change the way income is calculated for the purposes of eligibility and rentsetting for the voucher program as well as public housing and projectbased section 8 and adopt new method for allocating voucher funds among other changes on may 25 2007 the house financial

operating funds to public housing authorities under the new formula some phas eligibility for funding increased and others decreased those increases and decreases are phased in over two and five years respectively however any funding increases will be reduced and any funding decreases will be further deepened if the appropriations provided by congress are not sufficient to fund all phas at their full eligibility levels operating funds make up the difference between what tenants pay in rent and the cost of running public housing the amount pha receives is base d on set of allowable expenses set by hud phas calculate their budgets by totaling up the allowable expenses for all of their units and subtracting the amount they receive in tenant rents hud then adds together all of the agencies budgets and compares the total to the amount cong ress appropriated for the operating fund that year typically congress appropriates less than the full amount that phas qualify for under the formula so hud applies an acrosstheboard cut to agencies budgets called proration the 2008 proration is estimated to be 84 meaning that agencies will receive 84 of their budgets the new funding formula for fy2007 established by hud through regulation with input from pha industry groups adopted new allowable expense levels it also required phas to adopt

fy2011 some agencies qualify for higher budget under the new allowable expense levels and others face reductions although both increases and decreases will be phased in those that face decrease can transition to assetbased management sooner to help limit their losses however the magnitude of gains and losses under the new formula will depend on how much is appropriated for the operating fund and

management by 2011 historically phas had been permitted to centrally manage their public housing stock meaning pha could receive funding budget and provide services for all of their units in the same way on portfoliowide basis under asset based management phas will receive funding and will be required to budget for their units on projectbyproject basis phas will still maintain central offices however under the new funding formula the central office will not receive f unding directly from hud instead central office funding will come from fees charged by the central office to individual properties for the services the central office provides as noted earlier phas that are slated to lose funding under the new operating fund rule can convert to assetbased management before the 2011 deadline in order to limit their losses in order for phas to limit their losses in 2009 they must prove that they have converted to assetbased management by the deadline set by hud small phas defined by hud as those managing 250 or fewer units are not required to convert to assetbased management unless they wish to stop their losses there has been some controversy surrounding how phas demonstrate that they have successfully converted to assetbased management in order to stop their losses hud published preliminary guidance in september 2006 69 pha industry groups have argued that huds guidance is overly prescriptiveparticularly the guidance related to funding for the central officeand have lobbied for hud to make modifications70 specifically industry groups have opposed guidance related to

preservation and resident homeownership act lihprha as part of the cranstongonzalez national affordable housing act pl 101625 the program created incentives for building owners to continue offering

either the rent levels of comparable unassisted properties in buildings area or on area fair market rent levels as determined by hud marktomarket allows those owners with above market rents to renew their rental assistance contracts with hud although at lower rate while also restructuring their outstanding debt on the property the program is designed both to ensure that hud pays reasonable market rents for subsidized properties and to provide incentives for owners of assisted properties to renew their contracts with hud marktomarket allows rents on up to 5 of units eligible for the program to be set at levels that exceed market rents as long as they do not exceed 120 of market rent the fy2007 yearlong continuing resolution pl 110 5 extended the marktomarket program through the end of

waters introduced nearly identical bill but with additional provisions the new bill the marktomarket extension and enhancement act hr 3965 was approved by the house financial services committee on october 31 2007 hr 3965 would extend the marktomarket program until the end of fy2012 and would make eligible for the program certain properties where rent is not considered abovemarket as long as the hud secretary determines that debt restructuring is necessary to preserve the property the bill would also allow the secretary to waive the requirement that rent levels be above market for properties in federally declared disaster areas as long as uninsured damage is likely to exceed 5000 per unit in addition the bill would increase the cap on the percentage of units eligible to restructure rents to levels above market rents from 5 to 9 and would waive the cap in disaster areas it would also permit certain nonprofit owne rs to participate in mortgage restructuring another provision of hr 3965 would apply to late section 8 payments from hud to property owners the bill would require hud to alert owne rs at least 10 days before the section 8 payment due date if it anticipates that payment will be late if section 8 payment is more than 30 days late hud would be required to pay interest to the building owner an amendment adopted at the markup of hr 3965 would make changes to the marktomarket provisions that encourage resident involvement in the preser vation and improvement of their lowincome housing developments as amended hr 3965 would authorize not less than 10 million for

assistan ce legislation has been introduced that would address aspects of refinancing section 202 projects in order to maintain their affordability and prevent physical deterioration two similar bills both entitled the section 2 02 supportive housing for the elderly act hr 2930 and s 2736 have been introduced in the 110 th congress on december 5 2007 hr 2930 was approved by the house both bills would expand the circumstances under which building owner may refinance section 202 loan under current law section 202 loan may only be refinanced if the new loan has lower interest rate hr 2930 and s 2736 would expand circumstances in which loan may be refinanced to include cases in which the proceeds from the new loan are used to address the projects physical needs the rent charged to tenants does not change and the cost of any section 8 contract is not increased this expansion would make it possible for older section 202 developments many of which have loans with interest rates of 3 to refinance their loans and use the proceeds to make improvements to the property the two bills would also expand the ways in which project owners may use proceeds from refinanced loans funds could be used to provide supportive services without limitation current law limits 15 of funds for this use for payment of developers fees and for equity returns to nonprofit sellers

and s 2736 would limit huds ability to put conditions on the amount of proceeds that section 202 owners may realize from sale or refinancing or the way in which owners use the proceeds hud would only be able to impose conditions on the amount or use of proceeds if there were an existing contract between hud and the project owner that authorized such conditions to be imposed for more information on

delegated processing of section 202 capital grants to state housing finance agencies hfas was included in pl 110289 the housing and economic recovery act of 2008 which was enacted on july 30 2008 under this provision those grantee organizations that are aw arded section 202 capital grants and that also intend to use low income housing tax credits to develop their properties may have their state hfa review and process the capital grant instead of hud because hfas are the agencies that administer tax credits delegating the processing of the section 202 capital grant to the hfa together with the tax credit is thought to be more efficient as part of the delegated processing established in pl 110289 hfas may recommend project rental assistance in excess of the amount awarded by hud

americans by separating native american programs from the public housing program and by eliminating several separate programs of assistance and replacing them with single block grant program in addition to simplifying the process of providing housin g assistance the purpose of nahasda was to provide federal assistance for indian tribes in manner that recognizes the right of indian self determination and tribal selfgovernance nahasda provides block grants to indian tribes or their tribally designated housing entities tdhe for affordable housing activities the tribe must submit an indian housing plan ihp with long and shortterm goals and proposed activities which is reviewed by hud for compliance with statutory and regulatory requirements funding is provided under needsbased formula which was developed pursuant to negotiated rulemaking tribes and tdhes can leverage funds within certain limits by using future grants as collateral to issue obligations under guaranteed loan program the house and senate passed different versions of the native american housing assistance and selfdetermination reauthorization act of 2007 on september 6 2007 and may 22 2008 respectively both chambers passed an amended version of the house bill hr 2786 in late september 2008 on october 14 2008 the president signed the native american housing assistance and selfdetermination reauthoriz ation act of 2008 pl 110411 the law reauthorizes nahasda through 2013 and ma kes some changes to its programs pl 110411 strengthens language in the congressional findings of nahasda requiring that the federal government shall provide housing assistance and shall provide assistance in manner that recognizes indian selfdetermination and tribal selfgovernment the previous language stated that the government should pursue these objectives the law also redefines the term housingrelated community development to include any facility or infrastructure that is owned by an indian tribe or tribally designated housing entity tdhe that is necessary for the provision of housing in an indian area and that would make housing more affordable accessible or practical in an indian area the expanded definition will allow tribes to construct buildings directly related to the provision of housing that contribute to sustainable communities such as community centers laundromats and daycare centers

tribal communities program which allows tribal communities to use up to 20 of their annual grant amounts up to maximum of 2 million for housing activities that are wholly selfdetermined by the indian tribe and that are related to the construction acquisition or rehabilitation of housing or related infrastructure this program is meant to increase tribal selfdetermination of housing activities by allowing tribes to engage in certain housing activities without direct hud oversight the secretary is directed to conduct review of the program and report on the programs effectiveness in cy2011 pl 110411 also establishes new demonstration program that extends the existing loan guarantee program which provides guarantees for loans used to support affordable housing activities under the demonstration program the secretary is authorized to also guarantee loans for community or economic development activities for limited number of indian tribes or tdhes as long as 70 of the amount received by tribe as result of guarantee is used to support activities that benefit lowincome families the law authorizes appropriations for the demonstration program through 2013 the law also places limits on the aggregate amount that the secretary can guarantee and requires the secretary to submit report on the program after four years the law prohibits the use of nahasda funds to benefit unauthorized aliens as defined by the immigration and nationality act and it prohi bits the distribution of nahasda funds to the cherokee nation as long as its dispute with cherokee freedmen over freedmens rights is ongoing 85 cherokee freedmen claim to be direct desc endants of former cherokee slaves or free blacks who were made citizens of the cherokee nation in the 19th century this prohibition will not be in effect as long as temporary injunc tion issued by the district court of the cherokee nation on may 14 2007 remains in effect or if the cherokees and the cherokee freedman reach an agreement that ends the ongoing litigation pl 110411 also clarifies nahasdas relationship to other housing programs it specifies that income from developers fees for projects using lowincome housing tax credits lihtcs will not be counted as program income for projects funded by indian housing block grants ihbgs and it explicitly states that indian tribes or tdhes are eligible to receive home funds from the participating jurisdictions in which they reside86 the law also includes provisions that streamline tribes reporting requirements most notably by eliminating the fiveyear housing plan and revising the requirements for the oneyear housing plan as well as provisions that reduce the tribes administrative burden pl 110411 also clarifies the definition of lowincome housing units for the purposes of the formula used for distributing block grants and specifies that the requirement that housing unit remain affordable for its useful life does not apply to families or households who subsequently take ownership of homeownership unit 85 for more information about this issue see crs report rl34321 the cherokee freedmen dispute legal background analysis and proposed legislation

qualified projects sponsors or velopers of real estate projects apply to the corresponding state housing finance authority for lihtc allocations for their projects developers either use the credits or sell them to investors to raise capital or equity for real estate projects the tax benefit reduces the debt or equity that the developer would otherwise have to incur with lower financing costs tax credit properties can potentially offer lower more affordable rents for more information on the lihtc program see crs report rs22389 an introduction to the design of the lowincome housing tax credit by mark p keightley in order to be eligible for the lihtc properties are required to meet certain tests that restrict both the amount of rent that is assessed to tenants and the income of eligible tenants the income test for qualified lowincome housing project re quires that the project owner irrevocably elect one of two income level tests either 2050 test or 4060 test in order to satisfy the first test at least 20 of the units must be occupied by individuals with income of 50 or less of the areas median gross income adjusted for family size to satisfy the second test at least 40 of the units must be occupied by individuals with income of 60 or less of the areas median gross income adjusted for family size 87 qualified lowincome housing project must also meet the gross rents test by ensuring rents do not exceed 30 of the elected 50 or 60 of area median gross income depending on which income test the project elected88 the nature of the lowincome project determines the credit rate that it may be awarded rehabilitation and federally subsidized projects are eligible to receive what is generally referred to as the 4 credit new construction is eligible for the 9 credit references to the 4 credit and 9 credit are perhaps misleading because they imply that these rates are fixed and certain in actuality the credit rates awarded vary each month so that the present value of the effective subsidy as fraction of projects cost is equal to either 30 or 70 depending on whether the building is rehabilitated or new construction for more information about tax credit rates see crs report rs22917 the lowincome housing tax credit program the fixed subsidy and variable rate by mark p keightley the credit rate is then multiplied by the projects qualified basis to determine the

lowincome tenants buildings located in qualified census tracts or difficult to develop areas are eligible for an enhanced eligible basis the housing and economic recovery act of 2008 pl 110289 the enacted version of hr 3221 contains several provisions relating to the lihtc program specifically the act increases the per capita tax credit allocation to states by 020 for calender years 2008 and 2009 the proposed tax credit allocation is in addition to the annual inflation adjustment the act also changes the method used to determine the applicable credit rate for new construction projects newly constructed buildings will temporarily receive minimum credit rate not less than 9 if placed in service before december 31 2013 the current method for determining the credit rate for rehabilitated and federally subsidized projects was left unchanged by the act however pl 110289 changed the definition of facilities that are federally subsidized to exclude those that receive belowmarket federal loans federal subsidy with respect to lowincome housing projects now only includes obligations the interest of which is tax exempt in addition states are permitted to designate certain buildings as being in difficult to develop areas and thus eligible for an enhanced eligible basis which increases the effective subsidy the building can receive pl 110289 also eliminates the prior restriction placed on buildings developed using funds from huds section 8 moderate rehabilitation program that had prohibited them from receiving lihtcs

the emergency shelter grants esg program distributes funds to communities through formula allocation and they in turn may use the funds for the renovation major rehabilitation or conversion of buildings into emergency shelters grantees may also use funds to provide services to homeless individuals and for homelessness prevention activities although not more than 30 of funds may be used for either of these purposes the grants for the other three homeless assistance grant programs are awarded competitively through huds continuum of care coc system these programs are the supportive housing program shp shelter plus care sc program and the section 8 moderate rehabilitation assistance for singleroom occupancy dwellings sro program unlike the esg program the three competitive grant programs focus on transitional and permanent supportive housing for homeless people for more information on the homeless assistance grants see crs report rl33764 the hud homeless assistance grants distribution of funds by libby perl in the 110 th congress several bills have been introduced that would reauthorize the housing programs of mckinneyvento the homeless em ergency assistance and rapid transition to housing hearth act of 2007 hr 840 wa s introduced on february 6 2007 and the community partnership to end homelessness act of 2007 s 1518 was introduced on may 24 2007 on september 19 2007 the senate banking housing and urban affairs committee unanimously approved s 1518 and on july 31 2008 the house financial services committee approved hr 840 many of the differences between the two bills as introduced were resolved when the house financial services committee marked up hr 840 then on september 29 2008 another bill hr 7221 also called the hearth act was introduced in the house on october 2 2008 the house passed hr 7221 the new hearth act further resolved differences with s 1518 though some differences remain

competitive homeless assistance grants sc shp and sro into one consolidated grant called the continuum of care program in hr 7221 and the community homeless assistance program in s 1518 the president has also urged the consolidation of these three programs in his last seven budgets the two bills would also codify the system through which the funds are distributed retaining many aspects of the current continuum of care system the two bills would reauthorize the homeless assistance grants for different periods of time and at different funding levels however s 1518 would authorize the grants at 22 billion for fy2008 and for such sums as necessary from fy2009 through fy2012 while hr 7221 would authorize them at 3 billion in fy2009 and such sums as necessary for fy2010 both hr 7221 and s 1518 would provide funds to renew permanent housing contracts through the section 8 program rather than through the funds made available for the homeless assistance grants both bills propose to expand the definition of homeless individual under the current definition homeless individual is one who lacks fixed regular and adequate nighttime residence and who resides in temporary shelter including transitional housing for the mentally ill an institution with qualifications or place not designed for human habitation s 1518 would expand the definition of homeless individual to include individuals and families who are sharing housing but those doubledup households must also 1 lack the resources to pay for decent and safe housing 2 only be permitted to remain in the shared housing for short period of time 3 have moved three or more times in the past year or at least two times within the last 21 days and 4 not be able to make significant financial contribution toward the shared housing s 1518 would also include among homeless individuals those persons residing in hotel or motel with the same reservations as those sharing housing however in addition s 1518 would change the definition of chronically homeless to include families with an adult member who has disability currently only unaccompanied individuals are included the definition would also include persons released from institutions as long as prior to entering the institution they otherwise met the definition of chronically homeless and had been institutionalized for fewer than 90 days hr 7221 would similarly change the definition of chronically homeless initially the first version of the hearth act introduced in the house hr 840 would have expanded the definition of homeless individual to include persons who are sharing housing due to economic hardship those living in hotels motels or campgrounds due to lack of alternative accommodations and those living in substandard housing however the definition in the most recent version of the hearth act hr 7221 wa s revised and is now similar to that in s 1518 though differences remain person or family would be considered homeless under the definition in hr 7221 if they will imminently lose their housing if they have other place to go and if they lack resources to obtain other housing imminent loss of housing would be evidenced by an eviction requiring an individual or family to leave their housing within 14 days lack of resources allowing an individual or family to remain in hotel for more than 14 days or credible evidence that an individual or family will not be able to stay with another homeowner or renter for more than 14 days the bill would also consider homeless anyone who is fleeing situation of domestic violence or other lifethreatening condition in addition hr 7221 would allow communities to serve families with children or unaccompanied youth who are defined as homeless under other federal programs under certain circumstances for example the education for homeless children and youth program head start and the runaway and homeless youth program these circumstances would include situations where unaccompanied youth or families with children had experienced longterm period without permanent housing had experienced instability due to frequent moves and can be expected to remain unstably housed due to chronic disabilities chronic physical health or mental health conditions substance addiction histories of

with disability or multiple barriers to employment both s 1518 and hr 7221 would allow more funds to be used for homelessness prevention activities under current law only esg funds can be used to prevent homelessness the other three homeless assistance grants cannot be used for prevention both hr 7221 and s 1518 would allocate 20 of funds made available by congress for the homeless assistance grants to the newly named emergency solutions grants prog ram of those funds available to the new esg program both bills would ensure that at least 40 would be available for activities such as rental assistance and housing relocation for persons at risk of homelessness s 1518 and hr 7221 would also create separate process for rural communities to apply for the competitive homeless assistance grants the two bills would allow grantees in rural communities to apply separately for funds that would otherwise be awarded as part of the consolidated community homeless assistance program s 1518 or the continuum of care program hr 7221 in addition unlike current law rural communities would be able to serve persons who do not meet huds definition of homeless individual s 1518 provides that hud may award grants for the costs of assisting those in the worst housing situations in their geographic area those in imminent danger of losing housing and the lowestincome residents in the community similarly hr 7221 would allow rural communities to assist those at risk of homelessness those in imminent danger of losing housing and the lowestincome residents in the community the house bill defines at risk of homelessness to include those households with incomes below 30 of area median income without resources to attain housing stability and that have moved frequently for economic reasons these economic reasons are enumerated in the bill g5g20g21g561g20g142g153g152g155g157g156g561g152g151g561g10g152g158g156g146g151g144g561 in general crs report rl34591 overview of federal
