uninsured and other patients who generate uncompensated care costs it will also obtain additional federal medicaid and schip do llars using new state gene ral fund appropriations and revenues from employers that do not offer hea lth insurance another significant source of funding while not necessarily flowing through state coffers is the mandate that requires individuals to purchase insurance or face financial penaltie s over time the state expects to redirect additional funds from uncompensated care reimbursement to other uses eg premium subsidies as its uninsured rate declines however the legislation continues to provi significant support for hos pitals and other providers this report highlights major elements of the massachusetts legislation and raises issues that congress and other observers may consider as details of the states health reform plan are worked out during imp lementation it will not be updated background the states low uninsured rate and its ability to redirect and augment existing financial resources were two key factors working in favor of the recently passed massachusetts health reform legislation input and support from across the political spectrum also played an important rolehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22447crs2 1 crs report 96979 health insurance uninsured by state 2004 by chris l peterson 2 providers may incur uncompensated costs when they provide free care to the uninsured but also when they treat insured patients whose coverage excludes certain services or provides reimbursement below the actual cost of care frequent complaint

for married couples if the pe rsonal exemption did not apply the maximum increase in tax liability would be 189 for single person and 379 for couple some state or federal tax provisions could reduce this liability beginning with tax year 2008 an additional penalty will be levied for each month an individual is without insurance equal to 50 of the lowest premium for whic h he or she would have qualified it will be collected through withholding of state income tax refunds if refund is due or the penalty exceeds the refund amount the state w ill notify the taxpayer and may use existing state income tax enforcement and collection procedures to obtain the balance owed employers to help finance the legislati on some employers that do not offer insurance will pay fees to the state if an employer with more than 10 employees does not offer group health insurance plan to wh ich it makes fair nd reasonable premium contribution to be defined in regulation it will pay fair share employer contribution of more than 295 per employee per year if employees or their dependents incur 50000 or more in free care costs paid by the state in any given year separate free rider surcharge of between

144 million in fy2007 using new state general fund appr opriations 125 million and re venues from employers that do not offer health insurance at least 45 million9 another significant source of funding while not necessarily flowing through state coffers will be insurance premiums paid by those who comply with the individual mandate and financial penalties paid by those who do not issues to consider in any health insurance system including the one that massachus etts has planned for itself there are two overarching tradeoffs the first is between benefits and costs more generous coverage entails higher costs wh ich must be borne by someone the second is among participants who share the costs insurers providers employers families and individuals government and taxpayers the massachusetts gislation provides framework for achieving nearuniversal health insurance coverage that attempts to balance these tradeoffs it also leaves many important details to be worked out during implementation the remainder of this report discusses some of the issues massachusetts will face as it continues to address tradeoffs in its health reform plan individual affordability since many people will be required to purchase health insurance key question is how much pre miums will cost in 2005 the median total annual small group premium was 4380 for an individual and 11400 for family in massachusetts for single person maki ng 29400 per year 300 fpl the median premium represents almost 15 of gross income for family of four making 60000 300 fpl it represents 19 premiums ma represent smaller percentage of income if they are paid on pretax basis since the tax savings in effect reduce the cost if lower cost health insurance plans are not available some people could be exempted from the individual mandate under the c onnectors affordability schedul others who purchasehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22447crs6 plans that offer lower premiums in exchange for high deductibles or other significant cost sharing requirements may find it difficult to pay for care state cost premium costs are also concern for the state because it will be providing subsidies for individuals at or below 300 fpl via the commonwealth care program since it has an ongoing rela tionship with the medicaid managed care organizations that have been given exclusive rights to the programs subsidies until june 2009 initial premium costs may not be major issue howe ver if more people qualify for subsidies than anticipated or plan premiums are higher than expected state costs could increase as safety valve the legislation allows for cap on commonwealth care enrollment however this could leave some individuals unable to afford insurance another issue for the state is that its federal medicaid fundi ng is capped under its medicaid waiver if program costs surpass fixed budget ceiling the state must fund the excess with stateonly dollars or cap enrollme nt in recent waiver documents the state estimates that its health reform legislati on leaves approximately 12 million in room below its medicaid budget ceiling over the next two years subsidy design the design of sliding scale premium subsidies for the commonwealth care program will affect both individual affordability and state cost presumably consideration will be given to how the subsidies interact with the affordability scale set by the board of the connector for example if the board determines that an affordable policy fo r single person at 200 fpl 19600 s hould cost more than 10 of income subsidy might be set to equal the difference between 10 1960 and the lowest pr emium available to the individual if the gap between affordable and actual premiums is large subsidy costs for the state could be high employer coverage there are number of provisions in the massachusetts legislation that are designed to prevent employers from dropping coverage or offering different health plans to different worker s and to prevent individuals from dropping private coverage in favor of public however state officials have noted that creative behavior down the road may require additional policy chan ges to discourage erosion of the employer market federal perspective as discussed earlier alt hough massachusetts expects to obtain additional medicaid dollars to help fi nance the legislation federal funding will not exceed cap agreed to under the stat medicaid waiver the state w ill also rely on schip another capped funding source to date the federal gove rnment has assisted massachusetts and other states that have exhausted their federal schip funds by redistributing unspent funds fro m other states and more recen tly providing an additional appropriation less straight forward federal and state cost of the massachusetts legislation may come in the form of forg one tax revenue becau employers will be required to set up cafeteria plans that allow health insurance premiums to be paid on pretax basis income and payroll tax receipts may be reduced aside from the issue of financing there are other ways in which federal legislation could have an impact on the states health reform efforts for example bills such as s 2510 and s 1955 which contain reforms intende d to improve access to health insurance for small businesses eg new purchasing rrangements federal st andards for benefit coverage might require the state to rethink major elements of its legislation
