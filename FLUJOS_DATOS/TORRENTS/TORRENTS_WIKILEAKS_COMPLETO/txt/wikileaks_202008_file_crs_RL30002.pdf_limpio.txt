on the u s defense budget the report defines basic defense budgetrelated terms describes the structure of the defense budget briefly reviews the budget planning process within the depart ment of defense dod outlines in some detail the successive phases of the congressional defense budge t process and provides short review of budget execution the defense budget is not single document or product but more series f spending commitments that can be measured and broken down in number f different ways it can be defined first of all in terms of budget authority obligations and outlays congress provides most of dods funds in t he form of budget authority agencies may then obligate the funds and outlays occur as paychecks are issued or progress payments are made on contracts the defense budget can also be defined broadly as the national defense budget function or more narrowly as th department of defense budget the st ructure of the defense budget as considered in congress differs significantly from the structure of the budget as it is formulated by the department of defense the defense budget process has three main phases the first phase is preparation of budget request by the executive branch the department of defense s develop ed sophisticated mechanism known as the planning programming an d budgeting system pbs for formulating longterm budget plans and preparin g annual budget requests to the congress the white house office of management and budget omb is involved in the pbs process and formally submits the defens budget request to congress on behalf of the president the second part of the process is congressional considerati on the basic process has three phases the budget resolution the defense authorization bill and defense related appropriations bills the annual budget resolution establishes targets fo r defense budget authority and outlays but the mechanism for enforcing the target s allows considerable flexibility to appropria tors the authorization and appropriations bills approve the defense budget at similar levels of detail though only th appropriations process actually provides budget authority to agencies congres s frequently provides additional funds to the department of defense throug h supplemental appropriations bills which may or may not be acco mpanied by offsetting rescissions of previously appropriated funds the final part of the process is the budget execution stage after budge t authority is provided by congress the dod may obligate funds to acquire goods and services the pace at which funds are made available for obligation is governed i n part by process of allocations overseen by omb congress allows dod som flexibility to reallocate appropriated funds under process known as reprogramminghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30002contents introduction 1 chapter 1 basic defense budget terminology and concepts 2 snapshot of the defense budget process 2 national defense budget function

supersedes those earlier versions this report is not however source of uptodate defense budget estimates which ar e2 provided in other crs and us government publications see appendix d for bibliography nor does this report provide an analysis of substantive issues in the defense budget debate such as the appropriate level of total funding or priorities among specifi c weapon systems it is rather guide to the defense budget processa defense budget primer1 introduction under the constitution congress is responsible for raising and supporting the armed forces of the ited states the congress fulfills this responsibility in large part through reviewing and enacting annual defense budgets the programs funded by the defense budget directly affect the ability of us armed forces to defend the country and protect national interests the defense budget also has significant domestic impact the size an d composition of the defense budget may affect the health of the economy and the level of defense spending is often major issue in debate over national priorities both the defense budget itself and the process of congressional review an d approval are complex even observers who regularly track the defense budget may occasionally be baffled by defense budget terminology and procedures this report is primer for those who wish to familiarize themselves with th defense budget process the report defines basic defense budgetrelated terms 2 describes the structure of the defense budget briefly reviews the budgeting process within the department of defense dod and outlines the successive phases of the congressional defense budget process it also provides short review of the budget execution process t he reader should be aware that there are sometimes differences between the way the defense budget process works in theory and how it works i n practice not all variations in procedures are addressed here the report is divided into three chapters the first two chapters describe th product the defense budget itself the first chapter defines basic defense budget terms and the second chapter describes the structure of the fense budget the third chapter desc ribes the defense budget process from the initial planning stage in dod through congressional action and budget execution finally appendices provid guides to some of the more important defense budget documents and glossary f key defense budget terms matrix labeled legislative history of the defens budget is also included on the last page of this report to aid the reader in tracking legislative action on the defense budget as it unfolds over the course of yearhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30002crs2 chapter 1 basic defense budget terminology and concepts snapshot of the defense budget process in its outlines the defense budget process is straightforward the process begins with formulation of an annual defense bud get request by the executive branch in the case of defense spending the budget request to the congress is formulated mainly by the department of defense u nder guidelines established by the president through the white house office of management and budget omb the request is formall submitted to congress by the president submission of the budget is followed by congressional action congres s provides funds for defense programs mainly by appropriating funds in annua l appropriations acts including the department of defense appropriations act th military construc tion appropriations act and other appropriations laws congress also authorizes defense programs through other legislation mainl an annual national defense authorization act the authorization process does not however provide money for defense programs instead it establishes th organizations responsible for defense sets policies and determines the conditions an d limitations under which these organizations may car ry on their activities annual authorization acts authorize the appropriation of funds but they do not actually provide the money the final step in the budget process is budget execution when congres s appropr iates money for defense programs it provides budget authority to government agencies agencies are prohibited mainly by the antideficiency act from spending funds above the amount of budget authority appropriated or fo r purposes other than those for which funds were provided in order to comply with these limitations federal government agencies follow financial procedures that ar governed by offici regulations key step in the process is when budget authority provided by congress is obligated an obligation occurs when for example n employee is hired or contract for goods and services is signed at the end of th process are budget outlays which occur when the government actually issue s payments to employees or to private parties this chapter reviews basic terms which will be impo rtant in following the budget process discussed in later chapters terms discussed in this chapter include th national defense budget function and the department of defense budget budge t authority outlays and obligations obligated unobligate d and unexpended funds and current and cons tant dollars the chapter closes with brief discussion of measures of the defense burden on the economy national defense budget function and department of defens budget the phrase defense budget is commonly used both in narrow and in broad sense in narrow sense the defense budget is the budget for the defense programs administered an d managed by the department of defense dod in broad sense funding f or defense encompasses not only dod programs but number of defense related activities administered by other federal agencies including 1 atomic energyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30002crs3 doe defense programs include development of nu clear warheads and naval nuclear reactors3 nuclear weapons safeguards and security development of some arms control treat verification systems production of nuclear materials for defense programs handling an d reprocessing of defense nuclear waste maintaining the nuclear stockpile and environmental cleanup of weapons production facilities the defense appropriat

draft registration an d preparations to resume the draft administered by the selective service system and 4 defenserelated activities of some other agencies including the coast guard the maritime administration and the federal bureau f investigation4 all of these activities are included in the national defense budget function one of 19 functions used by the office of management and budget omb to subdivide activities in the federal budget into related categories the national defense budget5 function identified by the numer ical notation 050 is further divided into three sub functions each of which is similarly identified by numerical notation 050 national defense budget function6 051 department of defense military dod programs only 053 atomic energy defense activities doe national

funded outside of the national defense budget function among the dod civil programs are civilia n construc tion projects of the army corps of engineers in budget function 301 operation of arlington national cemetery in budget function 705 operation of the us soldiers and airmens home in budget function 602 and small portion of wildlife conservation on military reservations in budget function 303 funding for these programs is not generally reported in dod budget totals and is not discussed in this report prior to fy1985 the dod budget included payments to military retirees i n fy1985 this practice c hanged and payments to retirees now are financed through trust fund in budget function 600 outside of the 050 national defense function therefo re actual payments from the trust fund to retirees are not charged to th defense budget the dod budget however does include amounts contributed to the military retirement trust fund to cover the actuarially determined costs

tq in budget documents the phrase defense budget usually refers to budget authority for defense programs while10 defense spending usually refers to outlays for defense programs the distinction is t always made however the following analogy may help to explain the difference between budget authority 11 obligations and outlays suppose parent decides to give money to child to purchase new automobile budget author ity is analogous to receiving authority from the parent to draw on the parents bank account to purchase the new automobile an obligation is incurred when the contract is signed with the automobile dealer for delivery of the vehicle the actua l writing of the check in payme nt for delivery of the automobile constitutes an outlay of fundstable 1 and all of the budget

previously the fiscal year ran from july 1 to june 30 9 there are two important things to notice about table 1 first the dollars shown represent budget authority the amount which congress provides when i t appropriates money for defense and all other federal government programs second the dollars shown are current do llars ie they are not adjusted to reflect the effects of inflation the following subsections discuss these and related concepts budget authority outlays and related terms the defense budget defined narrowly or broa dly can be measured in terms of budget authority or utlays budget authority ba is the authority provided by congress to the department of defense and other government agencies to enter into obligat ions for the provision of goods and services obligations are incurred b signing contracts placing orders hiring personnel mak ing loans or grants or the like see 31 usc 1501 outlays represent the actual expenditure of funds in payment for goods and services usually in the form of disbursement of cash check or an electronic fund transfer10 common misunderstanding is that the congressional authorization proces s provides budget authority and the appropriations process provides outlays in fact the authorization process authorizes the appropriation of budget authority an d appropriations bills provide budget authority congress does not act directly n outlays levels rather congress provides budget authority through th e11 appropriat ions process and outlays then occur as executive branch agencies execute their

billion while ba amounted to 2549 billion the difference of 19 billion is accounted for by ba13 from previous years transfers and offsetting receipts the process through which budget authority is provided by congress and leads to outlays involves several steps each covered by specific policies and laws almost all budget authority for defense programs is provided by annual appropriations 14 in appropriating funds congress grants dod the authority to incur obligations and provides the treasury t he authority to make payments for specified purposes thus as dod budget manual explains appropriations do not represent cash actually set aside in the treasury for purposes specified in the appropriations act but rather limitations of amounts which agencies may obligate during the time period specified in the respective appropriations acts15 when congress appropriates money for defense programs it generally provides all the cos ts of the activities approved up front in one fiscal year this practice i s known as full funding it was mandated by congress in the 1950s to give ful l visibility to the cost of weapons procured full funding means that all the mone estimated to be necessary to complete an entire project such as production of 21 trident missiles overhaul of an aircraft carrier or construction of an ammunitio n depot is approved at one time by the congress even though the actual work may span many years as an exception to this practice congress sometimes provides funding fo r advanc procurement of longleadtime weapons components such as nuclear power plants for navy warships there has been some congressional debate duringhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30002crs7 according to the department of defense advanced procurement is authority provided16 in an appropriations act t obligate and disburse during fiscal year before that in which the related end item is procured the funds are added to the budget authority for the fiscal year and deducte d from the budget authority of the succeeding year used in major acquisitio n programs for advance procurement of components whose longleadtime requires purchas early in order to reduce the overall procurement leadtime of the major end item advanc procurement of long lead components is an exception to the dod full funding policy financial management regulation volume 2a p 12 in 1970 dod began

compensation or wherefore art thou inflatio n dividend by aspin mimeo sep 3 1986 rep aspin concluded that the inflatio n dividend probably amounted to between 35 billion and 50 billion he also attempted t determine what happened to the excess funds he concluded that more than about 185 billion of these funds could be accounted for through reprogr ammings expired appropriations andor congressional funding cutbacks with some portion of the rest going to defens contractors in the form of excess payments the 1990 s about full funding especially for navy shipbuilding and number of ship programs have been only partially funded in annual appropriations measures 16 full funding does not guarantee that the project can be completed within th amount appropriated because costs may turn out t be higher than estimated due for example to an inflation rate higher than expected unforseen technical problems or subsequent design changes in the 1970s inflation consistently was higher than17 assumed in the budget estimates for purchases f weapons and fuel as result the18 services were often forced to buy fewer items than congress planned when defense appropriations were approved from 1982 to 1987 however inflation was less than projected resulting in what some commentators called an inflation dividend according to several estimates defense was overfunded by anywhere from 18 billion to over 50 billion for the fy198286 period in recent years inflation has again19 frequently been overestimated and inflation savings have sometimes been used as offsets for supplem ental appropriations or for congressional additions to the defense budget after budget authority is appropriated by congress it becomes available fo r obligation by the relevant agency funds are obligated when the agency signs contract with supplier or otherwise makes formal commitment to pay for goods and services appropriated funds must normally be obligated during the first fisca l year for which they are provided otherwise they expire appropriations bills typically make money for some defense activities available for obligation for more than on year the length of time for which funds are made av ailable for obligation is specifiedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30002crs8 note that these periods of availability are specified in each appropriations act every year20 for example the fy1999 defense appropriations act p l 105262 opens by saying that the following sums are appropriated out of any money in the treasury not otherwis appropriated for the fiscal year ending september 30 1999 and section 8003 specifie s that part of any appropriat ion in this act shall remain available for obligation beyond the current fiscal year unless expressly so provided herein exceptions to the oneyea r availabili ty of funds under this clause are specifically noted in the text of the law fo r example the section of the fy1999 defense appropriations act that provides funds for the aircraft procurement army account reads for construction procurement production modifi cation and modernization of aircraft 1388268000 to remain available fo r obligation until september 30 2001 appropriations bills typically make research an d development rd funds avail able for two years procurement funds with the exception of shipbuilding for three years and military construction funds for five years us

continuedin annual appropriations legislation for example t he navy has been given up to five years to sign contracts for shipbuilding projects funded by congress 20 after funds are obligated the department of defense will expend the funds only as progress payments on contracts come due or as paychecks are issued thes expenditures constitute outlays by the government some defense programs such as weapons procurement and military construction projects may take several years for contractor to complete so outlay s may occur only quite slowly over period of time as result of these and other factors the spendout r ate or the rate at which appropriated funds are convert ed to outlays varies with different programs for21 some activities such as military personnel and operation and maintenance om most of the money appropriated is spent in the first fiscal yea r for which it is provided dod estima tes that 94 percent of budget authority provided in fy1999 for military personnel and 75 percent of budget authority for om will be expended as outlays during the fiscal year for other ctivities such as procurement of complex weapons and military construction projects bot h of which take several years to complete only small amount of the appropriated funds is spent in the first fiscal year for which it is provided about 22 percent and 15 percent respectively of fy1999 funds th rest is spent in the years beyond the budget year or the outyears at rates that vary from program to program the relationship between budget authority and outlays is perennially n important factor s haping how congress acts on the defense budget in recent years defense budgets like other parts of the federal budget have been constrained by strict limits on outlays imposed in an effor t to meet deficit reduction targets the ability to control defense outlays however is circumscribed by the fact that large share f outlays in any one year actually results from budget authority provided in prior years thus only part of the defense budget measured in outlays is controlled b congress ional action on annual defense appropriations acts in fy1999 fo r22httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30002crs9 continued22 budget rescissions see below for discussion us department of defense financial summary tables department of defense budget23 for fiscal yea r 1999 feb 1998 table j congress can reduce outlays from budge t authority provided in prior years by rescinding funds but the use of rescissions to contro l outlays presents the same problems as cutting fu nds from the annual budget ie large cuts in budget authority for weapons procurement would produce only limited outlay savings in given year for thorough discussion of the issue see congressional budget office an analysis of24 continuedexample dod stimated that about 67 percent of outlays would result from budget authority provided in fy1999 appropriations acts the rest 33 percent woul d result from budget authority provided in prior years for further discussion e23 appendix spendout rates and defense budget reductions moreover because different parts of t he defense budget spend out at different rates congress must carefully manage the balance between fast spending and slow spending accounts when it makes adjustments to the defense request if congress is concerned about military readiness for example it may wish to add money for military pay raise to the military personnel accounts or increase funding for training in the operation and maintenance accounts because these accounts spend out very rapidly the effect would be large immediate increase in outlays as well as in budget authority if congress wants to trim other slower spending accounts to offset the increases problem arises it would require disproportionately large cut i n budget authority for weapons procurement to balance the outlay impact of relatively small increase in personnel or om the balance between budget authority an d outlays therefore is often major consideration in the defense budget process the relationship between budget authority and outlays has also affected th defense budget process in recent years simply because it is difficult to calculat precisely the outlay impact of new defense budget authority outlays in any give n year resulting from new budget authority and from budget authority provided in prior years must be projected based on historical experience because these numbers are estimates the office of management and budget omb and the congressiona l budget office cbo oft disagree on projected outlays in 1997 omb estimated that defense outlays in fy1998 would total 2594 billion if congress were t approve the administration request for 2653 billion in new budget authority fo r national defense in its assessment of the same administration plan cbo estimated that approval of the administr ation program would entail defense outlays in fy1998 of 2650 billion 56 billion higher the concurrent budget resolution that yea r resolved the issue by providing 2660 billion in national defense outlays enough to accommodate cbo scoring with room for an additional 26 billion in budge t authority the same problem however recurred in congressional action on th fy1999 budget this tim congress dealt with the problem by allowing collections from sales of navy sh ips to foreign nations to be counted against the overall defense budget and by instructing cbo to score outlay savings from changes in managin g dod revolving funds two exercises in accountancy designed to avoid painful cuts in defense programs24httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl300020 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 constant fy99 in billions 1980 1982 1984 1986 1988 1990 1992 1994 1996 1998 fiscal yearunobligated balancesunexpended balancescrs10

budget concepts related to budget authority and outlays are unobligated funds and unexpended funds unobligated funds refer to budget authority that has been appropriated by congress for specific programs but has not yet been obligated unexpended funds include both unobligated and obligated funds which have not yet been spent as outlays these tw concepts unobligated and unexpended funds represent intermediate points in the process tha t extends from the provision of budget authority to the creation of outlays discussed above appropriations creat unobligated budget authority then when contracts are signed or other financia l commitments are made the funds are obl igated but are still unexpended only when the funds are paid out by check or otherwise do the appropriated amounts result in outlays it is important to note that unexpended funds whether obligated or not can only be used for specific programs that have been congressionally approved unobligated and unexpended funds are normal by product of the obligation and expendi ture process unusually high unexpended and unobligated balances fo r particular programs however sometimes act as red flags for congressiona l appropriators overseeing military s pending appropriators may consider the inability to spend already appropriated funds in given area as sig n of problems in program and as an indication that reductions in the next years budget may be called for moreover amounts of unobligated and unexpended funds may increase if inflatio n rates decline or if the dollar rises relative to foreign currencies in countries where the us military operates in recent years appropriators have used unobligated fund s caused by economic changes as source of funds to offset supplemental defens appropriations see below for discussion of rescissions of appropriated funds trends in the tota l amount of unobligated an d unexpended balances hav sometimes been construe d as an indication of the

unexpended balances of funds gre w substantial ly in dod over the course of the military buildup of the 1980s at th time some analysts argued that the gro wth of these balances was evidence that dod was not efficiently spending the money appropriated by congress and that the rapid growth of funding for new weapons programs was unwarranted in recent years26 some members of congress have proposed measures to transfer portion f unobligated balances of dod funds to other nondefense purposes dod officials point out however that unobligated and unexpended balances of funds may grow for many reasons in general one would expect unobligated andor unexpended balances to grow 1 along with growth in the overall budget and 2 as the share of the budget devoted to procurem ent programs with relatively slow spend out rates increases in addition part of the growth in unexpended balances may be explained by lower than expected inflation rates which means that costs of various programs are lower than anticipated when funds were appropriated so not all th appropriated funds must be obli gated or expended finally changes in contracting27 practices mandated by congressionally init iated procurement reforms may lower rates of payments to contractors thereby adding to unexpended balances 28 current and constant dollars budget authority and outlays can be measured in either current dollars or constant dollars current or thenyear dollars measure the cost of goods an d services in terms of prices prevailing at the time of purchase constant dollar s measure th cost of goods and services in terms of prices in given constant year fixing the purchasing power of the do llar to given year eliminates changes in prices due to inflation in comparing budgets from year to year by

major weapon systems and other procurement items to give some indication of rela tive spending for people versus hardware in the armed forces the dod appropriations title for military personnel however covers only the cost of pay and benefits for uniformed military personnel funding for dod civilia n personnel is provided mo stly in the operation and maintenance account with smaller amounts

operating support costs and various other personnel support programs 50 readiness and moder nization major debate in recent years has revolved around the balance of funding between readiness and modernization as defined by dod readiness is the collective capability of the elements of the force to delive r outputs for which they were designed modernization is th technical sophistication of all the elements of the force re adiness and modernization are two of four pillars of military capability commonly defined by dod 51httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl300020 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 constant fy1999

traditional dod budget formats however called readiness and modern ization analysts frequently associate readiness with the om appropriations title and modernization with the procurement and r d titles this approach is imprecise however ma ny readinessrelated items are funded in the procurement title eg replenishment spares and ammunition for training more importantly much of om funding is for activities only indirectly related t readiness including base operations environmental cleanup financial managemen t and other overhead activities and many other support functions even with only rough asures available however certain trends stand out general trend is that the mode rnization part of the budget tends to vary much more than the readinessrelated part of the budget when total defense budgets ar growing modernization funding typically rises faster when total defense budgets are declining modernization funding plummets readinessrelated budget accounts in contrast hav grown at fairly steady modest pace relative to the size of the force with variations due to increases or cuts in the number of troops this trend has bee n especially striking in recen t years total budge t authority for nationa l defense declined by 36 i n real terms between peak f the reagan buildup i n fy1985 and fy1998 while weapons proc urement declined by 67 and m by just 17 over the sam period figure 6 illustrate s the trend this has kindle d an ongoing dispute abou t the adequacy of the clinto n administrations defens budget plans critics argu that tight budgets in the 1990s have led the administration to cut weapon s modernization too deeply to protect nearterm readiness low rates f modernization they contend will jeopardize the future rea diness of the force which depends on modern weaponry critics also believe that the industrial base needed to produce new weapons in the future is languishing for their part administration officials acknowledge that pro curement levels have been extremely low in recent years but they argue procurement holiday was acceptable first because the new weapons bought during the buildup of the 1980 s have only recently been delivered so the current force is very modern and second because the drawdown in the size of the force led to the retirem ent of older equipmenthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30002crs24 so that the av erage age of weapons in the field has declined weapons procurement funding must now begin to turn up they say and since the fall of 1995 the join t chiefs of staff have urged that procurement fun ding level of 60 billion be achieved by the end of the decade the dispute over the adequacy of longterm modernization funding has bee n accompa nied by debate about the adequacy of readinessrelated funding as well even with readiness related funding apparently being protected reports of shortfalls in training spare parts equipment repairs and real property maintenance have grown over time meanwhile t he department of defense had projected that om funding growth would level off in the future be cause of several efficiency measures including base closures that were approved in earli er years and ongoing efforts to reduce costs these expectatio ns have proven increasingly difficult to sustain and it now appears that the department of defense with white house support will propose substantial increases in planned budgets over the next few years in an effort to protect bot h readiness and modernizationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30002crs25 fourth stage in the budget process review and audit is sometimes identified

budget ie the budget that began to be prepared in mid1986 and that was submitted to congress in january 198758 as result dod now goes through the whole ppbs process only every other year an amended budget is submit ted for the second year of each cycle but this amendedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30002crs27 section 1203 of the national defense authorization act for fy1988 and fy1989 pl 10059 180 requires the secretary of defense to submit the fydp to congress by april 1 of each year since the fydp is working financial plan its evolution does not stop after it i s initially formulated the fydp is updated to reflect congressional changes in requeste d programs and other major and minor short and longterm adjustments the fydp is usually updated three times within each cyclebudget is prepared through more limited process that generally follows th procedures used in the budgeting part of the full ppbs exercise the ppbs process is designed not only to prepare budget for submission t congress but also as the principal mechanism through which the department f defense prepares its own internal longterm financial plan indeed the syste m produces not only an annual or biennial budget for congressional consideration but also longterm defense plan for the following four years when the budge t submission to congress covered onl one year ppbs produced fiveyear defense plan or fydp pronounced fiddip now with twoyear budget submitted to congress the longterm plan extends over sixyear period and is known as th future years defense plan ie still the fydp 59 as its name implies the ppbs process can be divided into the three distinc t phases of 1 planning 2 programming and 3 budgeting each of which produces specific product planning the planning phase of the ppbs process is designed to integrat assessments of potential military threats facing the country overall national strategy and defense policy ongoing defense plans and programs and projected financia l resources into an overall statement of policy the formal outcome of the process is the defense planning guidance dpg which provide s the basic rationale for dod programs and budgets in the next fydp the planning phase formally begins i n august yearandahalf before the next biennial budg et is scheduled to be submitted to congress even before this time civilian officials in the office of the secretary of defense osd as well as military officials i n each of the and especially on the joint staff ie operating under the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff are reviewing and commenting on the arlier dpg the joint chiefs of staff jcs also issue their own policy overview called the joint strateg ic planning document jspd which provides formal jcs recommendations to th secretary of defense on the dpg the dpg which i s prepared in the office of the undersecretary of defense for policy provides official guidance to the military services on the basic principles that they are to follow in preparing their own longterm budget plans programming the pro gramming phase of the ppbs process lasts from about february through july of the year before the budget goes to congress in this phase each milita ry service prepares program objective memorandum pom which details the specific forces and programs that the service proposes over the fyd p period to meet the military requirements identified in the dpg within the financia l limits that are mandated by the secretary of defense each service has its ow n process for preparing its pom and service procedures differ substantially from each other the service poms are reviewed by the defense resource planning boardhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30002crs28 in fact omb officials are involved in the ppbs process throughout omb staff wor k60 directly at the pentagon and participate in the pom review process as well as in the budget review the defense budget is unique in the extent to which omb is directly involve d throughout the budgeting process when it came into office in 1989 the bush administration proposed budget amendment61 revising the reagan budget request for fy1990 it also submitted minor though formal budget amendments for fy1991 and fy1992 when it was leaving office the bus h administr ation did not submit budget to congress so the clinton administration simpl submitted its own request the clinton administration has frequently submitted mino r defense budg et amendments such as an amendment to the fy1999 request asking congress to provide emergency funding for operations in bosnia formal budget amendments ar printed as house documentsdrpb highlevel group chaired by the deputy secretar of defense and including represent atives from organizations within osd and the joint chiefs the po m review proces s often involves vigorous back and forth debate with key issues being identifie d by drpb subgroups decided initially by the drpb appealed by th services and reviewed and decided again ultimately the drpb makes final decisions about service plans i n the form of program decision memoranda pdms that are officially approved and signed by the secretary of defense budgeting the budgeting phase of the ppbs process generally lasts fro m about august through late december primary responsibility for the budgetin g process lies with the office of the dod comptroller which draws on othe r organizations within osd for support and which wo rks closely with the white house office of management and budget omb in part the budget review is fairly60 technical exercise in which earlier budget allocations made in terms of progra m elements used in the fydp and the poms are restructured for submission t congre ss according to appropriations accounts the budget review also involve s preparation and approval of justification mat erial for submission to congress with the budget request and in some cases projectbyproject review to ensure tha t programs are suff iciently welljustified to secure congressional support as result the budget review is inherently policyoriented process and the services sometimes complain that decisions presumably made during the pom process are revisite d during the budget review the outcome of the budgeting phase is the fina l preparation of the dod budget request that is submitted through the white house to the congress even after the defense budget is submitted to congress th executive branch can revise its budget request major budget amendments are often submitted b incoming administrations to modify budgets p repared by their predecessors minor61 budget revisions in response to changing threat perceptions international events or the domestic political and economic situation may be submitted either formally r informally budget revisions can complicate the process of tracking congressional action on the budget because house and senate commi ttees reviewing the presidents proposals may actually be considering different

separate targets for spending within two broad categories of expenditures discretionary and mandatory discretionary funds must be appropriated each year mandatory also70 known as direct spending in contrast is established by standing law for program s like medicare and social security the amount spent for such programs therefore can be adjusted only if congress amends the underlying statutes

underlying recommended functional funding levels but these recommendations have binding effect actual decisions n defense funding priorities therefore are made only in the defense authorization and

considerable flexibility to th appropriations committees in allocating total discretionary spending see the discussion of the appropriations process below for an explanation of thi s point though the annual budget resolution does not do so in recent years congress has sometimes established more rigi d limits on defense discretionary spending as part of legislation implementing longterm white

third major step in the congressional defens budget process is the appropriations process which provides budget authority t fund defense and other discretionary programs each year congress acts on 1 3 regular appropriations bills each of which is initially approved by separat subcommi ttee of the appropriations committee in each house the bulk of national defense funding is provided in three appropriations bills 1 national securit housedefense senate 2 military construction and 3 energy and wate r development for department of energy defenserelated activities minor amounts of funding are provided in three other acts see table 9 the first formal step in the appropriations process is when the appropriation s committee in each house decides how much money will be allocated to eac h subcommittee while the concurrent budget resolution establishes targets for the national defense budget function these targets are only advisory under th congressional budget act the appropriations committees in each house hav flexibili ty to allocate total discretionary funding for defense and nondefens programs alike as they see fit if for example the annual budget resolutio n recommends 270 billion in new discretionary budget authority for the nationa l defense budget function and includes another 270 billion for various nondefens programs the total amount of discretionary funding 540 billion is available to the appropr iations committees to allocate among the subcommittees as appropriator s decide appropriators may decide to allocate only 265 billion to subcommittees for defense programs and 275 billion for domestic programs or vice versa section 302 of the congressional budget act establishes procedures throug h which budget resolution ceilings on spending are implemented in the appropriations process under section 302a the concurrent budget resolution make s allocations of funds to committees ction 302b requires that the appropriations committee in each house report how funds under its jurisdiction are then subdivided among the appropriations subcommittees these suballocations of funds to th appropriations subcommittees are therefore commonly referred to as the 302b allocations point of order may be raised in the house and senate against any82 appropriations bill or any amendment to an appropriations bill that would exceed the amounts provided in the 302b allocation it is important to note that the 302b httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30002crs38 table 9 fy1999 appropriations for national defense by act and programs contained in each act current year dollars

programs administered by the department of defense the energy an d water development subcommittee in each house chamber has jurisdiction ove r departmen t of energy defense activities these

proceed in the same manner as with the authorization acts under the congressional budget act cba as amended the hous appropriations committee is required to report all annual appropriations acts b june 10 and the house must complete action on them by june 30 these deadlines are rarely met the cba bars consideration of appropriations bills before th concurrent budget resolution is adopted under an exception however the house appropriations committee can proceed on may 15th in the past the senate s waived the requirement for concurren t budget resolution to permit consideration of individual

allocation of funds to th appropriations committee in lieu of the concurrent budget resolution there is formal deadline for final congressional action on appropriations though government agencies must shut d own nonessential operations if funding is not provided in some form either in regular appropriations bills or in one or more continuing resolutions by the beginning of the fiscal year on october 1 some particular characte ristics of defense appropriations acts are worth noting first the national defense budget function is made up almo st entirely of programs that require annual appropriations the exceptions are small amount of dod trust funds that are funded through permanent appropriations in the case of annua l84 appropriations congress must pass new appropriations acts every year to sustain program permanent appropriatio ns in contrast are usually made in substantive legislation and make funds available each year without new action by congress second congress does not formally specify in the language f the appropriations acts themselves levels of funding for every item in the defense budget instead for the most part defense appropriations acts appropriate lump sum for all th programs funded in given appropriations account although specific amounts may be appropriated for individual programs of particular concern to congress th

themselves do not specify fundi ng by line item committee reports on the defense appropriations acts do specify levels of funding at the line item level moreover the military departments provide detailed budget information on programs in justification material present ed to congress and if appropriations reports do not specifically change the request congress assumes that dod will carry out th programs as requested in st rict legal sense nothing requires dod to adhere either to the rec ommendations in congressional reports or to its own program budge t proposals in spending money appropriated by congress at the line item level failure to spend funds in accordance with the detailed justification material an d committee reports however could cause congress to lose confidence in the requests and might result in reduced appropriations or in line item appropriations acts as85 result dod procedures require officials to act in accordance with congressiona l intent as expressed in committee reports third characteristic is that the overall funding level in the annual defens appropria tions act is difficult to compare directly to the level in the annual defens authorization act one reason as noted earlier is that the defense authorization bill includes funding for activities financed in several different appropriations bill fo r example the defense appropriations bill does not include funding for militar construction and family housing which is provided in the military constructio n appropriations bill r does it include funding for department of energy defense related activities which is provided in the nergy and water appropriations bill also funds for the selective service system and for civil defense are provided in othe r appropriation s bills the defense authorization bill in contrast authorizes funds for all of these defenserelated activities the defense au thorization bill also takes account of offsetting receipts for sales of surplus equipment to the public and sales from the national defense stockpile for example while the defense appropriations bill does n ot moreover until fy1998 the annual defense authorization bill did not specifically authorize an amount of money for military personnel w hile the defense appropriations bill has always included such amounts the defense appropriations bill also provides funds for some othe r functions such as intelligence community management which the authorization bill does not address finally within the total the authorization and appropriations bills use somewha t different account structure the most significant difference is that th authorization bill includes defense health program funding within the operation and mainten ance account while the appropriations bill provides

supplemental appropriations requests are printed as house documents89 this provision was also interpreted to apply to operation desert storm90used mainly to provide funding for unanticipated expenses though there i s sometimes an argument about whether the requ irements should have been anticipated or not in 1991 and 1992 for example the congress approved supplementa l appropriations to provide funds for operation desert shielddesert storm ever year since then congress has provided some supplemental funding for th department of defense mainly to cover costs of unplanned military operation s abroad including operations in somalia haiti bosnia and the persian gulf supplemen tal funds have also frequently been provided to cover storm damage t defense facilities and equipment indeed funds for defense programs have ofte n been provided in supplemental appropriations measures that also include substantial amounts to respond to domestic disasters such as earthquake s and floods there also remain some vestiges of the older procedure cost of living adjustments fo r veterans benefits for example are annually approved as part of supplementa l appropriations bill still there is longer an expectation th at an annual supplemental will be considered as part of the regular yearly budget process generally supplemental funds are provided in response to administratio n request s and the administration frequently sends one or more packages f supplemental appropriati ons requests to congress for activities in the current year at the same time as it sends the regular bud get request for the next fiscal year to capitol hill congress often adds funding for unrequested items to the supplementa l89 appropria tions bills however and such must pass bills also often become vehicles for policy riders that may be controversial over the past few years procedures for acting on supplemental appropriations measures have been altered further by provisions of the budget enforcement ac t bea of 1990 as noted earlier the bea established enforceable caps on tota l discretionary spending and in some years it set separate caps on defense and other types of discretionary expenditures in order to allow for pplemental appropriations to respond to emergencies without requiring ffsetting rescissions the bea provided that the discretionary spending caps would be increased by amounts specificall designated as emergency appropriations by the president and congress the be also specifically provided that funding for operation desert shield which wa s underway when the act was passed would be counted as emergency appropriations90 these emergency spending provisions were included in later extensions of the bea in 1993 and 1997 the use of the emergency designat ion for defense and other supplemental funding has frequently been controversial however some members of congres s have argued that funding for litary contingency operations in particular should be anticipated and sho uld therefore either be absorbed within amounts provided in the regular defense appropriations bills or should be offset with rescissions of othe r defense funds others have argued that defense readiness will suffer if offsets ar required the 104 congress 199596 generally tried to identify offsets for mostthhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30002crs44 for thorough review of the debate over emergency

be debated in the 105 congres sth 19979 8 the result for defense programs at least has been inconsistent congres s has sometimes offset supplemental defense funding with rescissions an d sometimes has not91 the relationship between authorization and appropriations some confusion and occasionally some controversy has arisen over time concerning th role of the defense authorizing committees compared to that of the defens appropriations committees some argue that the authorizin g committees should focus their attention on large r defense policy issues leaving lineitem oversight and review to the appropriations committees others argue that lineitem authorizatio n contributes to more comprehensive congressional oversight of fense programs the activities for which authorizations are required s expanded over time along with the growing breadth of annual authorization acts see table 8 the issue of u nauthorized appropriations can be particularly contentious title 10 of the us code the bo dy of law that governs the department of defense and the military services provides that funds may be appropriated for any fisca l year to or for the use of any armed force or obligated or expended for specifie d categories of expenditures unless funds th erefor have been specifically authorized by law moreover the rules of the house and the senate each generally prohibi t92 appropriation of funds for programs that have not been authorized and these rule s can be enforced by parliamentary points of order in practice however appropriations bills often provide funds over and abov amounts approved in authorization bills and for activities that have not bee n specifically mentioned in authorization acts or governing report language lega l opinion s have consistently held that appropriations acts may provide more or s money for particular programs than has been authorized may earmark funds fo r projects not specifically authorized may if enacted after an authorization measure alter the purpose of program established by an authorization and may extend the availabili ty of funds beyond the period provided in authorizing legislation th general rules are 1 that later legislation prevails which is almost always th appropriations bill and 2 that more specific provisions of law prevail over s specific provisions 93 in any event defense authorization and appropriations laws themselves seldom conflict directly on particular programs because the laws usually do not specif funding levels for particular line items or program elements instead both kinds ofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30002crs45 the budget and accounting act of 1921 provides that the comptroller general may issue94 legal decisions regarding the availability of appropriated funds for particular purposes function earlier

the account level for example the fy199 9 authorization act authorizes 7642200000 for navy aircraft while the fy199 9 defense appropriations act provides 75 41709000 levels of funding for particular programs like the fa18 fighter are specified in committee reports but except in unusual circumstances not in the language of th law differences in report language are not matter s to be settled in the courts or even by points of order in congress instead disputes between the authorization committees and appropriation s committees over funding for particular programs are matters that the committees have periodically tried to work out through consultation and informal compromises94 an obvious question then arises what happens if the authorization bill is t passed at all or is substantially delayed sometimes as in fy1996 the defens authorization bill has been vetoed and then has not been enacted until several months after the fiscal year has begun in such cases what happens to the workings of the pentagon the answer is that without defense authorizati on act for the current fiscal year the pentagon cannot make policy changes that are normally included in n authorization as long as the appr opriations act passes the pentagon has funding but certain activities may be limited becau of the lack of authorization by congress under standing law new military construction projects cannot go forward withou t both authorization and appropriations moreover authorization acts often mak e95 changes in standing law governing for example military endstrength levels an d regulations regarding military pay and benefits finally if particular program s been authori zed for only limited period of time and funding is not specificall provided in an appropriations act and t he authorization is delayed that program may not continue in debate over the fy1998 defense authorization bill senator bob smith of new hampshire outlined how the pentagon would be affected if the b ill

happened to be addressed in the authorization bill but not in th appropriations measure then being considered if as in other areas of the budget defense autho rization bills were not regularly enacted it is likely that appropriations bills would begin to address issues now considered in the authorization process congressional earmarks and additions to administration requests two other occasionally contentious issues in t he appropriations process particularly concern 1 congressional earmarking of funds for particular projects an d 2 unrequested congressional additions to defense budget requests what it means to earmark funds in appropriations bills is difficult to define precisely one quit carefully worded definition was pr ovided by congressional quarterly in glossary of legislative terms according to this definition to earmark is to set aside funds for specific purpose use or recipient generally speaking virtually every appropriation is earmarked and so are certain revenue source s credited to trust funds in common u sage however the term is often applied as an epithet for funds set aside for such purposes as research projects demonstration projects parks laboratories academic grants and contracts i n particular congressional districts or states or for certain specified universities or other organizations97 congressional reports on the defense authorization and appropriations bill s allocate funds to particular programs in great detail specifying for example ho w many weapons of what types are to be procured how much money is available fo r recruiting and which military construction projects may proceed in sense therefore funds in all defe nse bills are fully earmarked directed usually however the term earmark is used in the case of defenserelated l egislation to mean allocating funds at level of specificity below the normal line item level understood in thi s way congressional committ ee would not be said to earmark funds if it adds money to buy addi tional fighter aircraft for example but would be said to earmark funds ifhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30002crs47 it specifies that particular kind of radar is to be i ncorporated into an aircraft upgrade program defined in this way defense appropriations bills normally contain earmarks f funds for variety of purposes occasionally certain kinds of earmarks have come under criticism and procedures have subsequently been devised to avoid them research grants to particular universities for example were once quite frequent but such grants are now mainly made through peer review process defens appropriations bills continue to earmark funds for wide variety of research projects for acquisition of particular items of hardware and for broad range of medica l research programs defense authorization bills also often include such earmarks and unless appropriations measures specifically reject them they are equally binding on federal agencies closely related issue concerns congressional additions of funding for particular items to annual defense budget requests in some years congress has adde d substantial amounts to the overall defense budget congress added almost 7 billion in fy1996 105 billion in fy1997 and 26 billion in fy1998 to pentagon requests for fy1999 congress provided 83 billion in separat supplemental appropriations measure of which it is estimated more than half was not requested obviously i n such years congres s has added money for programs that the administration did not include in its proposed budget in other years however congress has approve d roughly the level of defense spending requested or it has reduced funding even in those years however congress has always trimmed funding for some programs and increased funding for others so some items have been added some members of congress and others have occasionally cited congressiona l earmarks of defense funds and congressional additions of unrequested projects s examples of wasteful practices the counterargument is that congressional oversight of defense policy necessarily involves making adjustments in defense plans th simple fact t hat the department of defense did not formally request something does not mean it is undeserving of funding part of congresss job is to determin whether agency priorities are appropriate for their part sen ior defense officials have been more c ritical of some congressional additions to the budget than of others clinton administration officials frequently have argued that if congress is going t add money to the budget the additions sh ould be for items that are included in future plans of each of the many recent congressional additions to t he budget have indeed been within the dods future plans in some cases however congress clearly has had differen t priorities than those reflected in administration defense plans during the bus h administration for example congress insisted on continued d evelopment of the v22 osprey tiltrotor aircraft which secretary of defense cheney wanted to cancel during the clinton administ ration congress has frequently added money for missile defense progra ms and for programs like the b2 bomber congress consistently has added money for national guard and reserve programshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30002crs48 after the treasury issues warrants that authorize agencies to draw funds from thei r98 accounts omb apportions the funds by time period and by activity function project r object classification the agency then allocates the funds to administrative units some appropriations accounts are established specifically as transfer accounts to which99 funds are ap propriated in order to be transferred to other operating accounts dru g interdiction environmental restoration and

budget process is budget execution it begin s with the treasury authorizing ag encies to draw funds from an account established by an appropriation and ends with the expenditure of appropriated funds as discussed98 earlier the appropria tions process makes budget authority available for obligation usually budget authority is then obligated and spent for the purpose specified i n legislation and i n report language but other dispositions are possible specifically funds may be reprogrammed or transferred to other programs or accounts may expire without being expended or may be deferred or proposed for rescission unde r procedures governed by the impoundment control act of 1974 transfe rs and reprogramming under procedures worked out betwee n congressional committees and executive branch agencies funds can be obligated for purposes other than originally approved in technical language they can b transferred or reprogrammed such flexibility is provided for many reasons often pay raises are not full funded in annual defense appropriations bills for example so money must be reprogrammed from other accounts to meet payro ll needs unplanned military operations may require funding if not financed through supplementa l appropriations procurement medical or other operating costs often grow beyond planned levels conversely extra money may be available from some sources program delays may prevent the timely obligation of funds savings may accrue from foreign currency fluctuations or from lower fuel costs or from lower than expected inflation technically reprogramming is an shift of funds from one program to another within the same budget account while transfer is shift of funds from one program to another in different accounts either in the same budget year or from one budget year to another dod however uses the term reprogramming for both kinds of transactions in annual appropriations bills congress formally grants the department of defense authority to transfer up to sp ecified amounts between accounts in recent years dod has been given general transfer authority of 2 billion per year an d additional amounts have been made available for transfer for specific purposes99 dod regulations reflecting instructions from the appropriations committees distinguish between three different kinds of reprogramming actions actions requiring congressional notification and approval including l transfers between accounts b any change to program that is matter ofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30002crs49 for discussion of the evolution of the reprogramming process see david

reprogrammings that exceed certain threshold amounts and actions not requiring any congressional noti fication including reprogrammings below certain threshold amounts and those that reclassify dollar amount s within an appropriation without changing the purpose for which the fund s were appropriated 100 the department of defense has also developed detailed procedures first to trac k congressional interest items and second to provide basis for making the requests to congress over the years congress has provided various instructions to the department of defense governing reprogramming actions thresholds for congressiona l notification have changed only rarely appropriations conference report language established the current thresholds for military personnel procurement and rdte in 1988 and for om in 1989 the appro priations committees have instructed dod not to use reprogramming actions to alter items that congress has added to th budget or to restore funding that congress has denied and they have strongl discouraged the use of reprogramming procedures to initiate ne w programs in recent years congress has required that dod provide single annual request fo r reprogramming actions that require congressional approval expiration of funds when provided in an appropriations b ill budget authority is generally made available for obligation within specified p eriod of time in the case of defense funding the period of availability varies depen ding on the account funds in military person nel accounts and operation and maintenance accounts are available for obligation only for one year in most procurement accounts for three years and in the shi pbuilding account for five years funding that is not obligated during it s period of availability expires and may longer be used to

disapprove presidential veto within 30day period under the law the president could propose rescission of certain items specificall identified in n appropriations law or in governing report language congress could overturn presidential rescission only by passing bill specifically rejecting th rescission any bill or joint resolution of disapproval could be vetoed by the president so it woul d

outlays an strategy that calls for reducing the defense budget in order to cut the federal budget deficit must take into consideration the relationship between ba and outlays th fact that funds for different defense programs are spent at different rates means that outlay savings resulting from cuts in budget authority in given year depend on which programs are reduced table 11 shows that funds for military per sonnel and om programs spend out at higher rate than other national fense programs do hence the quickest way to achieve outlay savings in d efense is to cut budget authority in these areas for every 1 cut in ba for military personnel programs for example 95 cut in outlays i s achieved the disadvantage of cutting mainly fastspending accounts is that suc h reductions result in large cuts in personnel endstrengths and therefore in forc structure or in readiness programs such as training and equipment overhauls which may dramatically reduce the effectiveness of defense forces table
