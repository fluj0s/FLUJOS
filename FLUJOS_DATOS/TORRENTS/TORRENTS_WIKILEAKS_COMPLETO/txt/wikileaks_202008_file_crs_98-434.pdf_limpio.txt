the crisis on both the united states and the world in 1998 the crisis that had been c onfined primarily to asia appeared to be spreading to the world the crisis was taking global dimensions the asian financial crisis was initiated by two rounds of currency depreciation that have been occurring since early mmer 1997 the first round was precipitous drop in the value of the thai baht malaysian ringgit philippine peso and indonesian rupiah as these currencies stabilized temporarily the second round began wit h downwar d pressures hitting the taiwan dollar south korean won brazilian real singaporean dollar and hong kong dollar governments have countered th weakness in their cu rrencies by selling foreign exchange reserves and raising interest rates which in turn have slowed economic growth and have made interestbearing securities more attractive than equities the currency crises also has revealed severe problems in the banking and financial sectors of the troubled asian economies the international monetary fund has arranged support packages for thailand 172 billion indonesia 423 billion and south korea 582 billion th packages include an initial infusion of funds with conditions that must be met fo r additional loans to be made available the actual f unds disbursed to date include only those from the imf wor ld bank and asian development bank the united states has

are bein g asked however about the need for the additional funding whether the imf creates moral hazard and whether the imf should attach different conditions to its support packages the second legislative context is in the impact of the crisis on the us economy and american financial institutions forecasters foresee decline in us economic growth of about 05 percentage point and an increase in the us trad deficit of about 65 billion because of the crisis the third context is the efforts f other countries particularly japan in resolving the problem although japan s pledged credits under the imf support packages its economy is in recession and it has not been performing its role as n engine of growth and absorber of exports from its neighbors in asia rather japans trade surplus is

were tied to an appreciating dollar which led to rising trade deficits generated doubts among investors and lenders that thailand and other asia n governments could maintain their pegged xchange rates this induced capital flight specula tion that currency depreciation would occur and growing reluctance b international lenders to roll over shortterm loans as speculators attacked exchange rates and central banks depleted their f oreign exchange reserves attempting to defend them currencies weakened further monetary authorities responded by raisin g interest rates to try to keep capital from leaving their respective countries thi s caused values on equity markets to decline and even more investors to flee local stock markets within half year about 700 billion was lost in asian equity

that is causing world stock markets to become mor interlinked has been the rise of mutual funds when mutual fund managers incu r losses in one market hong kong for example they may sell stock on

additional9 funding as way to express disapproval of its handling of the financial crisis as for imf resources the ratio of the imfs uncommitted and adjusted liquid resources to its liquid liabilities its socalled liquidity ratio had fallen fro m 1205 at the end of april 1997 to 478 at the end of december 1997 further10 deterioration has occurred in 1998 this implies tha t the imf has half or less than the amount of liquid resources it needs to meet its liquid liabilities an april 1998 article in the wall street journal estimated that after making the loans to deal with the asian crisis the imf would have another 13 billion or so in capital plus 24 billion credit line to deal with other emergencies considering the 209 billion in imf support11 for south korea alone plus new commitment of 112

credit the imf has asked for 144 billion increase in its quota capital base and for 35 billio n increase in line of credit new arrangements to borrow to be used in emergencies the imf quotas provide the financial res ources from which the imf extends loans to financially troubled member nat ions in addition to determining the size of the imfs capital and members contributions quotas also determine member countrys voting power and in part its access to imf loans and share in allocations of specia l drawing rights sdrs the international reserve asset created by the imf on september 21 1997 the interim committee of the imf announced n agreement to increase overall imf quotas by 45 this proposal was finalized in late decembe r 1997 and adopted by the imf on february 6 1998 total imf quota s would increase from about sdr 146 billion about 197 billion as of april 9 1998 to sdr 212 billion 287 billion the us p ortion of the imf quota would increase by 40 from sdr 26 5 billion 36 billion to sdr 371 billion 50 billion an increase of about 14 4 billion at the same time the us share of the total imf quota would drop fro m 181 to 175 which would still be sufficient to enable it to

the sense of the congress that the imf should raise funds in private financial markets through the sale of bonds or notes rather than from member countries in order t reduce the risk of loss to us taxpayers moral hazard moral hazard refers to the tendency for something that is designed to alleviate the ill effects of risky decisions to encourage more risky decisions to be made in the international financial context it refers to the tendency for borrowers and lenders to behave less prudently knowing that the imf or their respective governments may bail them out if the loans turn sour even supporters of the imf recognize that the very existence of the imf may encourage count ries to borrow excessively on international markets and for lenders to act imprudently the imf points out however that g overnments in trouble usually are too slow in approaching the fund for help because of the conditions the imf places on such support even some countries with severe currency difficulties such as malaysia in 1997 will do almost anythi ng to avoid having to swallow the bitter imf medicine according to the imf the real moral hazard is not with governments particularl quasigovernmental banks engaging in unsound borrowing and lending but that because imf support is available the private sect or may be too willing to borrow and lend private sector financial institutions know that country in trouble will go to the fund rather than default on international loans 14httpwikileaksorgwikicrs98434crs15 south china morning post january 8 1998 p 315 bangkok

hazard that lies at the heart of the problem for troubled economies like south korea by providing support for countries in financial trouble t he imf may be allowing their governments to use other resources to prop up companies that essentially are insolvent som governments have not allowed certain favored corporati ons to fail because of political or other connections in the words of one commentator capitalism withou t bankruptcy is like christianity without hell there is systematic means f controlling sinful excesses this type of moral hazard certainly existed in th e15 troubled asian countries banks may continue to lend to corporations in difficulty on the prospect that they will receive government assistance in other cases th government itself may channel funds to troubled companies from private or quasi governmental financial institutions the ba nk of thailand for example revealed that it had spent or otherwise committed about 255 billion betw een mid1996 and march 1998 to prop up troubled thai financial institutions most of which it later shu t down it claimed that it had been acting on orders given by two successive finance minister s in south korea when the hanbo steel venture collapsed in 1997 wit h16 58 billion in debts it was found that government officials has exerted pressure on banks to provide loans to hanbo in return for illegal political contributions one solution to the problem of mo ral hazard is to ensure that imprudent lenders or investors in the recipient countries do not escape real losses this has bee n happening to large extent international banks for xample face large potential and real losses from their operations in asia for example in 1997 the asian turmoi l reduced citicorps pretax earnings by about 250 million

insolvent banks have been closed and weak but viable banks have been required to submit rehabilitation plans in thailand 56 of 91 finance companies are bein g liquidated one question is whether the imf loans are used to bail out international banks including american banks that have made loans to the troubled asian economies that in retrospec t seem imprudent there is little doubt that banks which have loan s outstanding in asia have much to gain by return to stability in financial market s there to the extent that the imf support packages have contributed to that stability and to the extent that the infusion of dollars by the imf has enabled borrowers t purchase foreign exchange needed to make loan re payments the losses by us banks and other creditors have been stemmed the imf insists moreover that its assistance has been provided to suppor t programs that are designed to deal with econ omy wide structural imbalances and not to protect commercial banks and private investors from financial losses mor e21 stable exchange rate may contribute to recovery n stock markets or better business conditions but there is imf bailout of specific investors since imf loans are used prim arily to augment foreign exchange reserves of the borrowing nations they become intermingled with existing reserves foreign exchange from the imf i s usually sold through local foreign exchange dealers for local currencies the im f does not loan directly to private companies as for bailouts of manufacturing or other nonfinancial corporations the im f claims that th ere are provisions in the imfsupported programs for publicsector guarantees subsidies or support for them shareholders and creditors bear losses although individual governments may devise separate policies for dealing with such cases any company in need of foreign exchange h owever usually is better off when foreign exchange markets are stabilized as for financial corporations the imf recognizes that governments ofte n

size of the global capital flow s underlying the crisis along with the extent of structural problems uncovered in th economies of the troubled nations seem to rea ch beyond the ability of the imf

had t devalue its ruble even further japans yen and its economy continued to weaken china intimated that it might devalue its currency values had dropped on stoc k markets worldwide and economic forecasts were becoming more an mor pessimistic according to standard poors dri the major reason for the mor pessimistic outlook was that asian exports were doing more poorly than had bee n

institutions throughout the asian region appear to be much more ominous than previously imagined antichin turmoil in indonesia was driving away capital the collapse of regional tourism had undermined service sector growth in nearly every country in the region and the severe decline in th international prices of primary commodities had severely reduced incomes in th agricultural and mining sectors

imf conditionality refers to the strings attached to its lending opinions on conditionality are diverse and can be intense although the imf provides support to the very cou ntries who also are its

state enterprises the imf 25 however did not require action on huma n rights or security policy two controversial areas less closely linked to indonesias macroeconomy in the south korean support

asian financial crisis affects the us economy both in macroeconomic and microeconomic sense on the macroeconomic level it is affecting the us growth rate interest rates balance of trade and related variables on microeconomic level it is affecting specific industries each in different way depending on thei r relationship to the troubled asian economies danger exists that the asian financial turmo

financial crisis affects the us macroeconomy is through trade capital flows and investor confidence th depreciation in the values of the asian currencies except for the hong kong dollar and chinese rmb combined with slowing of growth and financial difficulties f banks and manufacturing corporations in these countries is expected to increase the us trade deficit by about 65 billion in the asian countries the immediate effect of the change in the value of their currencies and outflows of capital is to reduce their trade deficits and in some cases to gen erate trade surplus much of this increased trade surplus for asia appears to be coming at the expense of the united states the second macroeconomic mechanism by which the asian financial crisis affects the us economy is through capital flows as the contagion began and asian banks and corporations began to face severe financial difficulties concern arose in th united states that asian holders of american financial assets particularly us treasury securities might be forced to dispose of them in order to generate muc h needed cash or that foreign cent ral banks might sell them as part of their intervention to support their respective curr encies this has occurred to some extent it seems34 however that flight to quality has more than offset this activity both american and foreign investors withdrew liquid capital by sel ling securities and not rolling over loans from the troubled asian countries and moved the funds into safer markets like those in the united states the appreciating us dollar also has made us investments more attracti ve this influx of capital has eased the upward pressure on us interest rates and has had positive effect on us economic growth th capital flows however have caused some volatility on us stock markets economic growth the asia n financial crisis has slowed down us economic growth directly and indirectly through its negative effects on world economic growth in april

comparison of forecasts for us economic growth made in august 1998 with those made before july 1997 however reveals one unexpected result the forecasts for economi c growth made after the crisis erupted are higher than those published in july 199 7 before the onset of the troubles the main reason for this seems to be that in mid 1997 forecasters were wa ry of the federal reserve boards concern over the runup in the us stock market and tightening labor markets and thought it probable that the federal reserve would raise us interest rates these concerns were eased by the correction in the us stock market in october 1997 and by the financial turmoil in asia after the market volatility in augustseptember 1998 the federal reserve is even less likely to raise interest rates soon the rising us trade deficit therefore is being offset by the easing of upward pressures on us interes t rates and higher than expected activity in interestsensitive sectors such as housing us merchandise trade deficit forecast ers expect the 1998 us merchandise trade deficit to increas significantly because of the drop in the value of c urrencies in asia net capital inflows and the slowdown in growth

1996 lower profit40 growth by corporations tends to have negative effect on their stock prices japans economic weakness the asian financial c risis also calls into question the actions by other nations to resolve the situation particularly japan japan plays key role in the financial turmoil because it is the second largest economy in the world its currency plays large role in asian trade and its banks and businesses are major players in the economies f asia the pr oblem with japan is fourfold first the japanese yen is weakenin g relative to the dollar the weak yen was primary cause of the overvaluation of thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98434crs29 bank for internationa l settlements the maturity sectoral and nationality distribution of41 international bank lending second half 1996 basle switzerland july 1997 p 1920asian currencies which had been tied to the dollar that led to the drop in thei r values second japans economy with the exception of 1996 has been virtually in recessio n since 1991 this weak domestic economic activity has depressed th market for other exports from other asian countries third japans financial sector particularly its banks face massive problem with nonperforming loans that th government and financial institutions have been slow to resolve this bankin g problem not only has depressed economic growth in japa n but japanese bank lending in asia also is being curtailed and fourth it was the japanese model of stron g central government intervention in allocating capital through bank loans that led many of the other asian nations into what has been called crony capitalism or th allocation of loans based more on personal or other rel ationships rather than on sound market principles in these ways japan has been as much contributor to th economic problems in asia as solution to them the asian financial crisis co uld hardly have hit japan at worse time japanese banks that have been struggling for half decade with an overhang of nonperforming loans at home now face the prospect f many of their foreign loans also turning sour at the end of 1996 japanese banks reported total loans outstanding to indonesia at 220 billion to south korea 243 billion thailand 375 billion malaysia 8 2 billion the philippines 16 billion and to taiwan 27 billion in addition japanese banks had loans of 875 billion in hong kong and 588 billion

bank to finance trade with these countries or through it s foreign aid program which likely wo uld have occurred anyway the bank of japan also has intervene d in foreign exchange markets to support

itself is facing recession and has exhibited weak demand fo r imports from the troubled asian economies over the past year the only growin g sector in the japanese economy has been net exports just when other asia n economie s need help japan has been relying on its exports including those to it s neighbors in asia to generate growth at home in february 1998 japans surplus42 on total merchandise trade jump ed by 68 from 875 billion year earlier to 1471 billion about 11 billion while these surpluses h ave been declining since the onset43 of the asian financial crisis they are shrinking not because imports from thes countries are increasing but because japanese exports there are decreasing trade data for january 1998 show that compared with year earlier japanese exports to south kore declined by 418 to indonesia by 183 and to thailand by 344 in the same month japanese imports from south korea did increase slightly bu t those from thailand dropped 5 and those from indonesia were down 16 some of this decline in japans imports from thailand and indonesia can b attributed to the economic turmoil there companie s in those countries may have had difficulty obtaining trade credits to purchase raw materials or to finance exports the decline however also could be caused by stagnation in the japanese economy that is depressing imports and tendency b japanese firms with subsidiaries in southeast asia to favor home production over imports when markets are sl ack exporters in the troubled economies also may bypass the japanese market in favor of that of th united states and europe because they perceive japanese markets to be less open according to singaporean trade st atistics for example singapores exports to japan in december 1997 fell by 71 compared with that year earlier while exports to the united states rose by 198 and to the european union by 197 at march 7 1998 meeting of the asia pacific economic cooperati on apec forum government and business

percentage changes in japans official foreig n exchange reserves including holdings of gold along with changes in japans yen dollar exchange rate the accumulation or disposal of foreign exchange reserves is functionally equivalent to intervention in foreign xchange markets if japans central bank is accumulating foreign exchange it is refraining from converting dollars marks pounds and other foreign currencies into ye n this weakens the value of the yen and strengthens the value of foreign currenc ies particularly the dollar as the volume of japans foreign trade increases its need for foreign currency reserves also may rise but the level of japans currency reserves seems out of line with those of other major trading nations germanys reserves including gold are abo ut 80 billion the

the bank of japan added 16 billion in july to raise its foreign exchange reserves to 2075 billion45 japanese monetary policy also faces dilemma some economists point out that interest rates have fallen so w the bank of japans discount rate is 05 that they longer provide any stimulu s even with cheap loans businesses report that they46 face credi t crunch because banks are not anxious to lend one cause of thi s reported reluctance in the midst of an easy money policy is that japanese banks are now required to meet international banking standards for their capitalasset ratios since banks count part of their unrealized gains on holdings of corporate equities as capital the decline in va lues on japanese stock markets has reduced their capital and forced them to decrease their assets loans to keep their ratios from falling below the required level one suggestion is for japan to reflate its economy by expanding it s money supply and continue to allow its currency to depreciate in june 1998 47 japans money supply mcds was up only about 35 from the year previous2 given the need for economic stimulus this increase seems fairly conservative the united states and other indust
