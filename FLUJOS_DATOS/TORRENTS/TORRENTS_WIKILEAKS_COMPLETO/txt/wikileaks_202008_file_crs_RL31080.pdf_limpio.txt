events there can have an impact over much of the subsaharan region secure transport on the congo river as we ll as potential road and rail routes across congo could be great economic boon to the region and congo could be an important market for neighboring states as recently as the 1980s zaire was the worlds largest producer of cobalt and leading producer of industrial diamonds as well as copper it has petroleum deposits much good farmland and great hydroelectric potential despite its potential congo today is experiencing grave political and economic problems following major upheaval in 19961997 and again in 19981999 troops from five african countries are present in congo1 and large parts of the east and north of the country are held by rebe l groups armed militias also roam the east where civilian populations are suffering fro m prolonged instability and civil strife and human rights violations are common thus some analysts fear renewal of widespread armed conflict in congo civil war and possible breakup of the country others however are encouraged by slow progress in the congo peace process which began in julyaugust 1999 and acceler ated after the assassination of congo president laurent kabila on january 16 2001 united nations secretary general kofi annan speaking to the security council on july 24 2001 noted that the 6 month old congo ceasefire was holding despite some allegations of violations that were under investigation that most ar med forces in congo had disengaged in accordance with unsupported diseng agement plan and that the peacekeeping force in congo known as m onuc had developed positive working relationship with the congo government however the secret ary general himself remained cautious about the prospects for longterm peace in congo pointing

congos difficulties today result in part from the stunning rate of change it has confronted over short span of history in 1930 congo was rural peasantbased society under the control of tiny elite of belgian bureaucrats assisted by few senior congolese clerks and sometimes brutal colonial police force today the country has sprawling capital of five to eight million inhabitants an overall population of nearly 50 million up from 20 million in 1970 and complex social structure that includes kaleidoscope of conflicting ethnic loyalties as well as sharp economic and social class divisions2 congo has posed challenges for the broa der international system for more than century the conference of berlin 18841885 accepted the claims of belgian king léopold ii to this sprawling territory of diverse peoples nd many languages in order to stave off destabilizing scramble for the region among europes great powers the brutal repression mutilati ons and forced labor characteristic of léopolds rule were exposed by human righ ts activists and missionaries at the turn of the century and the situation in the congo became an international scandal3 in 1908 the belgian parliament voted to re move the colony from léopolds personal control and make it belgian colony belg ium adopted highly paternalistic style of rule treating congolese as incapable of selfgovernment reportedly when independence came in 1960 not one congo c itizen had received university degree political parties only began to emerge in the 1950s and according to leading authority largescale contact with the outside world dates only from the brussels exposition world fair of 1958 where seve ral hundred congolese were brought to belgium as showpieces for the congolese pavilion4 congos initial upheaval broke out in ju ly 1960 just after independence the belgian government had agreed to set da for independence only in january finally acknowledging that small european country could not hope to maintain large colony in africa in the face of rising na tionalism around the continent nonetheless belgian officers attempted to retain control of the congolese army after independence leading to mutiny and attacks on europeans united nations peacekeeping force intervened in the resultin g unrest in an effort to prevent the situation from becoming cold war crisis in fact however congo did become major cold war issue after prime minister patrice lumumba who enjoyed the sympathy and backing of the soviet ion was killed in 1961 the soviets halted their contributions to peacekeeping leading to financial crisis

continued s ecessionist threats in key regions in november 1965 general joseph mobutu form er journalist who had ri sen to command the armed forces seized power in bloodless coup the coup won ready acceptance in western capitals where mobutu already had many dvocates because of concern that the civilian regime was moving to the left over the next few years mobutu managed to neutralize his political opposition thwart secessionist tendencie s in key regions and consolidate his power base his methods which included the arrest and humiliation of former allies and the elimination of independent labor unions were authoritarian but not unusual among th ird world countries at that time in the 1970s however mobutu began series of disruptive political and economic initiatives that brought prolonged decline in the nations fortunes leading to eventual economic collapse and fi nally to the political crisis of 1991 his authenticity campaign launched in 1971 in addition to requiring zairians to abandon western styles of dress incl uded banning christian forenames and prohibiting religious broadcasts mobutu h imself adopted seri of honorific titles such as guide helmsman and father of the nation at the nd of 1973 he launched his zairianization campaign for the ec onomy which resulted in the seizure of foreignowned propertie s and their redistribution to mobutu loyalists many of the extreme measures undertaken by mobutu in th first half of the 1970s had to be eased or retracted in subsequent years but th confidence of foreig n investors and lenders had been badly shaken and the economy ne ver recovered long era of negative growth set in worsened by low world prices for copper the high cost of oil imports and what analysts described as pervasiv corruption nonetheless some observers credited mobutus policies with maintaining stability and minimizing ethnic conflict critics argued however that in stifling political dissent and impoverishing zaires people mobutu was only bottling up resentme nts that were bound to explode at some point political change after 1990 mobutus political position deteriorat ed sharply in 1990 as domestic and international pressures forced him into major policy changes and concessions the denouement of the cold war reduced the in centives for western governments to offer him political or economic support meanwh ile the union for democracy and social progress udps headed by tshisekedi wa mulumba joined with student groups to mount series of protests and demonstr ations police and military repression of these protests brought fresh international criticism in 1990 mobutu finally accepted the crea tion of full multiparty system in principle the continued terioration of the economy however was adding fuel to popular anger and large demonstrations broke out in april 1991 mobutu acceded to key opposition demand by announcing that national political conference would be convened the sovereign national conference

retain the ability to exploit the eastern regions resources charges both countries deny however repeated clashes in 1999 and 2000 between ugandan and rwanda n troops in kisangani at the center of

following the signing of the lusaka agreement would see the arrival of growing numbers of peacekeepers and as confidence in the process built gradual withdrawal of foreign forces and the launching of subs tantive dialogue between rebel leaders and the kabila regime laurent kabila came to be seen as an obstacle to the peace process and there is still much hope that the new joseph kab ila government will move the process forward during his february 2001 overseas trip joseph kabila impressed foreign leaders with his willingness to compromise and to permit resumption of the internal political dialogue some regard this dialogue as the best hope for the countrys future since it has the potential to restore politi cal unity and promote reconciliation while creating the basis for the eventual election of legitimate civilian government yet many are concerned that ethnic and political divisions among congo politicians as well as between the armed rebel groups and internal nonviolent opposition will prove too wide to bridge there is also concern that joseph kab ila who was reportedly just 29 years of age when he took office lacks the pow er and experience to maintain political stability in the capital or to guide the peace process to successful conclusion there have been rumors of coup attempts and dozens of people have reportedly been jailed on suspicion of involve ment in the assassination of laurent kabila finally many worry that rwanda uganda and their rebel allies are at best lukewarm with respect to the peace process and have little interest in bringing it to rapid conclusion in part analysts argue their attitude reflects legitima security concerns on such issues as the role of the kabila government in assisting the armed groups but experts maintain it may also reflect the stake rebel leaders and elites from rwanda and uganda have acquired in their continue d exploitation of congos resources23 conceivably fighting could resume if rebel groups and their external backers come to feel that their interests are not being protected and if the numbers of peacekeepers remain small if the process falters congo could fall into prolonged defacto breakup

steps toward longterm stabilization us policy congo was contentious issue in us foreign policy from 1960 into the early 1990s the cold war and the emergence of communist regime in cuba were very much on the minds of policymakers in 1960 and lent special urgenc to their efforts to stabilize congo through peacekeeping policymakers saw this approach as the best available means for minimizing soviet influence in congo some us critics of the policy however regarded the united nations itself as leftist influence and thought that the united states should have fostered the secession of katanga province as basti on against communism the most controversial event of that era was the death of prime minister lumumba in january 1961 many american observers regarded him as communist and soviet agent although others argued that he was essentia lly nationalist and populist evidence developed at 1975 senate hearings indi cated that us officials had attempted to implement plan to assassinate lumumba through poisoning or exposure to virus this plot evidently failed and lumumba died in katanga after falling into the hands of secessionist forces whether the united states played role in this event was matter of controversy but it is widely believed in congo that the united states was indeed involved t he belgian parlia ment is currently investigating charges that the actual ssassination of lumumba was planned and carried out by belgians many cong olese also blame the united nations which had peacekeeping force in congo at th time for failing to protect lumumba mobutu enjoyed g ood
