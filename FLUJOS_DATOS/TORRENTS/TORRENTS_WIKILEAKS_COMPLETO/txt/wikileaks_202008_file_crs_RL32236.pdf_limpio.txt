housing program referred to as hope vi has been credited with eliminating and replacing some of the most dangerous and dilapidated public housing in the country with new mixed income communities however the program has come under scrutiny for slow expenditure of funds and for displacing poor families reflecting these criticisms the bush administration requested new funding for the program in each budget request from fy2004fy2009 congress responded by continuing to fund the program but at less than quarter of what it had been funded at in fy2003 and prior years created in 1992 and administered by the partment of housing and urban development hud the hope vi program provides funds to renovate or demolish existing public housing and replace it with mixedincome housing the local public housing authorities phas that administer public housing apply for grants currently capped at 20 million each and use the funds to leverage other private and public re sources the bulk of the hope vi program is composed of revitalization grants that can be used for demolition rehabilitation and new construction of public housing as well as land acquisition relocation of residents and community and supportive services for residents hud has also provided demolitiononly grants that could be usedoften in conjunction with revitalization grantsfor the physical destruction of distressed public housing and the relocation of its residents although demolition grants have been issued for several years third type of grant planning grants are longer awarded but could be used for technical assistance in preparing property to go through demolition or revitalization new type of revitalization grant main street revitalization grants was created in 2003 they are available to local governments in small communities rather than phas for main street revitalization projects which may be unrelated to public housing over the history of the program 256 hope vi revitalization grants have been made to phas in 36 states districts and territories as of july 2008 cumulative total of 89892 units have been demolished and 70435 new and rehabilitated units have been completed the hope vi program has helped transform number of severely distressed neighborhoods which has made the program popular with many members of congress from both parties its authorization was set to expire at the end of fy2006 but congress extended the program through the end of fy2008 pl 110161 in the 110 th congress hope vi reauthorization legislation was considered hr 3524 and s 829and approved by the housebut was not enacted before the end of the 110th congress this report outlines the program and its history which sets the context for todays debate it will be updated to reflect congressional action

public housing reform program through hope vi the department of housing and urban development hud provides funds to rehabilitate or demolish public housing and replace it with housing that serves both the poor as well as the middle class in order to understand hope vi and its issues it is important to first understand brief history of the larger public housing program

depressionera program was intended to stimulate construction activity clear slums and provide lowrent housing to poor families as designed under the act public housing is built and operated by local quasigovernmental public housing authorities phas tenants who live in public housing typically pay 30 of their adjusted gross incomes toward rent although they can opt for marketbased flat rent and phas can choose to institute minimum rents of up to 50 per month phas are able to keep public housing rents low because local governments provide property tax reductions and the federal government provides both capital and operating subsidies to supplement the low rents paid by tenants from its inception public housing has faced number of barriers to success many communities were resistant to accepting public housing this opposition paired with strict federal rules about how much could be spent to build unit of public housing led to the construction of public housing developments in undesirable areas such as near railroad tracks highways and industrial zones the housing that was constructed was often highdensity highrise structures this form of development has often been characterized as the projects in addition to location and construction problems many projects faced management problems although many public housing projects were run by effective and efficien t phas others had inexperienced phas or in some cases negligent phas who were unable or unwilling to deal with problems as they arose furthermore pha budgets were often insufficient to maintain the properties it was thought at the time the program was created that most tenants would be working adults whose incomes would increase until their economic situation improved enough that they could move out of public housing this was the case in the early years of the program however policies that adopted rent levels based on incomes rather than operating costs and gave priority to the elderly and disabled paired with changing demographics and growth in singlemotherheaded households resulted in population of public housing residents that was very different than originally envisioned today about half of public housing residents are elderly or disabled and about half are nonelderly non disabled singleadult headed households the majority with children of those nonelderly non disabled households only about half have income from work while the other half either receive some form of cash assistance such as welfare or report income todays public housing serves the very poor who are only required to pay percentage of their income toward rent since the rent that phas receive from tenants is so low public housing is dependent on congressional appropriations and the budget has not always kept up with need many units of public housing fell into disrepair and some units had to be left vacant because they were longer habitable public housing over time became known for terrible living conditions research has shown that

to myriad social ills1 the often dense highrise structures of public housing became riddled with crime drugs and violence public housing was the primary government housing program for the poor until the late 1970s however out of growing concern about the problems with public housing and other government subsidized housing construction programs president nixon declared moratorium on federal housing construction programs in 1973 in 1974 congress authorized the section 8 program which provided subsidies to allow lowincome families to live in private market housing it was hoped that through partnerships with the privat sector the section 8 program could avoid the problems faced by public housing the section 8 program also introduced tenantbased assistance which subsidized tenants rather than units giving tenants the option to move tenant based assistance has grown in popularity partially out of the hope that it can prevent concentrations of poverty in neighborhoods over time section 8 overtook public housing as the governments largest housing program for the poor today almost twice as many households are served by section 8 than are housed in public housing 2

many were still plagued by problems in order to determine how to deal with the existing stock of public housing congress created the national commission on severely distressed public housing pl 101235 in 1989 the commission was mandated to identify those public housing projects that were in severe state of distress assess the most promising strategies for improvement and develop national action plan in 1992 the commission issued its findings and recommendations on the state of the nations public housing the commission labeled 6 of the public housing stock as severely distressed at the time equal to 86000 units it also reported finding the following residents afraid to move about in their own homes and communities because of the high incidence of crime high unemployment and limited opportunities for the meaningful employment of residents programs designed to address the conditions with too few resources provided too late programs designed to assist residents of public housing that provide disincentives to selfsufficiency and families living in physical conditions that have deteriorated to degree that renders the housing dangerous to the health and safety of residents the national action plan presented by the commission included proposals for change in five major categories 1 see william julius wilson the truly disadvantaged the inner city the underclass and public

vi began as demonstration program created in reaction to the findings of the national commission on severely distressed public housing the commissions national action plan was presented in august 1992 in october 1992 the final version of the fy1993 hud appropriations bill pl 102389 passed the congress including 300 million for an urban revitalization demonstration program under the demonstration the secretary of hud was to choose 15 cities based on need to receive up to 50 million each to revitalize distressed public housing each city was required to spend 80 of its funds toward the capital costs of major reconstruction rehabilitation and other physical improvements the capital costs of replacement units andor section 8 certificates management improvements for the reconstructed project and for planning and technical assistance purposes the remaining 20 was to be used for community and supportive services phas were required to match 15 of all funds provided from 1993 until 1998 the urban revitalization demonstration now commonly referred to as hope vi continued to receive funding through annual appropriations bills however the program remained unauthorized the law governing the program was contained within annual appropriations bills and the requirements for eligibility and funding changed from year to year hud administered the law not through regulation but in the directions they issued along with each annual notice of funding availability nofa to which communities would apply for hope vi funding changes to the program in addition to those mandated by annual appropriations laws were included in these nofas the fy1999 hud appropriations bill pl 105276 included major public housing reform initiative the quality housing and work opportunity reconciliation

characteristics of public housing from highrise tenements to attractive marketable units that blend in with the surrounding neighborhoods lessening concentrations of poverty by reducing density and promoting mixed income communities encouraging partnerships with other agencies and local governments for support and resources achieving highquality management in public housing and enforcing strict eviction rules and helping residents to attain selfsufficiency by providing services and educational opportunities and by encouraging economic development in the area surrounding public housing hud seeks to meet the goals of the hope vi program by providing grants to phas for revitalization or if this is not economically feasible for demolition of distressed public housing the majority of funds are awarded through revitalization grants funds have also been awarded through demolition grants until fy2004 and planning grants until fy1995 2003 hope vi reauthorization law pl 108186 created fourth type of hope vi grant designed to promote main street revitalization in small communities which is unrelated to public housing

thirtyfive planning grants were awarded to phas between 1993 and 1995 they were used to pay for studies of the area to be revitalized to develop plan for revitalization for economic development and for technical support planning grants were suspended after 1995 because hud believed that there were enough examples of phas that had begun the revitalizing process that the technical assistance was longer necessary g6g142g150g152g149g146g157g146g152g151g556g17g151g149g162g561g9g155g138g151g157g156g561 in 1996 hud established goal of demolishing 100000 units by the year 2003 since then the

grants is published in the federal register laying out the application requirements and deadlines once hud receives applications it screens them to determine whether they meet threshold requirements in the fy2005fy2006 combined nofa the thresholds included requirement that community had prior main street rejuvenation master plan that the plan included affordable housing and that appropriate zoning was in place once applications have been screened they are scored scoring categories in the fy2005fy2006 nofa included the capacity of the community including prior experience the need for affordable housing and the readiness of the plan for implementation while main street grants are capped in law at 1 million although in some years hud has limited the maximum to 500000 presumably to serve more communities g20g142g159g146g157g138g149g146g163g138g157g146g152g151g561g9g155g138g151g157g156g561 phas who wish to receive revitalization grant must apply by the deadline published in the nofa once the deadline has passed hud screens the applications to ensure that they meet threshold requirements if they do not then they are disqualified for example in order to meet the threshold requirements in 2006 applicants had to prove among other factors that they had secured site control for the proposed site had issued request for qualifications rfq to secure developer and that they had prepared plan in advance for relocating residents impacted by the revitalization the nofa also explains deadlines for spending funds and penalties for slow expenditure once hud screens the applications the agency scores them on variety of factors for example in the 2006 nofa applications received scores in categories including capacity to undertake development need the amount of outside reso urces brought in leveraging the amount of homeownership housing created the amount of prior hope vi units that had been completed by the applicant and community and supportive services hud then ranks the scored applications and funds them in order until the hope vi funds are exhausted in the early years of the hope vi program there was cap on the amount hope vi grantee could be awarded however since 1996 when hud began allowing phas to use hope vi dollars to leverage outside resources the average grant amount per project has dropped significantly in recent years hud has capped revitalization grants at 20 million each once grantees are selected they are notified and are required to sign grant agreement with hud the grant agreement includes timelines for progress for example under the terms of the 2006 nofa hope vi revitalization grantees are expected to complete their developments within 54 months however as the nofas change every year different cohorts of grantees have had different timelines for spending their funds phas must agree to meet all requirements of the program including match requirements for exam ple phas must match 5 of their hope vi grant award with other resources and must match dollarfordollar any amount over 5 of the grant amount that is used for community and sup portive services for residents if pha is not successfully meeting its deadlines or requirements hud has the authority to penalize the pha either by appointing some form of receiver or by rescinding grant funds to date hud has not rescinded hope vi funds from delinquent grantees although performance on hope vi grant has contributed to huds finding of substantial default and appointment of receiver for several phas

grantees are bringing into projects concern has been raised that hope vi redevelopments may be raising only limited private investment and may be more expensive than they appear according to huds fy2006 hope vi report to congress about 60 of funds spent on revitalization projects had come from leveraged funds and 73 of those leveraged funds were from nonfederal sources however that estimate includes private equity raised from the sale of lowincome housing tax credits lihtc as nonfederal source although some might consider it form of federal funding study conducted by general accounting office now the government accountability office in 2002 found that after excluding lihtc funds only 12 of leveraged funds had come from private sources lihtc funding had accounted for 27 of all leveraged funds in the projects studied 9 g21g158g140g140g142g156g156g142g156g561g138g151g141g561g5g152g151g140g142g155g151g156g561 hope vi has been credited with number of successes in terms of addressing severely distressed public housing the program has largely met its original goal to eliminate the worst severely distressed public housing grantees have been provided sufficient funding to demolish over 100000 units of public housing 10 the homes that are built in place of the demolished units are typically lowerdensity safer and more attractive the new designs also generally connect the public housing developments with their surrounding communities both functionally and aesthetically despite the hope vi programs successes there are several program issues facing congress they include the slow expenditure of hope vi funds the impact of hope vi on the original public housing residents the costeffectiveness of the program and the loss of assisted housing stock

sparked in surrounding communities although this kind of change is hard to measure studies have shown that hope vi has had some success study of eight hope vi sites undertaken by the housing research foundation found that in communities surrounding recent hope vi revitalization projects per capita incomes increased more than for the cities as whole neighborhood unemployment rates had fallen receipt of public assistance had declined fewer households qualified as lowincome commercial and residential lending rates increased at faster rate than overall city increases and 9 us general

data revitalization gr antees have demolished 89892 units of public housing demolitiononly grantees planned to demolish 57593 units of public housing despite the fact that some units may be

than in the overall city the author concluded that although there are many nonhope vi factors contributing to change in these communities the nature of hope vi development has helped determine the extent and pace of that change11 2003 gao report looking at the neighborhoods surrounding several hope vi sites also attempted to assess the impact of hope vi on neighborhoods using decennial census and home mortgage disclosure act data gao found that the neighborhoods surrounding the hope vi developments generally experienced positive changes in education income and housing indicators however further analysis found mixed results in some neighborhoods compared to comparable neighborhoods that had not undergone hope vi redevelopment in summary gaos report stated we cannot attribute these changes solely to the hope vi program to the extent that they do reflect the programs influence however they suggest that demolition of old deteriorated public housing alone may influence surrounding neighborhoods for example average housing value and average household income increased even though new units had been constructed it is possible that the hope vi program influenced these indicators by removing blight from the neighborhoods and temporarily relocating large numbers of low income households during demolition 12 regardless of whether hope vi redevelopments actually spur new neighborhood improvementor if such improvements woul d have happened without hope vi grantthe award of hope vi grant has often brought positive press to areas of towns that were plagued by negative perceptions many news stories have been written about community transformations linked to hope vi 13 arguably hope vi might help to change the publics generally negative perceptions of public housing

new resources into communities undergoing revitalization examples include the creation of community centers charter schools and new commercial activity in redeveloped hope vi sites and the provision of capital to help public housing residents start small businesses and social services to help public housing residents further their educations or overcome personal barriers 11 sean zielenbach the

markets partly as result of hope vi this new knowledge has allowed number of phas outside of the hope vi program to participate in mixedfinance deals and secure private loans as of december 2007 hud has approved 106 transactions in which 186 phas secured total of approximately 306 billion in loan and bond financing to address the capital needs of public housing14 these extra funds supplement federal funds and rents used to modernize public housing it is hoped that with the use of outside funding phas can begin to address the large backlog of modernization needs in existing public housing and prevent further disrepair g20g142g156g146g141g142g151g157g156g561 the majority of hope vi revitalization plans require at least the temporary displacement of residents grantees can relocate residents either temporarily or permanently to other public housing sites or by providing them with vouchers to be used in the private market according to hud program summary data as of march 2006 63885 households had been relocated by hope vi revitalization grantees of those households 49 had been moved to other public housing 32 had been given section 8 vouchers 6 had been evicted and 13 had made other arrangements or left the program of the 63885 that were relocated 22 are now living in revitalized units although the intention of many grantees is to return as many displaced residents as possible to redeveloped sites often fewer residents retu rn than planned gao found that in 1999 grantees estimated that 61 of original residents would return to redeveloped sites by 2003 their estimate of resident returns had dropped to 44 15 some families choose not to return opting instead to stay where they were relocated and avoid the hassle of another move in other cases families are ineligible to move back because of blemished credit or rental histories according to march 2006 hud data grantees now estimate that 38 of original residents will return to redeveloped sites given that many residents who are displaced from public housing projects undergoing hope vi renovation do not return when the revitalization is complete lowincome housing advocates have raised questions about what has happened to them since hud has not always required phas to follow residents during the revitalization process some phas have lost track of residents after their initial relocation to learn more about what has happened to displaced residents the urban institute conducted study that looked at the living conditions of former residents of eight hope vi sites that had been relocated either with vouchers or to other public housing units several years after their initial relocation their study found that overall relocated tenants lived in safer healthier communities and better housing after relocation although both groups have seen some gains families relocated with vouchers have generally fared better than families relocated to other public housing particularly the study found that children in voucher households have done better than children relocated to other public housing for whom behavior problems have increased one way in which voucher holders have done worse includes financial hardship v oucher holders are more likely than public housing residents to report difficulty in paying for utilities and foodindicating that they are having to make tradeoffs to pay their rent 16 14 according to huds fy2009 congressional budget justifications 15 us government accountability office public housing hope vi resident issues and changes in neighborhoods surrounding grant

priority on the needs of public housing residents when selecting hope vi grantees advocates contend that more units of public housing should be built through hope vi and that displaced tenants should have right to return they also argue that phas should be responsible for providing sufficient support to displaced residents especially residents that leave public housing to ensure that their relocation is successful the urban institute findings have also led to calls for the greater use of vouchers when relocating families 17

demonstration grants they were awarded to prior revitalization grantees to partner with community and faithbased organizations who provide community and supportive services to families hud wi ll use these grantees to see whether mentoring model improves self sufficiency outcomes for families affected by hope vi redevelopments the grants were funded with previous years appropriations funding presumably recaptured from grantees who were unable to use them g7g161g153g142g151g141g146g157g158g155g142g561 one main criticism of the hope vi program has been the slow expenditure of hope vi funds in fy2003 unspent balances reached peak of ov er 33 billion over half of the 6 billion appropriated for the program number of reasons have been cited for phas slow expenditure of hope vi funds one is the changing nature of the program in the beginning grantees were chosen almost solely on the basis of need often the phas with the most need had the weakest management capacity as result the poorestperforming phas were awarded large grants it is not surprising that they had difficulty in implementing their redevelopment plans this was especially true in 1996 when congress set aside grants for set of phas outside of any competitive process 18 2003 gao report found that the majority of revitalization grantees had missed at least one of the deadlines established in their grant agreements19 hud has worked to address several of these problems over time the process for selecting grantees has become more competitive and hud now uses number of criteria to judge applicants capacity for undertaking these complicated development projects for example recent 17 see testimony of george moses representing the nati onal low income housing coalition and dr susan popkin from the urban institute before the house financial services subcommittee on housing and community opportunity june 21 2007 available at httpwwwhousegovappslisthearingfinancialsvcs_demht0621072shtml 18 the 1996 grantees are known to have had problems in undertaking their hope vi redevelopments their problems are especially visible in expenditure data displayed in figure 2 later in this report gao assessment of 1996 grantees cited several additional factors that have led to delays in hope vi projects phas often lack staff with expertise in development and finance which hinders their ability to undertake complicated mixedfinance deals without acquiring additional staff or consultants certain types of development including onsite construction and new construction are more difficult than others which may not have been accounted for in original plans lack of community and resident support can hinder hope vi development plans and may lead to lengthy litigation and the hud approval process can move slowly perhaps because of staffing limitations 19 us general accounting office huds oversight of hope vi sites need to be more consistent gao03555 may 2003 available at

applicant and developer capacity and deduct points from applicants with previous hope vi grants that are behind in development there is reason to believe that more recent hope vi grantees have performed better than earlier grantees huds fy2006 2nd quarter hope vi progress report to congress included information demonstrating the improved performance of more recent cohorts of grantees on number of administrative performance measures for example the number of days it took more recent grantees those from fy2002 through fy2004 from the execution of their grant agreement to the approval of their revitalization plan averaged 177 days compared to an average of over 600 days for older grantees those from fy1993 through fy2001 pre2002 grantees took an average of over 1100 days to get approv of their mixed finance proposals compared to an average of about 356 days for fy2002 and later grantees these improvements may be due in part to more robust selection cr iteria used by hud in choosing grantees greater pha experience and familiarity with hope vilike mixed fi nance developments and more focus by hud on interim performance measures another important change has come in the way that congress provides funding to the hope vi program prior to fy2002 hope vi was provided with noyear funding meaning that the funds provided by congress remained available to th grantee until they were spent beginning in fy2002 congress adopted oneyear obligation and fiveyear expenditure deadline for hope vi funds any hope vi funds remaining unspent at the end of that period will expire and revert back to the treasury this change in funding should effectively solve the problem of future accumulations of unspent balances the fy2002 cohort of grantees were the first to experience an expiration of funds 12 million of fy2002 grant funds expired at the end of fy2008 before they could be used by grantees at the end of fy2008 unspent balances in the hope vi fund had been reduced from their peak of 33 billion in fy2003 to under 860 billion as illustrated in figure 2 just under half of that amount 46 is funding that will not expire the remaining 54 of those funds will expire if not spent within six years of their award

subsidies to the private market20 as result the government has not funded the development of new public housing units for many years grantees can use hope vi funds in conjunc tion with other public and private funds to build replacement units of public housing given wh at is known about the past costeffectiveness of the construction of public housing questions can be raised as to whether this is an effective use of limited government dollars hud testified before congress in 2003 that it is not an efficient method according to the assistant secretary for public and indian housing the division that oversees the hope vi program moreover it is evident to us that hope vi is not an efficient method for meeting the current and future capital needs of the public housing program the average cost of building unit under hope vi is 120000 more than 33 greater than the average cost of building similar unit using the home block grant program 21 given overall budget constraints it just doesnt make sense for us to continue funding for this program at the expense of more cost effective programs to serve the same ends22 taking different look at the costs of hope vi researchers at the urban institute attempted to undertake costbenefit analysis of hope vi redevelopment compared to maintaining the status quo in distressed public housing their study contrasted the upfront costs of undertaking hope vi development including hope vi and othe r government funding but excluding equity generated by lihtcs to the savings to the government that could result from undertaking the redevelopment they estimate savings from reduced housing subsidy needs since new buildings require lower subsidies and are likely to be more energy efficient improved family wellbeing lower welfare unemployment insurance medicaid and criminal justice system costs and improved neighborhoods increased property tax revenue the urban institute study estimates that prototypical distressed public housing project undergoing hope vi mixed income redevelopment could save the government more than 20 million over 20 years 23

vi revitalization grantees planned to demolish 88469 units of public housing rehabilitate 10993 units of existing public housing and build 92644 units of new housingon ly about half of which would be public housing units net loss of 41000 public housing units as of march 2006 88 of the units planned for demolition had been demolished and 54 of the public housing units slated for construction had been built an interim net loss of over 50000 units lowincome housing advocates have expressed concern that hope vi is eroding the nations stock of affordable housing and many have argued that hud should reinstate the oneforone replacement requirement they argue that in many communities there is simply shortage of lowercost housing and that the federal government has some responsibility to help increase or at least maintain the supply the requirement that each unit of public housing destroyed be replaced with new unit of public housing called oneforone replacement was suspended in 1994 and fully repealed in 1996 much of the impetus behind the suspension of the requirement was the argument put forward by phas that they were unable to deal with troubled public housing because the oneforone replacement requirement coupled with site standards deconcentration requirements limited funding and other rules made the demolition and revitalization process unworkable at congresss request gao investigated these issues and reported that phas were concerned that oneforone replacement was resulting in developments becoming decrepit 25 in addition to development concerns critics of oneforone replacement argued that it promoted concentrations of poverty did not appeal to investors and that the low rents paid by public housing residents would not allow projects to remain financially viable pha groups have contended that reinstating traditional oneforone replacement will again hamper their ability to undertake housing rehabilitation further there are questions about how oneforone replacement could affect efforts to deconcentrate poverty some compromise strategies such as requiring some minimum threshold of hard unit replacement or greater replacement with projectbased subsidies have been considered g20g142g140g142g151g157g561g6g142g159g142g149g152g153g150g142g151g157g156g561 g8g158g151g141g146g151g144g561 the bush administration requested new funding for the hope vi program in each of his fy2004fy2008 budget requests to congress citing th slow expenditure of funds concerns about costeffectiveness and that the program had effectively reached its goal of demolishing 100000 units of distressed public housing the administration states it is time to rethink whether hope vi is still necessary or effective the administration argues that even without new funding the program would not end any time soon since so many projects are still in the pipeline but that by not funding the program hud would have time to throughly evaluate the program and consider alternatives 25 us general accounting office public housing funding and other constraints limit housing authorities ability to comply with oneforone rule rced9578 march 3 1995 available
