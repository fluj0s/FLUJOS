if signif icant developments ensue the complaint the itc and doc had received ad and cvd petitions march 5 2004 from the national pork producers coalition nppc number of state pork associations and more than 100 individual producers the petitions alle ge that the industry is materially injured and threatened with material injury due to imports of live swine both slaughter hogs and feeder pigs from canada where farmers recei ve substantial subsid ies under variety of government programs petitioners allege that the subsidies have encouraged the canadian industry to produce too many animals which in turn are exported to the united states and sold at less than fair value pork and hogs for breeding are not covered by the action1 legislative basis us trade law spells out the relatively complex process for filing and investigating an ad or cvd petition which is filed simu ltaneously with both the itc and commerce as with this case petitions can be file d requesting both ad and cvd relief involving the same imports the agencies then follow specified steps in investigating the petitionshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21985crs2 2 the authority for cvd and ad actions is in subtitle title vii of the tariff act of 1930 as amended 19 usc 1671 and 1673 for an expl anation of this authority and cvd and ad procedures see crs report rl31296 trade remedies and agriculture 3 the itc published

published august 23 2004 69 federal register p 51800 this preliminary negative determination by commerce did not howev er terminate the cvd investigation 5 under the socalled byrd amendment sec tion 1003 of pl 106387 final duties would have to be redistributed to the domestic industries clai ming to be injured by the imports in this case petitioning pork producers wto dispute settlement panel has determined that the byrd amendment violates us trade obligationsto determine whether the product has been subsidized or dumped as the case may be whether us producers have been injured and the level if any of duties that should be levied the law authorizes antidumping duties on imported goods if commerce more specifically the import administration of th international trade administration within commerce determines that an imported product is being sold at less than its fair value and the itc an independent agency determin that us producer is being materially injured or threatened with material injury as result dumping is form of price discrimination whereby goods are sold in one export market at prices lower than the prices of comparable goods in the hom market or in other export markets the law also authorizes countervailing duties on imported goods if commerce determines that foreign government is pr oviding countervailable subsidy for the goods and the itc determines that the imports are causing or threatening to cause material injury to us industry the purpose of the c vd law is to offset any unfair competitive advantage that foreign producer or exporte r might have over us producers due to the subsidies any us ad and cvd action mu st conform to the terms of world trade organization wto agreements in addition the north american free trade agreement nafta allows final dumping subsidy or injury determination involving imports from nafta countries to be reviewed by bi national panel instead of by court in the country issuing the determination2 the investigations the itc issued preliminary determina tion on may 3 2004 of material injury to the us industry3 commerce announced on august 16 2004 negative preliminary determination in the cvd case4 commerce found that severa l of 22 canadian programs it had examined appeared to be countervailable but the va lue of the subsidies provided were less than 1 ad valorem other programs were not countervailable the doc found on the ad petition commerce did preliminarily determine on october 14 2004 that canadian swine are being or are likely to be sold in the united states at less than fair value to determine preliminary dumping margins the doc compared an export price or constructed export price during calendar 2003 with calcu lated normal value for the animals the margins effectively became the provisional duties5httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21985crs3 6 published march 11 2005 70 federal register pp 1218112188 minimis means less than 1 and therefore is disregarded 7 live swine from

american pork industry8 in the united states approximately 74000 producers held nearly 60 million hogs and pigs in 2003 but this aggregate number masks the industrys evolution and current structure production and inve ntories traditionally were locat ed in corn belt states with access to abundant feed grain and soybean meal supplies twentyfive years ago tens of thousands of small independe nt farms many diversified croplivestock operations raised hogs from birth to slaughter weight9 these hogs were sold to dozens of small to medium independently owned slaughter plants by 2003 the commercial us pork industry had changed dramatically due largely to the adoption of vertical production methods ie contr act production arrangements by few large integrators who also own slaugh ter and processing plants six large producers smithfield premium standard farms seaboard prestage cargill and iowa select together accounted for nearly 30 of us hog production in 2003 informa economics estimated that the hog production segment of th industry now has about 30 key firms plus several hundr ed additional significant operators in the packing slaughter sector less than dozen ke firms predominate informa reported10 another trend has been the expansion of producti on into other regions like the southeast production improvements lower costs of scale economies improved genetics and innovative management have enabled the united states to raise more meat with fewer sows and to become by 1995 net exporter of pork products it is now the thirdlargest exporter after the european uni on eu25 and cana da respectivelyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21985crs4 11 sources statistics canada and usdas national agricultural statistics service 12 these programs are described in 69 federal register pp 5180051811however the united states is net importer of live hogs almost all from canada imports have increased more than fivefold since 1989 to 74 million head in 2003 representing 73 of us production the 2003 imports were 30 higher than in 2002 and were expected to exceed 8 million in 2004 twothirds of the total imports are now feeder pigs and most of the rest slaughter hogs by contrast the united states exported approximately 170000 live hogs in 2003 many of them slaughter hogs to mexico canadas swine industry is bout onefourth the size of the us industry canada relies heavily on the us market sending to the united states nearly 25 of the 299 million head it marketed slaughter plus ex ports in 2003 crossborder trade reflects an increasingly integrated north american hogpork complex which has been facilitated in part by nafta the agreement and its predecessor the uscanada free trade agreement reduced tariffs and other trade barriers and allowed competitive market forces to play larger role in trade and industry trends according to usda the canadian breeding herd expande d by 40 from 1994 to 2004 from about 111 million head to155 million over the same peri od the us breeding herd declined by about 17 from 721 million to 6 million11 usda analysts point to number of factors spurring canadians to produce and export feed er pigs to the united states one was canadian government effort to curb s ubsidy expenditures in the 1990s notably graintransport subsidy without it grai n stayed in the western provinces to feed livestock also lower canadian subsidie s had led to reductions in previous us countervailing duties on canadian hogs and an appreciating us dollar against the canadian dollar from november 1996 to january 2002 favored canadian sellers starting in january 2002 steady appreciation in the ca nadian dollar then helped to slow but as of late 2004 not yet to halt the rate of canadian breedin g herd expansion usda said in the united states available slaughter capacity and dependabl feed supplies have been among the factors driving construction of hogfinishing facilities in corn belt states which helped to spur demand for feeder pigs according to usda canada has been willing provider usda and others also point out that manitoba with cooler climate and vast open spaces helping disease contro l provides more attr active conditions for siting largescale pig farrowing facilities than iowa and minnesota the primary destinations of feeder pigs sold in the ited states nppc has countered that numerous areas of the united states ffer similar climatic nd spatial conditions nppc asserts that the usda study failed to recognize that substantial government subsidies were the prime contributor to canadian ex pansion see next section arguments for and against the adcvd action for nppc asserts that canadian swine producers have received substantial subsidies from more than one dozen programs12 iowa state university agricultural economist dermott hayes asserts that the canadian agricultural stabilization program provided canadian swine producers with total of 1366 million which translated into an actual

httpwwwporktradeactionorgas much as 15 per pig hayes adds nppc argues that the docs cvd investigation erred by preliminarily determining that the federal income subsidies were not specifically targeted at the canadian hog industry by fi nding that the benefits were recurring and thus not countervailable and by failing to investigate the quebec program nppc contends that subsidies distort ma rkets by protecting canadian producers from normal economic risks as result nppc maintains canadian swine production has expanded even as net market returns are negative disrupting the normal hog cycle most of this overproduction nppc argues is ex ported to the united states where it harms us producers by depressing domestic pr ices from which canadian producers are unfairly immunized iowa states hayes calculated that the additional pork produced due to the quebec subsidies alone is equivalent to 30 of us exports13 against opponents including the pork trad action coalition contend that trade remedy actions are unjustified because swine prices are set by the market not canadian exporters hundreds of us farmers are buying the canadian pigs and raising them in the united states where they consume usgrown feed are slaughtered in us plants and are processed into highvalue pork products to meet strong domestic and export demand it is argued the preliminary dumping duties are tax that will make the pigs unaffordable to these farmers many of them nppc members the coalition contends calling the imports vital component in us pork industry pr oductivity and profits14 informa economics reports that the western corn belt has excess packing capacity and surplus feedgrain production to address this situati on the region imported about 20 million pigs in 2003 both from canada and from othe r states if this flow were sharply curtailed for some reason pl ant efficiency would immediat ely decline and permanent plant closures probably result informa obs erves see footnote 8 small producers have remained solvent by concentrating on finishin g out feeder pigs either under contract with an integrator or by indepe ndently importing them from else where including canada finishing barn involves less investment ris k labor and management expertise making these operations better fit for farms involve d in grain production as well as livestock according to the informa report the pork trade action coalition contends that canadian imports account for only 33 of the annual us market this figure is the live weight of the hogs or 27 billion pounds usdas 73 estimate of market share is based on the number of head the coalition also declares that us producers currently are r eceiving record prices and profits usda analysts confirm that str ong domestic and export demand for us pork products along with higher prices for compe ting beef helped to push the average price of hogs to an estimated 53 per 100 pounds cwt in 2004 the highest since 1990 additional observations under

poultry outlook november 18 2004 18 nppc says that due to the duty prices for feeder pigs will be higher in the united states benefitting those selling us feeder pigs but wer in canada though us feeder pig buyers will have to pay more anticipated higher prices for us slaughter hogs should offset all or part of this cost nppc arguesspecified quantifiable limits for those deemed to be the most distorting15 in its last notification of domestic farm support to the wto which was for 1999 canada reported that hog producers had received c160 million in support through pr ovincial programs or the equivalent of 62 of the value of production canada count ed this spending as amber box that is defined under the wt as potentially tradeproduction distorting elsewhere the organization for econo mic cooperation and development oecd has developed its own measure of major c ountries domestic supports both exempt and nonexempt and publishes them annually oe cd said its produ cer support estimate pse for canadian pigmeat was 7 of the value of production during 20022002 its comparable pse for the united states was 416 2004 usda analysis concluded that an final ad andor cvd penalty likely would result in slowing of north american pork market integration and decline in us imports of slaughter hogs as incentives increase to finish and slaughter them in canada us hog prices would increase to th benefit of us hog producers but at the expense of us hog buyers canadian domestic hog prices would decline17 the nppc materials further explain that canada lacks enough capacity to feed to slaughter weight the feeder pigs it will produ ce over the next 612 months so these would have continued to be exported to the united states in the short run assuring us feeders an adequate supply nppc argues that cana dian rather than us producers would absorb most of the net lower price impact of ne w duty leading to reduced canadian output18 usda and other analysts have noted nother possible consequence if dumping penalties and slowing imports of canadian swine had occurred an increase in canadian pork exports to the united states in 2005 usda expects us pork imports in 2005 to increase by nearly 10 to about 12 billion pounds december 2004 estimate according to some analysts canadian pork im ports would continue to trend higher over the long term if canada we re to add hog finishing and packing plant capacity creating more competition for those segments of the us industry in statement on april 6 2005 nppc said it would monitor the situation noting that the us government plans to meet with the canadian gove rnment to discuss the hog subsidies in the near future
