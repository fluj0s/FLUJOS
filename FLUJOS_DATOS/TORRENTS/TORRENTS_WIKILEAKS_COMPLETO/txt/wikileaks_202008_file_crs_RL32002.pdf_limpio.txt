summary the rate of breastfeeding in the united states has risen and fallen over time as result of changing lifestyles and the availability of substitutes for human milk however since the 1970s the rates of breastfeeding initiati on and duration have increased in part due to the increasing medical evidence of the significant health benefits both to mothers and children the federal governments health objectives for 2010 are for 75 of mothers to initiate br eastfeeding at the time of birth and for 50 to continue breastfeeding until their infants reach 6 months of age current rates are about 695 at the time of hospital discharge nd 325 at 6 months of age the health benefits to the infant include the high nutritional quality of human milk and decrease in various infectious and other diseases of infancy that are reduced by the antimicrobial antiin flammatory and immunologicalstimulating agents present mothers seem to benefit with more rapid return to the pre pregnancy state of their bodies improved glucose and lipid tabolism delayed ovulation and the possible re duction of certain cancers proponents of workplace lactation programs cite their benefits to employers as reduced employee absenteei sm increased productivity increased company loyalty and morale lower health care costs and improved employee retention the societal benefits of increased breastfeeding may include significant savings in health care costs savings in the costs of infant formula and the potential that intellectual development of children is enhanced by breastfeeding in the first year of life breastfeeding promotion is policy pr omoted by the us government and numerous nongovernmental organizations the infant formula industry also publishes educational literature that promotes breastfeeding as the preferred method of infant feeding in the first year of life federal legislation has pr omoted various aspects of breastfeeding the treasury and general govern ment appropriations acts of the last 4 years have contained provision that s upports breastfeeding at government sites in the 108th congress the pregnancy discrimination act amendm ents of 2003 s 418 was introduced to protect the rights of new mothers to breastfeed language in the leave child behind act of 2003 hr 936 and s 448 would require consideration of government policies to provide lactation facilities support nd services in the federal government it was reintroduced from the 107th congress the breastfeeding promotion act hr 285 introduced in the 107th congress would have provided protection of breastfeeding by new mother s required development of performance standard for breast pumps and provided ta x incentives to encourage employers to provide lactation programs as of nove mber 2002 32 states had enacted legislation to protect mothers and promote breastfeeding this report will be upda ted to track legislative developments httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32002contents t r n d s i n b r s t

products between 1946 and 1956 breastf eeding fell by 50 and by 1967 only 25 of american infants were being breastfed at the time of hospital discharge by 1982 the percentage of breastfed infants at discharge had grown to about 62 declined to around 46 in 1990 nd then had another upswing r eaching 64 in 19982 the pattern of breastfeeding for 6 month old infants parallels that for newborns although at considerably lowe r rate in 1998 about 29 of 6 month old infants were being breastfed current u s rates of breastfeeding are 695 for mothers inhospital and 325 at 6 mont hs postpartum

remained uneven among various population groups4 breastfeeding rates have generally been higher in western states and among women who were older college educated and multiparous given birth several times those who had not enrolled in the special supplemental nutrition progr am for women infants and children wic were not employed out side the home had normal bi rth weight infants and had higher

the home and participat ed in wic however these groups still remain the least likely to initiate breastfeeding health impacts for mothers and infants the documented advantages of extende d breastfeeding include nutritional immunological and psychological benefits to bot h the mother and child human milk provides optimal nutrition to infants in both its composition and balance of nutrients the relatively low protein content is adequate nutritionally while not putting an unnecessary load of nitrogen on the immature kidney human milk protein is mainly whey which is easily digestible by the in fant generous amount s of essential fatty acids saturated fatty acids mediumchain triglycerides and cholesterol are also present longchain polyunsaturated fatty acids promote optimal development of the central nervous system breast milk is re latively low in sodium content allowing fluid requirements to be t without overwhelming the re nal load the minerals in human milk are proteinbound and balanced for bioavailability and it provides iron zinc and calcium to meet infant needs while putting minimal demand on the maternal supply of these nutrients recent recommendations from the american academy of pediatrics suggest that exclusively breastfed infa nts should receive vitamin d supplementation to prevent rickets5 the academy recommends that vitamin supplements begin at 2 months of age and continue until the infants are cons uming at least 17 ounces daily of vitamin d fortified milk the use of multivitamin s containing 200 international units of vitamin d is suggested because supplements containing only vitamin d generally are too concentrated to be safe for routine use the recommendation also applied to nonbreastfe d babies who are drinking less than17 ounces of fortified formula or milk daily as well as children and adolescents who do not drink that much fortified milk get regular sunlight exposure or take multip vitamins with at least 200 international units of vitamin d previously physician s believed that babies got adequate amounts of vitamin d because sunlight stimulate s the body to produce vitamin d however recent recognition that sunlight exposure over time is risk factor for skin cancer has led to protecting children and infants in particular from di rect sunlight so they arehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32002crs3 6 national

protecti on during breastfeeding against diarrhea respiratory infections otitis media bacteremia bacterial meningitis botulism urinary tract infections and necrotizing enterocolitis7 the frequency of gastrointestinal infections appears to be significantly lower in breastfed infants compared to formulafed infants for some infections the durati on is shorter and the intensity is less in breastfed infants than in formulafed infants in addition breast milk appears to be protec tive against food allergies while considerable attention has focused on the health benefits of breastfeeding for the infant which is the reason given by most women who choose to breastfeed considerably less attention s been given to the health effects of breastfeeding on the mothers a1991 national academy of sc iences report concluded that there was insufficient evidence at that time to reach any conclusions on the impact of breast feeding on maternal health beyond the delay of return to regular ovulation8 more recent review of the maternal health benefits examined the short and longterm advantages from the available literature which continues to be limited9 breast feeding in the early postpartum period was shown to promote more rapid return of the uterus to its prepregnant state and ma also lead to more rapid return to pre pregnant weight among studies on durati on and intensity of l actation the majority showed significant association between lactation and weight loss although the researchers reported that there is evidence that lactation prevents obesity lactation also seems to affect glucose and lipid metabolism which may have implications for preventing the subsequent development of diabetes and heart disease lactation delays the return of ovulation and signifi cantly reduces fertility during the period of lactational amenorrhea while the researchers reported that the evidence from epidemiological studies is mixed several large studies have shown that extended lactation is

infant formula industry which consists of four compan ies in the united stat provides literature that supports the view that breastfeeding is the best choice in the first year of life an example is the recent publication of abbott laboratories10 societal impact of breastfeeding promotion the recognized societal benefits of an increase in the rate of breastfeeding until infants are 6 months old include the saving s that might be realized in health care costs an analysis of the economic bene fits of breastfeeding conducted by the economic research service of the us partment of agricu lture and published in 2001 estimated that minimum of 36 billion could be saved in the united states if breastfeeding increased from current levels to the levels recommended in healthy people 201011 this analysis represents cost savings from treatment of three childhood illnesses otitis media gastroente ritis and necrotizing enterocolitis and probably underestima tes total savings according to the researchers the savings to families of reduced spending on infant formula are substantial as well recent estimates are that outo fpocket costs for families that use infant formula amount to 855 for th first 6 months of life12 while breastfeeding would likely result in some increase in food cost s since lactating women have increased nutrient needs this cost would likely be less than the cost of infant formula for year the cost of purchasing form ula has been shown to be several hundred dollars more than the cost of providing supplemen tal food for the breastfeeding mother13 finally breastfeeding may enhance the intellectual development of children due to the benefits of certain polyunsat urated fatty acids dha docosahexaenoic acid and aa arachidonic acid that have b een demonstrated to promote visual and neural development the recent decision by infant formula manufacturers to add these expensive fatty acids to their pr oducts in order to provide product

status on initiation and duration of breast feeding american journal of public health vol 88 7 july 1998 pp 10421046 comparable to human milk suggests recognition of the potential benefit of these ingredients especially to premature infants factors affecting the decision to breastfeed decisions to initiate or refrain from breastfeeding are made for various reasons but number of barriers to breastfeeding have been identified significant factor is that breastfeeding is not necessarily accepted as cultural norm particularly within certain demographic groups the decline in breastfeeding several decades ago led to loss of traditional knowledge and support from the older generation for new mothers who wanted to breastfeed in addition health care professionals frequently lack adequate training in lact ation and managing breastfeeding problems when they arise with new mothers societal changes in childbearing and child rearing such as the increased numbers of teenage and single mothers and more reliance on child care outside the home also create challenges to sustained breast feeding in the workplace the relatively short term of maternity leave and difficulty of maintaining an adequate milk supply with prolonged separation from the infant contribute to early termination of breastfeeding the effect of the commercial sector on breastfeeding has also had an impact through both marketing practices and the availability of pr oducts that promote the use of human milk substitutes especially when these products are provided in hospital discharge packages while full time work has been shown to ve effect on the initiation of breastfeeding it does seem to have profound effect on breastfeeding duration14 one survey found that while equal numbers of employed and unemployed mothers initiated breastfeeding by the time their infants were 6 months old only 10 of fulltime employed working women reported that they were still breastfeeding compared to 24 of nonemployed women15 women who are presumed to have the most influence over their working conditi ons ie professiona l women are the most likely to breast feed after returning to work and have the longest duration of breast feeding regardless of the length of maternity leave the duration of maternity leave was shown to be highly significantly asso ciated with the duration of breastfeeding however this association does not necessarily mean that returning to work directly causes weaning some women may wean in anticipation of returning to work while others may wean in the face of difficu lties in managing both work and breast feeding16 breastfeeding supporters dvocate variety of ways to promote the initiation and duration of breastfeeding including more parttime em ployment opportunities improved training for health care personnel longer maternity leaves greater accesshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32002crs6 17 k tyler got milk breastfeeding programs human resources management

is seen as wa to support womans desire to breastfeed in making decision to provide lactation support facilities factors considered by employers include such issues as company size and the type of work company or agency performed that will be interrupted when breastfeeding occurs workplace lactation programs have been suggested to provide relatively inexpensive way to reduce employee absenteeism increase productivity increase company loyalty and morale lower health care costs and improve employee retention17 the provision of lactation services at the work site and during maternity leave seem to both enhance womans ability to initiate and sustain breastfeeding her child as well as commitment to the employer one review of the rise in breastfeeding in the united states suggested that pressure to remove existing barriers to breastfeeding could eventually come from health maintenance organizations and insurance companies which are increasingly likely to recognize the costs of not breastfeeding the author identified such options as flexible work hours and paid maternity l eave offered either by the government or familyfriendly workplaces that could in crease the ability of employed women to optimally feed their infants18 in countries where g overnments have passed laws which guarantee all mothers paid leave from their work with as much as 80 of their salary for 9 months af ter childbirth and in some cases up to year there has been significant increase in the preval ence of breastfeeding between 6 and 9 months of age19 the world health organizationunicef program to

lawshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32002crs9 observations on the promotion of breastfeeding there is substantial evidence that breas tfeeding of infants for 6 months and perhaps as much as year has significant health benefits to the child there also seems to be evidence that mothers benefit as well however less clear is the impact of programs to promote breastfeeding on the rates of breastfeeding initiation and duration while the rates of initiation are up compared to the rates in the 1970s these numbers are not maintained at 6 nd 12 months of age at the level current health guidelines would suggest for attaining maximum benefit for the child in healthy people 2010 the federal govern ment has set goal of increasing rates of breastfeeding providing mothers and their children with the necessary support for successful breastfeeding might contribute to the achievement of this goal various options that have been suggested include greater support in the workplace extended paid maternity l eave jobsharing or other parttime employment better training for health car professionals in working with pregnant and lactating women and pr oviding better coordination among government policies that promote women working and breastf eeding however given the difficulty experienced by many women of simu ltaneously balancin g the demands of employment and breastfeeding it is not possible to estimate the potential of these options in increasing the rate of breastfeeding toward meeting the national goals
