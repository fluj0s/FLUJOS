international journal of climatology date thu 24 apr 2008 193437 0700 replyto santer1llnlgov xflowed dear folks im forwarding an email from prof glenn mcgregor the ijoc editor who is handling our paper the email contains the comments of reviewer 1 and notes that comments from two additional reviewers will be available shortly reviewer 1 read the paper very thoroughly and makes number of useful comments the reviewer also makes some comments that i disagree with the good news is that reviewer 1 begins his review i use this personal pronoun because im pretty sure i know the reviewers identity by affirming the existence of serious statistical errors in dcps07 ive read the paper under review and also dcps07 and i think the present authors are entirely correct in their main point dcps07 failed to account for the sampling variability in the individual model trends and especially in the observational trend this was as i see it clearcut statistical error and the authors deserve the opportunity to present their counterargument in print reviewer 1 has two major concerns about our statistical analysis here is my initial reaction to these concerns concern 1 assumption of an ar1 model for regression residuals in calculating our adjusted standard errors we assume that the persistence of the regression residuals is welldescribed by an ar1 model this assumption is not unique to our analysis and has been made in number of other investigations the reviewer would like to see at least some sensitivity check of the standard error formula against alternative model assumptions effectively the reviewer is asking whether more complex time series model is required to describe the persistence estimating the order of more complex ar model is tricky business typically something like the bic bayesian information criterion or aic akaike information criterion is used to do this we could of course use the bic or aic to estimate the order of the ar model that best fits the regression residuals this would be nontrivial undertaking i think we would find that for different time series we would obtain different estimates of the bestfit ar model for example 20c3m runs without volcanic forcing might yield different ar model order than 20c3m runs with volcanic forcing its also entirely likely based on rick katzs experience with such ar modelfitting exercises that the aic and bicbased estimates of the ar model order could differ in some cases as the reviewer himself points out dcps07 didnt make any attempt to calculate the standard error of individual trend estimates and this remains the major difference between the two paper in other words our paired trends test incorporates statistical uncertainties for both simulated and observed trends in estimating these uncertainties we account for nonindependence of the regression residuals in contrast the dcps07 trend consistency test does not incorporate any statistical uncertainties in either observed or simulated trends this difference in treatment of trend uncertainties is the primary issue the issue of whether an ar1 model is the most appropriate model to use for the purpose of calculating adjusted standard errors is really subsidiary issue my concern is that we could waste lot of time looking at this issue without really enlightening the reader about key differences between our significance testing testing procedure and the dcps07 approach one solution is to calculate for each model and observational time series used in our paper the parameters of an ark model where k is the total number of time lags and then apply equation 839 in wilks 1995 to estimate the effective sample size we could do this for several different k values eg k2 k3 and k4 weve already done the k1 case we could then very briefly mention the sensitivity of our paired trend test results to choice of order k of the ar model this would involve some work but would be easier to explain than use of the aic and bic to determine for each time series the bestestimate of the order of the ar model concern 2 attempt to combine data across model runs the reviewer is claiming that none of our modelvsobserved trend tests made use of data that had been combined averaged across model runs this is incorrect in fact our two modified versions of the dcps07 test page 29 equation 12 and page 30 equation 13 both make use of the multimodel ensemblemean trend the reviewer argues that our paired trends test should involve the ensemblemean trends for each model something which we have not done rather than the trends for each of 49 individual 20c3m realizations im not sure whether the rationale for doing this is as clearcut as the reviewer contends furthermore there are at least two different ways of performing the paired trends tests with the ensemblemean model trends one way which seems to be what the reviewer is advocating involves replacing in our equation 3 the standard error of the trend for an individual realization performed with model with model as intraensemble standard deviation of trends im little concerned about mixing an estimate of the statistical uncertainty of the observed trend with an estimate of the sampling uncertainty of model as trend alternately one could use the average over different realizations of model as adjusted standard errors or the adjusted standard error calculated from the ensemblemean model time series im willing to try some of these things but im not sure how much they will enlighten the reader and they will not help to make an alreadylengthy manuscript any shorter the reviewer seems to be arguing that the main advantage of his approach 2 use of ensemblemean model trends in significance testing relative to our paired trends test his approach 1 is that nonindependence of tests is less of an issue with approach 2 im not sure whether i agree are results from tests involving gfdl cm20 and gfdl cm20 temperature data truly independent given that both models were forced with the same historical changes in anthropogenic and natural external forcings the same concerns apply to the high and lowresolution versions of the miroc model the giss models etc i am puzzled by some of the comments the reviewer has made at the top of page 3 of his review i guess the reviewer is making these comments in the context of the pairwise tests described on page 2 crucially the comment that we should use the standard error if testing the average model trend and by standard error he means dcps07s sigmase is inconsistent with the reviewers approach 3 which involves use of the intermodel standard deviation in testing the average model trend and i disagree with the reviewers comments regarding the superfluous nature of section 6 the reviewer states that when simulating from know statistical model the test statistics should by definition give the correct answer the whole point of section 6 is that the dcps07 consistency test does not give the correct answer when applied to randomlygenerated data in order to satisfy the reviewers curiosity im perfectly willing to repeat the simulations described in section 6 with higherorder ar model however i dont like the idea of simulation of synthetic volcanoes etc this would be huge time sink and would not help to illustrate or clarify the statistical mistakes in dcps07 its obvious that reviewer 1 has put substantial amount of effort into reading and commenting on our paper and even performing some simple simulations im grateful for the effort and the constructive comments but feel that number of comments are offbase am i misinterpreting the reviewers comments with best regards ben benjamin d santer program for climate model diagnosis and intercomparison lawrence livermore national laboratory

would give you head start in your preparation for revisions accordingly please find attached one set of comments hopefully i should have two more to follow in the near future best prof glenn mcgregor
