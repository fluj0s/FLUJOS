establishment of the advanced research projects agency energy arpae within the departme nt of energy doe as part of the america competes act pl 11069 modeled on the defense advanced research projects agency darpa arpae would support transformational energy technology research projects with the goal of enhancing the nations economic and energy security proponents of arpae contend that additional scie nce and technology would help respond to the nations need for clean affordable and reliable energy opponents question whether arpae is necessary to develop new technologies when existing energy technologies are not fully utilized due to insufficient policies to encourage their implementation arpae proponents counter that arpae is needed to catalyze the energy marketplace by accelerating research that will bridge the gap between basic research and industrial product development the bush administration questions whether the darpa model can be used for the energy sector and is concerned that it might redirect funds away from current doe research activities particularly the doe office of science instead the presidents fy2009 budget requests funding for six new technology transfer collaborations arpae proponents doubt that doe can achieve arpaes goals with its existing structure and personnel as opposed to the arpaes innovative rd management design congress authorized 300 million for arpae in fy2008 and such sums as are necessary for fy2009 and fy2010 congress subsequently appropriated funds for fy2008 the administration requested funds for arpae in fy2009 congress is currently debating whether to fund arpae in fy2009 and if so the amount that should be appropriated the house committee on appropriations draft fy2009 energy and water development appropriations report would provide 15 million for arpae while the senate committee on appropriations bill and report s 3258 s rept 110416 does not include any funding several bills propose methods of funding arpae

5012 the goal of arpae would be to enhance the economic and energy security of the united states through the development of technologies that reduce energy imports reduce energyrelated greenhouse gas emissions and improve energy efficiency in all economic sectors in addition arpae would aim to ensure that the united states is technical leader in developing and deploying advanced energy technologies according to the act arpae would achiev this goal by identifying and promoting revolutionary advances in fundamental sciences and translating scientific discoveries and cutting edge inventions into technological innovations arpae would focus its efforts on accelerating transformational technological advances in areas that industry by itself is not likely to undertake due to technical and financial uncertainty as stated in 5012 the agencys programs would accelerate novel earlystage energy research with possible technology applications the development of techniques processes and technologies and related testing and evaluation research and development rd of manufacturing processes for novel energy technologies and coordination with nongovernmental entities to demonstrate technologies and research applications to facilitate technology transfer to achieve these goals arpae would make awards to academic institutions companies research foundations and trade and industry research collaborations as well as consortia of these organizations that could additionally include federally funded research and development centers ffrdcs according to the act the criteria for selecting projects would include novelty scientific and technical merit the demonstrated capability of the applicant to successfully carry out the proposed project future commercial

have3 the act states that arpae would be managed by presidentially appointed director who would report to the secretary of energy the director would approve all new programs develop funding criteria establish technical milestones to assess program success and terminate programs not achieving their goals the director would have the authority to appoint 70 to 120 scientific engineering and professional personnel without regard to civil service laws and to determine their compensation the director would be responsible for ensuring that arpae activities are coordinated with and do not duplicate doe and other federal programs and laboratory activities the program managers would establish rd goals and select projects based on merit both the director and the program managers would be permitted to seek advice on the overall direction of arpae and specific program tasks from new arpae advisory committee or existing doe federal advisory committees additional sources of advice provided for in the act include the presidents council of advisors on science and technology pcast professional organizations and disciplinary societies 4 2 testimony of dr anthony tether director

openminded skeptic regarding arpae and pointed out that the recommendation for its establishment was based on four assumptions that he considered questionable the problem with the energy market is that the supply of new technologies is insufficient the supply of new technologies is constr ained because of lack of fundamental research sensible way to promote more fundamental research is to apply the darpa model to civilian energy sector and implementing the darpa model is the best way to improve energy research given tight federal budgets18 in the 110th congress the house committee on science and technology held similar hearing in his opening statement the committee chairman stated that among several policy goals and objectives darpa has succeeded largely because it continued to foster culture of innovation the key for arpae success he said is that it be similarly nimble organization with minimal administrative layers and the ability to quickly start and stop research programs according to the chair investment in arpae must be seen as the first step in boosting energy research and development to level that addresses the scale of our challenge and the true cost of doing transformational research19 the administration formally opposed the authorization of arpae during the 110th congress the administration supports the conceptual goal of arpae to overcome the longterm and highrisk technological barriers in the development of energy technologies however the administration continues to strongly object to this provision due to serious doubts about the applicability of the national defense model to the energy sector and because new bureaucracy at the doe would drain resources from priority basic research efforts the administration believes that the goal of developing novel advanced energy technologies should be addressed by giving the secretary of energy the flexibility to empower and reward programs within existing doe offices to fund unique crosscutting and highrisk research 20 the following sections discuss several key questions debated during the house science and technology and senate committee on energy and natural resources hearings

central intelligence agency cia venture capital firm that provides funding to identify develop and deliver technologies of interest to the intelligence community is better mode l for the energy marketplace than darpa see box 3 below proponents state that arpae will address organizational problems at doe by being small and flexible unlike existing doe organizations which they believe are riskaverse and do not sufficiently interact with each other to reach the nations energy goals in addition proponents argue that arpae should focus on breakthrough research using emerging basic research in areas such as nanotechnology to develop totally new technologies as opposed to existing programs that have already identified paths forward and tend to focus on incremental advances further unlike current programs arpae is designed to bridge the gap between basic research and industrial developmentnot to get products to the marketplace but to transform the marketplace by accelerating research in response to the claim that arpae will be more flexible and less riskadverse critics point out that the new organization will still be within doe so there is guarantee that doe management will let it take more risks than existing programs in response to the claims that arpae would bridge the gap between basic re search and industrial development and that existing applied programs tend to focus on incremental advances some critics argue that reforming does existing programs would be better than creating new organization advocates for arpae indicated that candidate energy technologies are not yet at stage where venture capital investment such as occurs with in qtel would provide the best return at some point however arpae research may lead to technologies appropriate for venture capital at that stage it might be appropriate to incorporate venture capital component into arpaes design just as darpa has evolved over 50 years arpae may need to evolve as

funding for arpa start at 300 million the first year and increase gradually over five or six years to 1 billion per year at that point the programs effectiveness would be evaluated and appropriate actions taken according to the report one issue discussed in hearings was whether the level of authorized funding for arpae is sufficient to support the research necessary for arpae to reach its goals some noted with concern that the proposed 300 million in fy2008 was less than 002 of the transportation and energy industries annual revenues level they believed was insufficient relative to the potential return some suggested that if it is to be successful arpae needs to be funded at level comparable to darpaabout 3 billion per year 23 23 darpas fy2008 budget is 30 billion its fy2009 request

not believe arpae should be funded due to budget constraints arpae they argued would be funded by shifti ng resources from does office of science increasing funding for the doe office of science is also goal of the america competes act some hearing witnesses expressed concern that dilution of doe office of science resources might influence does acceptance of arpae and hinder its success supporters of arpae agreed that funding for the doe office of science is the highest priority and testified that funding for arpae should not be redirected from that office some witnesses expressed concerns that riskt olerant agency like arpae could not survive if it was subject to the annual appropriations cycle political and financial pressures and resource fluctuations that might stifle innovation to over come this potential challenge some testifying proposed dedicated funding see below g25g146g149g149g561g3g20g18g3g556g7g561g25g152g155g148g501g561 some critics believe that what is preventing the united states from reaching its energy goals is not federal funding for innovative highrisk research but rather lack of privatesector investment in basic research failure to effectively transfer new energy technologies to the marketplace or some combination of these they point out the lack of captive customer energy has broad and diverse public and private market while darpa has dod as its single primary customer guaranteeing solid base of demand arpae proponents indicated that arpae is needed for translational research this type of research identifies the most pressing market needs selects and funds the most promising scientific approaches to enable breakthrough products and brings the best candidates of those products to the brink of production

the secretary of energy has issued new policy on technology transfer that espouses goals similar to that of arpae27 as result of this policy doe will now pool funds from the office of science and other programs to fund six new collaborations that integrate basic and applied research according to doe funding for these collaborations will be based on congressional language that requires doe to set aside 09 of its applied energy research and development budget for technology transfer28 for fy2009 doe has also proposed 100 million for new office of science program energy frontier research
