interview prospective witnesses committees consider people from diverse backgrounds including individuals from the executive branch state local or other regional governments academia business and interest groups as well as other private citizens committee may invite as many witnesses as it chooses and may schedule multiple days of hearings in some cases committee will strive to make sure that all reasonable points of view are represented while in other cases witnesses expressing only particular points of view will be invited typically the minority works informally with the majority to invite witnesses representing its views house rules allow the minority party members of committee to call witnesses of their choice on at least one day of hearing majority of the minority members must make this request to the committee chair before completion of the hearings rule xi clause 2j1 once suitable witnesses are identified the committee chair usually sends each witness formal letter of invitation this letter generally provides the witness some basic information on the proposed hearing including the purpose subject date time and location in addition to specifying the aspects of measure or issue the witness should address the letter might indicate limitation on the length of witnesss oral testimony the letter of invitation might also request that the witness send the committee biographical information and an advance copy of his or her written testimony the latter generally being required under house rules rule xi clause 2g4 certain committee rules also specify that witnesses should submit copies of proposed testimony in electronic format the committee might also send the witness additional information this information could include list of committee members the committees rules copy of the measure under consideration and articles relating to the issue often staff contact is indicated committee staff will often meet witnesses before hearing to answer questions and to review procedure committee may reimburse witness for expenses related to testimony and the letter of invitation may address this point

appear through subpoena rule xi clause 2m committees also may subpoena documents subpoenas are used infrequently usually at investigative hearings committee may authorize and issue subpoena with majority quorum present committee may however delegate this authority to its chair under any limitations it establishes in practice many committees generally require majority approval to issue subpoena other committees have delegated general subpoena authority to the chair

testimony the traditional format is that witness makes statement and then takes questions from committee members before the next witness testifies committees may also employ panel format often for witnesses with divergent viewpoints it is normally the practice in this case for all panel members to make statements then for committee members to pose questions to the panel or to various panelists some observers believe this format stimulates debate and elicits more pertinent information committees sometimes use other formats for gathering information such as seminars roundtable discussions and video conferencing with witnesses who may be located almost anywhere in the world the order in which witnesses testify is arranged at the discretion of the committee protocol dictates that member of congress generally testifies before other witnesses and similar privilege often is extended to highranking executive branch officials and to former members and highlevel government officials celebrity witnesses are carefully placed in the lineup because they often generate media coverage and public attention to an issue testimony from academics interestgroup representatives and other private citizens may be arranged in way that most favorably presents information and communicates the intent of the committee for example committee may arrange its witnesses to allow one individual to refute arguments made by another witness g3g158g157g145g152g155g561g5g152g151g157g138g140g157g561g11g151g143g152g155g150g138g157g146g152g151g561 christopher m davis analyst on the congress and legislative
