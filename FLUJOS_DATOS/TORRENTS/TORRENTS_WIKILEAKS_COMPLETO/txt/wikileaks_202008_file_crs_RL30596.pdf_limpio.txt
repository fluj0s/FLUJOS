implementation of these recommendations was to be accomplished through presidential directives congressional action and individual agency initiatives year later in september 1994 the npr issued status report indicating that 90 of its initial recommendations were being implemented 469 billion of its 108 billion in projected savings had been enacted an additional 16 billion in savings was pending

agencies were abolished additional npr status reports recommendations and proposals followed in 1996 1997 and 1998 republican congressional majorities continued during the 105th and 106th congresses administration and congressional reinvention and reform efforts resulted in moderate accomplishments during the 105th congress significant exceptions were the overhaul of the structure and operations of the internal revenue service and the consolidation of the foreign policy agencies both of which were realized as result of cooperation between the clinton administration and republican

to the npr endowing entrepreneuri government with empowered customers comp etition markets reduced regulations charging fees and making money decentralization and privatization he cautioned that

overlooked the importance of government capacity the reports author donald kettl wrote of the risk of an even more hollow government with far less capacity to do its job and managed by employees with even less incentive to do their jobs well38 third the report expressed concern about the lack of clarity in the core npr ideas the principles and purposes behind the reform needed to be more clearly defined or risk losing focus or creating conflicting agendas fourth the reform efforts plan to decentralize government and empower employees to be more entrepreneu rial risked damage to accountability particularly to congress some in academic circles went beyond the brookings report in arguing that the entrepreneurial focus of the npr was in tension with the presidents constitutional duty to take care that the laws be faithfully executed39 according to these critics public law creates system of accountability by the bureaucracy to the president and congress that is eroded when government functions are decentralized and privatized in the process of establishing entrepreneurial incentives the general accounting office gao also evaluated the success of the implementation of npr recommendations on their own terms assessing progress on each of the 384 major proposals from the september 1993 report as well as the reform effort as whole gao found that about 40 of the recommendations had been fully or partly implemented noting that the recommendations varied widely in their specificity and scope it applauded most of the recommendations and achievements of the npr but also expressed concern about its failure to address critical management issues that gao had previous ly identified as gao representatives later testified before the house subcommittee on government management information and technology in may 1995 the npr did not address number of issues that the office of management and budget and we consider to be highrisk areas these issues include defense inventory management practices that have resulted in unneeded inventory valued by the department of defense at 36 billion and problems plaguing federal information technology initiatives such as the federal aviation administrations air traffic control modernization project the npr recommendations also did not address nearly threefourths of the issues we identified last year for the former chairman of this committee as the most important management problems facing 23 federal agencies these issues include the lack of effective controls over department of defense disbursements and inadequate project management and planning in the department of energy therefore while we believe the recommendations npr made are an important contribution toward improved federal management we also

republican congress shortly after the nprs 1994 status report was released the republicans won majority control of the house and senate in midterm elections and the focus of the congressional agenda with regard to public administration turned to reducing the size and scope of the federal government the agenda was based on the republicans contract with america which called for the end of government that is too big too intrusive and too easy with the publics money the new republican majorities in the house and senate facilitated passage of the line item veto act which president clinton supported and which vested him with more control of unwanted budgetary expenditures43 they pressed for passage of the unfunded mandates reform act of 1995 which limits the ability of the federal

set of recommendations and also articulated the administrations new vision for the npr claiming that one third of the original recommendations had been completed and that nearly all of the others were underway the report also announced more than 180 new recommendations that had arisen for phase ii as presaged in rivlins testimony the new recommendations focused on devolving discontinuing or privatizing government functions despite the similarity of stated gover nment reform goals expressed by republican congressional leaders and the administration wide differences in the scale and location of the reductions were evident in the rhetoric and proposals of each camp republican congressional leaders had bold agenda for decreasing the size of government through contracting out privatizing government functions and cutting the number of programs and agencies for example representative john l mica r fl chair of the subcommittee on civil service committee on government reform and oversight reportedly proposed contracting out half of the federal governments activities to the private sector52 privatization efforts spearheaded by representative scott l klug rwi focused on the petrole um reserves helium reserves power marketing administrations pmas and the government printing office53 congressional intentions for decreasing the size of the federal government were probably best reflected in the plans of senate budget committee chairman pete v domenici rnm and house budget committee chairman john kasich roh which promised to save 806 billion and 1 trillion respectively both plans called for significant government reductions kasichs plan for example reportedly called for the elimination of three cabinet departments 13 agencies 68 boards commissions and authorities and over 230 programs54 the savings reported and proposed by the administration were modest by comparison the 1995 status report stated that around 58 billion of the originally projected savings of 108 billion had been realized and that the remaining 50 billion was either pending before congress or to be acted on in the near future55 some 70 billion in additional savings was projected from the phase ii recommendationshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30596crs14 56ibid p 3 57peri arnold making the managerial presidency p 414 58us congress senate committee on governmental affairs executive branch continuedtaken together these savings were far from the target figures of the congressional republicans the federal government reduction envisioned by the npr also differed from that of the republicans whereas republican congressional leaders wanted to dismantle entire departments and agencies recommendations for elimination or revision of regulations by 28 agencies and departments with major regulatory responsibility formed the focal point of the new phase of the npr the npr report asserted agencies are sendi ng 16000 pages of obsolete regulations to the scrap heap of 86000 pages of regulations reviewed agencies are reworking another 31000 pages of regulations regulatory and administrative burdens on the public will be reduced by nearly 28 billion attitudes are changing in many cases fines will be waived for honest mistakes agencies are closing more than 2000 field offices 56 according to one observer phase ii of the npr was designed to highlight reform work that was underway in the agencies prior to 1995 and the refocusing of the npr was essentially political response to the results of the midterm elections increased activity in regulatory reform during 1995 offers window onto the nprs methods substantive work towards reform was undertaken within the regulatory agencies and not within the task force itself those agencies reviewed regulations in the code of federal regulations and reassessed and proposed changes in their regulatory procedures essentially at this stage much of the substantive work of reform was happening in regulatory agencies and was overseen by omb57 the lack of cooperation between congress and the executive on government reform had been noted by gao regarding the 103rd congress when the democrats were in the majority in both houses of congress gao reiterated this concern regarding the 104th congress and the administration in testimony before the senate committee on governmental affairs as the following passages illustrate reorganization demands an integrated approach reorganization plans should be designed to achieve specific identifiable goals once the goals are identified the right vehicles must be chosen for

interconnectedness of government structures and activities make changes here and you will certainly affect something over there and just as the lack of an overall vision created many of the inefficiencies that exist in the federal government today reorganizatio n efforts that ignore the broader picture could create new unintended consequences for the future for this reason it is imperative that congress and the administration form an effective working relationship on restructuring initiatives and regulatory changes 60 the administrations vision of the role of congress in addressing the proposed npr reforms was unclear in the 1995 status report on the one hand the report continued to credit congress with support saying congress has enacted 36 nprrelated laws including the biggest procurement streamlining bill ever with second in progress congress has passed 66 of the 280 npr items requiring legislation 24 percent nearly 70 nprrelated bills are currently pending in congress congress has held more than 120 hearings on various npr recommendations61 howeve r on the other hand the report criticized the republican majority in congress for its concept of reducing the size of government some people including many in congress have decided that the way to fix government is just to eliminate as much of it as possible the main problem with taking an axe to the federal government is that it wont fix what remains government would be smaller but it would still be as inflexible and bureaucratic 62 the budget impasse the gulf between the conceptions of government reform

agencies in line with the cont ract with america agenda while the administration promoted reductio ns in government through the efficiencies of reinvention the npr was used to articulate the administrations position during this period but the administrations ultimate success did not provide clear mandate for the future form or scope of government one analyst observed despite the rhetorica l skirmishes there was little real sorting out of the governments functions reorganizing of its operations or shrinking of its role in the end the clinton administration maneuvered its way out of the crisis by outflanking congr essional republicans if the administration was politically stronger however the reinventing government movement was weakened by the quick shifts in tactics and the diffusion of its focus 64 firstterm npr on march 4 1996 the vice president consolidated the vision of the npr to be carried into the 1996 elections building on phase i and ii themes in the post budget battle environment gore delivered speech entitled governing in balanced budget world the published documentation accompanying the speech articulated six goals65 most of them like improving customer service covered familiar ground in addition gore advocated the conversion of appropriate agencies to performance based organizations pbos which would have greater autonomy in their management practices in return for increased accountability to performance standards the third status report which was released later that year just two months prior to the election made mention of pbos but rather highlighted npr themes and summarized the reinvention achievements of the first three years on an agency by agency basis it reported 974 billion in savings based on agency implementation of npr recom mendations or their adoption of npr principles it also reported personnel reductions procurement reform personnel policy reforms improved customer service reduced more streamlined and less

itself the goals it sought to accomplish and the means by which it would do so this third phase began with the presentation of the blair house papers to new cabinet in 1997 and culminated in the formal change of the nprs name to the national partnership for reinventing government in 1998 this period was characterized by increasing efforts to involve the american public in government reinvention reinventing the reinvention effort in the third phase of its reinvention effort from 19971999 the npr engaged in three campaigns to further define its agenda and its strategies as well as reiterate its support for past initiatives the blair house papers businesslike government lessons learned from americas best companies and the birth of the national partnership for reinventing government appeared to be attempts to stimulate both public and intragovernmental support for the reinvention cause however according to one observer the npr has presented different faces without fundamentally changing its direction because its overall project of reform has been eclectic from the beginning70 in january 1997 the npr ushered in its third phase when as vice president gore explained president clinton and i called the new cabinet to blair house to give them their reinvention marching orders71 the blair house papers reemphasized traditional npr rules and principles regarding the delivery of service the fostering of partnerships and community solutions and the reinvention of government to get the job done with less however the blair house papers reiterated and

papers p 42although the pbo plan was first outlined by vice president gore in his march 1996 speech72 the model was further refined and placed at the top of the nprs agenda with the blair house papers while the pbo is term of art is not yet legally defined and has been used to refer to varying levels of organizational autonomy the general pbo concept is spelle d out in the blair house recommendations the pbo model largely relies on businesslike practices and is discussed in market terms it is inspired by the next steps initiative in great britain and is based on the idea that organizations when exempt from federal procurement and personnel rules will perform more efficiently under new sets of incentives and higher levels of accountability pbos are to be managed by hired chief executive who will be held accountable to the appropriate department secretary and this relationship is to be governe d by an annual performance agreement thus the chief executive has incentive to ensure that the organization performs well this is further reinforced by making portion of the chief executives salary dependent upon the organizations performance underlying the pbo model is the separation of decisionmaking and policymaking authority from implementation authority and candidates for pbo status must fulfill certain number of prerequisites which were set out in the blair house papers have clear mission measurable services and performance measurement system in place or in development generally focus on external not internal customers have clear line of accountability to an agency head who has policy accountability for the functions have top level support to transfer function into pbo have predictable sources of funding73 based on these prerequisit the clinton administration identified its first candi dates for pbos in both the blair house papers and the presidents fy1998 budget they included the national technical information service the patent and

from business noting that american companies have already been through the transformation from industrialage to informationage management they have been through the learning curve they have made the mistakes and fixed them 74 while the report reiterated the basic npr tenets it was significant for its efforts to make the npr and its agenda readily accessible to the american public in the context of the nprs evolution the report reflected the changing nature of the npr and its outreach beyond the washington beltway to the general public the pinnacle of reinventing the reinvention effort was reached in march 1998 when the national performance review on its fifth anniversary formally became the national partnership for reinventing government along with the new name the npr adopted new strategies and principles the npr longer sought merely to make government work better and cost less instead it reorganized into eight teams focused on partnering with federal agencies state and local governments the private sector and citizen organizations to deliver hasslefree service create safer healthier america develop stronger and safer communities and families make the economy stronger technologically transform america engage americans in conversation about reinventing government create the most wellmanaged government in history model the office of the future 75 the npr sought to achieve these goals by fostering partnerships encouraging agencies to use balanced measures creating an electronic government and publicizing its message it focused on 32 high impact agencies those with the most interaction with the american people according to npr officials the groups new plan was to align around clear vision value and goal and carry on conversation with americans about what

potentially benefitting vice president gores 2000 bid for the presidency npr will be reviewed as if it demonstrates the vice presidents ability to lead his fiscal understanding of government can he run large organization npr director morley winograd is reported to have commented77 from this viewpoint the npr attempted to broaden its political appeal by refocusing its mission as the npr began to comm it itself to these broader political goals the gap between megapolitics and front line management began to grow while winograd contended that the npr could create safer neighborhoods by publicizing technological cultural and process changes made by new york and boston police78 the process reforms that the npr was undertaking in the view of one observer had little or direct connection with the achievement of the broader goals the npr had promised the american public79 winograd concluded that in seeking political relevance and moving past process npr distanced itself from its ability to identify accomplish and measure results through its own actions80 he judged that in phase iii the npr risked making pledges on which it could not deliver and focusing government employees on processes indirectly linked at best with phase iiis broader policy agenda81 although the npr spent much of 19971998 revamping its image and redefining its strategies and goals government reform efforts continued in other quarters overhauling the structure and operations of the internal revenue service irs for example was major accomplishment of the 105th congress number of development s contributed to this overhaul in 1984 the irs began replacing its outdated computer system few years later gao questioned the modernization effort and alleged that the irs had wasted billions of dollars on unwisely chosen computer purchases due to the lack of any overall plan for the computer system and reluctance to engage compu ter experts outside the irs in response congress mandated the national commission on restructuring the irs in late 199582 headed by senator robert kerrey dne and representative rob portman roh the commission sought to evaluate the irs and make recommendations

administration over the role of the proposed independent board of directors prior to the dissemination of the commissions report the administrati on had announced its intention to reform and reorganize the irs overhaul of the irs had been one of the original 1993 recommendations made by the npr eventually comprehensive plan for irs reform was unveiled by the administration in october 1997 with an announcement that it would be implemented immediately based on report by vice president gore and treasury secretary robert rubin the plan focused on improving custom er service giving taxpayers new ways to solve problems expanding taxpayer rights and remedies and creating new irs board of trustees83 however few days later the clinton administration abandoned its opposition to congressional reform of the irs and legislation embodying the recommendations of the irs reform commis sion was subsequently adopted in the house in january 1998 the senate committee on finance revealed abuses by the irs against taxpayers it had accused of noncompliance these abuses were said to stem from basing performance evaluations of employees on their success in bringing in revenue the chairman of the committee on finance senator william v roth jr rde drafted reform bill and offered it for consideration and markup at committee meeting on march 31 roths bill was adopted in may

105th congress when two omnibus bills and an additional senate proposal were introduced again the proposed measures were not passed by congress and the administration indicated that legislation converting the pto to pbo status would be offered in the 106th congress see hr 1907 in many regards converting the pto to pbo status did not succeed because the npr seemingly failed to anticipate congressional union and intragovernmental unwillingness to increase the autonomy of the pto by making it pbo without an effective strategy for dealing with congress the npr had relied on administrative action to accomplish many of its goals however the conversion of the pto to pbo status could occur only through legislative action and there was considerable amount of congressio nal resistance to relinquishing control over agencies as the pbo concept would place more power in the hands of the few and congress would lose some of its oversight authority86 furthermore labor unions strongly opposed pbo conversion that would exempt the pto from existing personnel rules in addition some saw executive branch resistance to pbo conversion legislation freeing the pto from the general services admini strations monopoly on real property services which the administrations bill did not do87 the first pbo was created with the enactment of the higher education amendments of 1998 when the department of educations student financial services were vested in new office of student financial assistance osfa88 headed by chief operating officer selected by the secretary of education the osfa was given independent control of its budget and finances personne l decisions and processes procurements and other administrative and management functions compensation of the chief operating

npr had in converting government agencies into pbos while the administration had long sought to convince congress to convert the pto and saint lawrenc seaway development corporation to pbo status the depar tment of education proposal was easily accepted in the house the higher education amendments of 1998 were adopted on 4144 vote and in the senate they were approved on 961 vote subsequently the conference report was passed by the house on voice vote and by the senate on 960 recorded vote the ease of passage may be attributed to the genesis of this particular initiative although the pbo model had been developed and promoted by the administration the initiative for the creation of osfa came from the republicans on the house committee on education and the workforce which adapted the administrations idea and applied it to the financial aid services the creation of the first pbo revitalized administration efforts to reinvent government by marketizing governmental functions in february 1999 the presidents fy2000 budget indicated that the pto defense commissary agency us mint and seafood inspection service which had been proposed for conversion to pbo status in past years would be offered again as pbo candidates in the 106th congress other entities recom mended for pbo status were the rural telephone bank the national technical information service and the federal lands highway program late in 1999 the president signed consolidated appropriations bill that included the american inventors protection act which reorganized the pto as an independent agency within the department of commerce but contrary to the claim of the reconstituted pto did not transform it in the view of many analysts into pbo89 in the closing weeks of his tenure president clinton with eo

saying npr claimed savings from agencyspecific recommendations that could not be fully attributed to its efforts in general the savings estimates we reviewed could not be replicated and there was way to substantiate the savings claimed we also found that some savings were overstated because omb counted savings twice and two of the estimates were reported incorrectly resulting in claims that were

observer states these downsizing efforts proved detrimental to morale among government employees and failed to win political favor with the american public93 this downsizing produced larger cuts in the frontline government employees than in the middle levels of federal government this development was contrary to the administrations promise to cut middle management who pushed paper and contributed to the burea ucracy and to preserve the top managers who made decisions and the frontline employees who delivered the services94 this observer donald kettl gave the npr and its government reinvention efforts favorable review and an overall grade of b he acknowledged that the npr had forge d new ground sustained the reinvention effort and realized important accomplishments among these he gave procurement reform an and the npr an for effort however he gave the npr d for identifying the objectives of government and for relations with congress incomplete grades were assigned for improving results in high impact programs and for service coordination95 while kettl delivered favorable yet critical review of the npr he brought to light important challenges that the organization would have to grapple with in order to continue reinvention efforts in the remaining months of the clinton administration he indicated that perhaps the greatest challenge to the nprs efforts had been guarded and sometimes resistant congress the nprs strategy of integrating government services conflicted with congresss traditional and fragmentedcommittee jurisdictions for the nprs first 18 months not always friendly democratic congress saw little reason to tangle with management reform while fighting battles on health care and other clinton proposals for the next three years republican congress has interest in acting on initiatives put forward by the leading candidate for the democratic partys 2000 presidential nomination96 however congress has not been the only entity to challenge npr reinvention efforts resistance also exists within the executive branch kettl further found that the npr failed to enlist support for reinvention from the administ rations own politica l appointees and from senior career civil servants this failure he noted produced an npr campaign with uneven effects among the agencies particularly where appointed leaders failed to connect with the reinvention effort97 moreover executive branch concerns about deregulation and pbos have delayed the implementation of the administratio ns pbo plan the delay according to onehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30596crs26

had been claimed in the september 1995 common sense government report that second annual npr progress report claimed that third of its recommended actions had been completed the gaos report demurred finding that 24 percent of the recommendations had been fully implemented and with most others still in progress as had been reported by the gao in 1994 thus in one year the rate of completion of recommendations had grown from 4 percent to 24 percent and there seemed genera l support for action on many of the remaining recommendations101 to this record of implementation or partial implementation of many npr recommendations may be added some other concrete achievements for example as arnold noted while agency action accounted for the implementation of at least 292 recommendations the npr was not completely lacking in legislative success legislative action was the second most common means of implementation of npr recommendations by december 1994 169 of the recommendations were introduced within legislation and 83 recommendations were enacted presidential actions addressed at least 86 recommendations also congressional support for reinvention continued into the republican congress after 1994 there was substantial synergy between the new republican agenda for reducing government and the nprs recommendations for simplifying government thus legislation such as the unfunded mandate reform act of 1995 the small business lending enhancement act of 1995 and several of the 1996 appropriations acts incorporated npr recommendations102 the npr later reported that as of march 1998 for those recommendations requiring presidential or congressional action president clinton signed 46 directives and congress passed and the president signed over 85 laws103 another accomplishment proffered by the npr cutting the federal workforce by 351000 positions making it the smallest since kennedy held office and as percentage of the national workforce the smallest since 1931104 donald kettl noted that careful analysis of the longterm employment trends shows that downsizing in the pentagon began before the nprs launch and cynics contended that the npr simply ratified reductions in the defense departments civilian work force that werehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30596crs28 105donald f kettl reinventing government fifthyear report card p 18 emphasis in

5going to occur anyway nonetheless he concluded that if the npr accomplished nothing else it certainly produced substantial and sustained reduction in federal employmentvirtually across the boardin way never before seen in the federal government105 one other achievement that the npr reported was the elimination of some 640000 pages of internal agency rules and about 16000 pages of federal regulations with another 31000 pages being rewritten in plain language106 additionally the npr claimed cost savings totaling about 137 billion as result of its efforts although that figure was recently contested by gao nonetheless kettl advised while the npr unquestionably produced cost savings especially in procurement and reduction in government employment assessing which of the nprs recommendations produced how much savings is virtually impossible job in part this is because it usually proved difficult to predict what costs would have been without the npr in part this is because the governments cost account systems frequently make such analyses impossible107 another consideration offered by arnold regarding the success of the npr concerned the instillation of new culture of administration within the executive branch arnold commented predecessor comprehensive reform efforts have been static they attempted wave of reforms at point in time aiming at enhancing presidential managerial capacities and streamlining federal administrative structure and processes in contrast the npr seeks to be dynamic to the degree that anything unites its recommendations the nprs advocates understand its reforms as creating changed economy of incentives within federal administration such that individuals will be motivated to be creative about the way they work more productive in their work and more responsible for the success of their organizati on in the vocabulary of reinvention the attitudes consistent with reinventions economy of incentives would constitute new administrative culture108 concrete achievements claimed in this area include the honoring of over 1200 federal innovation teams with the vice presidents hammer award and the creation of over 350 reinvention labs to test ways that agencies could improve their performance and customer service by reengineering work processes and eliminating unnecessary regulations109 reporting on the reinvention labs in march 1996 the gao indicated that the labs results suggest number of promising approaches to improving existing agency work processes but noted that the real value of the labshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30596crs29

managerial presidency p 433 113john kamensky brief history p 5 114peri arnold making the managerial presidency p 434will be realized only when the operational improvements they initiated tested and validated achieved wider adoption110 another success cited was the commitment of over 570 federal organizations to more than 4000 customer service standards111 finally regarding arnolds third considera tion how successful had the npr been in creating centrist coalition to support the leadership of president clinton arnold commented bill clinton initiated the npr to address governing context that was substantially differen t from that in which presidents had earlier used administrative reform to construct the managerial presidency the emergent context of the late 20th century is fragmented and characterized by weak parties mercurial interest groupings weakened public institutions and technology allowi ng intense and pervasive public focus on presidents like carter and reagan before him clinton sought to use administrative reform in this emerging context to respond to public hostility toward government112 perhaps the npr bespeaks success in this regard when reporting most importantly public trust in the federal government is finally increasing after 30year decline various polls have shown clear and steady increase over the past four years while it is not clear this is directly linked to the results of reinvention we believe reinvention has made an important contribution113 arnold however appeared to be more certa in about this area of success and concluded the reinvention of government has been side show in some respects after all administrative reform is secondlevel issue in presidential politics however reinvention is an enterprise that reflects well upon clinton and gore it reinforces their own optimal selfdescriptions and gives testimony that these leaders are addressing the problems that trouble most americans114 in september 2000 gao report concluded that the npr reinvention effort had been largely successful with more than 90 of key clinton administration recommendations having been fully or partly implemented the report was basedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30596crs30 115us general accounting office reinventing government status of npr recommendations at 10 federal agencies gao report gaoggd00145 washington september 2000

found that 33 of them were fully implemented and another 30 were partly implemented115 problems some of the problems encountered by the npr were noted previously and those identified here should not be regarded as constituting an exhaustive list although the npr enjoyed some cooperation from congress as the legislative record of npr recommendations legislated into law indicates the npr does not appear to have had clear strategy for working with congress most npr recommendations seem to have been implemented throug h strategy of agency acceptance and presidential orders the overall record arnold observed reflects congresss support for individual items among the npr recommendations and its disinterest in the nprs conception of reinvention116 agreeing with this assessment kettl concluded efforts to develop legislative support for npr initiatives have with the exception of procurement reform been weak and ineffecti ve support from congress poor117 the nprs efforts sometimes resulte d in loss of morale among federal civil servants part of reason for this problem as kettl noted was the tension between the nprs emphasis on the one hand on downsizing and reengineering and on the other hand customer service flatter organization driven by customer service demands energetic and highly motivated employees costcutting reengineered and downsized operation often discourages employees trying to do both risks putting the basic incentives at cross purposes focusing on either risks leaving the corporation stuck in oldstyle less productive approaches the npr took in the competing ideas without fundamentally sorting them out118 coupling morale deflation with agency leadership in support of npr reinvention efforts kettl offered the following scenario in 1996 survey conducted by the merit systems protection board only 37 percent of federal employees believed that their organization had made reinvention top priority the nprs management improvement goals penetrated far less into the pentagon than in civilian agencies morale in many agencies was poor only 20 percent of feder workers said that the npr had brought positive change to gover nment this response however varied directly with how much workershttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30596crs31 119ibid p 17 120ibid p 36 121james d carroll the rhetor ic of reform and political reality in the national performance review public administration review vol 55 mayjune 1995 p 310believ ed that their agencies officials had made the nprs goals top agency priority where the npr was top priority 59 percent of employees thought productivity had improved where it was not just 32 percent saw productivity improvements the lesson where agency managers promoted the nprs goals employees were three times more likely to think that government organizations had made good use of their abilities they were almost twice as likely to believe that they had been given greater flexibility the npr succeeded in motivating employees quite predictably to the degree to which top government officials made this an important goal where they did notand the survey suggests that the npr deeply penetrated only about third of all federal agenciesthe npr became known principally for its downsizing focus and consequently motivation lagged119 kettl also suggeste d that the npr had public confidence problem including both outreach or visibility and credibility june 1998 scripps howard news service survey showed that citizens tended not to believe that the npr had accomplished what it claimed although 54 percent of those surveyed said that they had heard of reinventing government 59 percent did not believe that the administration had in fact reduced the number of federal employees as the npr claimed even though those claims were fully accurate more respondents61 percentdid not believe that the federal government had become more efficient even though there is strong case for substa ntial improvements coupled with the republicans takeover of congress in 1994 and the nprs constant problems in gaining political traction for its messag reinventing government ran headlong into tough confidence problems indeed120 the npr also had problem framing its approach to and focus on reform the npr effort lacked theoretical base and cohesion among its broad range of ideas the npr largely devoted its attention to the process of government rather than the more basic questions of what government should do which many experts believe should come first james d carroll public administration expert observed in defining government as an appendage of the economy the npr strips the federal govern ment of what is distinctively governmentalultimately enforcement of binding norms through legitimate coercion to maintain legal normative order in treating government as walmart the npr ignores the fact that many operational assumptions based on customer service have implications for broader systems of values such as the rule of law representative governm ent separated and shared powers and individual liberty121 carroll also observed that the npr gave attention to the constitutional basis of american national government or its significance for administration ultimately he concluded these theoretical shortcomings resulted in some critical myopia in the npr reform efforthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30596crs32

review p 309neither phase i or ii of the npr directly and systematically addresses trends that probably will shape much of public administration in the early 21st century the first is the imbalance between consumption and savings and investment in the united states marked by concern with deficits and debt entitlement spending demographic change and declining private and public investment the second is the challenge of sorting out relationships and responsibilities among levels of government and governments and other organizations the third is reconciling traditions of constitutional governance and legal accountability with the search for flexibility innovation and productivity in addressing managerial and programmatic issues122 kettl found there was compounding effect to some of the nprs shortcomings npr is most notable for its failure to grapple with basic organizational issues it reduced the number of supervisors without transforming federal management practice its top officials preached the virtues of reducing middle management just as the private sector was rediscovering the importance of middle managers as highimpact players the npr failed to deal with the layering of government and especially with the 3000 political appointees that encrust the top of the federal bureaucracyfor the obvious political reasons that failure coupled with its failure to enlist those appointees aggressively in its cause marked major shortcoming of the npr it also made it harder for the npr to deliver on its promise to downsize middlelevel management route to better customer service it is hard to reduce the distance from top managers to the shop floor when the shop floorthose who actually deliver the governments goods and servicesincreasingly lies outside the government as consequence of contracting out123 finally in addition to prompting downsizing of frontline federal employees not middle managers and otherwise lowering the morale of many civil servants124 the npr carroll noted did not propose systematic agenda for rebuilding the career service and its overall message on the career service is ambivalent or negative125 remaining questions two of carroll s comments concerning problems npr engendered in its reinvention effort suggest some matters that may continue to draw policymakers attention the first of these involves addressing trends likely to shape much of public debate in the early part of the 21st centurythe imbalance between consumption and savings and investment in the united states entitlement spending demographic change and

governance and legal accountability with realizing flexibility innovation and productivity in addressing managerial and programmatic issues second question concerns the need for systematic agenda for rebuilding the career civil service and pursuing that agenda to establish new policy addressing this question at the end of 1999 james d carroll noting that the npr postponed the examination of some fundament realities that future efforts to improve federal manage ment will have to address suggested three items for the 21st century management reform agenda the first of these derived from the decline of the traditional administrative state and the rise of the entitlement state carroll commented in fiscal year 1962 63 percent of federal spending was discretionary in that it was appropriated on an annual basis in response to the presi dents budget proposal in fiscal year 2000 only 33 percent of spending is discretionary the remainder is legally committed under entitlement debt instrument or other devices the administrative state of the 1930s and thereafter was based on problem solving model of public management in this model in response to constituent and interest group pressures politicians defined problems in legislative form they then assigned the problems to agencies the agencies managers and technicians then exercised their skill judgment professionalism and discretion in planning budgeting and otherwise defining and acting upon problem in the entitlement state the president and congress establish program structures that constrain managerial discretion as well as future legislative direction budgeting rules particularly the budget enforcement acts have reinforced the emergence of these algorithmic structures and processes the challenge for the next agenda for public management is to determine how the entitlement state can be configured to allow the exercise of managerial judgment and skills126 second item derived from the emergence of congress as comanager of the administrative branch including government corporations and regulatory commissions in carrolls view factors strengthening congressional influence over administration included the program structures and other provisions of the entitlement state the congressional role in the budget process and the aggressiveness of congress in establishing new although somewhat fragmented framework for federal management in the 1990s with such laws as the chief financial officers act the government performance and results act and the federal financial management improvement act among others the resulting agenda item was for the executive and congress to sort out who is responsible for what in agency and program management127 third item carroll cited arises from changes in constitutional law federal managers he said increasingly must understa nd the supreme courts actions in order to act effectively and legally among these actions the court has held thathttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30596crs34

governments powers and continued to hold individual public administrators liable in money damages for their failure to consider the constitutional implications of their actions under federal civil rights legislation and other provisions of law consequently the item for the federal management reform agenda is to develop new public management frameworks that enable public managers to function effectively in this new constitutional framework128 in testimony offered at may 4 2000 senate governmental affairs subcommittee hearing on reinventing government gao representative identified six of the more important management problems that will confront the next congress and administration in the period after the npr effort adopting an effective results orientation coordinating crosscutting programs addressing highrisk federal functions and programs developing and implementing modern human capital practices strengthening financial management and enhancing computer security129 reinvention downsizing of the federal workforce was seen as resulting in problematic legacy according to the gao witness the manner in which the downsizing was implemented has short and longterm implications that require continuing attention the management control positions npr sought to decrease were barely reduced as proportion of the workforce as whole and at some agencies they increased in addition our reviews have found that lack of adequate strategic and workforce planning during the initial rounds of downsizing by some agencies may have affected their ability to achieve organizational missions some agencies reported that downsizing in general led to such negative effects as loss of institutional memory and an increase in work backlogs httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30596crs35 130ibid pp 4041 131ibid p 42 132ibid p 43although we found that agencies planning for downsizing improved as their downsizing efforts continued it is by means clear that the current workforce is adequately balanced to properly execute agencies missions today130 continued improvements in acquisitions management were thought to be needed reform efforts including the federal acquisition streamlining act of 1994 and the clingercohen act of 1996 have focused principally on simplifying the process for buying commercial products and services and on attempting to improve decisionmaking in acquiring information technology despite these reforms however the products and services the government buys all too often cost more than expected are delivered late or fail to perform as anticipated commercial business would remain viable for very long with results like these problems are particularly evident in the two areas where most of the dollars are spenton weapons systems and information technology significant improvements in these areas as well as in the skills of the acquisition workforce are needed in order to produce better outcomes131 finally it was also thought that the nprs initiati ves to improve the federal regulatory system by streamlining agency rulemaking and cutting regulations had at best yielded mixed results132 by implication the comment by the gao witness that prevailing management problems continue to demand attention poses the question of successor to the npr options include another temporary task force like the npr temporary national study commission on government reform designated unit in an existing agency eg omb gao or the creation of new agency such as an office of management perhaps vested with some of the management responsibilities currently assigned to omb closure the npr continued operations until the final day of the clinton administration january 19 2001 documents available from the npr web site as of that closing date were subsequently made
