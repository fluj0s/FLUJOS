statutes implicated by conducting illegal gambling using the internet it also discusses some of the constitutional issues associated with prosecuting illegal internet gambling gambling is primarily matter of state law reinforced by federal law in instances where the presence of an interstate or foreign element might otherwise frustrate the enforcement policies of state law state officials and others have expressed concern that the internet may be used to bring illegal gambling into their jurisdictions illicit internet gambling implicates at least seven federal criminal statutes it is federal crime 1 to conduct an illegal gambling business 18 usc 1955 2 to use the telephone or telecommunications to conduct an illegal gambling business 18 usc 1084 3 to use the facilities of interstate commerce to conduct an illegal gambling business 18 usc 1952 4 to conduct the activities of an illegal gambling business involving either the collection of an unlawful debt or pattern of gambling offenses 18 usc 1962 5 to launder the proceeds from an illegal gambling business or to plow them back into the business 18 usc 1956 6 to spend more than 10000 of the proceeds from an illegal gambling operation at any one time and place 18 usc 1957 or 7 since passage of the unlawful internet gambling enforcement act pl 109347 2006 for gambling business to accept payment for illegal internet gambling 31 usc 53615367 there have been suggestions that enforcement of these provisions against illegal internet gambling may raise constitutional issues under the commerce clause the first amendments guarantee of free speech and the due process clause the commercial nature of gambling business and the reliance of the internet on telephone communications seems to satisfy doubts under the commerce clause the fact that illegal activities enjoy first amendment protection appears to quell free speech objections the due process arguments raised in contemplation of federal prosecution of offshore internet gambling operations suffer when financial transactions with individuals in the united states are involved bibliography citations to state and federal gambling laws and the text of

of some of the federal crimin laws implicated by internet gambling and of few of the constitutional questions associated with their application american law has always reflected our ambivalence towards gambling antigambling laws were common in colonial america yet even in the northeast where they were perhaps most numerous the lottery was popular form of public finance1 majority of states continue to outlaw most forms of gambling but most also continue to employ lottery as means of public finance and to allow several other forms of gambling as well in fact at least fortysix states permit charitable bingo fortythree allow parimutuel betting thirtyseven have lotteries twentynine have indian gambling establishments and thirteen allow casino or riverboat gambling2 americans spend almost 822 billion year on legalized gambling3 estimates on the amount americans spend on illegal gambling vary widely4 there are many federal gambling laws most enacted to prevent unwelcome intrusions of interstate or international gambling into states where the activity in question has been outlawed5 they generally deal with lotteries numbers or betting on races and other sporting events but several were written with sufficient breadth to cover casino or other kinds of gambling then there is internet gambling in some cases internet gambling is not much different than gambling by telephone bettor places his bet with bookie using his computer and email rather than using just his telephone but the sophistication of modern computer technology permits another kind of internet gambling the gambling commission reported that by mid1999 there were over 250 online casinos 64 lotteries 20 bingo games and 139 sports books providing gambling over the internet6 today an estimated

was legal11 many of the technical challenges seem to have been overcome as for consumer acceptance although noted earlier reliable statistics can be somewhat elusive12 its popularity seems to supply the surest test financial complications appear to have slowed but hardly crippled the growth of internet gambling true historically the courts would not enforce gambling debts13 and some major credit card issuers and economic transfer services have acted to block use of their credit cards and services for internet gambling purposes 14 yet there seems to be some question whether the use of credit cards and fund transfers for internet gambling purposes was ever completely thwarted prior to passage of the unlawful internet gambling enforcement act15 on the legal front gamblers have introduced features like proxy gambling gambling for credit and at least the claim of gambling in virtual offshore gambling locale to induce bettors to believe they have overcome legal prohibitions in fact they have not 16 nevertheless enforcement 10 growth of internetbased gambling raises questions for bank systems bna s electronic information policy law report feb 28 1997 11 kanamine gamblers stake out the

sense and gambling is rarely high law enforcement priority even without the complications that the internet can bring to the table it was likewise uncertain for some time whether internet gambling like many types of gambling would be legalized with regulations pu t in place to reassure both investors and the gambling public17 be that as it may today using the internet to conduct gambling business either involving betting on sporting events or in volving form of gambling illegal under the laws of the state in which any of the players are located will almost certainly be federal crime

benefits which more extensive caselaw might bring the act is addressed to those engaged in the business of betting or wagering and therefore apparently cannot be used to prosecute simple bettors22 the government must prove that the defendant was aware of the fact he was using wire facility to transmit bet or gamblingrelated information it need not prove that he knew that such use was unlawful 23 the courts have also rejected the contention that the prohibition applies only to those who transmit concluding that use for transmission embraces both those who send and those who receive the transmission24 grammatically interstate transmission appears as feature of only half of the elements compare for the transmission in interstate or foreign commerce of bets or wagers or information assisting in the placing of bets or wagers on any sporting event or contest iv a1 2 above with for the transmission of wire communication which entitles the recipient to receive money or credit as result of bets or wagers or for information assisting in the placing of bets or wagers 4b c above nevertheless virtually every court to consider the question has concluded that knowing interstate or foreign transmission is an indispensable element of any 1084 prosecution 25 the execution of similar interpretative exercise might lead to the conclusion that the section applies only to cases involving gambling on spor ting events compare iv a1 2 with iv b c again the vast majority of prosecutions in volve sports gambling but cases involving other forms of gambling under section 1084 are not unknown26 and the limitation is contrary to literal 22 united states v scavo 593 f2d 837 843 8th cir 1979if an individual performs only an occasional or nonessential service or is mere bettor or

panel has concluded that the wire act applies only to sports gambling27 construction of the act is further complicated by the defense available under subsection 1084b28 read casually it might suggest general defense but the district court in the internet gambling case in the southern district of new york has highlighted its more restrictive scope the 1084b exemption by its terms applies only to the transmission of information assisting in the placing of bets not to the other acts prohibited in 1084a ie transmission of 1 bets or wages or 2 wire communications entitling the recipient to money or credit as result of bets or wagers with regard to transmissions of information assisting in the placing of bets the exemption is further narrowed by its requirement that the betting at issue be legal in both jurisdictions in which the transmission occurs exemption applies to the other wire communications proscribed in 1084a even if the betting at issue is legal in both jurisdictions see united states v mcdonough 835 f2d 1103 1105 5 th cir 198829 the second circuit panel in cohen endorsed the courts construction30 an accomplice who aids and abets another in the commission of federal crime may be treated as if he had committed the crime himself31 the classic definition from nye nissen v united states 336 us 613 619 1949 explains that liability for aiding and abetting attaches when one in some sort associates himself with the venture pa rticipates in it as in something that he wishes to bring about and seeks by his action to make it succeed32 the department of justice advised

this section shall be construed to prevent the transmission in interstate or foreign commerce of information for use in news reporting of sporting events or contests or for the transmission of

provision in the civil interstate horseracing act35 the justice department does not share this view36 the interstate horseracing act 15 usc 30013007 is the product of the emergence of state licensed offtrack betting parlors the parlors accepted wagers on races conducted both within the state and without race tracks and those dependent upon their success objected that the tracks were losing customers who lived proximate to both an in state track and an offtrack betting parlor in neighboring state 37 the act provides for compensation agreements more precisely it prohibits acceptance of interstate offtrack wagers except as provided in the act 15 usc 3003 but permits such acceptance with the consent of various horse racing associations state horse racing commissions state offtrack

states nor congress itself deemed criminal in nature the defendants acts fall into this chiaroscuro category perhaps not right but certainly not felonious it follows that these acts not indictable

of the internet seems to come within the reach of section 1955 the limited commentary on the point appears to concur47 dicta in an early federal appellate decision likewise strongly suggested the applicability of section 1995 under 1955 it is quite obvious that bettors should not be held criminally liable either under the statute or under 2 and that local merchants who sell the accounting paper or the computers on which bets are registered are not fficiently connected to the enterprise to be included even if they know that their goods will be used in connection with the work of the business on the other hand it seems similarly obvious that the seller of computer hardware or software who is fully knowledgeable about the nature and scope of the gambling business would be liable under 2 if he installs the computer electronic equipment and cables necessary to operate wire shop or parimutuel betting parlor configures the software programs to process betting information and instructs the owners of the gambling business on how to use the equipment to make the illegal business more profitable and efficient such actions would probably be sufficient proof that the seller intended to further the criminal enterprise 48 violations of section 1955 are punishable by imprisonment for not more than 5 years andor fines of the greater of not more than twice the gain or loss

continuity has been or remains in substantially continuous operation for period in excess of thirty days or by volume has gross revenue of 2000 in any single day53 the volume prong is fairly

section 1955 lies within the scope of congress legislative authority under the commerce clause the supreme courts decision in united states v lopez 514 us 549 1996 finding the gun free school zone act 18 usc 922q beyond the bounds of congress commerce clause power stimulated host of appellate decisions here and elsewhere in the case of section 1955 lopez challenges have been rejected with the observation that unlike the statute in lopez section 1955 involves the regulation of commercial activity gambling business b comes with jurisdictional elements selected to reserve prosecution to those endeavors likely to substantially affect interstate commerce five participants in substantial gambling undertaking and c was preceded by congressional findings evidencing the impact of substantial gambling operations upon interstate commerce56 the accomplice and conspiratorial provisions attend violations of section 1955 as they do violations of the wire act although frequently difficult to distinguish in given case the difference is essentially matter of depth of involvement to be guilty of aiding and abetting section 1955 illegal gambling business the defendant must have knowledge of the general scope and nature of the illegal gambling business and awareness of the general facts concerning the venture and he must take action which materially assists in conducting financing managing supervising directing or owning the business for the purpose of making the business succeed united states v hill 55 f3d 1197 1201202 6 th cir 1995 unlike conspiracy one may only be prosecuted for aiding and abetting the commission of completed crime before defendant can be found guilty of aiding and abetti ng violation of section 1955 violation of section 1955 must exist and aiders and abettors cannot be counted as one of the statutorily required five persons id at 1204 as general rule federal conspiracy exists when two or more individuals agree to commit federal crime and one of them commits some overt act in furtherance of their common scheme57 conspiracy may exist even if conspirator does not agree to commit or facilitate each and every part of the substantive offense the partners in the criminal plan must agree to pursue the same criminal objective and may divide up the work yet each is responsible for acts of each other if the conspirators have plan which calls for some conspirators to perpetrate the crime and others to provide support the supporters are as guilty as the perpetrators 58 conspiracy is separate crime and thus conspirators may be convicted of both substantive violations of section 1955 and conspiracy to commit those violations59 in fact under the pinkerton doctrine coconspirators are liable for conspiracy the crime which is the object of the conspiracy when it is committed and any other reasonably foreseeable crimes of their confederates committed in furtherance of the conspiracy 60 56 eg united states v riddle 249 f3d 529 53839 6th cir

operations that take wagers from bettors in the united states involves two questions first does state law proscribing the gambling in question apply when some of the elements of the offense are committed outside its jurisdiction second did congress intend section 1955 to apply beyond the confines of the united states section 1955 can only apply overseas when based on an allegation that the gambling in question is illegal under state law whose reach straddles jurisdictional lines for example statute that prohibits recording bets bookmaking in texas cannot be used against gambling business which records bets only in jamaica or dominican republic even if the bets are called in from texas united states v truesdale 152 f3d 443 44649 5 th cir 1998 rejecting the argument that the gambling was illegal under provision of texas law not mentioned in indictment or the jury charge on the other hand an overseas gambling business may find itself in violation of section 1955 if it accepts wagers from bettors in new york because new york law considers the gambling to have occurred where the bets are made inter alia 61 whether federal criminal statute applies overseas is matter of congressional intent62 the intent is most obvious where congress has expressly stated that provision shall have extraterritorial application eg 18 usc 2381 relating to treason committed in the united states or elsewhere in the absence of an explicit statement the courts use various construction aids to divine congressional intent unless some clearer indication appears congress is presumed to have intended its laws to apply only within the united states63 the courts have recognized contrary indications under several circumstances congress will be thought to have intended criminal proscription to apply outside the united states where one of the elements of the offense like the commission of an overt act in furtherance of conspiracy occurs in the united states64 similarly congress will be thought to have intended to outlaw overseas crimes calculated to have an impact in the united states for example false statements made abroad in order to gain entry into the united states65 finally congress will be thought to have intended extraterritorial application for continued 2006 61 people v world interactive gaming corp 1999 wl 591995 slip at 5 nysctjuly 22

established either by evidence that the enterprise has conducted its affairs in interstate commerce or foreign commerce or has engaged in activities that affect interstate commerce or foreign

as pattern90 related crimes for pattern purposes are marked by the same or similar purposes results participants victims or methods of commission or otherwise are interrelated by distinguishing characteristics and are not isolated events91 the continuity of predicate offenses may be shown in two ways either by prove of the regular occurrences related misconduct over period of time in the past closed ended or by evidence of circumstances suggesting that if not stopped by authorities they would have continued in the future open ended 92 the courts have been reluctant to find the continuity required for rico pattern for closed ended enterprises those with threat of future predicate offenses unless the enterprises activities spanned fairly long period of time93 openended

involved flow from predicate offense like illegal gambling i knowing that the property involved in financial transaction b represents the proceeds of some form of unlawful activity ii conducts or b attempts to conduct such financial transaction iii which in fact involves the proceeds of specified unlawful activity ai iv with the intent to promote the carrying on of specified unlawful activity 18

or even its nature98 the proceeds may be tangible or intangible eg cash or debt things of value or things with intrinsic value eg checks written on depleted accounts99 98 the term knowing that the property involved in financial transaction represents the proceeds of some form of unlawful activity means that the person knew the property involved in the transaction represented proceeds from some

commerce clause to enact the gunfree school zones act 18 usc 922q1988 ed supp ii which outlawed possession of firearm within 1000 feet of school 514 us at 551 in doing so lopez mapped congress commerce clause powers first congress may regulate the use of the channels of interstate commerce heart of atlanta motel inc v united states 379 us 241 256 1964the authority of congress to keep the channels of interstate commerce free from immoral and injurious uses has been frequently sustained and is longer open to question second congress is empowered to regulate and protect the instrumentalities of interstate commerce or persons or things in interstate commerce even through the threat may come only from intrastate activities see eg perez v united states 402 us 146 150 1971 for example the destruction of an aircraft 18 usc 32 or thefts from interstate shipments 18 usc 659 finally congress commerce authority includes the power to regulate those activities having substantial relation to interstate commerce ie those activities that substantially affect interstate commerce 514 us at 55859 several citations of the court omitted since the school zone act addressed neither the channels nor the content of commerce it had to find coverage under the power to regulate matters that substantially affect interstate or foreign commerce this it could not do it was devoid of any economic component and so could claim kinship to earlier cases approving congressional regulation of various forms of intrastate economic activity that substantially affected interstate commerce such as regulation of intrastate coal mining intrastate extortionate credit transactions loan sharking restaurants utilizing substantial interstate supplies inns and hotels catering to interstate guests and production and consumption of homegrown wheat 514 us at 55960

guidelines that might have confined its application to instances more clearly within the commerce power its criminal proscription contained commerce element it did not for example outlaw possession of firearm which had been transported in interstate commerce within 1000 feet of school its enactment occurred without the accompaniment of legislative findings or declarations of purpose that might have guided appropriate enforcement limitations the acts overreaching was all the more troubling because it sought to bring federal regulation to school activities an area where the states historically have been sovereign 163 morrison echoed lopez quoting it extensively in the course of an opinion that found that the commerce clause did not empower congress to create federal civil remedy for the victims of gendermotivated violence 529 us at 60719 other opinions confirm that the commerce clause must be read in light of the principles of federalism reflected in the tenth amendment for instance the clause does not empower congress to compel the states to exercise their sovereign legislative or executive powers to implement federal regulatory scheme164 these limitations notwithstanding the federal appellate courts have concluded thus far that the federal gambling statutes directed as they are against an economic activity come safely within congress legislative authority under the commerce clause165 g8g146g155g156g157g561g3g150g142g151g141g150g142g151g157g561 gambling implicates first amendment free speech concerns on two levels gambling is communicative by nature gambling also relies on advertising and wide range of auxiliary communication services historically gambling itself has been considered vice and consequently beyond the protection of the first amendment there is every reason to believe that illegal gambling remains beyond the shield of th first amendment gone however is the notion that the power to outlaw vice includes the pow er to outlaw auxiliary speech when the underlying vice remains unregulated 166 the supreme court made this readily apparent when it 163 514 us at 64 514 us at 83 kennedy oconnor jj concurringthe statute now before us forecloses the states from experimenting and exercising their own judgment in an area to which states lay claim by right of history and expertise and it does so by regulating an activity beyond the realm of

the due process limitations on the exercise of personal jurisdiction over the defendant or subject matter jurisdiction over the gambling activity 170

touchstone remains whether the defendant purposefully established minimum contacts in the forum state although it has been argued that foreseeability of causing injury in another state should be sufficient to establish such contacts there when policy considerations so require the court has consistently held that this kind of foreseeability is not sufficient benchmark for exercising personal jurisdiction instead the foreseeability that is critical to due process analysis is that the defendants conduct and 167 united states v edge broadcasting co 509 us 418 1993 168 greater new orleans
