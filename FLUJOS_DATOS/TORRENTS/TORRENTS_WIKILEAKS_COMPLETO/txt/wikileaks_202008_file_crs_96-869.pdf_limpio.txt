property 80 forfeiture and the eighth amendment an owners innocence or his or her relative culpability has been identified b several of the lower federal courts as factor to be considered in the determination of whether particular forfeiture constitutes an excessive fine in violation of th eighth amendment in alexander v united states and austin v united states the supreme court81 82 dealt with the issue of proportionality in civil as well as criminal forfeitur proceedings the court instructed that civil and criminal forfeitures should be made proportional to the condemned conduct and directed the courts of appeal to devise workable solution to correct the problem caused by forfeiture penalties whic h exceed the harm caused by the unlawful conduct the central issue which was before the cour t in both cases was whether the government through forfeiture violated the constitution if the value of the property to be forfeited substantially outweighs th severity of the offense the court found that in some instances civil proceedings do constitute punishment and may for example violate the eighth amendment s excessive fines clause in alexander the defendan t was convicted of

appeals to decide if th forfeiture was exce ssive in austin the defendant sold two grams of cocaine to an85 undercover officer and as result he lost his body shop and mobile home in civil forfeiture proceeding the supreme court held that civil forfeiture under 86 881a4 and 7 is monetary punishment and is subject to the limitations of th eighth amendments excessive fines clause87 finally it sho uld be noted that the owners innocence is only one of the factors that the lower courts have included in their various postaustinalexander tests for determining whether forfeiture constitutes an excessive fine88 overview the law of forfeiture dates back to the old testament the ox that gored and killed someone was guilty and the owner was freed of further obligation in thi s example the ox not the owner is deemed guilty but the owner is also punishe d because he is without the use of his ox the forfeiture doctrine continued into th common law where the crown became the sovereign to be appeased thus if n object had been the direct or indirect cause of the death of kings subject the object became the crowns in order to redress the loss of human life and provide revenue the distinction between civil and criminal forfei ture was based upon whether the penalty was against the person or against the thing forfeiture against the person is considered in personam and requires conviction before the property can be taken from the defendant these forfeitures are regarded as criminal in nature because they are penal they primarily seek to punish forfeiture against the thing is considered in rem and the forfeiture is based upon the unlawfu l use of the res property regardless of its owners culpability t hese forfeitures are regarded as civil and their purpose is remedial both criminal and civil forfeitures are available to the federal government and are used with increasing frequency in the war on drugshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs96869crs17 similar to civil forfeiture administrative for feiture is an in rem action against the res property it allows the agency to implement forfeiture of the property without judicial involvement instead of statutes agency regulations govern administrativ forfeitures the judicial analyses of 21 usc 881a6 and 7 by the federal court s reveal the disparate interpretations of the innocent owner defense the legislativ history seems to indicate that the defenses under 6 and 7 are the same however the structure of the language in 881a4c is identical to that in 881a7 and therefore the same canons of construction in one would be applicable to the other there are tw views disjunctive and conjunctive as to the correct interpretation of the statute and differences exist even with in these two views one school of thought contends that the term or must be read in disjunctive way holding that th innocent owner test requires cla imant to demonstrate either lack of knowledge or lack of consent but not lack of both knowledge and consent united states v parcel of real property known as 6109 grubb road on the other hand there are some courts which have followed the conjunctive school of thought and have hel d that in order to

the assertion of the innocent owne r defense by postillegal act transferee with guilty k nowledge of the tainted character of property in the one 1973 rolls royce case the third circuit held that
