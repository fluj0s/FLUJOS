contact information 2 when committee of conference approves its report the next step in the legislative process is for the report along with joint explanatory statement of the managers to be presented to the house and senate for consideration conference report must be filed and considered in one chamber at time when chamber is in possession of the official conference papers the high privilege accorded to conference reports in the house under rule xxii clause 7a allows them to be presented or filed at almost any time the house is in session provided that it is in possession of the conference papers exceptions to this procedure include time when the journal is being read during quorum call or when the house is conducting record or division vote this privilege applies in the house so that conference reports may not be filed while the chamber is resolved into committee of the whole see httpwwwcrsgovproductsguidesguidehomeshtml for more information on legislative process house rule xxii clause 8a1 provides that it is not in order to consider conference report until the third calendar day excluding saturdays sundays or holidays unless the house is in session after the report has been filed conference report may be considered only if it has been printed in the congressional record of the day on which it was filed these requirements are not in force during the last six days of session and may be waived by unanimous consent or more commonly by adopting special rule copies of the conference report and joint explanatory statement must be available to members at least two hours before the beginning of floor consideration this requirement may also be waived by unanimous consent or special rule allowing for the consideration of conference report immediately after it is filed none of these requirements would apply to conference report considered under suspension of the rules conference report is highly privileged and may be called up for consideration at almost any time another matter is not pending conference report that meets the layover and availability requirements does not need to be read when it is called up if it does not meet these requirements the report must be read unless the reading is dispensed with by unanimous consent typically majority managers of conference call up conference report even when they do not sign or support it although the speaker may recognize another member for this purpose once called up conference reports are normally considered in the house under the onehour rule conference report may also be considered under special rule from the rules committee or suspension of the rules house rule xxii clause 8d1 requires that the time allotted for debate on conference report be equally divided and controlled by the majority and minority parties however if managers from both parties support the report the rule also provides that member who opposes it may claim and control onethird of the hour recognition of member in opposition does not depend on party affiliation but priority is given to member of the conference committee debate may be extended beyond one hour by unanimous consent by special rule or by defeating the previous question on the conference report the house may choose to accept or reject conference report but amendments are not in order the chamber that agrees to request for conference is normally the one that considers the report first this is significant because the first chamber to act can agree or disagree to conference report or it can agree to preferential motion to recommit the report to conference motion to recommit to conference may be made after the previous question is ordered on the conference report and may include nonbinding instructions to the conferees however after one chamber has acted on conference report its conferees are discharged and the other chamber may only accept or reject the conference report if the second house rejects the conference report the measure is left in the procedural situation it was in before the conference was requested under such circumstance one house could propose new position to the other house as an amendment between the houses or it could ask for new conference in the event that report is recommitted or rejected and the measure submitted to new conference committee all of the matters originally sent to conference are again before the conferees novo for consideration in the house any point of order against conference report must be made or reserved before debate on it has begun or before joint explanatory statement is read if report is required to be read because it has not met the layover and availability requirements point of order cannot be made or reserved until after the reading point of order may only be made against the conference report and not against the language in the joint explanatory statement if point of order is sustained against conference report it falls and any further consideration of the measure must follow some alternate route in the same manner as if the report had been defeated rule xxii clause 10 establishes procedure for points of order against conference report due to the inclusion of senate matter not germane to the housepassed bill special rule may be used to protect conference report from one or more points of order and all points of order are implicitly waived when conference report is considered under suspension of the rules james v saturno specialist on the congress and legislative process jsaturnocrslocgov 72381 for
