elizabeth rybicki1 analyst in american national government government and finance division summary the 2000 elections resulted in senate composed of 50 republicans and 50 democrats an historic agreement worked out by the party floor leaders in consultation with their party colleagues was presented to the senate sres 8 on january 5 2001 and agreed to the same day the agreement was expanded by leadership colloquy on january 8 2001 it remained in effect until june of 2001 when senators reached new agreement to account for the fact that senator had left the republican party to become an

powersharing agreement background and opening day actions the november 2000 elections caused the senate to be tied with 50 republicans and 50 democrats the issue was further complicated by the election of richard b cheney 1 this report was written by paul s rundquist former specialist at the congressional research service dr rundquist has retired but elizabeth rybicki is available to answer questions on the subject crs2 as vice president when the 107th congress convened on january 3 2001 the incumbent vice president albert gore jr presided until vice presidentelect cheney was sworn in on january 20 although titular democratic majority existed with vice president gore available to break tie votes and could have tried to organize the senate any such organization actions could have been revisited under republican auspices once vice president cheney was in the chair to break ties the senate often negotiates formal and informal agreements to govern the legislative agenda and its consideration of individual measures similar negotiations about the organization of the senate began informally in late november between the democratic leader senator tom daschle dsd and the republican leader senator trent lott r ms talks continued after the senate convened and proposals under consideration by the two leaders were discussed at meetings of the party conferences2 senator daschle recognized as majority leader by vice president gore who was presiding made attempt to replace the incumbent senate administrative officers with democratic nominees in an unprecedented step the senate agreed to sres 3 electing senator robert c byrd dwv president pro tempore upon the adoption of the resolution and simultaneously electing senator strom thurmond rsc president pro tempore to be effective at noon on january 20 the senate designated committee chairmen on opening day as senate committees are continuing bodies senators serving on panels in the 106th congress retained their positions and roles when the 107th congress convened several committee chairmen did not return to the 107th congress however and for administrative reasons it was necessary for the senate at minimum to designate acting committee chairs to replace them pending election of the full committee slates the senate went further in adopting sres 7 naming democratic committee chairs on all senate committees to serve as such through january 20 and naming republican chairs to assume their posts at noon that day the powersharing agreement sres 8 two days later on the afternoon of january 5 2001 senator daschle presented to the senate sres 8 measure to provide the organizational basis for powersharing in the senate when the parties were equally divided the resolution was agreed to later that day3 the key provisions of the resolution were as follows committees all senate committees would have equal numbers of republicans and democrats 2 mark preston and paul kane senate strikes historic deal roll call vol 46 jan 8 2001 pp 1 15 3 the text of the resolution can be found in the congressional record daily edition vol 147 jan 5 2001 p s48 comments by sens lott daschle and others appear at pp s2931 s3244 crs3 full committee chair could discharge subcommittee from further consideration of measure or matter if it was not reported because of tie vote budgets and office space for all committees were equally divided with overall committee budgets to remain within historic levels4 and discharging measures or matters if measure or nomination was not reported because of tie vote in committee the majority or minority leader after consultation with committee leaders could move to discharge the committee from further consideration of such measure or nomination this discharge motion could be debated for four hours equally divided and controlled by the majority and minority leaders after the expiration or yielding back of time the senate would vote on the discharge motion without any intervening action motion or debate and if the committee were discharged by majority vote the measure or matter would be placed on the appropriate senate calendar to await further parliamentary actions agenda control and cloture the agreement prohibited cloture motion from being filed on any amendable item of business during the first 12 hours in which it is debated required both party leaders to seek to attain an equal balance of the interests of the two parties in scheduling and considering senate legislative and executive business and noted that the motion to proceed to any calendar item shall continue to be considered the prerogative of the majority leader although qualifying such statement with the observation that senate rules do not prohibit the right of the democratic leader or any other senator to move to proceed to any item 4 several press stories have already discussed the challenges associated with implementing the equal staff and space agreement see

2001 pp 127128 crs4 supplemental colloquy january 8 2001 on january 8 2001 the provisions of sres 8 were further clarified and other procedures relating to the powersharing agreement were announced senator harry reid dnv the assistant democratic floor leader received unanimous consent to enter printed colloquy between senators daschle and lott into the congressional record and to direct that the permanent congressional record be corrected to provide for its inclusion with the resolution when it passed the senate last friday5 in addition to summarizing the provisions of sres 8 the colloquy covered several additional issues filling the amendment tree limits on floor leaders in perhaps the most significant announcement the two leaders pledged to refrain from using their preferential rights of recognition to fill the amendment tree in an effort to block consideration of controversial issues6 senator lott on behalf of both leaders declared the policy in the written colloquy it is our intention that the senate have full and vigorous debates in this 107th congress and that the right of all senators to have their amendments considered will be honored we have therefore jointly agreed that neither leader nor their designees in the absence of the leader will offer consecutive amendments to fill the amendment tree so as to deprive either side of the right to offer an amendment we both agree that nothing in this resolution or colloquy limits the majority leaders right to amend nonrelevant amendment nor does it limit the sponsor of that nonrelevant amendment from responding with further amendment after the majority leaders amendment or amendments are disposed of7 minority senators as presiding officers the party leaders agreed that minority party senators would be permitted to serve as presiding officers of the senate this differed from the usual senate practice under which only majority party senators serve as temporary presiding officers party access to space in the capitol the colloquy further specified that both parties would have equal access to common space in the capitol complex for purposes of holding meetings press conferences and other events this supplemented the provisions in sres 8 guaranteeing the minority equal committee office space 5 sen harry reid remarks in senate congressional record daily edition vol 147 jan 8 2001 pp s53s54 6 an amendment tree is the diagram describing the number and type of potential amendments that may be offered to pending amendment depending upon the textual form taken the pending amendment to measure for example to an amendment proposing to insert text in bill both seconddegree substitute and seconddegree perfecting amendment could be offered but if the perfecting amendment were offered before the substitute the substitute could not be offered until the perfecting amendment was disposed of under this circumstance the floor leaders have pledged not to offer firstdegree amendments to insert text and then immediately to offer their own seconddegree amendment to block other senators from offering seconddegree substitute for fuller description of senate amendment trees and rules see crs report 98853 the amending process in the senate 7 sen trent lott remarks in the senate congressional record daily edition vol 147 jan 8 2001 p s54 crs5 additional issues the agreement embodied in sres 8 was not comprehensive it did not address many parliamentary issues as senator lott noted in floor remarks it covered the issues on which the party leaders were able to reach agreement in instance after instance senator daschle and i discussed points argued about points when we could not come to agreement we said we would deal with the rules as they are so we got it down to what really matters8 for example one issue that was not resolved was conference committee composition although the agreement specified equal party strength on the senates standing special and joint committees it did not specify equal party strength on conference delegations some senate republicans were insistent that majority of senate conferees be republicans reflecting the tiebreaking vote of vice president cheney available to approve any conference compromise as one republican senator noted i think its absolutely our position and my position that we have to control the conferences9 the parliamentary stages though which the senate passes to get to conference are usually handled by unanimous consent this particularly includes granting authority to the presiding officer to appoint conferees based on the recommendations of the committee and floor leaders if objection is raised to granting this authority senate conferees are to be elected by amendable motion debatable under the normal rules of the senate10 senator lott alluded to this possibility in the printed colloquy of january 8 with respect to the ratios of members on conferences we both understand that under previous senate practices those ratios are suggested by the majority party and if not acceptable by the minority party their right to amend and debate is in order the intention of this resolution is not to alter that practice and this resolution does not serve to set into motion any action that would alter that practice in any way11 the senate did not name conferees through its traditional mechanisms during the powersharing period of the 107th congress during that time the senate agreed to send only two measures to conference committee the budget resolution and the reconciliation bill but it should be noted that conference procedures on these measures are governed in part by the budget act12 in both of these cases majority of the conferees were republican 8 sen trent lott remarks in the senate

sections 305c2 and 310e1 of the budget act preclude extended debate on the motions necessary to send measure to conference crs6 conclusion on may 24 2001 senator james jeffords announced his intention to leave the republican party to become an independent and to caucus with the senate democrats with senator jeffordss announcement the democrats held numerical edge in the senate on june 5 2001 senator jeffords met with senate democrats at their weekly conference meeting on june 6 the senate convened with the democrats as the acknowledged senate majority party the powersharing agreement in effect in the senate from january to june of 2001 was an experiment it differed from many established practices of the senate the agreement was not comprehensive and new issues came before the senate that had to be resolved by informal agreements unanimous consent negotiations or other means the success of any senate organizational settlement depends in part upon its adaptability and that of its members to changing circumstances for other versions of this document see httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20785
