sunset and program review commission bills in the 109th congress comparing hr 3282 and hr 5766 summary the sunset concept provides for programs and agencies to terminate automatically on predetermined schedule following systematic evaluation of past performance unless explicitly renewed by law in each congress since the 105th bills to create federal sunset commission modeled on the sunset commission in texas have been introduced by representative kevin brady including hr 3282 in the 109th congress president bush supports creation of federal sunset commission in may 2006 the house leadership announced plans to bring sunset legislation quickly to the house floor along with other budget process reforms favored by the republican study committee in return for the groups backing of the fy2007 budget resolution in the effort to craft consensus bill attention came to focus on hr 3282 and on hr 2470 sponsored by representative todd tiahrt which would create commission on the accountability and review of federal agencies carfa modeled on the base realignment and closure commission brac approach on july 14 2006 representative tiahrt introduced revised version of hr 2470 as hr 5766 the government efficiency act to provide for the establishment of federal review commissions frcs which would apparently address concerns similar to those envisaged for the sunset commission in hr 3282 although hr 5766 is often referred to as sunset bill this is technically inaccurate since it contains actionforcing mechanism under hr 3282 an agency would be abolished within one year of the commissions review unless the agency received statutory extension if congress passed reauthorization bill the measure would then go to the president to be signed into law if the president instead vetoed the bill twothirds majority in both chambers would be necessary to override the veto and extend the life of the program or agency on july 20 2006 the committee on government reform voted to report hr 3282 favorably and at the same time voted to report favorably hr 5766 as amended the votes to order the bills reported were largely along party lines supporters of the bills contend that there are too many overlapping and ineffective federal programs that contribute to the growing federal deficit and that the commission would assist congress in performing its oversight function thereby reducing fraud waste and abuse critics of the measures counter that the bills would cede too much power to the executive branch would burden congress with tremendous workload with mandatory reauthorization of every agency and program and would facilitate elimination of federal programs that provide safety net for the most vulnerable in society this report examines the two bills and

programs and agencies to terminate automatically according to predetermined schedule unless explicitly renewed by law as developed in the 1970s by the organization common cause sunset law contains two requisite components an actionforcing mechanism and framework for the systematic review and evaluation of past performance under sunset agencies fade into the sunset unless following oversight review the legislature acts affirmatively to continue their existence for more than three decades sunset bills have been introduced in every congress1 since 1997 representative kevin brady and others have supported the creation of federal sunset commission modeled on the sunset commission in texas he reintroduced his bill in the 109th congress as hr 32822 in may 2006 the house leadership announced plans to bring sunset legislation quickly to the house floor along with other budget process reforms favored by the republican study committee rsc in return for rsc backing of the fy2007 budget resolution in the effort to craft consensus bill attention came to focus on hr 3282 brady bill and on hr 2470 sponsored by representative todd tiahrt which would create commission on the accountability and review of federal agencies carfa modeled on the base realignment and closure commission brac approach3 on july 14 2006 representative tiahrt introduced revised version of hr 2470 as

although the carfa and frcs would address concerns similar to those envisaged for the federal agency sunset commission in hr 3282 hr 2470 and hr 5766 are not true sunset measures because they lack an actionforcing mechanism whereby agencies and programs would terminate automatically absent congressional action as would occur under hr 3282 although technically inaccurate both bills are often referred to as sunset measures however4 on july 19 2006 the house government reform committee held hearing on hr 3282 and hr 57665 both bills went to markup the following day and the committee voted 1514 to report hr 3282 favorably to the house hr 5766 as amended was favorably reported by vote of 1512 both votes were largely along party lines all democrats voted against both bills one republican voted with the minority on each bill representative chris shays voted with the minority on hr 5766 and representative todd platts did likewise on hr 32826 supporters of the measures suggest that there are too many overlapping and ineffective federal programs that contribute to the growing federal deficit that congress lacks time for thorough oversight of all existing agencies and programs and that the commissions would assist congress in performing its oversight function thereby reducing fraud waste and abuse critics of the measures counter that the bills would cede too much power to the executive branch and the majority political party would burden congress with tremendous workload with mandatory reauthorization of every agency and program and would facilitate elimination of federal programs that provide safety net for the most vulnerable in society summary of hr 3282 hr 3282 would create federal agency sunset commission fasc to review the efficiency of and public need for federal agencies and provide for the abolishment of agencies for which public need does not exist the fasc would consist of 12 members appointed by the speaker of the house and the senate majority leader of the six members appointed by the leaders of the respective chambers four would be members of congress with not more than two from the same political party within one year after its establishment the commission would submit to congress schedule for the review of all federal agencies and advisory committees by the commission at least once every 12 years and for the abolishment 4

house panel sends sunset bills to floor cq today july 20 2006 these press accounts call the tiahrt bill sunset bill even though technically it is not one 5 for hearing statements in electronic form see httpreformhousegovgovreformhearingseventsingleaspxeventid47286 6 representative shays voted present on hr 3282 explaining that he intended to vote against the bill on the floor but would allow it to be reported crs3 of each agency following the review absent congressional reauthorization agencies performing similar or related functions would be scheduled for review at the same time then the commission would commence its annual reviews utilizing the 19 criteria specified in the bill in reviewing and evaluating the efficiency and public need for each agency by september 1 of each subsequent year the commission would report to the president and congress and recommend whether each agency reviewed that year should be abolished or reorganized and whether functions of other agencies should be consolidated transferred or reorganized the fasc would also submit draft legislation to carry out the recommendations under the sunset provisions in the bill an agency would be abolished within one year of the commissions review unless the agency received statutory extension this means that following congressional approval of reauthorization bill the measure would have to go to the president in order to be signed into law if the president were to veto the bill twothirds majority in both chambers would be necessary to override the veto and extend the life of the program or agency the possibility of popular program or agency being eliminated by president with the support of one third of the house and senate arguably represents significant transfer of power from congress to the executive branch the bill would allow the deadline for abolishing an agency to be extended for an additional two years by legislation enacted by super majority of the house of representatives and the senate the commission also would report to congress on all legislation introduced that would establish new agency or new program to be carried out by an existing agency hr 3282 would direct the comptroller general of the government accountability office and the director of the congressional budget office in cooperation with the director of the congressional research service to prepare an inventory of federal programs within each agency for the purpose of advising and assisting congress and the commission in carrying out the requirements of the act although constitutional concerns appear not to have played major role in consideration of hr 3282 in prior congresses similar sunset commission bills have been questioned on constitutional grounds for example an advisory opinion from the department of justice provided for the hearing record in 1998 suggested that unless congress were to enact the schedule for review and termination recommended by the commission the bill would violate separation of powers7 an advisory opinion 7 the opinion stated because this bill would allow the abolishment of statutorily created executive agency not through legislation passed in conformity with article 1 but at the discretion and in accordance with timetable imposed by twelvemember commission composed of eight members of congress and four other personsit violates the constitutionally required separation of powers see us congress house committee on government reform and oversight subcommittee on government management information and technology hr 2939 federal sunset act of 1998 hearing before subcommittee 105th cong 2nd sess sept 14 1998 washington gpo 1998 pp 5354 crs4 from the justice department in 2002 referred to the same issue as well as other possible constitutional concerns8 summary of hr 5766 as amended hr 5766 as approved with an amendment in the nature of substitute and ordered reported favorably by the house committee on government reform on july 20 2006 would add new chapter 10 to part i of title 5 of the us code part i pertains to the agencies generally and chapter 9 is titled executive reorganization federal review commission might be established through the issuance of an executive order or enactment of joint resolution that specifies the federal programs and agencies to be reviewed by the commission each review commission would have seven members appointed by the president four of whom would be selected after consultation with designated congressional leaders up to four members of congress might be appointed to serve as nonvoting ex officio members the bill specifies qualifications for all commission members each person shall have expertise and experience in the particular programmatic area to be reviewed by the commission hr 5766 provides that within one year of enactment the president would submit to congress schedule under which additional federal review commissions would be established subsequently to review all federal agencies and programs in developing the review schedule the president would provide that agencies performing similar or related functions would be reviewed at or near the same time in its review work each commission would consider whether the missions and goals of the programs and agencies studied by the commission are being carried out as effectively and efficiently as possible the extent to which the programs and agencies duplicate or conflict with other ongoing activities and whether reorganization of the programs and agencies would better enable the federal government to accomplish its missions and goals the committee substitute offered by the chairman of the government reform committee added agency rule making to the list of factors to be considered in the frcs review whether existing rules promulgated by the agencies to carry out the programs derive from specific legislative authority are being carried out as efficiently as possible or duplicate or conflict with rules promulgated by other federal agencies and whether any agency or program being reviewed in any manner violates the constitutional separation of powers 8 the opinion for example found that giving commission whose members were appointed by congressional leaders the power to apply directly for enforcement of its subpoenas in the united states district courts entails executive or enforcement powers that would render the commission members officers of the united states who must be appointed in conformity with the appointments clause or otherwise violates the separation or powers daniel j bryant assistant attorney general department of justice letter to rep dave weldon chairman of the house subcommittee on civil service census and agency organization apr 23 2002 copy provided to author by subcommittee staff crs5 within one year after being established the commission would report to the president on its assessment of operations effectiveness and efficiency of the programs and agencies which were reviewed the commission might also submit to the president legislative proposal to reorganize consolidate abolish expand or transfer any of the programs and agencies just reviewed within 30 days after the commission reports the president would transmit to congress the assessment and any legislative proposal submitted by the commission along with the presidents recommendations regarding the assessment and proposal expedited congressional procedures9 hr 5766 mandates that congressional consideration of legislation implementing commissions recommendations occur under special fast track legislative procedures congress sometimes chooses to apply expedited legislative procedures of this type to its consideration of specific measures because the regular legislative procedures of the house and senate are timeconsuming and do not guarantee that given measure or type of measure will be considered in timely fashion or at all it is noteworthy however that as introduced amended in committee and ordered reported favorably hr 5766 specifies fast track procedures only for the house of representatives with respect to the senate it reads language to be provided ordinarily members of either house may choose to introduce legislation at any time that their chamber is in session during twoyear congress under hr 5766 the majority leader of the house or his designee would be required to introduce the bill within five legislative days after receipt from the president of the draft implementing measure10 but committee referral of the bill would follow regular legislative procedures congress generally does not mandate that committee act on bill referred to it within specified time frame under hr 5766 if committee does not report the implementing legislation referred to it within 30 legislative days privileged motion would be in order debatable for up to 20 minutes to discharge the panels from further consideration the scheduling of vote on that motion would be at the discretion of the speaker but would have to occur within the next two legislative days upon report or discharge an implementation bill would be placed on the house calendar following the report or discharge of implementing legislation from committee hr 5766 would make in order privileged motion to call up the legislation on the floor when member announced his intention to offer such motion to proceed to consideration the scheduling of vote on that motion is at the discretion of the 9 the author gratefully acknowledges the assistance of crs colleague christopher davis in drafting previous version of this discussion on expedited procedures 10 such language requiring introduction of proposal from the president is common component of fast track procedures congressional leaders regularly comply with the rule introducing the measure by request as matter of comity between the branches crs6 speaker but again must occur within the next two legislative days11 once the house has chosen to take up the implementing legislation by adopting the motion to proceed its consideration is in sense locked in it remains the unfinished business of the chamber until disposed of other business cannot intervene it cannot be laid aside and it must be disposed of before other matters may be taken up in the absence of special rule dictating otherwise the house ordinarily debates measures under the onehour rule in the senate debate is ordinarily unlimited except by unanimous consent by the invocation of cloture or by some other special procedure such as that governing budget reconciliation hr 5766 would limit house debate on the implementing bill to 10 hours the bill also would limit members ability to delay consideration of the implementing legislation by barring amendments and motions which would ordinarily be permissible under chamber rules at the conclusion of the time specified for debate the house would immediately vote on passage of the legislation expedited procedures sometimes stipulate that if before voting upon implementing legislation either chamber receives implementing legislation passed by the other chamber that second measure is not referred to committee but is voted on instead of the first chambers measure12 hr 5766 however does not specify any expedited elements after house passage the omission of such automatic hookup procedures from hr 5766 leaves open the possibility that there will be need to resolve differences between the house and senate on implementing legislation as well as the possibility that implementing legislation will die at this final stage of the legislative process although fast track procedures such as those proposed in hr 5766 may be codified in law rather than contained in the rules of the house and senate they have the same effect as chamber rules and as result are often called rule making statutes the fact that an expedited procedure is contained in statute does not mean that another law must be passed in order to alter it the provisions can be changed for example by the adoption of special rule from the house committee on rules by suspension of the rules or by unanimous consent agreement it is important to point out however that the house of representatives has the ability to change its rules more easily than is possible in the senate changing senate rules is virtually impossible without the widespread support of super majority of senators as result expedited procedures of the type proposed in hr 5766 for the 11 under hr 5766 however this motion to discharge seems to be in order only if the committee has reported the measure favorably or been discharged in other words whether it is intentional or not the expedited procedures in hr 5766 appear to permit committee to kill implementing legislation by reporting it adversely because in the house legislation is normally referred to every committee that has jurisdiction over measure to the extent feasible it is unclear under hr 5766 as it is currently drafted what happens if one committee of referral reports implementing legislation adversely and the others report favorably 12 such provisions are often included in fast track statutes to prevent the need to resolve differences between the versions of bill passed by the house and by the senate crs7 house if extended to the senate arguably would bind the senate far more dramatically than they do the house simply put they would remove the right every senator possesses under the rules to filibuster legislation and to delay or prevent final vote on its passage the house may and often does ignore statutory expedited procedures by adopting special rule from the house committee on rules laying out alternative terms of consideration13 unless strong senate expediting provisions are added to hr 5766 the fast track procedures will arguably be of negligible value the expediting elements as currently written apply only to the house which does not need such provisions to work its will comparison of selected features in hr 3282 and hr 5766 table 1 provides an overview of selected features in the two bills the following discussion highlights some differences and similarities between the measures there are parameters in the language contained in hr 5766 regarding time frame for the total duration of the reviews the provisions suggest multiple ad hoc commissions with each coming into existence pursuant to an executive order or joint resolution the bill would require the president to submit to congress schedule for establishment of frcs to review all federal agencies and programs in contrast hr 3282 stipulates that within year of enactment the sunset commission would submit review schedule to congress providing for each agency to be reviewed at least once every 12 years hr 5766 is also silent regarding the number of commissions that might be established to accomplish the reviews nothing in the bill appears to preclude the simultaneous existence of more than one frc in contrast hr 3282 envisages the sunset commission as an ongoing institutional body with rotating membership with respect to membership hr 3282 provides for 12 member commission half of whose members would be appointed by house and senate leadership hr 5766 provides for sevenmember commission appointed by the president with advice from congressional leaders although both bills would likely ensure bipartisan commissions in that both democrats and republicans would be appointed the membership would not necessarily be equally balanced the party of the president would probably enjoy at least 52 majority on each of the frcs under hr 3282 the fascs membership might be skewed 84 if the same party controlled both chambers of congress as noted already hr 3282 contains an actionforcing mechanism whereas hr 5766 lacks such provision under hr 3282 each agency would be abolished year after the completion of the sunset review unless extended by law on the other hand hr 5766 provides expedited congressional procedures for implementing 13 rep claude d pepper remarks in the house congressional record vol 134 july 7 1988 p 17071 crs8 the recommendations of the commission whereas expedited procedures are absent in hr 3282 some might support the inclusion of such procedures to facilitate consideration of bill for example to extend the life of an agency due to terminate for another two years as authorized in hr 3282 thereby allowing additional time for congress to act on reauthorization bill hr 3282 also would provide for compilation of program inventory to assist the commission and congress in the sunset review process hr 5766 is silent regarding where the president might turn for assistance in devising the purviews and review schedule for frcs which he would be required to submit to congress within year after the creation of the first frc both bills would eventually sunset the commissions under hr 5766 each review commission would terminate 90 days after submission of its assessment and possible legislative proposal to the president the sunset commission established under hr 3282 would remain in existence through several congresses and administrations but would terminate on december 31 2030 absent reuthorization finally one might keep in mind the possibility that hr 3282 and hr 5766 could conceivably both be enacted either as separate bills or combined in single measure chairman davis noted at the hearing on july 19 that the two bills as written could become separate titles of new bill for floor consideration thereby establishing the framework for bradys longterm commission as well as tiahrts ad hoc more focused commissions14 some however might view the provisions of the bills as possibly redundant even if not incompatible funding to cover administrative expenses of operating two ongoing commission frameworks might arguably engender resistance to the extent that some are concerned with the bills individually for ceding too much power from congress to the executive branch enactment of both bills would serve to compound the power transfer 14 see ralph lindeman sunset
