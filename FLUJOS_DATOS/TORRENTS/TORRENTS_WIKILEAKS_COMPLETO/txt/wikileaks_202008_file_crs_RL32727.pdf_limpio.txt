state in confrontation with israel and comprehensive settlement of arabisraeli issues is likely to require syrian support or acquiescence syria has been linked with international terrorism but on some occasions has cooperated with the united states in pursuing certain terrorist groups that both countries oppos syria opposed the usled military campaign in iraq in 2003 and has been accuse d by us officials of facilitating the infiltration of antius fighters into iraq charge denied by syrian leaders also of concern to the united states are reported syrian efforts to expand its weapons of mass destruction capabilities with relatively new and largely untested leadership syria seems to be reviewing and evaluating its internal and regional policies as syrian policy makers try to maintain dialogue with the united states while continuing to pursue what they regard as syrian national interests the type of regime that evolves in syria will affect the achievement of us goals in the region many observers incl uding some members of congress believe that the present regime in damascus is seriously complicating efforts to resolve the arabisraeli conflict fight international terrorism redu ce weapons proliferation and inaugurate peaceful democr atic and prosperous iraqi state critics point in particular to the dictator ial nature of syrian politic s and the countrys moribund economy still based largely on soviet models some call for process of internal reform in syria or alternatively for the replacement of the current syrian regime others however are concerned that ccessor regime could be led by islamic fundamentalists who might dopt policies even more inimical to the united states including support for organizations like qaeda which the present syrian regime regards as potential threat political scene development of the asad regime the death of syrian president hafi z alasad on june 10 2000 removed one of the longest serving heads of state in the middle east and key

bashar became president and arrested several out spoken critics of the regime including two members of parliame nt observers have described president bashar alasads modernization programs as akin to the chinese model with emphasis on economic reform while retaining oneparty rule structure of government and society the syrian constitution of 1973 as am ended in 1984 provides for republican government consisting of president up to three vice presidents there are currently two appointed by the president cabin et and 250member onehouse legislature elected by adult citizens including women the president is nominated by the decisionmaking branch of the ruling bath renaissance party see below agreed to by the legislature and proposed to the elect orate in referendum in practice power is concentrated in the office of the presidency and key aides prime ministers typically deal with routine administration and economic policy but the more sensitive issues such as defense and foreign affairs are exclusively within the presidents domain the us state depar tment describes syri as republic under military regime with virtually absolute authority in the hands of the president and goes on to say that despite their right to vote citizens do not have the right to change their government2 in actuality the nature of the regime depends more on the interplay of societal factors than on the structural institutions that constitute syrias political system as in several countries in the middle east the syrian population is divided along both ethnic and religious sectarian lines ma jority of syrians roughly 90 of the population are ethnic arabs however the country contains small ethnic minorities notably kurds historically syrian kurds have been much more passive than their fellow kurds in iraq turkey and iran however recent rioting over perceived government neglect and discrimination points to the possibility that syrian kurds are becoming more assertive and influenced by the advances made by their ethnic kin in neighboring countries of more importance in syria are re ligious sectarian divisions in addition to the majority sunni mu slims who comprise over 70 of the population syria contains veral religious sectarian minorities including three smaller muslim sects alawites druze and ismailis and several christian denominations despite the secular nature of the bathist regime religious sects are important in syria as symbols of group identity and determinants of political orientation as noted below3 further within these ethnic and sectarian communities are important tribal and familial groupings which ofte n provide the underpinning for political alliances bothhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32727crs4 4 power struggle involving both the asad fa mily and senior

sept 24 2004 tactical and longterm moreover superimposed on the preceding pattern are divisions along socioeconomic lines peasantry workers mercantile classes middle class wage earners public sector employees military officials and political elite finally geographic differences and local ttachments divide syrian society for example rivalries between syrias two largest cities of damascus and ale ppo and longstanding isolation of the alawite h eartland east of syrias mediterranean coast have had effects on syrian political life to retain legitimacy syrian leaders while authoritarian find it necessary to adopt policies that will accommodate to some degree the various power centers within th is diverse population three such centers in particular form the principal p illars of support for the asad regime pillars of the regime the alawite sect the alawite religious sect which evolved from the shiite sect of islam constitutes approximately 12 of the sy rian population formerly the most economically deprived and socially disadvantaged group in syria the alawites rose rapidly in the ranks of the military establishment and the ruling bath party in the 1960s and have dominated political lif in syria since then the alawite community as whole and the asad family in particular constituted an important power base for the late president hafiz alasad and at least for the time being have rallied behind his and successor t hough committed to maintaining the primacy of the alawite community the asads ve sought with some success to coopt support from other sects in fact many senior positions including that of prime minister are held by members of the sunni muslim majority however most key positions particularly in the security institutions remain in alawite hands and some observers believe that any weakening of the central regime or an outbreak of political turmoil could precipitate power struggle between entrenched alawites and the majority sunni muslims who comprise ove r 70 of the population others see the possibility of split within the alawite community itself possibly over succession issues4 in the past sectarian cohesiveness has been suffici ent to avoid major split within the alawite leadership the bath party the socialist panarab bath party whose rival wing governed iraq came to power in syria in 1963 the syrian branch of the bath with an estimated 2 million members is the senior partner in multiparty coalition called the national progressive front which w on 167 out of 250 seats in the 1998 elections and again in the 2002 elections to the syri an parliament rgely consultative body with little effective power5 although the syrian constitution specifies leading role for the bath party and the party provides the regime with political legitimacy the bath is more an instrument for the execution of policy than an originator of policy although many bathists are not alawites th ere is complex synergistic relationship between the party and the community and one commentator writing some years agohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32727crs5 6 david hirst the guardian june 26 1979 7 van dam p 100 8 neil macfarquhar husseins fall leads syrians to

as alawidominated bathist rule7 still barring major governmental change syrian leader would need to enjoy the support of the bath party apparatus the partys top decisionma king body known as the regional command sits at th top of syrias policymaking process and membership in this body is stepping stone to top pos itions in syria in june 2000 when senior syrian officials were or chestrating the succession of bashar asad to the presidency after the death of his father one of their first steps was to arrange for bashar to be elected secretary general of the regional command replacing his late father other vacancies were filled by officials supportive of the new president some commentators speculate that the co llapse of bathist rule in neighboring iraq could undermine the pivotal role of the bath in the syrian regime however there is little evidence that such fundament change in the political scene is under way there are indications however that the overthrow of sa ddam husseins regime may have emboldened syrian citizens to test the limits of their governments toleration of open criticism for example syrian film maker was quoted in recent news report as saying that when you see one of the two bath parties broken collapsing you can only hope that it will be the turn of the syrian bath next human rights lawyer however pointing to the absence of political life for four decades commented that if the regime left today there would be one to run this country8 the military and security establishment the role of the armed forces and national security services has figured prominently in most syrian regimes and predates by some years the establishment of the bathist regime factionalism within the armed forces was key cause of instability in syria in the past as military cliques jockeyed for power and made and unmade g overnments with considerable frequency this situation changed abruptly after 1970 as the elder asad gained position of unquestioned supremacy over th military and security forces the late president appointed longstanding supporters partic ularly from his alawite sect to key military command positions and sensitive intelligence posts thereby creating military elite which coul d be relied upon to help maintain the asad regime in power president bashar alasad does not have the deep connections to the syrian armed forces that his father had upon the death of his older brother basil who had been considered the heir apparent bash ar returned from advanced medical studies in london to damascus in 1994 at the late pr esident asads request

st amp on the government but some observers doubt that the old guard has yielded that much power there appear to be conflicting viewpoints as to whether ne w leadership is indeed emerging or whether recent changes are simply the natural erosion created by senior officers reaching retirement age9 other support groups although the preceding entities have long formed the mainstay of the syrian regime there are other groups on which syri as leadership can rely to some degree to broaden its support base during his multiterm nure the late president hafiz alasad was able to garner support from various ethnic sectarian and socio economic groups not necessarily represented in his core constituency various motives influenced members of such gr oups to support or acquiesce in the asad regime some welcomed th relative stability of the asad regime after two decades of instability and repetitive milita ry coups others felt sense of pride in asads consistently nationalist st ands on regional issues secularminded syrians and members of religious minority groups approved of his oppositi on to theocratic state and his measures to suppress the funda mentalist muslim brot herhood still others were overawed by pervasive and often heavyhanded poli ce and security controls it appears that for the time being at leas t the younger asad has benefitted from these sources of additional support wh ich his late father was ab to coopt at the same time some observers have warned that discontent is growing as result of the presidents apparent inability to curb the excesses of the powerful and superrich clique of regime leaders10 examples of groups that have given so support to the regime include the following sunni business elites the welltodo and mainly sunni muslim business community largely eclipsed during period of extreme socialist measures in the 1960s has undergone partial revival since the gradual adoption of more pragmatic economic policies under the asads along with surviving remnants of the old bourgeoisie this community includes ne w commercial and to lesser extent industrial class that has been able to find niche in what might be called syrias post socialist

older sunni muslim business class who we re traditionally c ontent to profit while others ruled because it feels squeez ed out by better connected rivals14 peasantry during its formative years the bath party drew considerable support from the countryside and many ra nk and file bathists came from peasant stock land reform measures enacted by bathist regimes gained additional support from the peasantry this support has c ontinued although to greater degree among middle and welloff peasants who have gained material and social benefits under the asad regimes and continue to serve in the bath party apparatus poorer peasants though not opposed to the regime became less enthusiastic in their support for it and tend to regard governmentsponsored peasan t organizations more as instruments of the regime than as organizations advocating their interests15 peasant support for the regime may have increased in recent year s as the government has shifted economic development policies from indus trial expansion to the agricultural sector including largescale irrigation projects in 2003 report us stat department officials note the success of the asad regime in giving peasant farmers stake in

down in the previous public sector expansion furthermore in more recent years the religiously fundamentalist muslim brotherhood long at odds with the bathist regime has made inroads among the lowe r

smaller sects comprise approximately 10 of the syrian population most syrian christians are arabic speaking and have traditionally tended to identify with arab nationalist movements which they see as an antidote of islamic funda mentalism at the same time like other christians in the middle east syrian christians feel certain affinity for western civilization on religious and cultural grounds19 christians have been well represented in syrian government organizations under the asad regime according to one commentator many christians apparently prefer the alasad regime or any alawidominated successor to any sunni fundamentalist alternative20 two other commentators discussing the makeup of the syrian armed forces describe christians as disproportionately represented in the syrian officer corps21 the good relations that generally exist between the syrian regime and its indigenous christian commun ity contrast markedly with the often tense relations between the syrian regime and the christian community in neighboring lebanon whereas large numbers of lebanese chris tians resent syrian domination of the lebanese political scene syrian christians tend to look on the asad regime as

political discussi on groups or salons activities which were not tolerated under the late hafiz alasad the window of opportunity for these reform ers to challenge the government was quickly closed in

hardliners who had close ties to the late president hafiz alasad others suggest that the palestinian intifada and the election of ariel sharon as prime minister in israel in 2001 caused syria to

more extensive relationship with syria the eu through its neardecade old euromediterranean partnership has sought to improve its ties to syria albeit more slowly than the eus relationships with other

concer ns about human rights and reform in syria could provide an opportunity for the us policymakers to push for conditionality on eu aid to syria in 1991 th european parliame nt briefly blocked aid to syria over alleged human rights abuses there69 however some speculate that recent us sanctions against syria could l ead european officials to support counter balancing policies in this connection some european officials feel that punitive action against arab countries will hamper european and us efforts to combat terrorism and therefore may contribute toward further strengthening of eu engagement policies with syria exploring selective engagement some experts note that with the arabisraeli peace process stalled us policy toward syria has lost focus without waiting for resumption of the peace process some analysts have suggested that the ited states couple its demands on the syrian government with concrete set of incentives to expand the ussyrian relationship through trade aid and defense and security cooperation some sp eculate that syria would welcome us assistance and the syrian government has stressed to us officials that it keeps lebanon stable supplie s electricity to iraq and helps track qaeda terrorists70 conclusions most observers agree that us relations with syria in the near term will be colored by syrias attitudes and actions on iraq with us stabilization efforts hampered by the insurgency the new iraq i government remains highly dependent on us and international coope ration making iraqi officials eager to forge strong relationships with neighboring states such as syria in order to limit crossborder interference in iraqi affairs at critical juncture in iraqs political development seen in this light us pressure on syria and on neighboring iran may be us tactic to relieve iraqi officials of havi ng to confront syria us demands for syria to curtail the activities of iraqi exbathists in syria and to stop the flow of islamic militants infiltrating

syria although bate continues over the extent of syrian support for the insurgen cy many us officials believe that syria can ill afford to run the risk of major confrontation with the united states since the launching of operation ir aqi freedom in march 2003 experts have speculated over the possibility of ussyrian military confrontation over reported syrian support for the iraqi insurgency lthough some officials have advocated regime change strategy in syria military operations in iraq have forced us policymakers to explore additional options some analysts suggest that in order to demonstrate us resolve the united states could launch either limited air strikes against insurgent leaders or use special opera tions forces to target exiraqi bathists inside syria others believe that the bush administration nd congress may propose tougher sanctions that strengthen the syri accountability act some observers also note that israel which carried out an air raid against an alleged palestinian terrorist camp near damascus in october 2003 could play role in applying pressure on syria other experts have cautioned against us military action in syria for fear of either causing broad public backlash in the arab world or strengthening radical islamist elements in syria eager for confrontation with the west overall the internal dynamics of the asad regime may continue to be key factor in determining us policy toward syria since the death of hafiz alasad in 2000 experts have debated whether bashar alasad is able to command the same authority within the regime as wielded by his father some experts have suggested that bashar alasad may be incapable of reining in high level syrian military and intelligence officials who might be actin g independently to support the iraqi insurgency although the dynamics of the asad regimes inner circ remain difficult to discern president asads relationship with other alawite military and intelligence officials may affect his ability to comply with us demands for cooperation not only in iraq but also in lebanon others suggest that bashar alasad has firm grip on power and is capable of doing more to thwart iraqi insurgents crack down on hizballah guerilla activity on the lebaneseisraeli border and comply with international demands for rem oval of syrian troops from lebanon observers are less divided on the issue of bashar alasads lack of vision and inability to promote economic development and political reform in syria since 2000 observers have noted that the regime itself has made few major policy changes some military and intelligence officials have retired president asad reshuffled his cabinet and there has been some limited privatization in the financial sector economic reforms have stalled and some experts believe that spite high oil prices and new trade agreements with the eu syrias long term economic health remains questionable although some new proposals are expected to be debated during the upcoming june 2005 syrian bath party cong ress ultimately the asad regime may try to balance the need to keep its power structure intact while moving ahead with limited reforms
