1 c your visit to moscow provides an opportunity to strengthen bilateral economic relations at time when both our economies are beginning to show signs of recovery following an extremely difficult year because our economic relations with russia were relatively stable even prior to the political reset weve seen this year we are wellpositioned to press for progress on few key issues including russias wto accession agricultural trade and intellectual property rights where more work is needed end summary usrussian relations 2 c four meetings this year between presidents obama and medvedev including the presidents july visit to moscow and secretary clintons numerous discussions with foreign minister lavrov have given impetus to real change in our bilateral relations addressing the ruling united russia party congress november 21 president medvedev even used the phrase reset heretofore reserved for issues involving the us and russia and called for an economic reset as well we want to see this will applied not just to the modernization that medvedev is advocating for russia itself but to its interaction with foreign investors and integration into global financial institutions all of which force reforms deeper into the system the challenge as always is to translate rhetoric into specific decisions and joint actions 3 c for the first time in years we have structure in the relationship to do this the obamamedvedev commission has four working groupsbusiness development and economic relations energy nuclear energy and agriculturewith remit to broaden the economic base of interaction between us the commission will give us regular focused interaction with influential centers of russias business and economic decisionmaking in early contacts some russian participants in the working groups have shown preference fro form over substance though we need to continue to set higher standard the commission needs to produce results not reports and decisions not dialogue global economic crisis and russias response 4 c the global economic crisis hit russia particularly hard as the economy remains heavily dependent on commodities exports primarily oil and gas for growth and on foreign capital for investment the abrupt drop in the price of oil combined with decline in foreign investment strained the russian economy beginning in mid2008 throughout the following twelvemonth period russian industrial production plummeted with doubledigit declines in monthonmonth production occurring on regular basis key sectors such as steel and automobiles were hit particularly hard with russian domestic automobile production declining by over 50 in the first half of 2009 the industrial sector particularly the singlecompany towns was hard hit with unemployment remaining at an unprecedented high predictions for 2009 gdp decline grew from 3 early in the year to the current estimates of 75 5 c at the beginning of the crisis the russian government held the third largest quantity of reserves internationally and relatively little sovereign debt thus the gor was much better positioned to react than many other countries the gor burned through third of these reserves an estimated 200 billion to slow the decline of the ruble the gor also provided large infusions of capital into the domestic financial sector in an effort to keep stressed banks afloat in addition the russian government instituted series of temporary crisis measures including tariff increases and other import restrictions in an effort to protect domestic production in key sectors and increase demand 6 c while these measures were successful in staving off complete collapse of the financial sector 1998 they have come at price official russian reserves are significantly lower than at the start of the crisis and we expect the gor will be required to borrow including on international markets in order to cover its expected federal budget deficit in 2010 also while the infusions of cash into the financial system prevented total meltdown banks used much of the funding to make provisions for nonperforming loans and other distressed assets the infusions of cash did not result in resumption of lending and domestic financing remains hard to come by constraining efforts to stimulate the real economy 7 c the tariff and other trade barriers did slow imports during the first half of 2009 but the reduced competition did not appear to do much to help domestic producers domestic demand particularly in the automotive and real estate sectors remains extremely weak the gor has pushed companies to retain workers during the economic downturn in an effort to slow unemployment growth and avoid potential social difficulties as result many companies have used their limited reserves to continue paying workers and are not well placed to take advantage of an economic upturn when it arrives that said russia appears to have muddled through the worst of the crisis and aided by higher oil prices and strengthening ruble gor officials are now considering how to encourage return to strong economic growth key challenges to russian economic growth 8 c dmitriy medvedev has made central theme of his presidency russias need to diversify its economy develop an innovation economy based on its strong intellectual resources integrate itself into the global economy and deal with the problems created by corruption while we support these objectives we are concerned that progress has been limited at best the recent economic crisis dealt yet another blow to russias limited industrial base the lack of domestic financing limits entrepreneurs efforts to move into new sectors weak enforcement of intellectual property laws and gaps in key areas such as protections on encryption technologies restrict growth in it and other innovative sectors russias onagain offagain approach to wto accession has not only slowed down russias own accession process but has also made it difficult for others such as the us and eu who are interested in supporting russias accession russias continued tariff and nontariff restrictions on agricultural trade also present challenges to increasing bilateral usrussia trade as many us producers are simply not able to export their products to russia finally corruption and legal nihilism continue to plague the russian governance system the death in custody of russian lawyer sergey magnitskiy is only the latest example domestic political context 9 c after year and half of tandem leadership of russia medvedev and putin continue to function based on division of labor the president plays to his strengths of clear public presentation and longrange focus on modern economy and underscores his constitutional responsibilities for foreign policy his november 12 annual address to the nation again highlighted and expanded on the theme of economic modernization and to lesser extent political reform as well putin meanwhile has built on his image of domestic problem solver employing his trademark streetwise rhetoric in dressing down oligarchs or critics his november 21 address to the annual congress of the united russia party which he heads reaffirmed public perceptions of him as the man who is making sure government pays pensions and salaries justpublished poll supports this though their ratings had been declining they shot up to 74 and 79 percent respectively after their strong performances 10 c although there is evidence that their closest advisors spar over specific policies and personnel matters the two leaders themselves share staterun national media coverage to the nearexclusion of other political figures and project an aura of ease with one another in public medvedev has yet to make major changes to the senior staff he inherited from putin putins prominence in tackling crises whether conflict with georgia gas supply negotiations with ukraine or localized unrest or frustration due to the economic crisis earns him higher public opinion ratings and elite group allegiance than medvedev this combined with his suggestions that he might stand for third presidential term all ensure that major decisions are not made without putins approval the complete national dominance of the ruling united russia party under the leadership of putin reinforced through the partys overwhelming yet tainted victory in october 11 regional elections has made it difficult for opposition parties to function let alone capitalize on economic discontent conclusion 11 c in sum your visit comes at promising momentboth our bilateral relations and our economies are beginning to move in more positive direction but challenges remain we encourage you to use your meetings with key russian governmental and private interlocutors as well as with the american business community to push for continued dialogue leading to concrete positive action we want russia to integrate into the global economy to join the wto to diversify its productive base and to move forward in the fight against corruption and we stand ready to work with russia on these issues your meetings with medvedevs top economic adviser dvorkovich and first deputy foreign minister denisov in particular are chance to move beyond improved atmospherics and examine in greater depth how we can support the best of medvedevs modernization goalseg greater energy efficiencyin ways that pay dividends to both economies and broaden the economic base of the relationship beyrle
