for us policy from foreign experiences summary of the major points of seminar summary participants in crs seminar on the possible lessons to be learned from other countries experiences in dealing with rrorism generally agreed on three things first terrorism is used by wide variety of groups for wide variety of ends second the current threat that the united st ates faces from islamist terrorism is most likely longterm and third policymakers must think through antiterrorist actions in order to avoid consequen ces that may be worse than the original problem much of the seminar discussion focused on matters that two and half years later became the subject of 911 commission recommendati ons revised introduction highlights the discussion summarized in this report that is relevant to commission recommendations the remainder of the report has not been changed discussions during the three hour minar held on january 22 2002 centered on the relative utility of three main policy tools 1 targeting members and leaders for arrest and assassination or as speaker christopher hewitt beled it the model of attrition 2 negotiati ons and 3 reforms hewitt who has studied the effectiveness of antiterrorism policies in five countries said that the only one that showed clear results was m odel of attrition i that arrest in ternment or killing of terrorists is the most effective means to significantly reduce levels of terrorist violence speaker martha crenshaw weighed the pros and cons of targeted assassinations noting that for her the disa dvantages principally the difficulty of avoiding mistakes and the possibility that assassinations would just encourage others to take the place of those killed outweig hed the advantages principally that it was relatively more humane th an massive military response the most controversial subject was the utility of political and economic reforms in countries that harbor terrorists many questions were raised about hewitts finding that improving economic conditions did not have any effect on levels of terrorism and that fairly extensive political reforms might decrease but did not end terrorism some raised the possibility that longter m educational reform s and other methods of changing perceptions might have more success the difficulties of achieving negotiated settlements to end terrorism were examined participants suggested ways to increase the chances for successful outcomes these included international s upport for legitimate core issues in order to increase support for negotiations international participation in the negotiations and the adoption of measures that would isol ate terrorists including steps to increase the rule of law and anticorruption edu cational and cultural programs the utility of controlling supporting structur for terrorism nd restricting civil liberties were also discu ssed speakers noted that international cooperation is necessary to control arms and funds that usually flow from abroad this seminar was made possible in part by grant from the charles h revson foundationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31517contents introduction 1 p r t i c i p n t s n d t p i c s 3 r

search service sponsored seminar on the possible lessons for us policy fro m the experiences of other countries in handling their own terrorism challenges although other countries generally have not experienced international terrorist incidents resembling the events of september 11 2001 in concept and in devastating execution many have confronted very severe and prolonged domestic threats to discuss whether there are policy lessons that the united states might draw from those c ountries crs invited several experts on international terrorism and ot hers with particular experi ences in one or more cases to discuss the topic although this seminar was held over two and half years ago several of the topics of discussion and speakers poi nts of view are relevant to the recommendations made by th report of the 911 commission issued in july 2004 the following four paragraphs in this introduction summarize pertinent points on the utility reform which was the major topic of discussion during the seminar as well as on four subjects highly relevant to commission recommendations these subjects were 1 the possible tradeoffs between secu rity and civil liberties 2 the tradeoffs between security risks and costs 3 in ternational cooperati on and 4 terrorist financing the remainder of the text is unchanged from the original publication of july 24 2002 several of the commissions recommendations dealt with perceived need for reforms within muslim countries economic reforms political reforms and social reforms most particularly education one of the most controversial topics of discussion at the crs seminar was the utility of such reforms the debate centered upon the accuracy of the findings of 1984 study by one of the speakers that demonstrated that levels of terrorism did not decrease when economic reforms were undertaken or when selected economic indi cators improved but rather that violence worsened when economic indicators were better other speakers and discussants raised several considerations as to why this finding may have been true 1 terrorists may have intensified their activities as they found reform s counterproductive to their objectives 2 if negotiations were going on they might have intensified activities to produce more concessions 3 the governme nt was unable to deliver the degree of reform needed or had undertaken reforms t oo late 4 other government actions such as stopping people on the streets may have unde rmined the positive effects ofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31517crs2 reform or simply 5 that the time frame covered by the study four to eleven years depending on the case may have not been long enough to demonstrate the true results of reforms one speaker pointed out that the timeframe over which one evaluates situation can affect perceptions of policys effectiveness and outcome see pp 1114 there was some discussion as to whether islamist terrorism was better addressed through longterm programs such as s ecularized education and whether changed circumstances could modify the social and psychological context which feeds terrorism speakers could not recall precedent where the united states sought to change an educational system abroad to prevent the emergence of terrorism but thought perhaps domestic example the in fluence of education in diminishing over time the power of the ku klux klan might provide insight into the possible utility of such an approach one speaker said that he found the educational system to be one of the most significant factors in predicting the occurrence of terrorism he attributed large difference in the degree of terrorism in quebec canada and northern ireland both of which have paratist movements w ithin british cultures to the deliberate nationalist indoctrination in northern irelands schools he also pointed to an example regarding northern ireland where long term cultural shift in perception has been undermining the pro terrorism culture there see pp 1314 speakers debated the degree to which the united states could affect islamist terrorism by change in its policies in the middle east particularly its policy towards israel see pp 1516 the speakers also addressed two sets of tradeoffs that were raised by the 911 commission noting that many of its r ecommendations called for the government to increase its presence in our lives the commission advanced several recommendations designed to protect civil liberties while cautioning that security must be reconciled with liberty since th success of one helps protect the other one speaker opined that whether europes severe antiterrorism laws granting extraordinary police powers in the 1970s and 1980s were effectively implemented depended upon the collection of good inte lligence that could minimize the use of intrusive repressive tactics the commi ssions recommendations also pointed to the dilemmas raised by evaluating risks within the context of limited resources but concluded in the case of transportation asse ts that terrorists should perceive that potential targets are defended discussion at the crs seminar suggested that decisions setting priorities in terms of risk may be difficult if not futile task as even the highest degree of preparedness is not going to prevent terrorist incidents as terrorists turn to second level targets wh more desirable targets are well guarded the net result according to one of the speak ers is that the united states will have to decide what degree of risk it is willing to bear much as the united states decides to tolerate the risk of deaths on its highways and from smoking see pp 1517 the commission report also indicated through several r ecommendations the need for international cooperation w ith one recommendation calling for the development of comprehensive coalition strategy against islamist terrorism crs speakers pointed to international coopera tion as helpful in controlling sources of support for terrorist acts in particul ar financing and arms see pp 89httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31517crs3 participants and topics there were three speakers the first was martha crenshaw now the colin and nancy campbell profes sor in global issues and democratic thought at wesleyan university who gave an introduc tion discussing the complexities involved in developing viable policy towards rrorism as one of the first scholars to devote herself to the study of terrorism who continues to devote major portion of her time to the subject she has studied the phenomenon for over 30 years the second speaker was christopher hewitt professor of sociology at the university of maryland baltimore county who has wr itten multicase comparative study of the effectiveness of gove rnment policies towards rrorism and book published in the spring of 2002 on american terrorism his comparative study completed in 1984 looked at five cases all modern demo cracies three were cases of ethnic or separatist terrorism the ira in northern ireland 19681973 the basque eta in spain 19751981 and the eoka in cyprus 19551958 the other two were cases of revolutionary terrorism the red br igades in italy 19771981 and the tupamaros in uruguay 19681973 of these the first two conflicts are still active to some extent the final speaker was peter probst an independent consultant with nearly 30 years of experience with the central intelligence agency and the department of defense his formal remarks concentrated on perceived deficiencies in current us policy three additional people were invited to participate in the subsequent discussion with members of the audience they were imadaddean ahmad of the minaret of freedom marc gopin visiting professor at the fletcher school of law and diplomacy and specialist in conflict resolution and ulrich seidt of the german embassy in washington dc for furt her biographical information on the speakers and commentators see appendix the three major issues that the speakers were asked to address were methods of dealing with terrorist organizations whether targeting leadership for arrest or assassination and targeting flows of money can curb or eliminate terrorist activity utility of policy reforms and accommodation whether an accommodation of us policy andor reform of middle east governments would help end radical islamist terrorism debate over civil liberties whether the strengthening of police enforcement powers and strict immigration controls have significantly enhanced public security in other countries the speakers were also asked to weigh whether there are particular policies that might be useful and to suggest policies wh ich may not have yet been tried there were three areas discussed immediately below on which there seemed to be broad agreement there were many points of liv ely discussion and deba the most salient of which are present in the section on issues in dealing with terrorist organizations this report concludes with some considerations for us policy that were raisedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31517crs4 throughout the program one hour edited versions of the seminar are available in audio ab50397 and video v b60057 tapes online audio and video excerpts from the seminar are posted at httpwwwcrsgovproductsmu ltimediasem 020122shtml areas of agreement nature of terrorism an area on which the three speakers agreed was on the nature of terrorism and the riousness of the current threat to the united states all of them saw it as tactic used in many different contexts by people willing to inflict violence on military and civilian targets in order to obtain variety of ends in response to question as to what was terrorist organization both crenshaw and hewitt thought it best to avoi d labeling organizations as such arguing that applying terrorist label to acts and not the actors would facilitate clearer analysis and policymaking ahmad offered definition deliberate targeting of civilians to create an atmosphere of terror with the inten tion of advancing ones particular cause longterm prospect of violence all also agreed that the united states may be dealing with international terrorism as domestic problem for very long time the united states is in situation that is likely to last for generations according to probst while others did not speculate on the time frame there was general agreement that terrorism tends to become long term selfperpetuating problem because it engenders cycle of violence crenshaw pointed out that the problem in dealing with terrorism is in ma ny cases not just wiping out the terrorist network its dealing with whole gene ration of usually young men who have been socialized into certain culture of viol ence and form recruiting pool youre not going to kill and arrest all those people you cant so in many cases the change that you anticipate even with the best of policies and the best of circumstances will be many years twenty years generation down the pike she as the others cautioned that as long as the threat of terrorism exists even the highest degree of alertness and preparation is not going to prevent acts of terrorism taking place unintended consequences several speakers warned in various contexts that policymakers needed to think several steps ahead in formulating antiterrorism policies in order to avoid unintended consequences that could make bad situation worse crenshaw pointed out two instances in israeli policy where attempts to deal with the palestine liberation organizati on plo were counterproductive creating new and perhaps more dangerous advers aries and situations according to crenshaw israel attempted to deal with the plo in the late 1980s by tolerating the emergence of hamas as rival to the plo instead of creating hopedfor balance of power this strategy in the end may have created an enemy who was harder to deal with than the first enemy she sa id also in 1978 and again in 1982 israel sought to protect its northern borders from incursions by the plo by invading lebanon and occupying southern lebanon in 1982 israel succeeded in getting the plo to withdraw and getting the plo to go to tunisia she pointed out but of course in doing so they ma naged to create hezballah httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31517crs5 issues in dealing with terrorist organizations attrition targeting members and leaders in his review of his five country comp arative study hewitt stated that the only policy tool that significantly reduced levels of terrorist violence was what he called model of attrition ie th arrest internment or killin g of terrorists the more terrorists or suspected terrorists that you could arrest or kill the lower level of violence was he said it wasnt true fo r every country but it was true for three of the five cases i looked at he also added that the same held true in his more recent study of american terrorist groups theres limited number of terrorists if you could catch or kill enough of them th the terrorism will fall off according to hewitt such policy requires good intelligence obtained through good police work in surveillance payoffs to inform ants infiltration and eliciting information from captured terrorists the most success is had he said from intelligence gained from infiltration and information given by informants and turned or surrendered terrorists tactics of repression and mass searches are more likely to be counterproductive you need to be able to know who the terrorists are so instead of searching thousand housesyou go to one house break down the door and grab the terrorist in thereyou dont have to alienate thousand households hewitt also pointed to successes in countri which have used laws to facilitate gaining information from terrorists he cited successes in northern ireland gained from terrorists who surrendered and received amnesty and ne w identities in return for information and in italy from terro rists who received reduced sentences both probst and crenshaw concurred w ith hewitt that good police work can be an effective means of dealing with terrorism arrests and the rule of law do seem to be the most effective longterm way according to probst crenshaw also concurred that you can with good intellig encewipe out certain network whether its political or whether its criminal crenshaw asserted that one could not arrest or kill all members of an orga nization and raised the need to attempt to deal with the circumstances that spawned such organi zations or networks unless you can do something about those circumstances sh argued eliminating one adversary might only create another thats stronger more lethal more committed and has learned the lessons of its predecessors creating very very long run sort of problem additional drawbacks in targeting leaders crenshaw concurred that there were cases that demonstrated the utility of arresting leaders but raised possible problems in the practice she noted that th arrest in the 1990s of two top leaders abdullah öcalan head of the kurdistan wo rkers party pkk in turkey and aníbal guzman head of the shining path in peru did appear to have very significant negative impact on those movements however she also cited the israeli experience with arrests and ssassinations of leaders as mixed one and thought that it and other countries experiences with such tactics deserved more study im not sure that we know which types of organiza tions are so dependent on single leader that removing that leader really ends the organization and when it doesnt httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31517crs6 she pointed to further problem that could ensue if jailing or killing the top leader did not put an end to the organiza tion sometimes what it does is deprive you of someone to negotiate with if in the long run you think youre going to have to negotiate with them this she point ed out was dilemma that the algerian government faced in the 1990s after it ja iled the two top leaders of the islamic salvation front which was likely to win elections when the government found it couldnt crush the group however it released the leaders in order to negotiate it found however that they were longer of any use because they had lost the trust of their former followers weighing an assassination policy responding to question on the issue of targeting leaders of terrorist organi zations for assassina tion crenshaw listed common perceptions of the pros and cons of such policy she noted that she was leaving aside the moral issue of taking lif without due process an advantage she said was that assassinations could be an efficient means to cripple an organization by removing the leadership or the people with key skills and relatively more humane than using massive military response in which many innocent people might be killed she cited four disadvantages however which in her opinion outweighed the advantages first crenshaw argued that it woul d be hard to avoid mistakes she noted that an assassination requires excellent intelligence but that even with the best intelligence mistakes can be made and innocent civilians killed she pointed out that even israel with its very good reputation for gathering accurate intelligence has killed innocent people because of mista kes in choosing its targets second she j udged that public opinion would be very volatile in the abstract she thought most pe ople would regard an assassination policy as good idea but that in the long run if government assassinated the wrong pe rson two or three times as almost surely is going to happen then you d have public backlash third she raised the possibility that the targets would not be as critical to the organization as believed and that their elimination might not end the threat fourth she pointed out that in so cases such policy could just encourage other people to step in to that persons shoes depending on whether there were others in the organization with equivalent skills she speculated that for technical skills theres always going to be substitutability probst opined that terrorist planners those who plotted the actual acts would be hardest to replace but he thought that some technical people would have special flair that might make them irreplaceable others picked up on the issues of the morality of an assassination policy and its effectiveness probst asked why some consider it morally acceptable to try to kill somebody by dropping bomb from 30000 feet as opposed to clean rifle shotthe chances for mistake or misstep i think are much greater when you engagehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31517crs7 1 ahmad later provided two references for that statement 1 on the palestine information center website on hamas under the heading about hamas and the subheading military action in hamas program the organization st ates anxious to see civilians on either side fall victim to the conflict hamas took several initiatives proposing that both sides stop targeting civilians and that they be exclude d from the scope of conflict however the zionists rejected these initiatives and by doing so they showed their terrorist nature httpwwwpalestineinfocoukhamasindexhtm 2 on the palestinian news website in an article of november 1999 issue 101 entitled hamas we wont attack israeli civilians if israel stops attacking palestinians sheikh ahmed yassin described as hamas founder and spiritual leader is cited as within the context of series of interviews w ith israeli and arab media going so far as to propose an openended moratorium on attacking israeli and palestinian civilian by both sides the ezzul deen alqassam military wing of hamas fighters are aware that islam is against targeting civilians who are noncombatants he suggested that attacks by hamas military wing on israeli civ ilians were mostly reaction to bl oody israeli attacks on palestinian civilians including the murder of 29 worshipers by an israeli settler in february of 1994 yassin even reiterated an earlier proposal by the movements military wing proposing freeze of armed attacks against israe lis including settlers in return for freeze on all settlement activity in something like bombing raid if you are trying to put terrorist leader or terrorist planner out of commission in later amp lification probst stated that assassination can be more humane tool than bombing s or other acts of warfare which are indiscriminate and risk the killing of inno cents while an assassination carried out by sniper is relatively precise and sends message he dded that the primary aim of lethal operations is not retaliation but rather to deprive terrorist group of its leadership and brain trust thereby reducing the risk to innocent men women and children who are the terrorists prime targets if early in the game we had been able to eliminate osama bin laden mohammed atef and ayman alzawahiri we probably would have been spared the tragedy of 911 and some 3000 am ericans would be alive today probst also expressed concerns about the possible unintended consequences and thought that policymakers need to think through secondary and tertiary cons equences of an act others commented on the morality issue in the discussion over assassinati on in the middle east see the second paragraph in the section below debate over assassination in the middle east the application of these policies in the middle east situation provoke d some debate crenshaw stated that while in the united states consideration of an assassination policy has always assumed that the action would be preemptive she thought israels assassination policy was retaliatory designed to extr act revenge retaliation in her view provokes counterretaliation curre ntly in the form of the palestinian suicide bombings although she said that israel mig ht judge that the advantages of such policy outweighed the disadvantages she d reservations in her judgment the israelis had gotten trapped in need to respond creating vicious cycle from which it would be very difficult to escap ahmad who supported crenshaws view that hamas actions are retaliatory also stated that hamas had offered to stop its suicide bombings if israel would stop killings he later provided citati ons to support his view as footnoted below1 he argued that an assassi nation policy is problematic not because it is more or less moral than dr opping bomb or causing collateral damagehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31517crs8 2 james adams the financing of terror behind th plo ira red brigades and m19 stand the paymasters how the groups that are terrorizing the world get the money to do it the american edition publication inform ation new york simon and schuster 1986but because it is counterproductive the problem he said is that it invites retaliation on the target of the person who authorized the assassination gopin argued that the hamas suicide bombi ngs were not retaliation and disputed the idea that hamas had offered to stop its suic ide bombings if israel would stop its killings it was very clear from the beginning that they were training throughout the oslo years for suicide bombing on very concerted basis against civilians he further argued that the israelis regarded policy of assassinating leaders as more humane than other possible tactics believe it or not they see it as kind of humanitarian lessening of the violence as opposed to tank shells etc in response to an attack against them gopin also questioned whether assassina tions can be an effective policy in circumstances where people are willing to die for their cause if so many people are committing suicide in other words they want to die where is the preventive measure in terms of killing somebody he as the others concluded that an assassination policy in israel or elsewhere can be counterproductive arrest is humiliating assassination exalted dealing with support structures several of the discussants cited need to control the sources of support for terrorist acts as corollary some not ed that such control would require the assistance of other nations hewitt agreed that policies to cut off fundi ng were helpful but did not agree that such policies in themselves could curb terro rism he attributed his reservations about the effectiveness of such policies to hi s belief that powerful terrorist groups get funding because they are powerful he pointed out that his view is different from that of other analysts who believe that terro rists become powerful as result of the funding most notably james adams2 and therefore view such policies as highly effective crenshaw thought that it would be very helpful to cut off not so much the longterm social support structures the s upply of recruits but money finances arms she warned however that theres magic bullet she also noted the need for international coope ration in implementing cutoff po licies the british had lot of success against the irish republican army once they secured the active cooperation of the republic of irela nd in cutting off money and weaponswho discovered and destroyed arms caches which were often in the irish republic and also through the help of other govern ments who intercepted arms shipments similarly she pointed out that spain could not begin to deal with the basque separatist group the eta until france helped spain control their common borderhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31517crs9 3 although before the date of this seminar saudi arabia was viewed as uncooperative in blocking such funds after the date of this semi nar some us officials stated that the saudis were increasingly cooperating with the united st ates on controlling funding to groups in the qaeda network see saudis crack down on charity linked to qaeda network the washington post march 12 2002 p 11 however still later reports indicated that officials thought that further progress was ne eded on controlling funding to terrorist groups see bush looks to mend arab world fences the baltimore sun april 25 2002 p 14a 4 robert p clark negotiating with eta obstacles to peace in the basque country 1975 1988 reno university of nevada press 1990gopin stated that the current middle ea st situation is exacerbated by outside powers and interests he c ontended that elements in ir aq and saudi arabia and some western charities are contributing money to the s upport structure for suicide bombings in israel raising difficu lt considerations for us policy3 the difficulties of negotiations discussion on the utility of negotiati ons underscored the extreme difficulties of bringing negotiations to successful conclusion negotia tions were undertaken in three of the five cases that hewitt examined and they broke down in all three hewitt offered several different hypotheses on why negotiations in these and other cases did not work for one he thought th at in some cases the demands are so thoroughly polar that theres negotiation possible because there is way the parties can split the difference what democratic government is going to allow socialist revolution to take place he asked what democratic government is going to allow section of its territory to leave its authority and form an independent state he also cited studies that indicate that some fighters may want to keep fighting because they dont know what else to do4 in addition hewitt stated that ceasefires are commonly used as way to reequip nd regroup and to bring in new recruits so that when the negotiati ons break down conflict resumes at higher level gopin agreed with this assessmen t negotiations do when they fail create more terrorism hewitt and gopin both ventured that ne gotiations and unila teral responses to grievances would only work if undertaken be fore terrorist violence begins once youve got terrorism working negotiati ons probably dont do much according to hewitt for gopin the answer also lay in trying to address problems that are potential sources of violence before organi zations develop terrorist structures it boils down to knowing the soup from which terrorism comes versus knowing the highly professionalized struct ures and terrorist cells that you might be examining you want to cut it off before it gets to that point dealing with factions the speakers were asked if the large number and divergence of groups and factions within groups in the middle east will make it impossible to bring an end to conflict th ere through negotiations crenshaw pointed out that british dealings with the irish re publican army were just such case and the same was true in germany where some of the groups gave up the armed struggle but others emerged who were not under their c ontrol she also pointed out that it washttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31517crs10 5 although one at the seminar countered seid ts statements not all analysts have agreed that the level of violence is related to us pa rticipation as reflected by debate within the bush administration on this issuea common psychological misperception that were always prone to see these groups as monolithic when theyre not monolithic at all ahmad suggested that the differences am ong factions might be dealt with by understanding the value of each issue at stake to each of the groups involved outsiders he said have to distinguis h between peripheral issues which can vary from group to group and core issues upon wh ich all parties to one side of the conflict agreed in dealing with the core issues outsiders have to judge which are widely considered legitimate if negotiations are focused on those issues they might not appease the terrorist groups he argu ed but may have an impact on the political dynamics of negotiations by appealing to many groups who support the terrorists if the demand is on core issue that is unacceptable to us the united states as an interested party and illegitimate then we have problem and us s upport for negotiation is not possible but if the demand is for an issue that is quite legitimate for example demand that some state adhere to international law then by supporting that demand you will not satisfy all groups but you will appeal to whole bunch of groups who are siding ag ainst our position and may be engaged in what we consider terrorism thus rrorists may be neutralized by undermining support for them in the broader society th is would apply to the current situation in the middle east ahmad argued stating that even if position that urged israel to henceforth abide by the geneva conventi ons and pertinent resolutions would not satisfy qaeda it still would satisfy many other groups improving the possibilities of negotiations two suggestions were made for improving the possibilities of ccessfully concluding negotiations seidt stated that although negotiations may be difficult the possibility of successful negotiated outcome should not be written off completely pa rticularly in cases where the conflict is over territory to increase the possibilities of success he argued that negotiations should involve not only the two pa rties in conflict but also third party in the role of mediator or facilitator looking at th recent increase in violence and terrorism in israel for example seidt judged that the level of violence and terrorism in the middle east was far lower as long as the united states was involved in the middle east peace process but that it rose when the united states disengaged5 gopin thought that peace processes w ithout simultaneous and steady steps to increase the rule of law were doomed to failure simulta neous anticorruption education and cultural measures should be unde rtaken to guarant ees that process is moving towards coexistence peace process needs to slowly and steadily isolate terrorism he argued and not bli ndly give endless sums of money that end up being used to create corrupt system that further feeds the terrorists gopin also thought that terrorism strategi should be measured for their effects on both leadership and on the soup that feeds terrorism ie the people who provide either active or t acit support for terrorists because of their sympathy with their cause he thought it might be necessa ry to develop different policies to dealhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31517crs11 with each he pointed out that the ability of leaders to negotiate will depend on how their followers judge the potential accepta bility of possible outcome and that depends partly on their assessm ent of the current situation utility of reforms hewitts most contentious findings we re that reforms and accommodation did not lead to the cessation of terrorism hewitt contended that while many analysts view addressing the root causes of conflict th rough political and economic reforms as essential in order to dry up the water in which the fish swim his study led him to doubt the utility of that approac h the study examined the relationship between levels of terrorism and political reforms and between the levels of terrorism and several economic indicators including une mployment the standard of living and inflation and levels of terro rism regarding reforms he found that even when most of terrorists grievances were addressed the leve l of terrorism only decreased it did not end hewitt noted that in two cases spain and northern ireland fairly extensive reforms were made without affecting the levels of violence he also found that improving economic conditions doe snt have any effect on the level of terrorism in every one of the five cases he examined hewitt said that if anything there was actually more terrorism in the good months than there was in the bad months obstacles to success hewitts remarks led to an extended discussion on the possibilities of generalizing further from his findings in five cases with limited time frames and on the motivations of individual terrorists and the sentiments of those who support terrorist organizations one audience member questioned whether hewitts findings would hold tr ue if he looked at the sa cases over decades the time frame of his studies ranged from four to 11 years and if these findings would necessarily hold true in all cases hewitt conceded that they might not other speakers and commentators as well as hewitt offered several hypotheses as to why hewitts findings would be true at least in some cases their explanations included judgments on the motivations of terrorists their vested interests and tactical considerations and the difficulties of governments in meeting their demands and the timing of reforms as discussed below gopin and ahmad however both argued that in developing policies to control terrorism it is necessary to distinguish between the effects of policies on the terrorists themse lves and the effects on their supporters the real question is the support group for them and the ways in which those support groups destabilize or can dest abilize efforts to stabilize c ountries such as palestine or such as pakistan and thats where ec onomic issues and psychological issues and gestures and cultural relationsw ould become operative gopin said vested interests tactical c onsiderations difficult demands probst commenting on hewitts finding that terrorist activities spiked when reform was at its height opined that perhaps the reason was that terrorists felt most threatened by economic reform the idea being that if the economy of the area improves their recruiting pool will likely lesse n or dry up if you remove the core grievances its true youll still have core group of terrorists but recruiting replacements might be much more difficult although hewitt had not interviewed terrori sts to assess their motivations but only looked at empirical da ta he also offered reasons related tohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31517crs12 6 he cited one book to take arms year in the provisional ira by maria mcguire london macmillan 1973 which makes reference to such calculations by the ira motivations to explain why his data would accurately reflect the situation noting that he had f ound that peri ods of political and economic reforms were periods when violence spiked he posited that terrorists mig ht be making cold calculations that they could force the government to more cessions if they escalated the amount of violence6 he also speculated that sometimes reforms might not work because what was needed was beyond what the government could deliver hewitt also suggested that it was difficult to separate out the impact of reforms and economic improvements because despite improvements in economic conditions the general situation might not be percei ved as improving when so many other things were going on simultaneously on ce youve got violence started theres whole dynamic of violence itself one reasonfor example why economic reforms may not work is youre pumping money i n but the terrorists are blowing up buildings and factoriesso its sort of vicious cycl and there are also other factorspeople being stopped on the street s and harassed and so on timing the timing of reforms might also be factor ahmad echoing crenshaws idea that there were points at which the cycle of violence excluded help posited that reforms did not work because they were undertaken so late when the cause was lost already hewitt stated that one reason that so many ethnic groups with territorial grievances did not turn to violence was that some governments made concessions to them in timely fashion be fore the situation reached one of violence economic motivations whether economic factors were among the motivations of people for joining organizati ons and undertaking terrorist acts or for continuing to commit acts of terrorism was also discussed hewitt said that he did not find much of correlation between depr ivation and the incidence of terrorism as counterevidence to the idea that poverty and econo mic deprivation motivates people to participate in terrorism hewitt noted that nationalist terrorists tend not to come from the most disadvantaged groups but rather are crosssection of their society and that revolutionary terrorists tend to come from privileged classes he pointed out the basques came from rich region and that ethnic basques within that region tend to be better off than the i nhabitants who are not ethnic basques ahmad however indicated that just because terrorists did not come from the poorest groups in society did not disc redit the idea that economic deprivation contributes to terrorism in his view the economic motivation was not necessarily the amount of an individuals own income but the perception of theft from group with which one identifies ie whether one group was be ing exploited or raided to give prosperity to anothe r he thought that when examining economic rationales analysts should not think of them on an individualistic basis rather he said analysts should look at complex feeling of affiliation and sympathy for people and empathy people may have w ith one another he dr ew parallel between the situation of germany after world war i when the victorious allies required germany to pay hefty reparations which many see as an important factor in the rise of hitler and the economic deprivation in iraq wh ich he believes resulted in the creationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31517crs13 of osama bin laden even though osama bin laden himself is quite wealthy he is able to have credibility among the massesof the arab states ahmad argued because of the extreme dispossession and deprivation of the iraqis several of the speakers and the commentators suggested that the extent to which economic conditions motivate terrorists may differ from the extent to which they motivate terrorists supporters gopin so distinguished between two types of suicide bombers he thought the motiva tions were different for those suicide terrorists who are highly organized and hi ghly trained and those who are driven to suicide for economic motives because of desperate situation or the desperation of the circumstances with funding belie ved to be provided by outside sources to support the families of suicide bombers for the later group gopin said its basically like life insurance policyt here are many people signing up simply because its the best way in bad situation for them to have future for their family potential for longterm change some speakers and audience members raised the possibility that terrorism may be addressed through longterm programs or circumstances that would change the social and psychological context which feeds terrorism for some taking longterm pe rspective was crucial in developing and assessing options ahmad argued that the scope of ones view ie the time frame over which one conceptualizes situati on can affect perceptions of policys effectiveness and outcome w hen youre looking at longer term things may look very very different than they do when you l ook at the short term he stated gopin wondered whether counterterrorism acade mic research can become wider to examine things over the long term not just in terms of whats going on with this terrorist cell but whats going on in the larger culture that can be correlated positively or negatively withthe strength of terrorism two areas were mentioned where change might be encouraged educational reform and cultural shifts attributable to changing pe rceptions discussed below educational reforms one member of the audience asked whether it might be productive for the united states to invest substantially in s ecularized educational institutions in developing countries cren shaw stated that she did not know of any precedent where the us tried to change an educational system abroad so as to prevent the emergence of terrorism but sp eculated that it would take some 20 years for effectiveness to show there was some discussion as to whether there were other applicable precedents the suggestion that the united states has changed the nature of germany and japan after world war ii through educational systems drew some skepticism as precedent because the unite d states was also engaged in extensive political reform in those count ries others looked to domes tic situations for possible precedents probst mentioned that educa tion over time diminished the power of the ku klux klan and made martin luther ki ng hero an example that crenshaw and others thought more valid precedent gopin said that he thought counterte rrorism strategy without legislative package that encourages new systems of education globally is going to fail hewitt said that one of the reasons that he nds to downplay economic factors is that one of the most significant factors he found in predicting the occurrence of terrorism was the character of the educational system i think what makes terrorists and what makes terrorist supportersis the kind of so cialization they have he pointed outhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31517crs14 7 this claim was removed in the cons titutional amendment which took effect on december 2 1999 8 as adopted by the palestine national c ouncil in 1968 the plo covenant stated in article xv that the liberation of palestineaims at the elimination of zionism in palestine this article which is widely interpreted as deny ing israels right to exist was deleted as part of the subsequent oslo peace process that there was large difference in the degree of terrorism in quebec and in northern ireland which both have sepa ratist movements within britis h cultures he attributed the difference to deliberate nationalist indoc trination in northern irelands schools which was not present in the case of queb ec education in the catholic schools of northern ireland the parochial schools whic h virtually every catholic went to was kind of indoctrination in being an iris h nationalist comparing the writings of northern irish catholic groups with t hose of greek cypriot groups hewitt found similarities in that both emphasized the role of education in promoting their cause crenshaw raised concerns about the wi sdom of placing too much emphasis on longterm policies warning that shortterm policies should not be slighted obviously the seeds come both from within societies like egypt saudi arabia pakistan afghanistan as well as us global presence as the worlds only superpower after the end of the cold war she said surely we can work toward educational reform in these countries but its very difficult still to predict what will happen to know in the long term what exactly is going to happen changing perceptions hewitt cited the possibility of long term cultural shifts in perceptions or reality that can undermine the social and psychological support base for terrorism he discussed changing perceptions in northern ireland as example that might help clarify possibilities for israel he pointed out that the irish republics 1937 constitution had claimed the territory of northern ireland the only constitution that he knows of with claim on the territory of another state7 that provision he said scared the protes tants and encouraged the catholics in northern ireland contributing to culture which fomented terrorism he drew parallel between that document and the f ounding documents or constitution of the plo which he said called for the total destruction of israel8 with time however he said northern irish cat holics have suddenly realized that southern ireland ie the irish republic is not that crazy to have them and this realization is prompting shift in perception that is contributing to change in the proterrorism culture gopin discussed the importance of what leaders in the islamic world say on influencing perceptions he pointed to recent statements by the pakistan president as one indication of the type of change needed for example general pevrez musharraf made major speech in the last couple of weekssaying our islam is not going to be captured by extremism he said were going to have jihad for economic stability not jihad against the united states that was hermeneutic development to the concept of jihad within his culture and in his religion that was revolutionaryhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31517crs15 debate over respect for civil liberties hewitt noted that european actions against terrorism in the 1970s and 1980s were all carried out in the context of severe antiterrorist laws granting extraordinary police powers while he f ound it difficult to assess the effects of the laws themselves he thought that whet her they worked depended on whether they were implemented in such way that they avoided means such as mass searches that would alienate the population he pointed to the collection of good intelligence as the crucial factor in eff ective implementation you need to be able to know who the terrorists are so instead of searching thousand housesyou go to one house break down the door and grab the terrorist in thereyou dont ve to alienate thousand households but you get the terro rist such intelligence was gathered through various means surveillance lowlevel cash payments infiltration of terrorist groups which hewitt said can be relatively easy in some cases impossibly difficult in others and dealing with captured terrorists by promising reduced sentences as in italy or giving amnesty and new identity as in northern ireland in return for information on their comrades crenshaw thought that one lesson to be learned from the experiences of european liberal democracies with dom estic terrorism in the 1970s and 1980s was that despite policies that clamped down pretty severely on terrorismcivil liberties did survive she suggested that restrictions on civil liberties to protect citizens of wellestablished democracies against terro rism were not as great dilemma as perhaps some people have seen it in past years while some measures may have been arguable and some were criticized the european democracies were resilient she further indicated survivin g their encounters with terro rism in very robust sort of fashion issues regarding us policymaking how much can the united st ates control the sources of terrorism one theme that reoccurred throughout th seminar was the degree to which the united states can control the factors that promote international terrorism particularly in the current situation in dealing with th multipronged threat of islamist terrorism crenshaw emphasized the degree to which th situation was outside of us control we cant force egypt or saudi arabia to reformand in many cases the results of what you do are so longterm and so contingent that you will find it hard to persuade government to take risks for policies when you say the payoff may be twenty years from now she argued she also warned th at the public should not be led to expect that there can be perfect solution to th problem its not to say one shouldnt be prepared she said but its very difficult to have the kind of security that the public could be led to expect ahmad held that while there are actors in the middle east that the united states cant control there are situations there that the united states can control he cited as definitely under our control three of osama bin ladens objections to ushttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31517crs16 policy in the middle east sanctions agains t iraq the supply of arms to israel and the presence of american troops on saudi so il regarding whether it is in the us interest to continue suppor ting israeli occupation of th west bank ahmad said that george washington had pointed out that an entangling alliance with another foreign country is not in americas in terest and therefore it woul d be an affirmation of us interests to stop supporting an illegal occupa tion referring specifically to israel ahmad made suggestions that in his view would help the united state assert control in the middle east ie dont legitimize terrorism by engaging in it or sponsoring it yourself nd dont provoke it terrorism by engaging in unjust policies against people who have other resources than resistance probst took issue with the idea that the united states should alter us policy on these issues however arguing that to do so would be simply to capitulate american interests wherever they might be challenged such capitulation he argued would whet the terrorists appetite probst stressed that there is problem between the united states and islam but said that there is cultural war between america and small but very wellf unded band of extremists who as some muslims have said have h ijacked islam although there are things which are out of us control and must be recognized as such probst argue d when we defend our interests candidly and wellw not only earn the respect of other countries who may be innately hostile to us but we also create an atmosphere in which there is much less chance of misreading signals misread signals lead to conflict and conflict can often burgeon into war grand strategy and improved organization the question of whether or not the ited states needs grand strategy towards terrorism was raised by crenshaw who nevertheless stated that she would stand by my conclusion that it is very difficult to come up with viable grand strategy for dealing with terrorism ho wever she also noted longing for such strategy there are many difficult ques tions that she thought would need to be answered in order to formulate such po licy most involving costbenefit decisions necessary to shape such strategy how much tolerance of risk do we have as society do we face one threat or many smaller threats would grand strategy be too costly what would be the cost to achieve certain vels of protection crenshaw pointed out that the united states tolerates lot of risks that are not associated with terrorism such as deat hs on the roads and highways and smoking do we feel more keenly about terrorism that were willing to pay more to defend against it she asked because the gra nd strategy that we proposemight be extremely costly crenshaw noted that germany beginning in 1972 had organized its bureaucracy to effectively deal with terro rism she doubted however that the united states government would be similarly capable of organizing an effective structure seidt described the rationale for the german organization and the three main elements of its strategy he recounted that in the 1970s when germany found itself faced with terrorism threat after the 1972 killing of israeli athletes at the munich olympics the government decided it needed to start to deal with the problem at the strategic level not the operational level to confront the threat it faced from the redhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31517crs17 army faction in germany and the pales tinian organizations with which it had relations the german government adopted strategy of attr ition that strategy included good old solid police work and ope rational thinking but it also integrated traditional intelligence work and sought to discern the mind set of the terrorists ie the forces driving the terrorists and their sympathizers one of the greatest problems in implementing the strategy seidt said was the conflicting operational thinking of the different state agencies of police work and of intelligence work and the question of who was to direct the comp rehensive strategy at the end we ended rather at the top of the whole political system namely in the chancellors office crenshaw questioned whether the united states was appropria tely organized to combat terrorism and made two recommendations one was that the state department office of counterte rrorism assume more importa nt role the other was that implications for terrorism become an integral part of all foreign policymaking we can longer compartmentalize terrorism and say its separate from the rest of our foreign policy its not separate its never been separate and it always has to be part and parcel of overall formula tion of foreign and defense policy many participants seconded crenshaws ggestion that there be constant flow of money to study and deal with terrorism she noted that in the 30 years that she has been studying terrorism money seems to fo llow crisis and dry up when the crisis is perceived to have pa ssed undermining efforts to understand the phenomenon feasibility of infrastructure protection probst urged greater funding for security claiming that there are several security measures that are recognized as bein g needed but are not implemented because theyre judged to be too expensive too in convenient or simply too hard and then after the terrorists exploit that particularly vulnerability and there are too many dead we find the money and we embrace the inc onvenience and we discover that in reality it wasnt too hard after all he noted that he thought that the next terrorist incident of major proportions is likely to involve weapons of mass destruction biological chemical radiological or ma ybe even nuclear he looke d at targets that he thought were natural targets for future terrorist ac tions and thought they should be protected probst cited several statements by osama bin laden that his target was the united states economy and then said that when he looked at the lack of protection around wall street it made his blood run cold hewitt and crenshaw argued that even the highest degree of preparedness is not going to prevent terrorist incidents from taking place they pointed out that the list of potential targets is long and cited several examples in other countries where terrorists turned to second level targets when the most obvious targets were well guarded crenshaw pointed out that us policymakers will have to consider what risks they and us society as whole are willing to take and how much they are willing to spend in order to guard potential targets and believed they might conclude that such protection might be too expensivehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31517crs18 suggestions for further study virtually all participants argued that there is need for further study on the causes and conduct of terrorism several of the speaker s noted an inconsistency in us attention to and funding for countert errorism measures with tendency to peak during crises and fade afterwards seidt suggested from the german experience that it is necessary to be patient be modest put slow and steady stream of money into it among the specific suggestions were the following noting dearth of comparative policy studies crenshaw stated that she thought that scholars were just beginning to sort through many issues regarding what lessons coul d be learned for us policy from other cases and thought that some sort of systematic study would be worth the effort in particular she suggested further study on the longterm effects of assassination policy in places which have had such policies such as israel south africa and to lesser extent france something she thought that academics would not be able to do because of the classified nature of much of the relevant information probst suggested the establishment of multidisciplinary center to study terrorism he thought par ticularly importa nt was better understanding of the motivati ons of terrorists and the psychodynamics of different groups as each group is different each is unique each has its own customs and the threat such groups pose to our national security he noted that billions were being spent on such items as improving security for infrastructure but that programs exploring the psychology of terrorism are not as wellfunded and given significantly less priority actions that we may label as crazy may appear perfectly rational in the context of the terrorists worldview and of his value system he argued to effectively fight such groups we must understand them gopin argued for joint multidisciplinary effort between policy analysts and the academic field of antiterrorism as mentioned earlier he thought desirable an ex amination of cultu ral determinants of terrorism to achieve real unde rstanding of terrorism in the long run he also argued for more re search on long term effectiveness of various antiterrorism policies hewitt suggested future research on whether one big terrorist event has more effect on country than series of smaller events ie chronic terrorism like bombing every other week in shopping mall he also suggested considera tion of the adoption of national id card in the united states as method of controlling terrorism seidt suggested study of the different branches of sufi islam and their ways of thinking raphael perl of crs suggested studies of criminal networks and policy responses to them for instance the kingpin approach in wiping out drug cartels in order to gain insightshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31517crs19 into how terrorism works and how to make counterterrorism policy more effective rens lee consultant with crs suggested an examination of the factors that make negotiations successful or unsuccessful and of programs th at might be developed to help members of terrorist networks reintegrate into society httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31517crs20 appendix participants biographies imadaddean ahmad is president and director of the
