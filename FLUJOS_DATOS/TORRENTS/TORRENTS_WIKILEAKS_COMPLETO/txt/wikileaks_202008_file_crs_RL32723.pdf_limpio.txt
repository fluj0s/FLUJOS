in early 2008 the zimbabwe parties are now struggling to determine who will control key ministries and implementation will require major concessions from all sides background after years of economic sanctions by the intern ational community and decadeslong civil war that resulted in mo re than 30000 dead the white minority rule government of southern r hodesia concluded series of agreements with the black majority in 1979 that resulted in the estab lishment of the government of the republic of zimbabwe among the greatest challenges facing the new government was the demand by the majority for great er equity in land distribution22 at independence the white minority who composed less than 5 of the population owned the vast majority of arable land many observers considered the countrys whiteowned commercial farms cruc ial to the countrys economy although there was general recognition that land reform was necessary britain initially funded willing buyer willing seller program to redistribute commercial far mland offering compensation to white farmers amenable to leaving their lands dissatisfaction with the pace of land reform grew and led in the 1990s to spontaneous and often violen t farm invasions at the sa time the countrys labor movement and segment of its urban middle class were becoming increasingly critical of the governments economic performance facing rising

favorable to zanupf the 2004 gerrymandering of constituencies which the government attributed to population shifts arising from its land reform program resulted in the redistricting of three urban

did eventually participate under protest but did not do as well as in previous polls in the months prior to the 2005 senate elections the mdc was once again divided on whether to participate pported by some civil society groups who suggested the elections were meaningless and waste of time and resources tsvangirai argued that participating in the senate would legitimize previous rigged elections

large sections of its population serious suffering that must now be redressed with the assistance of the united nations nd the international community the international community should encourage the government to prosecute all those who orchestrated this catastrophe and those who may have caused criminal negligence leading to alleged deaths if so confirmed by an independent internal

2005 constitutional amendment one of the uni ntended side effects of mugabes 2000 land reform strategy which resulted in the abolition of land tenure was that farmers were unable to use their land as collateral to obtain bank loans to invest in their farms as result few commercial farmers were able to find the capital to maintain productivity the government began to dist ribute 99year leases in november 2006 and among the initial recipients were 19 white farmers which came as shock to many after mugabe declared in july 2005 that his land reform program would be complete only when there was not single white on the farms115 there are currently less than 500 white farmers left in zimbabwe some suggest financial institutions may be reluctant to accept the new leases as collateral given that the government reserves the right to cancel the lease if it deems the farm unproductive the government also announced in 2007 its intention to ration electricity to households across the country in

mmittee appointed to monitor and respond to the vote consisting of austra lia south africa and nigeria determined that zimbabwe would be suspended fro m the commonwealth for one year the suspension was the first public action against mugabe by body that included influential african countries in d ecember 2003 the commonwealth including 19 other african members voted to suspend zimbabwe indefinitely on this occasion the decision was strongly criticized by south africas president mbeki who had by then committed to his policy of quiet diplomacy and by other governments in southern africa mugabe responded by withdrawing zimbabwe from the commonwealth and ruling out any furthe r discussions or possible return141 some speculated as result that the commonw ealths action had backfired by placing zimbabwe fully outside the bounds of its infl uence others argued that indefinite suspension by body including many frican members had important symbolic value in africa and
