leopoldhaimbergerunivieacat peter gleckler gleckler1llnlgov xflowed dear phil just quick response to the issue of model weighting which you and carl raised in your emails we recently published paper dealing with the identification of an anthropogenic fingerprint in ssmibased estimates of total column water vapor changes this was true multimodel detection and attribution da study which made use of results from 22 different aogcms for fingerprint and noise estimation together with peter gleckler and karl taylor im now in the process of repeating our water vapor da study using subset of the original 22 models this subset will comprise 1012 models which are demonstrably more successful in capturing features of the observed mean state and variability of water vapor and sst particularly features crucial to the da problem such as the lowfrequency variability weve had fun computing whole range of metrics that might be used to define such subset of better models the ultimate goal is to determine the sensitivity of our water vapor da results to model quality i think that this kind of analysis will be unavoidable in the multimodel world in which we now live given substantial intermodel differences in simulation quality one model one vote is probably not the best policy for da work once weve used carls method to calculate synthetic msu temperatures from the ipcc ar4 20c3m data as described in my previous email it should be relatively easy to do similar model culling exercise with msu t2 t4 and tlt in fact this is what we had already planned to do in collaboration with carl and frank one key point in any model weighting or selection strategy is to avoid circularity in the da context it would be impermissible to include information on trend behavior as criterion used for selecting better models likewise if our interest is in assessing the statistical significance of modelversusobserved trend differences we cant use model performance in simulating observed tropospheric or stratospheric trends whatever those might be as means of identifying more credible models further issue of course is that we are relying on results from fully coupled aogcms and are making trend comparisons over relatively short periods several decades on these short timescales estimates of the true trend in response to the applied 20c3m forcings are quite sensitive to natural variability noise as peter thornes 2007 grl paper clearly illustrates because of such chaotic variability even hypothetical model with perfect physics and forcings would yield distribution of tropospheric temperature trends over 1979 to 1999 some of which would show larger or smaller cooling than observed this is why its illogical to stratify model results according to correspondence between modeled and observed surface warming something which john christy is very fond of doing what weve done in the new water vapor work described above is to evaluate the fidelity with which the ar4 models simulate the observed mean state and variability of precipitable water and sst not the trends in these quantities weve looked at model performance in variety of different regions and on multiple timescales the results are fascinating and show at least for water vapor and sst that every model has its own individual strengths and weaknesses it is difficult to identify subset of models that consistently does well in many different regions and over range of different timescales my guess is that we would obtain somewhat different results for msu temperatures particularly for comparisons involving variability clearly the absence of volcanic forcing in roughly half of the 20c3m experiments will have large impact on the estimated variability of synthetic t4 temperatures and perhaps even on t2 and hence on modelversusdata variability comparisons its also quite possible that the inclusion or absence of volcanic forcing has an impact not only on the amplitude of the variability of globalmean t4 anomalies but also on the pattern of t4 variability so model ranking exercises based on performance in simulating the mean state and variability of t4 and t2 may show some connection to the presence or absence of volcanicozone forcing the sad thing is we are being distracted from doing this fun stuff by the need to respond to douglass et thats real shame with best regards ben phil jones wrote all ijc do have comments but only very rarely i see little point in doing this as there is likely to be word limit and if the system works properly douglass et would get the final say there is also large backlog in papers awaiting to appear so even if the comment were accepted it would be some time after douglass et that it would appear better would be submission to another journal jgr which would be quicker this could go in before douglass et appeared in print it should be in the ijc early online view fairly soon based on recent experiences paper pointing out the issues of trying to weight models in some way would be very beneficial to the community ar5 will have to go down this route at some point how models simulate the recent trends at the surface and in the tropospherestratosphere and how they might be ranked is possibility this could bring in the new work peter alludes to with the sondes there are also some aspects of recent surface t changes that could be discussed as well these relate to the growing dominance of buoy ssts now 70 of the total vs conventional ships there is paper in j climate accepted from smithreynolds et at ncdc which show that buoys could conceivably be cooler than shipbased sst by about 01c meaning that the last 510 years are being gradually underestimated over the oceans overlap is still too short to be confident about this but it highlights major systematic change occurring in surface ocean measurements as the buoys are presumably better for absolute ssts this means models driven with fixed ssts should be using fields that are marginally cooler and then there is the continual reference to kalnay and cai when simmons et 2004 have shown the problems with ncep it is possible to add in the erainterim analyses and operational analyses to being results from era40 up to date cheers phil at 2340 04122007 carl mears wrote karl thanks for clarifying what i was trying to say some further comments at 0253 pm 1242007 karl taylor wrote dear all 2 unforced variability hasnt dominated the observations but on this short time scale we strongly suspect that it has dominated for example the 2 sigma error bars from table 34 ccsp for satellite tlt are 018 uah or 019 rss larger than either groups trends 005 015 for 19792004 these were calculated using goodness of linear fit criterion corrected for autocorrelation this is probably reasonable estimate of the contribution of unforced variability to trend uncertainty douglass et have not shown that every individual model is in fact inconsistent with the observations if the spread of individual model results is large enough and at least 1 model overlaps the observations then one cannot claim that all models are wrong just that the mean is biased given the magnitude of the unforced variability i would say the mean may be biased you cant prove this with only one universe as tom alluded all we can say is that the observed trend cannot be proven to be inconsistent with the model results since it is inside their range it we interesting to see if we can say anything more when we start culling out the less realistic models
