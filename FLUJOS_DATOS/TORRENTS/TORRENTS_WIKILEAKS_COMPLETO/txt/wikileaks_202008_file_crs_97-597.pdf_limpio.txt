summary lawsuit challenged on both securities and antitrust grounds the right of charitable organizations to issue socalled charitable annuities federal and state legislation to protect the charities was enacted however the fifth circuit has recently declined to review district courts refusal to dismiss the case the following report briefly summarizes the theory of the lawsuit the federal and state legislation which was enacted and the recent decision by the fifth circuit discussion in 1988 widow in texas signed over assets to religious foundation the arrangement between the widow and the charity was relatively common one the widow was to receive from the charity fixed amount of money at regularly scheduled times and at her death the charity was to receive lump sum distribution this type of arrangement is often referred to as charitable gift annuity potential heirs of the widow brought suit in federal district court in wichita falls texas alleging violations of federal securities and antitrust laws1 the claim of the potential heirs that violations of federal securities laws occurred was based upon thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97597crs2 215 usc 80a1 et seq 3these other laws

6parker supra note 5 is the decision in which the court first enunciated the antitrust state action doctrine which has been repeatedly expanded over the past 50 years that the purpose of the sherman act was to suppress combinations to restrain competition and attempts to monopolize by individuals and corporations abundantly appears from its legislative history 317 us at 351 emphasis added see also city of lafayette v louisiana power light company 435 us 389 1978 and subsequent state action casesargument that because charities commingled number of trust funds in pooled income fund and because part of the funds net earnings may be viewed as inuring to the benefit of persons and individuals the charities should have registered with the securities and exchange commission sec as required by the investment company act of 19402 and other federal securities laws3 during the past twentythree years the sec has addressed questions raised by charitable income funds the sec had provided noaction assurances4 that charitable income funds could operate under certain circumstances without registering under the various federal securities laws despite these assurances concerning particular transaction recipient could still have been liable to private litigant who alleged that the same transaction violated federal securities laws it is for this reason and certain other reasons such as state securities registration requirements that proponents of the bills discussed below believed that statutory exemptions needed to be granted under the federal securities laws for charitable income funds in the classaction lawsuit the practice alleged to be violative of the antitrust laws as price fixing was the use by numerous charitable organizations of the annuity payout rates and actuarial tables provided by the american council on gift annuities charities were also alleged to have engaged in deceptive trade practices by promoting themselves as shrewd financial investors who can offer optimum income options to vulnerable the word used by plaintiffs lawyer donors the supreme court has stated on several occasions beginning with the courts assertion of state action exemption to the antitrust laws as reason for not applying them to the states that the purpose of the antitrust laws generally and the sherman act particularly has traditionally been to protect marketplace competition and commercial transactions from monopolistic or detrimental practices5 in parker v brown and subsequent state action cases the court has made the distinction between private actions pursued for commercial competitive gain and governmental actions assumed to be in the public interest6 charities nonprofits which are generally taxexempt organizations assert that since their activities are noncommercial they should not be subject to the operation of the antitrust laws in addition it should be noted that the defendant charities are not competitors of the individuals they are alleged to have harmed httpwikileaksorgwikicrs97597crs3 7620 f2d 1301 1980 certiorari denied 449 us 842 1980 8national collegiate athletic association v university of oklahoma 468 us 85 101 fn 22 1984 note omitted 9united states v brown university 5 f3d 658 665 666 1993notes omittedmany commentators and jurists agree with that argument although they recognize the question surrounding the antitrust treatmentanalysis of noncommercial activities ie whether all noncommercial activities should receive an unqualified exemption from the antitrust laws or should be analyzed under the antitrust rule of reason doctrine under which the anticompetitive results of practice are balanced against any procompetitive consequences or analyzed under the antitrust per rule under which only the occurrence of an antitrustviolative activity need be proved in missouri v nation organization for women inc for example the state unsuccessfully attempted to enjoin the organizations boycott of states that had not ratified the equal rights amendment the claim that the boycott constituted combination and conspiracy in restraint of trade was rejected by the united states court of appeals for the eighth circuit and the supreme court refused to hear an appeal from that decision7 although the appeals court acknowledged that an examination of the legislative history does not clearly indicate the answer to the question whether congress wanted to protect free and fair competition from political or social activities that can have the same effect upon competition as the commercial activities of trust against business it also noted that missouri does not direct us to nor have we discovered any legislative history that indicates an affirmative intent of congress to do so 620 f2d at 1305 on the other hand in two more recent cases both the supreme court and the united states court of appeals for the third circuit found just such an intent there is doubt that the sweeping language of section 1 of the sherman act applies to nonprofit entities and in the past we have imposed antitrust liability on nonprofit entities which have engaged in anticompetitive behavior8 congress intended the sherman act to embrace the widest array of conduct possible section ones scope thus reaches the activities of nonprofit organizations which are not beyond the purview of the sherman act because the absence of profit is guarantee that an entity will act in the best interest of consumers the appeals court did note however although nonprofit organizations are not entitled to class exemption from the sherman act when they perform acts that are the antithesis of commercial activity they are immune from antitrust regulation this immunity however is narrowly circumscribed it does not extend to commercial transactions with public service aspect9 the house bills hr 2519 philanthropy protection act of 1995 and hr 2525 charitable gift annuity antitrust relief act of 1995 each passed the house unanimously on november 28 1995 they dealt separately with securities and antitrust issues hr 2519 permitted charitable income funds to operate without registering with the sec under the investment company act of 1940 the securities act of 1933 and the securities exchange act of 1934 hr 2519 also provided further exemptions from federal and state securities laws to charitable organizations and persons

from the enactment of hr 2525 they enacted statutes that expressly provide that the provisions of the federal legislation shall not apply s 978 affected both securities and antitrust issues the securities provisions of s 978 were very similar to those in hr 2519 its antitrust provisions were somewhat broader than hr 2525 granting an exemption from the antitrust laws for the activities of charitable organization relating to the issuance maintenance or investment of charitable gift annuity it too provided specifically for state enactment of statutes to prevent federal preemption of state law s 978 was not reported out of the senate committee on banking housing and urban affairs the house bills were enacted as the charitable gift annuity antitrust relief act which provides that it shall not be unlawful under any of the antitrust laws or under state law similar to any of the antitrust laws for 2 or more persons described in section 501c3 of title 26 that are exempt from taxation under section 501a of title 26 to use or to agree to use the same annuity rate for the purpose of issuing 1 or more charitable gift annuities10 congress made this act retroactive11 the texas legislature also passed legislation intended to prevent state law claims by retroactively allowing nonprofit organizations to sell annuities and operate trusts12 after passage of the new federal and state legislation the plaintiff amended his complaint to add nonexempt defendants such as law firms insurance companies and commercial banks in essence alleging hybrid conspira cy by exempt and nonexempt organizations the district court again refused to dismiss the case13 defendants petitioned to the fifth circuit for writ of mandamus requesti ng dismissal of both the state and the federal claims on the grounds that the district court abused its discretion by refusing to grant the second motion to dismiss asserting jurisdiction to consider whether defendants meet the relief acts

council on gift annuities inc 9611332 1997 westlaw 169400 5th cir 1997 15the defendants have blithely ignored that richie is alleging some of them to be non exempt which creates factual issues and that he is alleging hybrid conspiracy richie v american council on gift annuities inc 1997 westlaw 169400 11 5th cir 1997 16id at 5 17northwestern university had separately appealed the denial of its motion for summar judgment arguing that it had demonstrated its exemption under the relief actissues plaintiff requested that the court dismiss the defendants appeals on numerous grounds most importantly for lack of appellate jurisdiction14 the fifth circuit held that it lacked jurisdictio n to hear the appeal and imposed 15000 sanction on the defendants for pursuing frivolous appeal15 in ruling that it lacked jurisdiction to hear the appeal the fifth circuit stated that the district courts refusal to dismiss the case is not final decision that can be appealed under 28 usc section 1291 it should be evident from the above that because the refusal to dismiss was predicated on richies claims of nonexempt defendants and hybrid conspiracy involving them the matters it addressed were neither conclusively determined nor separate from the merits of the case to the contrary the district court went out of its way to state that it would reconsider the defendants claims of exemption as soon as there was sufficient evidence to do so given that the ruling was based on the possibility of hybrid conspiracy we need not consider whether the relief act grants 501c3 organizations some sort of immunity or right not to stand trial it follows that because the denial of the motion to dismiss did not actually require finding of immunity it is not collateral order and we lack jurisdiction to entertain the appeal16 the court also held that it lacked jurisdiction to hear northwestern universitys claims for the same reasons that it lacked jurisdiction to hear the defendants claims17 the court also denied defendants petition for mandamus relief finding that the grant of summary judgment by the district court was neither an abuse of discretion nor usurpation of power and the court found that the texas attorney general was entitled to intervene as of right finally the court imposed sanctions for bringing an appeal that it considered frivolous
