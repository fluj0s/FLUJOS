divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34610midwest flooding disaster rethinking federal flood insurance summary historically floods have caused more ec onomic loss to the nation than any other form of natural disaster in 1968 cong ress created the nati onal flood in surance program nfip in response to rising fl ood losses and escalating costs resulting from adhoc appropriations for di saster relief federal fl ood insurance was designed to provide an alternative to fede ral disaster relief outlays by reducing the rising federal costs through premium collection and mitigation activities the purchase of flood insurance was considered to be an economically efficient way to indemnify property owners for flood losses and internalize th risk of locating investments in the floodplains despite massive rainfallri ver flooding in several midw estern states along the upper mississippi river and its tributaries in june 2008 damages for the most part are not expected to produce significant insured flood losses under the nfip this significant but not unprecedented flood event instead will likely cost several billions in uninsured damages that will probably remain uncompensated or be paid through federal emergency supplemental appr opriations for disaster relief key lesson learned from the 1993 and 2008 midwest floods is that many people believe that the g overnment will provide them with economic assistance despite their lack of insurance what then is the appropriate role of the federal government in dealing with ambiguous risks where the insurance industry is reluctant to offer coverage and homeo wners and businesses demonstrated reluctance to purchase coverage even when it is mandatory this question is important for the longterm solvency of the nfip and overall future costs to federal taxpayers this report examines the impact of the 2008 midwest floods on the national flood insurance program nfip in th context of congressional efforts to reauthorize and modify the

2nd sess september 1966 washington gpo 1966 13 pl 90448 82 stat 573congressional interest in flooding and fl ood control policy originated in the late 19th century following massive flooding along the mississippi river basin during the 1850s through 1870s when policymakers began to consider strategies to mitigate the escalating costs of repairing damage to buildings and their contents caused by floods the federal policy response to widespread flood damages in communities and rising taxpayerfunded disaster relie f cost was initially so called leveeonly policy approach ie relying on levees to protect population and property in floodprone areas in 1879 congress created the mississippi river commission 18791928 to oversee the development of levee system that would confine the rivers natural flow9 since the enactment of the flood control act of 1917 the us army corps of engineers usace has played sign ificant role in flood damage reduction10 over the 40year period between the hi storic mississippi floods of 1927 and the early 1960s it became generally apparent th at the leveeonly flood control policy approach was not achieving the intended objectives11 this strategy of modifying natures flood hazard areas would prove cos tly largely because of hurricane betsy 1965 and other hurricanes in 1963 and 1964 as well as heavy flooding on the upper mississippi river basin in 1965 congress undertook study of the feasibility of alternative methods of provi ding assistance to those suffering property losses in floods and other natural disasters12 the recommendations of this study and private insurers unwillingne ss or inability to underwrite fl ood insurance led to the enactment of the national flood insurance act of 196813 and creation of the nfip flood damage is excluded under homeo wners policies because insurers consider flood risk to be an uninsurable pe ril insurers reportedly cannot accurately estimate losses and most lack the ability to pool and spread flood risks over large and diverse group of uncorre lated insureds in order to minimize the possibility of multiple claims for the same event fede rally backed flood insurance fills this void and is

has once again fo cused public attenti on on the economics of government riskbearing federal flood insura nce when private insurers do not offer affordable coverage on the exposure of fe deral taxpayer to losses when program revenues do not cover costs and on th efficacy of the nations floodplain management strategy in reducing federal disaster relief expenditures the midwest floods also raised several broad issues and concerns that could lead policymakers to rethink federal flood in surance in the context of reauthorizing the nfip broadly speaking these issues and concerns include what responsibilities should property owners bear to understand and prepare for flood hazards especia lly given the confluence of greater property exposure and projected likelihood of more frequent severe storms how do we provide assistan ce to victims of floods is the nfip the appropriate structure fo r insuring flood losses should congress consider comprehens ive natural disaster program effectiveness of structural l evees and dams and nonstructural landuse ordinances and build ing codes floodplain management systems that annually prevent billi ons of dollars in floodrelated property damages but also arguab ly can encourage individuals and businesses to build in flood prone areas the persistently low takeup rate of flood insurance in highrisk areas despite federal mandatory purchase requirements lender compliance for properties in federally mapped flood zone whether households are relying on federal disaster relief for compensation rather than federal flood insurance

future vulnerability of the built environment th federal government retains responsibility for all underwriting losses but it also has dvantages over private insurers namely its greater ability to avoid adverse selection and moral hazard through mandatory purchase requirements compulsory membership and its access to greater information risk assessmen t and flood hazard mapping recognizing the low market penetrati on of flood insurance in the early 1970s congress enacted the flood disa ster protection act of 197316 to establish mandatory flood insurance purchase requirement for structures located in identified special flood hazard areas sfha17 the idea was to shift more of the cost of floods to those who build in floodprone areas after the 1993 midwest floods it became apparent that homeowners were still not adequately complying with the mandatory purchase requirement the national fl ood insurance reform act of 1994 was enacted to strengthen the purchase requirement18 in 2004 congress enacted the flood insurance reform act of 2004 to addr ess among other things the repetitive loss property rlp problem19 challenges facing the nfip in the wake of the 2005 hurricanes nd the 2008 midwest floods critics of the status quo have pointed to several recurrin g problems that they believe affect the nfip they include20 the lack of accounting by the nfip for residual risk behind levees has contributed property owners dis missing their exposure to risk of levee failure and overtopping the 1993 2005 and 2008 events illustrate how ignoring residual risk could contribute to greater demand for disaster reliefhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34610crs7 inaccurate flood maps that need updating to reflect not only recent development in floodprone areas but residual flood risk behind levees dams and other struct ural flood control systems providing disaster relief to uninsur ed individuals tends to discourage steps to reduce loss exposure and results in higher societal and federal costs the low flood insurance market penetration in river floodprone areas that results in billions of dollars in uninsured losses substantial crosssubsidies among cl asses of policyholders with the use of historical average loss year premium setting approach the performance of fema floodpl ain management standards in achieving flood damage reduction the desirability of establishing catastr ophe reserve fund to pay claims during the rare catastrophic loss year reserve fund would mean higher premium rates midwest floods of 2008 early rough estimates of flood damages from the 2008 midwest floods indicated that the cost to the nfip would likely be small because of the relatively low number of policies and claims filed in midwestern states most experts appear to agree the program will be able to cover 2008 flood cl aims without having to borrow from the department of the treasury the nfip might still have to borrow to pay scheduled interest payments on the debt however table 1 shows the number of federal flood insurance policies and the number of total claims submitted in 12 midwestern states as result of the march and june 2008 floods the table also shows total cla ims filed and total payments over the 20 year period from 1988 to 2007 nfip d reportedly received only about 6338 insurance claims as of june 30 2008 iowa has experienced the majority of damages based on the number of counties affected 83 of 99 counties policies in force coverage in force severity of damage to residential and commercial structures characteristics of the flooding and the estimated or average amount of the claim payment table 2 provides list of the top fifteen si gnificant flood events in the united states in terms of nfip payouts the 2008 midwest flood does not rank among these although the 1993 midwest flood was the most devastating in the region with total economic damage s approximately 20 billion it ranks only 12th in terms of the nfip with only 273 million in nfip claims in contrast the devastating flooding caused by hurricanes katrina rita and wilma resulted in more than 200 billion in economic losses of which 219 billion were covered under the nfip httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34610crs8 the key lesson from the 2008 midwest floods is not the magnitude of payouts under the nfip but rather the eventual cost of federal disaster relief for individual business and communities congress might therefore opt to reassess federal flood insurance that was intended to work in tandem with risk identification mapping and floodplain management regulati on to

galloway to determine what could be done to reduce future flood damage central to the findings was the labeling of the flood protection system in the upper mississippi basin as loose aggregation of federal local and individual levees and reservoirs that does not ensure the desired reduction in the vulnerability of floodplain activities to damages21httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34610crs11 21 continued

unprecedented rainfallriver event and that such floods would probably occur again further the study noted that although th goals of floodplain management are clear and the means to carry it out existed imp rovement and refocusing were needed22 the responsibilities for flood management are largely within state and local governments some 15 years later the nations levee system remains as an uncoordinated assortme nt of levees that are owned and maintained by local governments agencies and even individuals some disaster ex perts have called for more uniform approach to managing the levees the 2005 hurricanes an important lesson learned from th 2005 hurricanes is the importance of identifying levees and assessing the level of protection they offer citizens following the floodwall failures in new orleans and vee overtopping in many parts of coastal louisiana in 2005 president bush signed into law the emergency supplemental appropriations act of 2006 for defense the global war on terror and hurricane recovery that included 30 million to develop and implement national levee inventory and ssessment program23 in june 2006 the usace completed the initial inventory survey of federal levees and cr eated national databa that includes the location number and condition of these levees24 the next step is to include state local or privatelyowned levees in this i nventory to improve unde rstanding of the role of levees as component of the national flood risk the 2008 midwest floods the first lesson that can be learned or relearned from the 2008 midwest flood is that the nfip might not completely internalize the risk of living and investing in the floodplain nor achieve the level of indi vidual participation or reconstruction of older homes originally envisioned critics of the nfip say the program along with levees encourage too many people to locate in areas susceptible to flood damage and flood victims reliance on federa l disaster assistance for uninsured losses these tendencies in many ways negate the original intent of the nfip which was to minimize future flood damages and the corres ponding need for federal disaster relief second many property owners affected by the 2008 midwest floods might have made location and insurance decisions based on inaccurate or incomplete flood maps this lesson was also learned in the afte rmath of hurricane

httpwwwrandorgpubstechnical_reports2006rand_tr300pdffederal flood insurance policie s funds have not been set aside for catastrophe losses nor do the premium rates reflect the affect of coastal erosion and climate change on flood risks these factors were not c ontemplated or built into the program at inception moreover the nfip is providing subsidized flood insurance to homeowners who choose not to take advantag of this financia l protection rand corporation study of the nfips manda tory purchase requirement nationwide indicated that only about 49 of single family homes in sfha are covered by flood insurance25 based on the certification of levees as providing at least protection from the 100year flood property owners may not purch ase flood insurance yet they may face significant uninsured losses if the levee fails or is overwhelme d many homeowners were told or wrongly concl uded they were not at risk because they resided behind certified levee and therefore were outside the federal requirement to purchase flood insurance an illustration of the national consequences of not pricing or reserving for residual risk due to infrastructure failure might be helpful the most costly flood in the 40year history of the nfip were caused not by rainfallriver flooding but by breeched or overtopped levees protecting the city of new orleans from coastal storm surges according to fema some 7580 of the area behind the levees were designated sfha high risk zone due to rainfall there was an explicit flood insurance purchase requirement in effect in the affected areas still the nfip assumed the levees were going to hold b ack storm surge floods and therefore did not price the policies to reflect the failure or overtopping of levees the lack of understanding of the national flood risk the inadequate communication of that risk and diminished cap abilities in flood ri sk management due to inaccurate or outofdate flood hazard maps are wea knesses in the program third the price charged for federal fl ood insurance could understate the risk because flood hazard data might not be accu rately reflected on flood maps and in the underwriting process in practical terms the 2008 midwest floods have exposed the public safety risks associated with levee systems and an overreliance on levees and other structural flood control measures signed to mitigate future flood losses across the nation given the vulnerability of th large number of levees that are not adequately inspected and maintained there is an increased risk that the nfip will continue to experience unexpected losses and fiscal deficits potentially requiring future nfip borrowing from the us treasury the high degree of uninsured flood losse s during the 2008 floods could raise the policy question of who should appropriately bear the cost of the decision to live in potentially highrisk areas including ar eas behind levees dams and other flood control structures in the absence of flood insurance the cost of repairing the flood damage will be borne either by the property owner from their own financial resources or through federal disa ster assistance not flood insurance

requiring private insurers to make available private flood insurance policies at actuarially determined prices in flood prone areas with the federal government providing federa l reinsurance that would be selfsupporting in the long run some economists have suggested that floods and other catastrophic risks may now be insurabl because of insurers ability to transfer risk to the capital markets

fema undertook st udy with the assistance of accounting firm deloitte touche to explore alternative financing arrangements to reduce the need for us treasury borrowing fema was concerned about the

flood hazard maps threefold set of problems was revealed first the actual insurance cost of living in floodplain has not b een reflected in the cost of ownership the government generally finds it difficult to assess risk because of political pressure not to differentiate one person or firm from another in the way the private sector would this difficulty might lead to large and hidden cross subsidies moreover governments are susceptible to pressures not to enforce certain regulations particularly after catas trophic flood event second according to fema approximately 25 of all flood cl aims have been on properties located outside of currently designated 100year floodplains inaccurate flood maps typically result in unexpected flood damages uninsur ed properties and larger than

concurrent causation holds that if two cau ses eg water and wind combine to produce loss or damage and one of the two causes is excluded the loss will be covered absent policy wording to the contrary the antic oncurrent causation doctrine was designed to prevent the theory of concurrent causation from broadening coverage under standard property insurance policies insurance claims and determining whether loss was attributable to wind privately covered or flooding insured under the nfip the issue in contention is whether fema has adequate procedures and collects accurate information on damages to ensure claims paid by the nfip cover only those damages caused by flooding insu rers typically adjust flood claims along with their own creating this internal conflict of interest38 to address this issue congress is considering whether to 1 prohibit wyo insurers from including anti concurrent causation language in their homeowners policies39 2 establish flood insurance advocate office to

proponents of adding the wi nd peril say it is n ecessary to eliminate coverage disputes when wind and flood both contribute to loss optional wind coverage is also said to be needed because of the difficulty that property owners have in obtaining affordable wind coverage in states along the gulf and atlantic coasts private insurers have dramatically increased premiums and deductibles reduced coverage or withdrawn altogether from thes areas out of concern about catastrophic risk exposure in those areas homeowners must instead purchase their wind coverage from state pools where the pre
