about the language in the key statements first china was not defined in the three joint communiques in the normalization communique the united states recognized the prc government as the sole legal government of china but the prc has never ruled taiwan and other islands under the control of the roc government the prcs late paramount leader deng xiaopings 1984 proposal of one china two systems sought to define taiwan as special administrative region under the prc after unification on the other hand taiwan was defined in sec 152 of the tra essentially to be the islands of taiwan and the pescadores plus the people entities and governing authorities there g23g151g156g142g157g157g149g142g141g561g21g157g138g157g158g156g561 second there has been disagreement as to whether taiwans status actually was resolved or determined in secret talks in 1972 president nixon assured prc premier zhou enlai that the united states viewed the status of taiwan as determined to be part of one china the prcs december 1978 statement on normalization of diplomatic relations with the united states said that the taiwan question has now been resolved between the two countries however the us statement of december 1978 on normalization stated the expectation that the taiwan question will be settled peacefully by the chinese themselves the tra also stipulated the us expectation that the future of taiwan will be termined by peaceful means president reagans 1982 statement on arms sales to taiwan declared that the taiwan question is matter for the chinese people on both sides of the taiwan strait to resolve moreover under us policy settlement or resolutionnot stated as unification or reunificationof the taiwan question is left open to be peacefully determined by both sides of the strait in rare

taiwans selfdefense were left contentious and critical for us interests washington consistently has stated its strong interest that there be peaceful settlement but the prc has not renounced its claimed sovereign right to use force if necessary washington has not promised to end arms sales to taiwan although the mutual defense treaty of 1954 was terminated on december 31 197914 in the

members of congress debated whether the wording on us military intentions was clear or ambiguous since the mid 1990s new debate has arisen over how to deter conflict in the taiwan strait including whether ambiguity or clarity in us statements about possible military role serves us interests in preventing conflict or provocations from either beijing or taipei 15 there have been issues about whether and how us statements of intentions might be clarified to specify the conditions under which the us military might help to defend taiwan and the us stance on taiwans sovereignty or efforts to change its declared political status16 questions also have persisted about the extent of the us defense commitment to taiwan given president clintons 1996 deployment of two aircraft carriers near

about whether successive administrations have changed the us position since 1971 to adapt to changing circumstances and whether such shifts have advanced us interests successive administrations have generally maintained that longstanding us policy has been consistent some in congress and others however have contended that us policy has changed in some important areas there also are issues as to

ruling dpp since 2000 the government in taipei has made greater use of the name taiwan vs roc18 even while recognizing the roc government and it s jurisdiction over taiwan on the eve of the nixon administrations contacts with prc leaders in beijing the state department testified to congress in 1969 and 1970 that the juridical matter of the status of taiwan remained undetermined the state department also wrote that in neither the japanese peace treaty of 1951 nor the treaty of peace between the republic of china and japan of 1952 did japan cede this area of formosa and the pescadores to any particular entity as taiwan and the pescadores are not covered by any existing international disposition sovereignty over the area is an unsettled question subject to future international resolution both the republic of china and the chinese communists disagree with this conclusion and consider that taiwan and the pescadores are part of the sovereign state of china the united states recognizes the go vernment of the republic of china as legitimately occupying and exercising jurisdiction over taiwan and the pescadores 19 however accounts of president nixons secret talks with prc premier zhou enlai in china in 1972 reported that nixon made promises on the question of taiwan in return for diplomatic normalization that went beyond the communique is sued at the end the carter administration later called the promises nixons five points20 also according to assistant secretary of state stanley roths march 1999 testimony nixon pledged us support for taiwan independence second time after kissingers 1971 promise we have not and will not support any taiwan independence movement21 with the release on december 11 2003 of declassified memoranda of conversation of the secret

to the prc the united states in 1979 and 1982 again acknowledged the chinese position22 of one china and taiwan is part of china however the 1982 communique further stated that the united states has intention of pursuing policy of two chinas or one china one taiwan while president reagans accompanying statement said that the taiwan question is matter for the chinese people on both sides of the

position on one china and that since 1978 each administration has reaffirmed this policy despite these apparent similarities in us polic statements some contend that the us position since originally formulated in 1972 has adopted the prcs one china principlerather than steadily maintaining neutrality and equal distance from beijing and taipei in 1982 senator john glenn criticized both the carter and reagan administrations the ambiguous formulation agreed upon in the 1979 joint communique went considerably further in recognizing the prcs claim to taiwan although the word acknowledged remained the object of our acknowledgment shifted noticeably we longer just acknowledged that both chinas asserted the principle that there was one china but instead acknowledged the chinese position that there is but one china by dropping the key phrase all chinese on either side of the taiwan strait maintain one could interpret that we had moved from the position of neutral bystander noting the existence of dispute to party accepting the chinese assertion that there is one china clearly this was the prcs interpretation more recently pekings threat s to downgrade relations with the united states unless washington agreed to end l arms sales to taiwan prompted president reagan to write to chinas communist party chairman hu yaobang in may 1982 and assure him that our policy will continue to be based on the principle that there is but one china we now assert that it is our policy us policy that there is but one china and although not stated indicate implicitly that taiwan is part of that one china the use of the qualifier acknowledged has been dropped altogether i do not believe that anyone can dispute that the us policy toward china and taiwan has changed dramatically over the last 10 years let reiterate one more time in 1972 we acknowledged that the chinese on both sides of the taiwan strait maintained that there was but one china today it is us policy that there is but one china despite this remarkable shift over time the state department at each juncture has assured us that our policy remained essentially unchanged 23

china policy and the principles set forth in the three uschina joint communiques while that joint statement did not include the three noes the administration decided to have state department

organization for which statehood is requirement some questioned whether the three noes especially as it was publicly declared by the us president while in the prc was change in us policy 25 us nonsupport for one china one taiwan or two chinas can be traced to the private assurances of the nixon administration in the early 1970s however the clinton administration be ginning with its taiwan

members in both the senate and the house nearly unanimously passed resolutions in july 1998 reaffirming the us commitment to taiwan the clinton administration nonetheless argued that the three noes

of the taiwan strait the us national security council nsc stated in second response that we do not support taiwan independence with jiang zemin at his side at summit in crawford tx in october 2002 president bush himself stated that we do not support independence however there have been questions about whether the bush administration has adjusted us policy after president chen shuibian surprised th united states in august 2002 with speech on one country on each side and call for holding referendums specifically there has been the issue of whether president bush gave assurances at closed meetings starting at that summit in october 2002 to prc president jiang zemin and later president hu jintao that the united states is against or opposes unilateral moves in ta iwan toward independence andor the status of taiwan independence in the interest of stability in the taiwan strait26 position in opposition to taiwan independence would represent shift in policy focus from the process to the outcome and go beyond president nixons five principles which expressed nonsupport for taiwan independence but us opposition to taiwan in dependence would be consistent with president clintons secret letter reportedly sent in 1995 to prc leader jiang zemin as the basis for the three noes us opposition would also conflict with the stance of the government of taiwan which under the dpp has argued that taiwan is already independent as evident since the first democratic presidential election in 1996 27 after chen during campaigns for taiwans presidential election in march 2004 advocated holding referendums and adopting new constitution by 2008moves that could have implications for taiwans sovereignty and crossstrait stability the bush administration called on chen to adhere to his pledges

cancel the referendum however bush did not make public remarks against the prcs threats toward democratic taiwan bush also did not counter wens remarks that bush reiterated opposition to taiwan independence bush raised questions about whether he miscalculated the willingness of chen to back down during his reelection campaign and risked us credibility since chen responded defiantly that he would hold the antimissile antiwar referendums as planned and that his intention was to keep taiwans current independent status quo from being changed32 american opinions were divided on the bush administrations statements toward taiwan some saw chen as advancing provocative agenda of permanent separation from china while trying to win votes and supported bushs forceful stance against chens

receptive policy toward the ruling dpp in taiwan richard bush chairman of ait said on january 28 2002 that the united states favors and encourages dialogue but has intention of serving as mediator in this dispute or of pressuring taiwan to negotiate he added that it does not seem constructive for one side to set preconditions for resumption of dialogue that the other side even suspects would be

the six assurances meaning us mediation and pressure on taiwan to go to the bargaining table 74 in testimony in april 2004 after chen shuibians reelection in the march election kelly again reaffirmed the six assurances but explicitly warned that secure and selfconfident taiwan is taiwan that is more capable of engaging in political interaction and dialogue with the prc and we expect taiwan will

time after the ending of the war in indochina we are prepared to begin reducing our other forces on taiwan as our relations improve so that the military questions need not be principal obstacle

ordered the people s liberation army pla to stop the bombardment of quemoy and other islands as of to day state of military confrontation between the two sides still exists along the taiwan strait this can only create artificial tension we hold that first of all this military confrontation should be ended through discussion between the government of the people s republic of china and the taiwan

the china mainland and all other peoples of the western pacific area93 2 to declare that peace and stability in the area are in the political security and economic interests of the united states and are matters of international concern 3 to make clear that the united states decision to establish diplomatic relations with the people s republic of china rests upon the expect ation that the future

shanghai communique during debate on the tra in february 1979 senator jacob javits noted the difference and said that it is very important that we not subscribe to the chinese position on one china either way deputy secretary of state warren christopher responded that we regard the english text as being the binding text we regard the word acknowledge as being the word that is determinative for the us wolff and simon p 310311 92 instead of the phrase all chinese on either side of the taiwan strait in the 1972 shanghai communique the 1979 normalization communique used the chinese position in the english text and chinas position in the chinese text 93 key issue for congress was to consider the character of the relationship with taiwan while the normalization communique and the administration called for unofficial us relations with taiwan members objected to the use of that word congress omitted any adjective for the relationship and ait and the tra does not specify the relationship as official or unofficial in discussing the legislative history of the unpr ecedented law senator jacob javits wrote that one really knew what the limits of officiality were congress and foreign relations the taiwan relations act foreign affairs fall 1981 94 on this language in the tra the house report and statements of key members of congress such as rep zablocki chairman of the

as rep dodd considered the language on grave concern to be strong and unambiguous but rep quayle noted that of grave concern is very ambiguous term we read every day in the newspapers thus he added language that became section 2b6 of the tra wolff and simon p 7791 95 senator jacob javits wrote that members of congress debated the appropriate characterization of us concern for taiwans security congress did not s eek to reconstruct defense agreement with taiwan and majorities in the house and senate agreed with the administration in opposing senator charles percys amendment to characterize coercion against taiwan as threat to the security interests of the united states because such language would unnecessarily convey an intention to reenact the security agreement itself thus violating one of the understandings with beijing nonetheless javits wrote that congress legislated broad definition of the threats that taiwan could face going beyond language for resisting armed attacks generally put into defense treaties he was particularly concerned with other dangers which in fact seemed more realistic than an outright invasion from across the straits congress and foreign relations the taiwan relations act foreign affairs fall 1981 96 according to an author of the language section 4b1 treats taiwan as state for purposes of domestic us laws and without it the united states could not sell taiwan weapons or enriched uranium for nuclear power r eactors for example see harvey feldman president reagans six assurances to taiwan and their meaning today heritage foundation october 2 2007 97 congress considered the security implications for the ited states of whether the definition of taiwan includes the offshore islands of quemoy and matsu only several miles off the mainland coast the house report p 16 on the tra noted that the definitions are illustrative not limitin g nonetheless rep zablocki chairman of the house foreign affairs committee explained that his committee had excluded quemoy and matsu from the definition he pointed out that these islands had been deliberately left out of the mutual defense treaty and we should not be expanding the us

i would take this opportunity to elaborate on the policy concerning the return of taiwan to the motherland for the realization of peaceful unification proclaimed on new year s day 1979 1 in order to bring an end to the unfortunate separation of the chinese nation as early as possible we propose that talks be held between the communist party of china and the kuomintang nationalist party of china on re ciprocal basis so that the two parties will cooperate for the third time to accomplish the great cause of national unification the two sides may first send people to meet for an exhaustive exchange of views 2 it is the urgent desire of the people of all nationalities on both sides of the strait to communicate with each other reunite with their relatives develop trade and increase mutual understanding we propose that the two sides make arrangements to facilitate the exchange of mail trade air and shipping services and visits by relatives and tourists as well as academic cultural and sports exchanges and reach an agreement thereupon 3 after the country is reunified taiwan can enjoy high degree of autonomy as special administration region and it can retain its arme d forces the central government will not interfere with local affairs in taiwan 4 taiwan s current socioeconomic system will remain unchanged so will its way of life and its economic and cultural relations with foreign countries there will be encroachment on the proprietary rights and lawful right of inheritance over private property houses land and enterprises or on foreign investments 5 people in authority and representative personages of various circles in taiwan may take up posts of leadership in national political bodies and participate in running the state continued the committee report is concerned

is but one china and taiwan is part of china the question of united states arms sales to taiwan was not settled in the course of negotiations between the two countries on establishing diplomatic relations the chinese government reiterates that the question of taiwan is china s internal affair the message to the compatriots in taiwan issued by china on january 1 1979 promulgated fundamental policy of striving for peaceful unification of the motherland the ninepoint proposal put forward by china on september 30 1981 represented further major effort under this fundamental policy to strive for peaceful solution to the taiwan question the united states government attaches great importance to its relations with china and reiterates that it has intention of infringing on chinese sovereignty and territorial integrity or interfering in china s internal affairs or pursuing policy of two chinas or one china one taiwan 105 the united states government understands and appreciates the chinese policy of striving for peaceful resolution of the taiwan question as indicated in china s message to compatriots in taiwan issued on january 1 1979 and the ninepoint proposal put forward by china on september 30 1981 the new situation which has emerged with regard to the taiwan question also provides favorable conditions for the settlement of united stateschina differences over the

sales to taiwan that its arms sales to taiwan will not exceed either in qualitative or in quantitative terms the level of those supplied in 102 public papers of the presidents of the united states

on september 17 and 27 1982 and subsequently communicated with the state department to investigate apparent conflicts between the reagan administrations 1982 communique and the tra and to seek clarifications on policy toward taiwan from secretary of state george shultz he answered that determination of taiwans defense needs and of the sufficiency of its self defense capability requires an assessment of the nature of the military threat confronting it this necessarily requires an assessment of the military capacity of the prc and its policy towards taiwan among extensive responses shultz also replied that us arms sales do not violate chinas sovereignty that the united states takes position on the question of taiwans sovereignty and that the communique is not an international agreement 104 the chinese text says that the united states recognized cheng ren chinas zhongguo position repeating the formulation of the 1979 communique 105 in response to question at the senate

the us willingness to reduce its arms sales to taiwan is conditioned absolutely upon the continued commitment of china to the peaceful solu tion of the taiwanprc differences it should be clearly

august 18 1982 on the august 17 1982 communique let recapitulate and emphasize few key features then ill take your questions first the document must be read as whole since the policies it sets forth are interrelated original emphasis second as i have previously noted the communique contains strong chinese statement that its fundamental policy is to seek to resolve the taiwan question by peaceful means 4 original emphasis third the us statements concerning future arms sales to taiwan 6 are based on chinas statements as to its fundamental peaceful policy for seeking resolution to the taiwan question and on the new situation created by t hose statements 5 original emphasis fourth we did not agree to set date certain for ending arms sales to taiwan and the statements of future us arms sales policy em bodied in the communique do not provide either time frame for reductions of us arms sales or for their termination we see mediation role for the us nor will we attempt to exert pressure on taiwan to enter into negotiations with the prc there has been change in our longstanding pos ition on the issue of sovereignty over taiwan the communique 1 in its opening paragraph simply cites that portion of the joint communique on the establishment of diplomatic relations between the us and the p rc in which the us acknowledged the chinese position on this issue ie that there is but one china and taiwan is part of china it has been reported in the press that the chinese at one point suggested that the taiwan relations act be revised we have plans to seek any such revisions 9 should not be read to imply that we have agreed to engage in prior consultations with beijing on arms sales to taiwan original emphasis 109 harding 110 us house committee on foreign affairs hearing on

5 1994 it is an incontrovertible historical fact that the roc has always been an independent sovereign state in the international community since its fo unding in 1912 however relations between the two sides of the taiwan strait are not those betw een two separate countries neither are they purely domestic in nature in order to ensure that crossstrait relations develop toward benign interaction the roc government has formulated the concept of political entity to serve as the basis of interaction between the two sides th term political entity has extensive meaning it can refer to country government or political organization at the current stage of cross strait interaction only when we set aside the sovereignty dispute will we untie the knots that have bound us for more than the past 40 years and progress smoothly toward unification the roc government is firm in its advocacy of one china and is opposed to two chinas or one china one taiwan but at the same time given that division and divided rule on the two sides of the taiwan strait is longstanding po litical fact the roc government also holds that the two sides should be fully aware that each has jurisdiction over its respective territory and that they should coexist as two legal entities in the international arena as for their relationship with each other it is that of two separate area s of one china and is therefore domestic or chinese in nature the roc government takes one china two equa l political entities as the structure for handling crossstrait relations and hopes that crossstrait relations will develop in the direction of being peaceful pragmatic and sensible the cp c communist party of china should dismiss any misgivings it has concerning the roc government s determination to achieve unification what the cpc authorities should give urgent cons ideration to is how given the fact that the country is divided under two separate governments we can actively create favorable conditions for unification and gradually bring the two differen t political entities together to form one china at the same time the chinese people cannot strive for unification just for the sake of unification instead unification should be realized under reasonable and benign political 129 mainland affairs council executive yuan cabinet republic of china explanation of relations across the taiwan strait

the joint co mmunique of 1982 also constitute part of the foundation in the joint communique shifting diplomatic relations to the prc 15 years ago the united states recognized the government of the people s republic of china as the sole legal government of china the document further states that within this context the people of the united states will maintain cultural commercial and other unofficial relations with the people of taiwan the united states also acknowledged the chinese position that there is but one china and taiwan is part of china these formulations were repeated in the 1982 communique since 1978 each administration has reaffirmed this policy the policy has been essential in maintaining peace stability and economic development on both sides of the taiwan strait and throughout the region we have made absolutely clear our expectation that crossstrait relations will evolve in peaceful manner we neither interfere in nor mediate this process but we welcome any evolution in relations between taipei and beijing that is mutually agreed upon and peacefully reached in the end it is only the two parties themselves taiwan and the prc that will be able to resolve the issues between them in this regard the united states applauds the continuing progress in crossstrait dialogue 130 announced on september 7 1994 and described in the clinton administrations only

must firmly oppose any words or actions aimed at creating an independent taiwan and the propositions split the country and rule under separate regimes two chinas over certain period of time etc which are in contravention of the principle of one china 2 we do not challenge the development of nongovernmental economic and cultural ties by taiwan with other countries however we oppose taiwan s activities in expanding its living space internationally which are aimed at creating two chinas or one china one taiwan 3 it has been our consistent stand to hold negotiations with the taiwan authorities on the peaceful unification of the motherland i suggest that as the first step negotiations should be held and an agreement reached on officially ending the state of hostility between the two sides in accordance with the principle that there is only one china 4 we should strive for the peaceful unification of the motherland since chinese should not fight fellow chinese our not undertaking to give up the use of force is not directed against our compatriots in taiwan but against the schemes of foreign forces to interfere with china s unification and to bring about the independence of taiwan 5 great efforts should be made to expand the economic exchanges and cooperation between the two sides of the taiwan strait 6 people on both sides of the taiwan strait should

g345g345g561 april 8 1995 1 the fact that the chinese mainland and taiwan have been ruled by two political entities in way subordinate to each other had led to state of division between the two sides and separate governmental jurisdictions hence the issue of national unification only by facing up to this reality can both sides build greater consensus on the one china issue and at the earliest possible date 2 in taiwan we have long taken upon ourselves the responsibility for safeguarding and furthering traditional chinese culture and advocate that culture be the basis for exchanges between both sides to help promote the nationalisti c sentiment for living together in prosperity and to foster strong sense of brotherliness 3 we will continue to assist the mainland in developing its economy and upgrading the living standards of its people based upon our existing investments and trade relations as for trade and transportation links with the mainland the agencies concerned have to make indepth evaluations as well as careful plans since these are very complicated issues 4 i have indicated on several occasions that if leaders on both sides could meet with each other on international occasions in natural manner this would alleviate the political confrontation between both sides and foster harmonious atmosp here for developing future relations it is our firm belief that the more international organizations both sides join on an equal footing the more favorable the environment will become for the growth of bilateral relations and for the process of peaceful unification 5 we believe the mainland authorities should demonstrate their goodwill by publicly renouncing the use of force and refrain from making any military move that might arouse anxiety or suspicion on this side of the taiwan strait thus paving the way for formal negotiations between both sides to put an end to the state of hostility 6 hong kong and macau are integral parts of the chinese nation post1997 hong kong and post1999 macau are naturally matter of great concern to us in this regard the roc government has reiterated its determination to maintain normal contact with hong

october 29 1997 key to asia s stability is peaceful and prosperous relationship between the people s republic of china and taiwan i reiterated america s longs tanding commitment to one china policy it has allowed democracy to flourish in taiwan an d provides framework in which all three relationships can prosperbetween the united states and the prc the united states and taiwan and taiwan and the people s republic of china i told president jiang that we hope the people s republic and taiwan would resume constructive crossstrait dialogue and expand crossstrait exchanges ultimately the relationship between the prc and taiwan is for the chinese themselves to determinepeacefully 141 first of all i think the most important thing the united states can do to facilitate peaceful resolution of the differences is to adhere strictly to the one china policy we have agreed on to make it clear that within the context of that one china policy as articulated in the communiques and our own laws we will maintain friendly open relations with the people of taiwan and china but that we understand that this issue has to be resolved and resolved peacefully and that if it is resolved in satisfactory way consistent with statements made in the past then asia will be stronger and more stable and more prosperous that is good for the united states and our own relations with china will move on to another stage of success i think the more we can encourage that the better off we are but i think in the end since so much investment and contact has gone on in the last few years between taiwan and china i think the chinese people know how to resolve this when the time is right and we just have to keep saying we hope the time will be right as soon as possible sooner is better than later 142

being part of chi na because neither has jurisdiction over the other neither can represent the other much less all of china 146 white house office of the press secretary remarks by the president and

unification151 prc mr wang said that taiwan s political status can be discussed under the one china principle on this point both mr jiang zemin and mr qian qichen had similar comments to the effect that anything can be put on the table under the one china principle therefore on the question of one china this will be our consistent stand before the two sides across the strait are reunified there is only one china across the strait taiwan is part of china and chinese sovereignty and territorial integrity are indivisible now the government of the people s republic of china is universally acknowledged internationally as the only legitimate government representing china in spite of this the two sides should still negotiate on equal footing under the principle that there is but one china

respective interpretation however beijing has unilaterally abandoned this agreement in recent years in the framework of the 1992 agreement whereby each side is entitled to its respective interpretation we have always maintained that the one china concept refers to the future rather than the present the two sides are not yet unified but are equals ruled separately we both exist concurrently therefore the two sides can be defined as sharing special statetostate relationship prior to unification

and exercise china s sovereignty including its sovereignty over taiwan the chinese government is actively and sincerely striving for peaceful unification to achieve peaceful unification the chinese government has appealed time and again for crossstrait negotiations on the basis of equality and the one china principle the chinese government has also proposed that dialogue that includes political dialogue may start first which may gradually move on to procedural consultations for political negotiation to resolve issues for formal negotiation such as the name topics for discussion and format then political negotiation may begin political negotiation may be carried out stepbystep however since the early 1990s lee tenghui has gradually deviated from the one china principle in military affairs the taiwan authorities have bought large quantities of advanced weapons from foreign countries and sought to join the tmd system attempting to covertly establish certain forms of military

herself and that nothing has really changed in policy as far as im concerned this is what other presidents have said and i will continue to say so i have said that i will do what it takes to help taiwan defend herself and the chinese must understand that secondly i certainly hope taiwan adheres to the one china policy and declaration of independence is not the one china policy and we will work

g351g343g561 april 21 2004 the united states does not support independence for taiwan or unilateral moves that would change the status quo as we define it for beijing this means use of force or threat to use force against taiwan for taipei it means exercising prudence in managing all aspects of crossstrait relations for both sides it means statements or actions that would unilaterally alter taiwan s status the president s message on december 9 of last year during prc premier wen jiabao s visit reiterated the us government s opposition to any unilateral moves by either china or taiwan to change the status quo the united states will fulfill its obligations to help taiwan defend itself as mandated in the taiwan relations act at the same time we have very real concerns that our efforts at deterring chinese coercion might fail if beijing ever becomes convinced taiwan is embarked on course toward independence and permanent separation from china and concludes that taiwan must be stopped in these efforts the united states strongly supports taiwan s democracy but we do not support taiwan independence unilateral move toward independence will avail taiwan of nothing it does not already enjoy in terms of democratic freedom autonomy prosperity and security while strongly opposing the use of force by th prc we must also acknowledge with sober mind what the prc leaders have repeatedly conveyed about china s capabilities and intentions it would be irresponsible of us and of taiwan s leaders to treat these statements as empty threats we encourage the people of taiwan to regard this threat equally seriously we look to president chen to exercise the kind of responsible democratic and restrained leadership that will be necessary to ensure peaceful and prosperous future for taiwan as taiwan proceeds with efforts to deepen democracy we will speak clearly and bluntly if we feel as though those efforts carry the potential to adv ersely impact us security interests or have the potential to undermine taiwan s own security there are limitations with respect to what the united states will support as taiwan considers possible changes to its constitution our position continues to be embodied in the socalled six assurances offered to taiwan by president reagan we will neither seek to mediate between the prc and taiwan nor will we exert pressure on taiwan to come to the bargaining table of course the united states is also committed to make available defensive arms and defensive services to taiwan in order to help taiwan meet its selfdefense needs we believe secure and selfconfident taiwan is taiwan that is more capable of engaging in political interaction and dialogue with the prc and we expect taiwan will not interpret our support as blank check to resist such dialogue war in the strait would be disaster for both sides and set them back decades and undermine everything they and others in the region have worked so hard to achieve we continue to urge beijing and taipei to pursue dialogue as soon as possible through any available channels without preconditions 191 testimony of assistant secretary of state for east asian and pacific affairs james kelly at
