and related issues april 8 2008 l elaine halchin analyst in american national government government and finance divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34439former nfl players disabilities benefits and related issues summary professional football is very popular sport and the physical nature of the game of football is part of its appeal but at the same time playing the game can exact physical and mental toll on players violent collisions as well as other aspects of the sport can and do cause in juries each week during the season the national football league nfl releases an injury report that lists for each team players who are injured the type or locati on of the injury for example concussion knee or ribs and the players stat us for the upcoming game during the 2007 season aside from weeks one and eight at least 10 of nfl players were identified each week as being injured players in juries and current health conditions for example excess weight and sleep apnea might have longterm consequences for their health meaning that todays injury might become chronic health problem or disability during retirement from the nfl the issue has received considerable attention from congress including hearings in both chambers through collective bargaining agr eement cba negotiations and other discussions the nfl and the nfl players association nflpa have established number of benefits including retirement benefits that is pension severance pay total and permanent disability benefits and an annuity prog ram some benefits are available to all players while other benefits are available only to players who played in the nfl during certain years additionally some benefits have eligibility requirements funds for benefits that ar included in the cba come from the portion of the leagues total revenues that is allocated to the players apparently the nfl and the nflpa determine how to fund other benefits the nfl and the nflpa have taken st eps to promote the health and safety of players the league has established several committees such as the mild traumatic brain injury mtbi committee and through nfl charities awards grants for medical and scientific research related to health and safety issues the nflpa has medical advisor and performance consu ltant and there is an nflnflpa joint committee on player safety the subject of injuries disabilities and benefits is complex one and there are variety of issues surrounding this subject for example it has been argued that the way compensation is structured within th nfl might induce an individual to play while injured instead of seeking medical treatment the oldest retired players might make up subset with exceptional financial and medical needs because they 1 might not have been protected as well as current players are 2 might have received medical care that while the best available at the time was not as effective as the care available today and 3 are not eligible for all of the benefits available to current players another issue involves mtbi research and whether multiple concussions might have longterm effects the nf lpa proposed three legislative options in 2007 other possibilities include establishi ng one or more ombudsman offices or taking steps to mitigate the economic risk of injuries and disabilitie s this report will be updated as events warrant

game this limited rost er comprises an active list not exceeding 45 and an inactive list however active pl ayers as used generally in this report extends beyond roster players those play ers employed while in other categories injured reserve for example active and future players are represented by the nfl players association nflpa which is the sole and exclusive bargaining representative for players4 the average length of an nfl career is three and onehalf seasons and the average salary which may include other types of co mpensation see below for additional information is 11 million5 including both vested ie having earned sufficient number of credited seasons to qualif for retirement benefits and nonvested players the number of retired or form er players is appr oximately 13000

video replays of especially hard collisions some players achieve renown as big hitters despite the popularity of the physical na ture of the game it is balanced by concern for the players one sports journalist has written of the games violence players live for it fans love it media celebrate it and all bemoan its devastating consequences the brutal collision of bodi is footballs lifeblood and the nfls biggest concern9 for the purposes of this report distinctions are made between injuries disabilities classified as such under the be rt bellpete rozelle nfl player retirement plan retirement plan disabilities generally and chronic health problems an injury is damage that occurs to an i ndividuals body in this case professional football player such as an abrasion or sp rained ankle torn muscle or concussion retirement plan disability is medical condition that qualifies as disability under the nfl and nflpa retirement plan s ee below for additional information about the different types of disabilities for whic h benefits are provide d under the retirement plan the term disability also may be interpreted more broadly to include any inability or incapacity thus retired player who is incapable of performing one or more particular activities or functions but does not receive any retirement plan disability benefits also may be considered to be disabled10 the phrase chronic health problems refers to conditions or illnesses that interfere with the activities of daily living but do not rise to the level of rendering player unable or incapable of performing an activity or function for example as reported by the angeles times in 2000 joe montana former quarterb ack for the san francisco 49ers does not qualify for disability payments and app ears to be living healthy active post career life but he suffers from an aching knee that makes playing golf painful numb foot that makes walking awkward nd occasional blurred vision from too many hits to the head11 although the focus of this report is on fo rmer players and their health problems and benefits the report also covers certain issues invol ving active players the health of retired players deri ves in part from the injuries and medical conditions such as excessive weight if not obesity that they may have experienced during their playing days accordingly some of th conditions terms or policies under which active players perform might have some bearing on their current and longterm health the issue of former players nd their health and benefits has received considerable attention from congress incl uding

issues and discusses possible courses of action the game of football and the health of players introduction comprehensive data about the health of former players apparently are not collected and maintained either by the nflpa or the nfl or by third party the nflpa is not aware of any source of gene ral data on the current health of the 7900 former players who are vested12 individual teams may have some information but apparently the retirem ent plan office does not13 neither the players association nor the league collects data on number or percentage of players who retire because of an injury or injuries14 the nflpa notes players may leave the game for several reasons statistics about why nfl players retire can be misleading most careers are not affected by muscle or bone problem that causes person to be onehalf of second slower in the 40 yard dash in the nfl that halfsecond could cost player his job the vast majority of players who leave the nfl including those who leave because of injury are in most respects quite hea lthy and capable of other employment15 although the last statement in this passage may be accurate conf irmation is difficult due to the dearth of evidence and possibl some of the individuals who are quite healthy upon leaving the nfl might develop footballrelated disabilities later in life the nfl offers several possible reasons individuals retire from professional football players retire for many reasons because they do not make the team because they wish to start their second career because they lose the desire to play or because they wish to spe nd more time with their families16 nevertheless the nfl has some information on this subject which suggests that for the period 1994 2004 at least 181 players retired for health r easons

was able to identify these 181 players because they received additional compensation after they did not pass their preseason physicals due to injuries sustained during the prior season and thus were unable to play not included in this count are players who decide d to retire because of their injuries and thus did not submit to preseason physical without comprehensive complete deta iled and accurate data including the number and extent of all disabilities and chronic health problems it is difficult to know the health status or employment or fi nancial status of all former players and not just those who already receive in particular di sability benefits18 as suggested above some former players may have ch ronic health problems or may suffer from disabilities as broadly cons trued but do not receive any disability benefits from the retirement plan the absence of informa tion about this group of retirees makes it difficult to determine whether any of them do not receive sufficient assistance and also might hamper efforts to determine the effects or consequences of footballrelated disabilities despite the lack of data on the health of former players however descriptive information can provide some insight into the nature of professional football and football injuries which for some former players might have longterm health consequences the nature of the game of football physical contact is integral to the game of professional football for some though the phrase physical contact is an inadequate description notably mike ditka former player and coach in the nfl stated during congressional hearing that it is not contact sport its collision sport19 timothy gay professor of physics at the university of nebraska and author of football physics the science of the game asks what is the force of that hit well youre talking about classical physics which puts us in the province of isaac newt on force equals mass times acceleration what you come up with in this

back alone is 30 percent more likely to get hurt than quarterback even though passer touches the ball on every possession two out of three cornerbacks and safeties suffer injuries in the nfl annually

class 2 obesity37 the authors concluded their article with the following comment although measurements of body composition are needed to determine the source of the increased weight it is unlikely that the high bmi in this group particularly in the class 2 obesity range is due to healthy increase in muscle mass alone the high number of large players was not unexpected given the pressures of professional athletes to increase their mass however it may not be without health consequences recent study described increased sleepdisordered breathing in professional football players particularly those with high bmi linemen who had the highest bmis also had higher blood pressures than did other players the high prevalence of obesity in this group warrants further investigation to determine the

unknown data provided by the nfl and the nflpa show that possibly 9196 million was spent on benefits for retired player s in 2006 nd 2007 however the ways in which the data are presented by the two or

benefits for former players115 965 million for retirement benef its for retired players 31 million for medical benefits fo r retired players 18 million for health reimbursement accounts 2 million for

terms of how the benefit costs reduce the revenue available for active players under the cba it appears that this description refers to the process described above for the alloca tion of funds for

the management council the commissioner or an nfl committee but it does not have the power to commit orhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34439crs57 189 ibid p 38 190 ibid pp 3839 191 ibid p 38bind either the players association or the management council on any issue189 this limitation on its authority may exist because any changes the committee proposes possibly would have to be negotiated pursuant to the collective bargaining process on the other hand this limitation might mper the ability of the nfl and the nflpa to enact in timely manner any rule or policy changes necessary to protect the health and safety of the players moreover whereas it appears that the joint committee focuses exclusively on player safety and health when recommendation made by the committee is forwarded to one or more of the other parties it is unclear what other factors interests or considera tions might be raised by these other parties when discussing the committees recommendation the joint committee also has role to play if the nflpa believes that any proposed playing rule changes which are issued following the nfls annual meeting would adversely affect player safety the process is as follows if the nflpa believes that the adopti on of playing rule change would adversely affect player safety then within seven days of receiving such notice the nflpa may call meeting of the joint committee on player safety and welfare to be held within one week to discuss such proposed rule change within five days after such meeting if the nflpa continues to believe that the adoption of playing rule change woul d adversely affect player safety the nflpa may request an advisory decision by one of the arbitrators designated in article ix of the cba hearing before such arbitrator must be held within seven days of the joint committee meeting and the arbitrator must render his decision within one week of the hearing such playing rule change will be made by the clubs until after the arbitrators advisory decision unless the arbitrator has not rendered his decision within one week of the hearing the arbitrators decision will be advisory onl not final and binding except as so limited nothing in this section will impair or limit in any way the right of the clubs to make any playing rule change whatsoever190 while the joint committees role in this type of situation is relatively minor the description of the process fo r addressing rule changes that might adversely affect player safety shows that ultimately neither the joint committee the players association nor the arbitrator has any cap ability to modify or rescind potentially problematic proposed rule change it is not known how many rule changes if any were enacted despite the objections of th nflpa conversely considering the following excerpt from the cba it appears that the nflpa is not included in the process for proposing new rules and t hus cannot propose any rules directed at improving player safety let alone participate in discussi ons of rules proposed by the nfl andor teams immediately following the nfl annual meeting the nflpa will be given notice of all proposed playing rule changes either tentatively adopted by the clubs or put over for further consider ation at later league meeting191httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34439crs58 192 ibid p 19 193 dustin dow much pain gain cincinnati enquirer july 1 2007 available at

concerned that if he is unable to play because of an injury his comp ensation or his position on the team might be jeopardized faced with one or more possi ble financial disincentives player might choose then to conceal an injury and tinue to play thus risking further injury moreover by delaying or not seeking treatment or even by downplaying the severity of his injury player may not receive appropriate effective medical treatment the lack of medical treatment or even just the lack of timely medical care could have longterm health conseque nces even if player considers this possibility the immediate financial incentives of continuing to play might outweigh concerns about possible longterm consequences particularly since those consequences might not be well know n and might be unlikely to occur player does have financial incentive to report an injury but this incentive is relatively small failure to promptly report an injury to club physician trainer may result in fine of up to 1500192 the financial penalty for failing to report an injury promptly might be ss important to player than the perception if not the reality of potential adverse financial consequences related to his willingness to play while injured if an individual continues to play with an injury an action that can be facilitated by the use of pain medications it is possible that he risks aggravating the original injury or that other parts of his body may be forced to compensate for the injured body part possible longterm cons equence is that since the injury is not part of the players medical records he might not have documentation he will need as former player to be eligible for retirement plan disability benefits anecdotal information in the form of statements by players that have been reported in news articles suggests that the perception exists among at least some players that in some cases or situations player who reports an injury might be jeopardizing his career193 bob brudzinski who

wanted to see if you can play injured there were lot of injections and stuff like that and the other thing is you didnt want to sit out game because theres always somebody behind you who can take your

there is definition of guaranteed contract but the term is taken to mean that player who has guaranteed contract will continue to receive some or all of his compensation even if he is for example injured and thus unable to play th following excerpts from the nfl player contract which permit team to terminate players contract for reasons having to do with among other things the players physical condition and performance may contribute at least in part to the notion th at players in the nfl do not have socalled guaranteed contracts 8 physical condition player represents to club that he is and will maintain himself in excellent physical condition player will undergo complete physical examination by the club phy sician upon club request during which physical examination player agrees to make full and complete disclosure of any physical or mental condition known to him which might impair his performance under this contract and to respond fully and in good faith when questioned by the club physician about such condition if player fails to establish or maintain his excellent physical condition to the satisfaction of the club physician or make the required full and complete disclosure and good faith responses to the club physician then club may terminate this contract 9 injury unless this contract specifically provides otherwise if player is injured in the performance of his services under this contract and promptly reports such injury to the club physician or trainer then player will receive such medical and hospital care during the term of this contract as the club physician may deem necessary and will continue to receive his yearly salary for so long during the season of injury only and for subsequent period covered by this contract as player is physically unable to perform the services required of him by this contract because of such injury if players injury in the performance of his services under this contract results in his death the unpaid balance of his yearly salary for the season of injury will be paid to his stated beneficiary or in the absence of stated beneficiary to his estate 11 skill performance and conduct player understands that he is competing with other players for positi on on clubs roster within the applicable player limits if at any time in the sole judgment of cl ub players skill or performance has been unsatisfactory as compared with that of other players competing for positions on clubs roster or if player has engaged in personal conduct reasonably judged by club to adversely affect or reflect on club then club may terminate this contract in addition during the period any salary cap is legally in effect this contract may be terminated if in clubs opinion player is anticipated to make less of contri bution to clubs ability to compete on the playing field than another player or players whom club intends to sign or attempts to sign or another player or players who is or are already on clubs roster and for whom club needs

data the longterm financial consequences for players who sustain an injury or injuries and as result are unable to play are unknown the continuedskills decline or he sustains an injury that keeps him from playing respectively the idea of guaranteed contract is perhaps an overly broad concept for the nfl given the different ways in which player compensation may be structured generally the composition and amount of to tal compensation and whether all or portion of the compensation is guaranteed varies from player contract to player contract generally player has an agent who negotiates the terms of his contract with the team however player may nego tiate his own contract players total compensation from the nfl may include for example salary one or more bonuses and one or more incentives202 incentives are also kno wn as performance bonuses however not all bonuses are incentives one of the betterknown bonuses an nfl player may have included in his contract is signing bonus which means he will receive bonus for signing his contract w ith the team some incentives are tied to teams performance such as points scored by offense points allowed by defense and number of sacks allowed203 examples of individual incentives include number of interceptions made passer rating and total number of receptions204 portion of players compensa tion might be guaranteed depending upon what was negotiated with the team but how much is guaranteed for what reason or reasons and for which year or ears of the contract varies from player to player it is difficult to know then how much of each players compensation from the league is guaranteed and how much is not guaranteed without this information and in particular data that show how many players if any have none or only negligible portion of their nfl compensation guarant eed it is difficult to know whether and how many players could be at risk of dverse financial conse quences if they are unable to play because of injuries205 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34439crs62 205 continued actual consequences may differ from players perceptions although an analysis performed by the pittsburgh tribunereview suggests that connection might exist between sustaining an injury and having ones salary decreased the tribunereview which analyzed salary and bonus data for 109 individuals who play ed for the steelers during the period 19992003

players association guaranteed c ontracts in professional team sports how does the nfl compare p 4 in this statement the term signing bonus includes bonuses which are either labeled as such or ar payable up front or with similar degree of certainty such as first year roster bonuses reporting bonuses or option bonuses ibid p 4apparently however during the 2007 season approximately 94 of nfl players had only portion if any of thei r compensation guaranteed the nflpa has noted that if the term guaranteed is defined as an indivi dually negotiated clause in players contract that ssures that he will receive all or most of his salary for the term of the contract even if he is unable to play due to injury or declining skills only about 6 per cent of all nfl player contracts are guaranteed206 this percentage equates to approx imately 102 players for the 2007 season207 looking further back from the 1982 through 1992 seasons only eleven players had any of their base salary guaranteed and the average number of players with guaranteed base salary from 1995 through 2002 was 40 per season208 the nflpa has noted nevertheless that signing bonuses are preferable to salary guarantees and has suggested generally that such bonuses equate to guaranteed compensation specifically the players association has stated that signing bonus is far more preferable to salary guarantee for these reasons the money is given to the player up front that is before he renders his services to the club if the club wants some or all of the signing bonus returned for example if the player fails to perform the team must legally prove its entitlement to return of any of that money and the player can invest the money as soon as he receives it unlike salary which is paid periodically209 the nflpa adds it should therefore be clear that signin g bonuses representing more secure form of compensation than the typical guarant eed contracts in professional baseball and basketball more than qualify as guaranteed compensation under any definition of that term in 2006 approxi mately 52 of all compensation paid to players in the nfl was paid in the form of signing or similar bonuses orhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34439crs63 210 ibid see the preceding footnote for desc ription of what the nflpa includes in the term signing bonus in this context 211 ibidguaranteed salary in very real sense it can therefore be said that at least 52 of all compensation in the nfl is in fact guaranteed to players210 although leaguewide 52 of all compen sation in 2006 was virt ually guaranteed this does not mean that 52 of each pl ayers compensation was guaranteed variations among players contracts specifically signing bonuses provide better indication of each players financia l status and as the nflpa has suggested could indicate what portion of players contract is guaranteed the nflpa acknowledges that it knows better than any one that not all players can negotiate large signing bonuses or otherwise lucrative contracts211 the size of players signing bonus might have some bearing on whether and how vulnerable player might be to internal or external factors inducing him to play when he is injured recognizing that an individuals decision to play when injured could be the result of combination of many different factors or considerations signing bonus data are presented in tables 8

at least six concussions by the time he retired several months after the end of the 2005 season212 the article on chrebets concussion clause stated the following chrebet signed through 2008 agreed to 13 million pay cut that lowers his base salary this season 2004 to 15 million according to nfl players association documents the pay cut isnt surprise considering chrebet probably will lose his starting job but th new contract does include an injury related wrinkle the jets got chrebet to sign split contract complicated deal that would save them from having to pay his entire 15 million salary if hes placed on injured reserve with c oncussion ordinarily player receives his full salary on injured reserve clearly the jets are concerned that another concussion would end chrebets season and quite likely his career the split salary as negotiated by both parties is 500000 it means that if chrebet were to land on injured reserve his salary would drop to 500000 from 15 million prorated over the course of season the difference is about 60000 per week the contract states that only concussion and other injury can trigger the split salary to sweeten th deal for chrebet the jets

smith college who has written extensively on sports economics summarized the situation in the nfl the lack of guaranteed contracts is natural outcome of football players getting hurt217 in similar vein the nfl players association offered this explanation for nocut contracts that is contracts that do not include any guarantees theres argument that nocut contracts in the nfl have been rarity for

ever had ahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34439crs73 218 nfl players association ne w look at guaranteed contr acts in the nfl related issue is the length of contracts fans often read about multiyear deals but nfl compensation packages are really series of oneyear contracts because of careerending injuries players increasingly rely on signing bonus struck at the beginning of the contract and performance incentives after they take the field signing bonuses now constitute half of players takehome pay according to the national football league players association prine bloody sundays repor tedly the rationale offered by an employee of the nfl for oneyear contracts is as follows the nfl is competitive sports league we put the worlds best athletes on the fi eld so its competitive business by its very nature lets say team gave someone longt erm contract whats the players incentive to compete you must have an incentive to get out there and compete at the highest level or you wont have the competitive excellence that we have in the nfl ibid 219 the salary cap is the absolute maximu m amount of salary that each club may pay or be obligated to pay its players each year national football

alternative if they wanted to have pro football career were forced to sign series of one year nonguaranteed c ontracts the nfl was unique owners argued because injury rates to players who ironically took all the risks were so high that there was desire to have to keep on paying players longer in the league218 if injury risk were reallocated and the compensation structure were altered accordingly players might be less likely to play with injuries which would benefit them immediately and might also positively affect their longterm health on the other hand nfl teams might be adversely aff ected if they were required to bear more of the risk related to injuries than they do presently team cannot pay its players more than the nflestablished salary cap each year219 the existence of salary cap means that team would be unable to hire and pay additi onal players to play in place of injured players while it continues to pay the salaries of the injured players related problem is that team may be unwilling or unable financially to pay the salaries of more than 53 players t eam can have only 53 players on its regular season and postseason rosters the nflp describes this dilemma for teams as follows in the nfl the salary cap rules require that any salary paid in given year must count against the cap for that year even if the player is longer playing if team has large number of guaranteed c ontracts rash of injuries to players covered by those contracts could cause severe cap problems for the team and diminish its ability to compete with healthy players on the field220 journalist for the new york times explains further how guaranteed contracts could adversely affect teams ability to maintain competitive team there are seasons when dozens of players on one roster will miss at least some games because of injury if football teams had to pay every player whose abilities were diminished as result of injury or had to continue paying player who had suffered careerending injury there

play while injured because of the way risk is allocated between the team and the players framed as question are the players who are less likely to have guarantees or to have large guarantees included

starter the player who generally is the be st at that position the other players are listed on the depth chart in descending or der so that the individual who is number four on the depth chart is possibly the least experienced or least skilled player at that position players who are number three or number four on the depth chart for their respective positions might feel pressured to play when injured in the hope of moving up the depth chart or not being cut from the team following the end of the season222 since these players generally are the least skilled or least experienced on the team

exnfl players can always seek employment in other professional football leagues such as the canadian football league or the arena football league salaries for players in those leagues usually pale in comparison to nfl salaries thus for most nfl players when their nfl career ends so too does their professional football career so instead of continuing professional football career many exnfl players gravitate toward positions in coaching scouting finance sales or real estate all of which can offer good wage by most standards but typically not by nfl sta ndards other exnfl players lack the education skills or life experience to obtain continuous empl oyment outside of football in short life in the nfl may be good but its usually very short and the vast majority of exnfl players are headed for lives more akin to those of their fans than of their star teammates225 for some retired players then finding gainful employment might be relatively difficult the lack of gainful or conti

that time the retirement board was required to determine that the players in jury caused him to leave football before it could grant lod benefits after eval uating the report of the neutral physician who examined mr pear the three play er trustees on the retirement board wanted to award mr pear the lod bene fits but the three management trustees refused to do so as result of this deadlock the board sent the issue to an arbitrator who ultimately ruled that the injury did not cause mr pear to leave football mr pear applied for tp be nefits in 1995 the retirement plan doctor who examined mr pear determined that he could work the retirement board therefore concluded that mr pear did not qualify for tp disability benefits231 when the tp disability benefit was established only two categories of benefits active football and active nonf ootball were included the football degenerative and inactive categories we re added in 1993 an individual does not have to be vested to receive active f ootball or active nonfoot ball tp benefits but he must be vested to receive foot ball degenerative and inactive benefits232 the four benefit categories including the amount of monthly payment are as follow active football the monthly be nefit will not be less than 4000 if the disability or disabilities arise out of nfl football activities or arise while the player is an active player and otherwise cause the player to be totally and permanently disabled shortly after the disability or disabilities first arise233 active nonfootball the monthly benefit will not be less than 4000 if the

three categories and the threshold for distinguishing between degenerative football disability and an inactive disability which is discussed below might contribute to the contentious nature of disagreements between retirees on the one hand and the nfl the nfl players association and the plan office on the other hand as table 12 shows the benefit amount decreases if the disability is not related to football and whether di sability is related to footba ll is determined by the amount of time that has passed since retirement from the nfl in the following explanation of how tp benefits are structured the nflp essentially confirms that this is the methodology for determining the si ze of benefit for each category the criteria for all of these tp benefits the four categories were forged in collective bargaining which category applies in specific case generally depends on 1 the cause of the disability and 2 the length of time between players nfl career and his inability to work in the view of the nflpa it is appropriate for the benefit to be greater where nfl football was the cause and it is appropriate that the payment amount may depend in part on the length of time between the players nfl career and his inability to work237 this explanation raises few questions for example does scholarly literature indicate that total and permanent disabilities caused by injuries peculiar to playing professional football manifest themselves within certain time frame specifically is the time frame selected by the nf l and the nflpa 15 years supported byhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34439crs80 scholarly literature additionally do some types of disabilities appear later than others the threshold that is time frame for determining whether players

30 when they retire their disabilities if any will need to surface at younger age than under the prev ious criteria for them to be eligible for the football degenerative benefit players who retire at age 31 or older will have an additional three years compared to the previous criteria in which their disabilities may surface for them to be eligible for the football degenerative category the implications of this change in criteria for players who retire before they reach age 30 are unknown as noted above the length of an average career is 3½ seasons so significant number of players might retire before age 30 accordingly players who have relatively short careers probably sustain fewer injuries than their peers who play for 10 or 15 years applications for disability benefits are

practices these teams will be located in areas where there is the largest concentration of retired players including in arizona ca lifornia florida and texas as well as in other major metropolitan

applicants via tollfree number th is specialist will assist in preparing applications and advise applicants on the information that is required the completed application will be sent to th applicant for review verification and signature the 45day review period will begin once the signed application is returned this service will make it more likely that applications are completed correctly the first time and thus reduce the processing time 4 expedited email appeals the retirement board will whenever possible decide appeals via email ballots this will allow for faster decisions on many appeals and will avoid requiring applicants to wait for the next scheduled meeting of the retirement board 5 extending review period the plan will reduce the number and frequency of continuation reviews for those applicants receiving total and permanent disability benefits by extending the current threeyear maximum to at least five years any three trustees may require continuation review more frequently although not more frequently than annually if they decide there is reason to do so241 furthermore the nfl and the nflpa have agreed that any eligible former player who is receiving social

eviden ce of neurocognitive decline after multiple three or more mtbis or in thos players out 7 days from the date of the concussion the data show that mt bi in this population is characterized by rapid return of neuropsoychological function in the days after injury263 theme among peer reviewers comments was that the finding the evidence does not support link between single or multiple mtbis and longterm effects was questionable the following are excerpts from peer reviewers comments in addition i do not believe that this st udy with correlation between clinical and neuropsychological evaluati on proves that there are widespread permanent or cumulative effects of single or multiple mtbi in nfl players i think that it is premature to conclude that there ar longterm consequences of mtbi in football while players are still active for many reasons264 these results should be interpreted w ith caution further followup of players sustaining mtbi is needed to better termine the cumulative effect of multiple concussions265 the authors possess remarkable data set my strongest impression after reading the article was that the data set was so important that it deserved additional analysis and that good place to start would be to remove the outliers and see the results266 it is specifically recommended that the statement that there are widespread permanent or

professional football players they only studied the acute neuropsychol ogical effects of single and repeat concussion and the data presented tell us nothing about potential permanent or longterm complications the author s cannot assume that there could not be chronic effects especially since they have only looked at brief window of time268 study carried out by physicians who are not affiliated with the nfl and led by the research director of the center for the study of retired athletes csra kevin m guskiewicz focused specifically on the longterm effects of concussions in former nfl players as the following excerpt shows gukiewicz et reached different conclusion than did pellman et regarding possible longterm consequences of mtbis these data describe significant asso ciation between recurrent concussion and mci as well as with selfreported memory impairments confirmed by spouse or close relative retired professiona l football players with three or more concussions were twice as likely to be diagnosed with mci as those with one or two previous concussions and five times more likely than those with previous concussions this trend continued with respect to selfreported significant memory problems these findings suggest th at the clinical features of dementia related syndromes may be initiated by repetitive cerebral concussions269 another result of the survey conducted by guskiewicz et i nvolved the prevalence of concussions among retired nfl players among former players who participated in the study 608 reported having had at least one concussion during their nfl careers and 24 reported sustaini ng three or more concussions270 peer reviewers comments on guskiewicz et noted among other points that relying on selfreported information might affect the accuracy of the data collected several peer reviewers also commented on the value and possible implications of the study like all retrospective studies that rely upon selfreported medical histories and health problems this one is subject to bias in the accuracy with which problems were recalled and reported nevertheless these results are of considerable interest the authors make appropriate

knowledge this is one of few studies to show positive association between repetitive concussion and longterm cognitive impairment and alzheimers disease273 this is an interesting paper that poses an intriguing hypothesis regarding the consequences of recurrent concussion not only to create shortterm problems but also to accelerate the decline of cognitive function in later years while tantalizing the findings are soft the data are derived from questionnaire administered to group that may have substantial bias especially considering the recent reports and concerns expre ssed by physicians and the media274 this is an extremely valuable contribu tion most concussion studies focus on the days and weeks following the injury w ith the implicit assumption that recovery to preinjury levels is the end of the issue the present paper provides strong suggestion that some residua of c oncussion may not become manifest until decades after the injury the authors are to be commended for clearly stating the limitations of their retrospective self report experimental design however the goldstandard methodology would require multidecade prospective study275 this is an important paper on the relationship between cerebral concussion and subsequent cognitive impairment in retired professional football players its major flaw as the authors acknowledge is that the history of previous concussion was based on the players retrospective recall of injury events nonetheless their data strongly suggest s there is cumulative deleterious effect of repeated concussion on later cognitive function276 the present study does not dispel uncertainties regarding the relationship between repeated concussions and subse quent onset of brain disorders most importantly alzheimers disease society

guskiewicz et recurrent concussion and risk of depression in retir ed professional football players p 904 281 ibid p 906 the findings from our study of retired professional football players support the notion that lifetime prevalence of depr ession and feelings commonly associated with depressed state increases as func tion of previous head injury exposure our observed threefold prevalence ratio for retired players with three or more concussions is daunting given that depression is typically characterized by sadness loss of interest in activities decreased energy and loss of confidence and selfesteem these findings call into question how effectively retired professional football players with histor of three or more concussions are able to meet the mental and physical dema nds of life after playing professional football furthermore our findings ggest that single concussion does not provide the risk for subsequent depressi on and they provide an extension to the findings on the cumulative risk of repeat concussion demonstrated in collegiate football players in combination these suggest that football players with three or more concussions are at threefold risk for sustaining future concussions with subsequent threefold risk of be ing diagnosed with clinical depression compared with those with limited or prior history278 guskiewicz et then explain the impact that depression may have on an individual noting that depression can affect ones ability to function in multiple realms including interpersona l relationships productivity at work and selfcare in older adults depression is associated with significantly higher health care costs and significant risk of functional decline 279 additional findings reported by guskiewicz et in this article suggest that certain players because of combination of injuries and circumstances may experience range of problems during retirement the following excerpt describes these circumstances and problems our findings also suggest that in genera l retired professional football players who have history of concussion and pressive episodes report greater physical limitations that interfere with their ab ility to perform daily physical activities compared with those without depression the sf36 short form 36 results for mental and physical functioning reveal that those with history of depression are more likely to be restricted by muscle and joint pain feel helpless have difficulty sleeping and in general feel as t hough their health is declining280 individuals with history of depre ssion also reported more alcoholrelated problems and were more likely to be separated or divorced281 the journal in which this article appeared did not publish any peer review comments on this article

additional mtbi study of 2905 football players which was also led by kevin guskiewicz explored the possibility that player who has suffered one or more c oncussions is more likely to sustain an additional concussion than an individual who has not had any concussions in published article guskiewicz et reported that player who has sustained concussion and in particular player who has sustaine d three or more concussions has greater probability of having another concussion than player who has not had three concussions the authors wrote players reporting history of 3 or more previous concussions were 30 times more likely to have an incident concussion than players with concussion history our study suggests that player s with history of previous concussions are more likely to have future concussive injuries than those with history 1 in 15 players with concussion may have additional concussions in the same playing season and previous concussi ons may be associated with slower recovery of neurological function th results illustrate that history of previous concussions may be associated with an increased risk of future concussive injuries and that these prev ious concussion may be associated with slower recovery of neurological func tion following subsequent concussions within given season there may be 7 to 10day window of increased susceptibility for recurrent c oncussive injury but this finding should be further studied in larger sample of athlet with recurrent inseason concussions282 this article was not published in neurosurgery hence there are comments by peer reviewers in an article on returntoplay consider ations which are used to determine when it is acceptable from medical perspective for player who has sustained concussion to return to practice or to game pellman et suggest that player who has sustained an mtbi does not have greater risk of sustaining another concussion than player who has history of concussions players who are concussed and return to the same game have fewer initial signs and symptoms than those removed from play return to play does not involve significant risk of second injury either in the same game or during the season the current decisionmaking of nfl team physicians seems appropriate for return to the game after concussion when the player has become asymptomatic and does not have memory or cognitive problems283 the nfl experience thus suggests that players who become asymptomatic with normal examinations at any time after inju ry while the game is still in progress have been and can continue to be safely returned to play on that day this indicates that the 15minutes rule in the current guidelines may be too conservative for the nfl many of the currently accepted guidelines also indicate that

study who had recorded loss of consciousness as result of mtbi and later returned to play in the same game there was evidence of any adverse effect of this action these data suggest that these players were at increased risk of repeat mtbi or prolonged postconcussion syndrome compared with other players284 the peer reviewers comments on pellman et are as follows study of this magnitude has some inherent limitations as the authors acknowledge however this is an intere sting analysis that demonstrates that at least in the acute phase and during their active playing years these athletes seem to perform well with risk for intracrani hemorrhage or later high incidence of recurrent concussion or postconcussion symptoms285 the conclusions cited in this article are supported by the data presented multiple studies in the past several years have indicated that the incidence of concussion cited by the athlete questioned after the season is over is many times higher four to seven times than that currently reported by the team medical personnel that most athletes do pl ay through most minor concussions is supported by these studies286 the present study evaluated the safety of returning concussed professional football players to the same game imme diately or after period of rest as would be predicted players who returned to the same game have significantly lower incidences of cognitive and memory problems than players removed from play or hospitalized this article essentially confirms that the practice by team physicians and trainers in the nfl of not allowing symptomatic or neurologically abnormal athletes to return to play in the same game is safe practice287 returntoplay decisions regarding at hletes who sustain concussion can be difficult for the sports medicine

artic several members of the mtbi committee submitted letter in may 2006 to neurosurgery critiquing omalu et and suggesting that their article should be retract ed or revised an excerpt from casson et follows we disagree with the assertion that omalu et als recent article actually reports case of chronic traumatic encephalopathy in national football league nfl player we base our opinion on two serious flaws in omalu et als article namely serious misint erpretation of thei r neuropathological findings in relation to the tetrad characteristics of chronic traumatic encephalopathy and failure to provide an adequate clinical history we have demonstrated that omalu et als case does not meet the clinical or neuropathological criteria of chronic traumatic encephalopathy we therefore urge the authors to retract their paper or sufficiently revise it and its title after more detailed investigation of this case293 omalu et replied to the casson et letter and others in the field of neurology also commented on th article and the casson et letter in their reply omalu et explained why they would not withdraw th eir article and concluded by encouraging the nfl to study the longter m consequences of mtbi in concluding their letter omalu et wrote in fact our case is important primarily because it indicates that there may be brain damage in nfl players that is currently underreported because of lack of longterm clinical followup focused on evaluating such condition we suggest that the nfl begin examining the longterm effects of brain injury in its former players we

seve ral valid points regarding the intrinsic limitations of the case material used in omalu et als study however because these limitations were noted by omalu et in the published version i do not see the point of publishing letter reiterating them296 casson et should be thanked for compiling this detailed historical review of our understanding of th neuropathology of chroni c brain injury omalu et

that differ from those of the first reported case300 the reasons for the differen ces were not clear and again omalu called for further st udies to identify and defi ne the neuropathological cascades of chronic traumatic encephalopa thy in football players which may form the basis for prophylaxis and therapeutics301 excerpts from peer reviewers comments are as follow this is an interesting study linking the chronic head trauma in professional football players with chronic traumatic encephalopathy there is temporal association of the symptoms with the pa tients football career also it does not prove that head injury from playing foot ball was the sole cause of this patients disease the association is intrig uing and is important to report302 with such multifactorial and incomple history i think it is extremely speculative to suggest that his former player psychosocial behavior and neuropathological findings are attri butable to footballinduced traumatic encephalopathy especially because he demonstrated residual evidence of post concussion syndrome after his one documented cerebral concussion after which he returned to full football partic ipation for several years nevertheless although more than daunting to perform postmortem neuropathological examinations on all nfl hall of fame inductees would be of interest303 following on their initial case report this autopsy study is of interest and further raises the question of the possibility of chronic or cumulative effects of multiple subclinical concussions resulting in neurodegenerative changes notwithstanding the absence of documentation of multiple clinical concussive episodes this case nonetheless stimulates the discussion of whether or not in small number of players such football

of concussion in this study 5 return to play data were collected on players with initial and repeat c oncussions there are many other factors that go into the decision of whether or not the player

more concussions this research is presented above the following comments by resear cher kevin guskiewicz and greg aiello senior vice president of media relati ons for the nfl as reported in the new

trying to raise ambiguity when the science is becoming more and more clear greg aiello nf l spokesman responded in statement we certainly respect the work that dr guskiewicz nd others have done on this subject and look forward to continuing to work w ith him our medical advisers including neurosurgeons and neurologists do not fully share his view of the science we are conducting research on

for players who sustain concussions team physicians and athletic trainers s hould continue to exercise their clinical judgment and expertise in the treatment of each player who sustains concussion and to avail themselves of additiona l expert consultation when clinically indicated we encourage team physicians and athletic trainers to continue to take conservative approach to treating concussion team physicians and athletic trainers s hould continue to take the time to obtain thorough history includi ng inquiring specifically about the common symptoms of concussion and to c onduct thorough neurological examinati on including mental status testing at rest and postex ertional testing before making return to play decisions in game or practice the essential criteria for consideration of return to play remain unchanged the player should be completely asymptomatic and have normal neurologic examination including mental status tes ting at rest and postexertional testing before being

hould continue to consider the players history of concussion including number and time between incidents type and severity of blow and time to recover team physicians and athletic trainers should continue to educate players about concussion and to emphasize the need for players to be forthright about physical and neurological complaints associated with concussion321 the third item from the bottom which advises that player who was unconscious should not be returned to the sa game or practice appears to conflict with an article written by members of the mtbi committee the relevant portion of the 2005 neurosurgery article is as follows many of the currently accepted guidelines also indicate that any player who experiences loss of consciousness with mtbi should not be allowed to return to play that day although the numbers were small there were few players in this study who had recorded loss of consciousness as result of mtbi and later returned to play in the same game there was

most important factor in determining returntoplay deci sions by team physicians there are many other factors that go into the decision of when the player should return to play the importance of the

in determining the quality and longevity of an nfl players career it is importa nt for players to become knowledgeable about the injuries they sustain and to learn what their club medical staff thinks about those injuries according to tim english nflpa sta ff counsel who regularly represents injured nfl players in injury grievance arbitrations players who review their clubs medical records for the first time while preparing their arbitrations are often surprised to read what has been written about their injuries by the club doctors and trainers the level of detail in the records far exceeds what is told to them by the club invariably those players regret not having taken the time to review their records previously many times the additional information contained in the clubs records may assist player in planning or altering his off season treatment and training activity all too often during the season player who sustains an injury is only focused on getting back out on the field and not on the extent of his injury and the best course of action to take for longterm health the offseason is therefore the time to reevaluate those injuries and review of the club medical and trainers records is the place to start341 arrangements for medical care and treatment article xliv of the cba governs the players right to medical care and treatment as the employer team provides medical care

representative of players physical condition which adversely affects the players performance or health the physician will also advise the player if such condition could be significantly aggravated by continued performance the physician will advise the player of such fact in writing before the player is again allowed to perform onfield activity343 while the requirement to provide written notification to player is an important safeguard it is unclear whether this step w ould be feasible in some situations for example is it possible to provide written notification to players during game player may seek second opinion and he may have his team pay for the costs associated with doing so as long as he follows this provision in the cba player will have the opportunity to obtain second medi cal opinion as condition of the responsibility of the club for the costs of medical services rendered by the physician furnishing the second opinion the player must consult with the club physician in adva nce concerning the other physician and b the club physician must be furnished promptly with report concerning the diagnosis examination and course of treatment recommended by the other physician344 at least one former team doctor has suggested however that some players may believe the team prefers that they not seek second option as quoted in news article dr robert huizenga team doctor for the oakland raiders and past president of the national football league team physicians society said he always suspected that the raiders he treated belie ved it would be held against them if they sought second opinion some of them were afraid to even admit to being injured at all dr huizenga said345 although it is not known whether any team has discouraged player from seeking s

owners the following excerpt from news article describes the issue there is complex tapestry occurring in players medical treatments coaches often want players rushed back onto the field to win games players themselves often push to get back quickly but when some injured players balk coaches and teammates might consider them loafers and pressure them to return coaches pressure doctors for medical

relationships the league wants players treated effectively and fairly but also wants to protect its teams from expensive liability awards352 the status of this effort is unclear related issue is the nature of the business arrangement between team and its medical staff as described in the follo wing excerpt some doctors or their medical practices pay team for the privilege of serving as team doctors in an upsidedown scenario spawned by an increasingly competitive healthcare market hospitals and medical practices eager for any promotional advantage have begun bidding to pay pro teams as

retire or one or more disabilities arise when it might be too late for them to apply successful applicati on for workers compensation benefits might limit players options for recourse concerning his

suggestions for legislative action at hearing in september 2007 the executiv director of the players association proposed three legislative options365 the nflpa did not discuss how it developed these

develop federal st andards for workers compensation which currently is administere d by states the players association argues that the current system causes the vast majority of hurt workers not just nfl players to settle for lump sum and give up their rights to lifetime medical care for their injuries on the job366 without additional detaile d information about states workers compensation systems or programs including data about the disposition of workers compensation applications the exte nt of the problem raised by the nflpa is unknown this suggestion might be interp reted as applying to all employers and employees and not just the nfl and prof essional football players yet it would be helpful to have an explicit declaration of the scope of the suggestion in any case whether the suggestion is for the nfl only or for all employers the implications of such change could be farreaching another consideration is whether since states historically have been responsible for ad ministering workers compensation this is an area in which the federal government would want to intervene in sum additional detailed information is needed in order to assess this proposal permit unions to manage their benefit plans the nflpa suggested that the tafthartley act 29 usc 141 197 should be changed to allow the players association if not all unions to manage their own pla ns it appears that the nflpa is referring to 29 usc 186c5b which requires that plan subject to the act be administered by board of tr ustees and that the union and the employer be represented equally on the board as with the first proposal it is unclear whether the nflpa is suggesting this change for only the nflnflpa retirement plan or for all negotiated retirement plans if the nflpa is proposing that the suggested change to the tafthartley act apply to all negotiated plans it is unclear how other unions and employers might respond to the nflpas suggestion the rationale offered by the nflpa fo r amending the tafthartley act is as follows since the nflpa has been criticized when applications are denied even though majority vote of the six trustees is necessary for decision and since current players are funding the system it ma kes sense for the players to be the ones making the disability decisions367 the players association has also said that allowing the trustees appointed by the nflpa to have the sole responsibility to decide applications for di sability benefits would avoid deadlocks and expedite payments368 changing the composition of the retirement board might not significantly affect the application approval rate which means that criticism of the nflpa might not lessen as the nflpa executive director noted in his comments regarding this proposal the negotiated contribution by em ployers is fixed and plan actions cannot impose extra liability369 thus the nflpa does not assert that changing thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34439crs121 369 continued oversight of the nfl

above the plan counsel testified that the retirement plan is underfunded actuarially however one of the suggestions presented below regarding the sports broadcasting act of 1961 includes mechanism that if enacted might yield additi onal funds for benefits while it might be important symbolically for the board to consist solely of nflpa representatives the substantive significance of the second element of the nflpas rationale for this proposal pl ayers fund the retirement plan is not readily apparent furthermore under th proposed arrangement the nflpa alone most likely would bear the brunt of criticis m about the disability application process whereas currently both the league and the players association might be viewed as sharing responsibility for the retirement boards decisions in his testimony the nflpas executive director mentioned six trustees which suggests that he was referring to the retirement board the dicc has only two members when he proposed that the nflp choose all of the individuals who make disability application decisions giving the nflpa sole responsibility for the decisions of the retirement board would according to the players association end deadlocked

disability initial claims committee dicc in his 2007 testimony the nflpas executive director asked congress to eliminate the requirement to have an extra level of decisionmaking in disability

stipulate that neither the individual who made the adverse determination nor an yone subordinate to this individual can hear the appeal rationale accompanied the nflpas suggestion although it seems

players about injuries and possible longterm consequences and helping the nfl the nflpa and the retirement plan office to identify and remedy possible problems associated with the administration of benefits possible options include providing injury surveillance system reports to active players which c ould aid them in understanding for example the scope and frequency of injuries which pos itions are at risk for certain injuries and why certain protective equi pment or safety procedures are necessary for players safety provision of the data in addition to the two reports that are produced each season to the nflpa would make it possibl for the players association to conduct its own analysis of injuries suggestions for new data collection fforts include conducting exit interviews with players who are retiring carrying out survey of former players and establishing and maintaining database on the disposition of applications for disability benefits exit interviews might provide information useful to the league the players association and the players th emselves an exit interview could cover range of topics including for example reasons for retirement feedback on the nature and quality
