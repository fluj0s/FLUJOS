wikileaks document release httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22761 february 2 2009 congressional research service report rs22761 extending trade adjustment assistance taa to service workers how many workers could potentially be covered john j topoleski domestic social policy division january 30 2008 abstract trade adjustment assistance taa provides income support and training assistance to workers who become unemployed for certain traderelated reasons only workers who make an article ie man ufacturing workers are eligible for taa under current law service workers who become unemployed for traderelated reason eg outsourcing are ineligible for taa several bills in the 110th congress s 1848 hr 910 hr 3589 hr 3920 would expand taa to include service workers and public sector employees the available data indicates that the number of displaced manufacturing workers in offshorable occupations from 2003 to 2005 489000 roughly equals the number of taacertified manufacturing workers over the same period 450000 there were 840000 workers displaced from offshorable nonmanufacturing occupations from 2003 to 2005 suggesting that the pool of taaeligible workers could have increased by over 170 if service workers had been eligible for taa in january 2006 nearly three times as many employed nonmanufacturing workers were in offshorable occupations 207 million than employed manufacturing workers in offshorable occupations 77 million suggesting large increase in the pool of potentially eligible taa workers order code rs22761 updated january 30 2008 extending trade adjustment assistance

assistance taa provides income support and training assistance to workers who become unemployed for certain traderelated reasons only workers who make an article ie manufacturing workers are eligible for taa under current law service workers who become unemployed for traderelated reason eg outsourcing are ineligible for taa several bills in the 110th congress s 1848 hr 910 hr 3589 hr 3920 would expand taa to include service workers and public sector employees the available data indicates that the number of displaced manufacturing workers in offshorable occupations from 2003 to 2005 489000

workers were in offshorable occupations 207 million than employed manufacturing workers in offshorable occupations 77 million suggesting large increase in the pool of potentially eligible taa workers this report will be updated as circumstances warrant taa background taa provides income support and training assistance to certain workers who lose their jobs for traderelated reason for example manufacturing workers who are laid off either due to company shifting production to country with which the united states has free trade agreement or manufacturing company switching to supplier in any foreign country would be eligible for taa manufacturing workers who lose their jobs due to general economic decline are not eligible for taa taa was most recently reauthorized by the trade act of 2002 pl 107210 and was set to expire on september 30 2007 pl 11089 extended taa until december 31 2007 pl 110161 signed on crs2 december 26 2007 fully funds taa through september 30 2008 the department of labor has indicated that this is sufficient to continue the program including issuing new certifications of eligible workers1 currently taa eligibility is generally limited to workers in firms that make an article which excludes most nonmanufacturing workers in the united states in the 110th congress several bills s 1848 hr 910 hr 3589 hr 3920 would expand taa eligibility for example s 1848 and hr 3920 would extend taa to workers in service sector firms or public agencies the bills also eliminate the requirement that the shift in production be to country with which the united states has freetrade agreement so for example workers whose jobs are offshored to any country regardless of whether they produce product or service would be eligible for taa under s 1848 and hr 39202 taa benefits and financing taa has two primary benefits trade readjustment allowances tra and training job search and relocation benefits httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22761 tra provides up to 130 weeks of income support if taaeligible worker is participating in an approved training program tra is mandatory spending program because tra benefits are provided to all who meet the eligibility requirements under current financing provisions workers would lose tra income support benefits if there were an increase in the pool of taa eligible workers an increase in tra expenditures would be paid for like all mandatory funding through some combination of borrowing increased revenues or spending cuts in contrast to tra the training job search and relocation assistance aspect of taa is capped entitlement the trade act of 2002 specifically limits training expenditures to 220 million per fiscal year in fy2007 an additional 39 million was appropriated for job search and relocation expenses s 1848 would increase the amount of training funds to 440 million in fy2008 and increase the annual appropriation by 10 if states had obligated or expended 90 of the previous years authorization hr 3920 would increase training funds to 440 million in fy2008 and fy2009 and 660 million in each fiscal year thereafter an expansion of taa to include service workers might present additional challenges to the management of training funds taa funds are allocated to states on the basis of worker participation and expenditures for the prior two and half years however state that experiences unexpectedly large layoffs might find training funds insufficient to meet the demand and so have to ration the available training funds both s 1848 and hr 3920 adjust the funding formula used to allocate training funds to address these funding concerns 1 for more information see crs report rs22718 trade adjustment assistance for workers taa and alternative trade adjustment assistance for older workers ataa by john j topoleski 2 for more information on offshoring see crs report rl32292 offshoring aka offshore outsourcing and job insecurity among us workers by linda levine crs3 impact to examine the impact of offshoring on the number of potential taaeligible workers this report examines workers in occupations that have the potential to be offshored the report examines the offshorability of displaced or employed workers occupations and categorizes the number of workers first by the offshorable potential of their occupations and second by whether the workers are employed in the manufacturing nonmanufacturing or government sectors the report analyzes two sets of data 1 longtenured displaced workers from january 2003 to december 2005 and 2 workers who were employed in january 2006 data this report uses employment data from the current population survey cps the cps is monthly survey of about 50000 households conducted by the bureau of the census for the bureau of labor statistics bls and is the primary source of information on the labor force characteristics of the us population we use the january 2006 cps httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22761 to examine the number of workers employed in january 2006 in addition this report also uses the displaced workers survey dws supplement to the january cps in even years the january 2006 dws provides information on workers who were displaced from their jobs between january 2003 and december 2005 this report does not include agriculture workers and members of the armed forces variable definitions to determine which occupations were potentially offshorable this report uses list created by princeton university economist and former vice chairman of the board of governors of the federal reserve system alan s blinder3 blinder classifies occupations as highly offshorable offshorable nonoffshorable or highly nonoffshorable on the basis of the occupations description in the department of labors onet database by offshoring blinder means the migration of employment from the us and other rich countries to other mostly poorer countries conforming to the bls definition of manufacturing occupations this report uses occupations listed as production occupations by the census bureau government workers may be from any occupation but are employed by local state or federal government displaced workers are persons 20 years of age and older who lost or left jobs because their plants or companies closed or moved there was insufficient work for them to do or their positions or shifts were abolished this report uses the bls definition of long tenured displaced workers these are workers who had worked for their employers for three or more years at the time of displacement whereas taa eligibility only requires that worker be employed at the firm for 26 of the 52 weeks preceding the layoff using longtenured workers may better approximate the number of taaeligible workers although this likely slightly underestimates the number of taaeligible workers using 3 see alan s blinder how many us jobs might be offshorable ceps working paper 142 march 2007 available at httpwwwprincetonedublinderpapers07ceps142pdf crs4 all displaced workers including shorttenured would likely greatly overestimate taa eligible workers support for using longtenured displaced workers can be found in recent government accountability office gao report that found 917 of taa eligible workers from five plant closings had been at their place of employment for at least five years4 caveats this methodology may overestimate or underestimate the number of workers whose jobs are outsourced and who would potentially be eligible for taa unfortunately neither the census bureau nor bls collects data on the number of jobs that have been offshored some important caveats include the following not all job losses in the highly offshorable or offshorable categories would be eligible for taa as it currently exists or as it might be expanded to service workers for example it is entirely possible for workers in manufacturing plant in an offshorable occupation to lose their jobs because of plant fire or general downturn in the economy httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22761 such workers would not be eligible for taa the estimates in this report represent sort of upper limit on the number of workers potentially eligible for taa an assumption is that workers in nonoffshorable or highly nonoffshorable occupations will not lose their jobs to offshoring worker in nonoffshorable occupation may be offshored in the future particularly if technology changes the nature of work in an occupation blinders list is of potentially offshorable occupations it makes prediction as to the actual number of jobs that will be offshored blinder rates the ease with which job could be offshored on the basis of the job description for example the physical presence required by janitorial staff suggests lower probability of being offshored than callcenter workers who could perform their jobs from any location it would be very difficult to predict the number of nonmanufacturing job losses that would be eligible for taa although it appears that the number of displaced manufacturing workers in highlyoffshorable and offshorable categories closely matches the number of workers on petitions that were taa certified this may or may not be the case with nonmanufacturing and government workers therefore extrapolating to the nonmanufacturing sector is difficult this report does not calculate standard errors therefore the difference between manufacturing and nonmanufacturing workers may or may not be statistically significant ie the results could be due to chance 4 gao0643 trade adjustment assistance most workers in five layoffs received services but better outreach needed on new benefits available at httpwwwgaogovnewitems d0643pdf crs5 results generally the results show manufacturing occupations have much greater percentage of offshorable employed and displaced workers than private non manufacturing occupations but that the number of private nonmanufacturing offshorable employed and displaced workers is considerably higher than manufacturing workers as group manufacturing occupations are more likely to be or to have been offshored but there are many more nonmanufacturing employed and displaced workers in offshorable occupations if proposed legislation were enacted the pool of potentially taaeligible workers could increase anywhere from two to four times the current number table 1 indicates the number of potentially offshorable longtenured displaced workers within three major categories of occupations private nonmanufacturing government and production there were 38 million displaced workers from 2003 to 2005 of which 14 million 36 were in potentially offshorable positions httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22761 nearly all 93 displaced production workers were in offshorable occupations in contrast only 28 of private nonmanufacturing displaced workers were in offshorable occupations finally only 12 of displaced government workers were in offshorable occupations nearly twothirds of displaced workers in offshorable occupations were from nonmanufacturing and government occupations these displaced workers would not have been eligible for taa under current law but might be under proposed legislation there were 489000 displaced production workers in offshorable occupations for comparison there were 446000 workers certified for taa from 2003 to 2005 table 1 number of longtenured displaced workers

highly offshorable and offshorable categories the four categories of offshorability sum to 100 shown in the last column crs6 most nonmanufacturing occupations are nonoffshorable although within private nonmanufacturing occupation categories there is considerable variation in offshorable potential for example although 100 of legal occupations are considered offshorable only 7 of information occupations are potentially offshorable had displaced nonmanufacturing workers been eligible for taa from 2003 to 2005 the number of taaeligible workers potentially could have more than doubled from 490000 to 14 million table 2 contains data on the number of workers employed in january 2006 there were 32 million 245 workers employed in offshorable occupations for most employment categories the percentage of potentially offshorable current workers is less than the percentage of displaced workers in offshorable occupations for example 205 of employed httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22761 nonmanufacturing workers are in potentially offshorable occupations from table 2 compared with 275 of displaced nonmanufacturing workers from table 1 although there were 17 times as many displaced private nonmanufacturing workers as displaced manufacturing workers from table 1 there were 27 times as many private nonmanufacturing workers employed in offshorable occupations in january 2006 if government sector workers are included this suggests that the pool of potentially taaeligible workers could more than quadruple from 77 million to 317 million in the future if taa is expanded to include service and government sector employees table 2 number of employed persons in the united states as of january 2006 by potential offshorability of occupation total of both occupation highly non
