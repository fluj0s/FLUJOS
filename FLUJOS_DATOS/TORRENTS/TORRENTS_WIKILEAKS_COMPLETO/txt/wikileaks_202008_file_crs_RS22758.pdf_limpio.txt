defense and trade division july 21 2008 abstract iran has an active interest in developing acquiring and deploying broad range of ballistic missiles this was spotlighted in midjuly 2008 when iran launched number of ballistic missiles during military exercises reportedly including the mediumrange shahab3 on july 18 2008 pentagon spokesman said iran was not testing new technologies or capabilities but rather ﬁring oﬀ old equipment in an attempt to intimidate their neighbors and escalate tension in the region subsequent analysis of the july 2008 missile launches also shows iran apparently digitally altered images of those launches this report seeks to provide an overview of the reported or suspected variety of iranian ballistic missile programs because there remains widespread public divergence over particulars however this report does not provide speciﬁcity to what iran may or may not have or is in the process of developinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22758g5g20g21g561g20g142g153g152g155g157g561g143g152g155g561g5g152g151g144g155g142g156g156 prepared for members and committees of congress g561

shah was overthrown and the islamic republic of iran established the new iranian government embarked on ballistic missile program marked by considerable secrecy many consider that irans ballistic missile development was in full force by the mid1980s during its protracted war against iraq during which iran reportedly launched more than 600 ballistic missiles today there is little disagreement among most experts that iran has acquired some number of ballistic missiles from other countries and has developed other ballistic missiles indigenously or in cooperation with others iranian ballistic missile proliferation has been matter of us and international concern at the same time however there has been considerable public disagreement over precisely what ki nds of ballistic missile systems iran has or is developing itself or in cooperation with others this is because there is little transparency in irans ballistic missile programs which has led to some degree of lack of confidence in irans public assertions of its activities finally details about iranian ballistic missile programs remain classified in the united states because of the secrecy inherent in the development of weapon systems especially in less open societies opensource analyses reflect widerange of technical views and assessments this report provides brief description of what is publicly discussed regarding irans ballistic missile programs 1 it does not discuss iranian cruise missiles2 or rockets3 these latter weapons were source of concern when some reportedly iranianmade rockets and other missiles may have been used by hezbollah against israel in 2006 4 charges of iranian military support to iraqi insurgents do not include iranianmade rockets or missiles however this report first examines irans longrange ballistic missile programs because those efforts generally drive the greatest concerns within the united states especially when coupled with concern over the development of irans nuclear capabilities brief overview of irans medium and shortrange ballistic missile programs then follows

missiles icbms as those ballistic missiles capable of ranges greater than 5500 kilometers about 3400 miles to date five countries have deployed operational icbms all with nuclear weapons the 1 after an initial powered phase of flight ballistic missile leaves the atmosphere about 100 kilometers and follows an unpowered trajectory or flight path before reentering th atmosphere toward predetermined target ballistic missile ranges can vary from hundred or so kilometers to more than 10000 kilometers 2 cruise missile is guided missile that normally uses some form of jet propulsion system to allow sustained flight within the atmosphere toward its target cruise missile ranges can vary from few hundred to more than 1500 kilometers 3 after an initial powered launch military rocket will head toward its intended target without leaving the atmosphere military rocket ranges are relatively short range and can be guided or unguided 4 for instance see crs report rl32048 iran us concerns and policy responses by kenneth katzman and the rocket campaign against israel during the 2006 lebanon war by uzi rubin mideast security and policy studies 71 june 2007 there remains uncertainty over the extent of hezbollahs rocket and missile inventory and what was actually fired during the 2006 war this includes the chinesebuilt antiship missile c802 which iran imported in the early 1990s at least one such c802 may have been transferred to hezbollah and used to nearly sink an israeli naval corvette ship in july 2006 reports of fajr3 iranianmade artillery rocket used in the 2006 war are sometimes erroneously confused with an iranian mediumrange ballistic missile i

as iran are believed by some observers to have icbm programs in varying stages of development in 1999 the us intelligence community assessed that at some point the united states would probably face icbm threats from iran5 this remains the official us position that iran could test an icbm in the last half of the next decade using russian technology and assistance emphasis in the original similar report was issued in 20016 this assessment is often interpreted that iran will have icbms by 2015 but the unclassified intelligence statements place various caveats on that potential capability these intelligence statements serve as the official us basis for assessing the iranian icbm threat to the united states and its friends and allies these assessments drive us military efforts designed to respond to such threats such as th us ballistic missile defense bmd program in general and the us proposed missile defense system in europe specifically as well as us diplomatic efforts to curb iranian longrange ballistic missile programs7 these assessments in conjunction with official us assessments of iranian nuclear weapons development contribute significantly to ongoing us concerns over iranian threats to us and international security these assessments do not mean however that there is universal agreement within the us intelligence community on the issue of an ir anian icbm according to these unclassified statements some argue that an iranian icbm test is likely before 2010 and very likely before 2015 other us officials believe however that there is less than an even chance for such test before 2015 furthermore us assessments are also conditional in that an iranian icbm capability would have to rely on access to foreig n technology from for example north korea or russia 8 finally it is argued that an iranian icbm could develop from an iranian space program under which spacelaunch vehicle program might be converted into an icbm program some have argued that iran could develop and test such space launch vehicle by 2010 some observers argue that although the us position may be based upon realistic assessment it is also worstcase analysis of the potential threat from iran they argue that with rare exception this level of threat has rarely turned out to be the historical reality 9 beyond these general us public statements bout iranian icbm developments there are few unclassified details further nonofficial public sources reflect little technical or program consensus regarding an iranian icbm program some have referred to program called the shahab6 or kosar in some instances as potential icbm development program perhaps 5 national intelligence council foreign missile developmen ts and the ballistic missile threat to the united states through 2015 september

although iran continues to declare it has plans to develop an icbm program there appears to be considerable public uncertainty and debate as to whether the shahab6 is an actual design study concept or an active or abandoned iranian icbm or even spacelaunch program and in january 2004 irans defense minister reportedly announced that iran would launch satellite within 18 months which launch did not occur statements from other iranian officials indicate they do have space launch program underway in august 2008 us defense officials said an iranian missile test aimed at putting dummy satellite into orbit failed shortly after launch

experts believe that irans shahab3 which sometimes appears also to be called the zelzal 3 ballistic missile is derivative of the north korean nodong 1 ballistic missile it has reported range of about 1000 to 1500 kilometers this could reach potential targets throughout most of the middle east some have speculated that north korea iran and pakistan entered into cooperative effort at one point to develop missile of this range and capability other observers have alleged russian assistance in iranian development of this missile some reports suggest that iran has already deployed number of mediumrange ballistic missiles mrbms of all iranian ballistic missile programs there seems to be more publicly available information in relative terms about this particular missile system than others 11 even so there remains considerable and varying differences in open sources about this system longer range versions of the shahab3 variously referred to as shahab3 variants the shahab 3a shahab3b and shahab4 and bm25 may have range capabilities of 15002500 kilometers these missiles potentially could reach targets throughout the middle east turkey and into southeastern europe some have reported that perhaps several dozen or more of these missile types may be deployed and operational some chinese north korean or russian involvement is suspected in 2006 iran announced the successful test of fajr3 mrbm comparable to the shahab3 although us and israeli intelligence analysts reportedly expressed skepticism in midjuly 2008 iran launched number of ballistic missiles and rockets of varying ranges during military exercises some observers noted the missile launches were in direct response to longrange israeli air force exercises at the time iran claimed it flight tested 2000 km version of the shahab3 that could carry 1ton warhead if accurate this missile could hit targets throughout the middle east and turkey but some analysts are skeptical of these iranian claims pending further technical analyses of these recent military exercises and others have cited iranian exaggerations of its missile capabilities in the past various major international media retracted initial images of the missile launches because they were reportedly digitally altered bush administration officials said iran did not test new technologies or capabilities but said the missile launches were evidence of the need for its proposed missile defense system in europe secretary of state rice stated the exercises were not helpful and that iran should refrain from such activities 10 see for instance shahab6

2000 kilometer range in november 2008 at the time pentagon spokesman said he could not confirm the launch occurred but that this was consistent with the fact that iran continues to develop ballistic missile program that poses threat to irans neighbors in the region and beyond other reports have also surfaced over irans development of much longer mrbm with ranges of 40005000 kilometers or even space launch vehicle derived from these efforts that some refer to as the shahab5 the degree to which this effort might be actually underway also is highly uncertain

srbms those with ranges less than 1000 kilometers in addition iran is believed to have various other srbms under development either indigenously or in varying degrees of cooperation with countries such as china north korea or russia beyond these speculations however open source materials do not reflect consensus over technical capabilities and performance additionally there appear to be considerable differences in descriptions of the numbers of systems operational or deployed and even the agreedupon names of srbms ascribed to iran some of the more commonly referred to iranian missiles are discussed briefly some believe that iran may have imported perh aps 200 chinese css8 or tondar69 srbms in the late 1980s as well as number of associated launch systems for their operational deployment 12 the css8 may have range of about 150 kilometers iran may have developed an srbm in the 1990s called the fateh a110 also apparently referred to as the mershad or zelzal2 variant according to various reports this missile may have been developed with chinese syrian and north korean involvement this missile may have range of about 200 kilometers and may have become operational around 2004 some believe that iran acquired several dozen chinese m11 or css7 srbms and associated launch vehicles in the mid1990s although china has denied this the m11 reportedly has range of around 280 kilometers 13 iran may also possess number of srbms with ranges of 200300 kilometers that it might have acquired from libya or north korea some may have been produced or modified indigenously these have variously been referred to as the scudb scudb variants or shahab1 srbms iran might also possess few hundred srbms with range of about 500700 kilometers or so these srbms have sometimes been referred to as the scudc and shahab2 analysts have expressed uncertainty over whether the iranians developed and built these missiles on their own or had help from china and north korea
