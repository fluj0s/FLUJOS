cbe tour those that want to go ahead with the tour do so with the unde rstanding that you have to rasise the money dont strain work from the subtle levels itll be the consciousness of the area that

dont push ill take some questions about the new finance situation ray could we have some of raja rogers bobby roth said we should focus on smaller schools charter schools dont drop the public schools we started charter school in charlotte but can not teach tm ray could we have some of the directors on the course cull some of the names of people from schools from the internet raja rogers dont spend lot of time on the public schools we cant enter the tour expenses into netsuite dori invite our meditators and have them pay for little more for their lunch to cover the nonmeditators who are invited raja rogers yes that could very well work if you are postponing your tour notify the hotel right away the donor s i have talked to have been diverted off into other areas ray i have an mec that doesnt cost the movement anything im in the black since may 2005 what category am i in raja rogers if you are in the black then we have the option of continuing with the existing program or electing to go with one of the other programs existing program means if you are in the black you can continue to draw salary and you can continue to enter some expenses into netsuite im suspecting everythings going to come down to the 2 categories independent contractor 30 of your gross income 10000 income you get 3000 you have ability to enter expenses into netsuite you pay your own expenses b you have an mec directors at the center 25 of the income but you can enter expenses in netsuite but they are reviewed by the raja and dr feldmans office ray if you are on the existing program you cant enter anything for the cbe tour raja rogers we need return on investment now those expenses will be very high and the rate of return may give us return over long term period if you do enter it and dont get good return then your ability to enter bills may be eliminated jane can the raja in that domain look at his stats and see what the rate of return was for the tour raja rogers ill try to call raja kingsley you can also call chris busch ruth independent contractor option can we then claim those expenses on our taxes advantages can write off your home expenses mortgage if you work in your home elaine you should get 1099 and mved should not withhold any taxes so you can claim expenses on your taxes jeff can person go back to black can an independent contractor make more than 4000 raja rogers i dont think so but will check they figured it for the last 15 months category b people the most you can make is 4000 category people 4000 also dori if on the old system what happens if you make lots of one month and 0 next month raja rogers will check on how they handle this jeff l i have contract on an office space does this put into category b raja rogers will check jeff l maharishi said we should not be teaching in our homes but in dignified office and that is why i rented that susan m weve tried to share expenses but it doesnt always come out evenly jeff put in more than for example raja rogers regardless of that i think you all are in the red susan m as we move forward would be still be separate raja rogers yes if you are indep contractors its simple or if in group b you pay 500 and he pays 500 susan can we split the income raja rogers elaine in present system of netsuite you cant split expenses unless the vendor bills each center separately cant split course fees except for wpa course fees you can use the other wpa course fee category would international be willing to open up the categories of expenses that directors can raise money for right now it is just land things for mec and cbe tour raja rogers send an email and i will check on this dori i feel pull to go on the course but feel the need to do things here which is more evolutionary raja rogers ill give maharishi answer both if you have gap in activities then go to the course for week or 10 days but dont leave in the middle of big project like land purchase jeff l doris land is very nice looking for land is not revenue generating activity we are being given an incentive to ignore looking for land in favor of generating activity raja rogers that seems to be the direction unless you are working on land project now revenue revenue revenue you can have meditators keep their eyes open for land everything ebbs and flows right now the idea is to balance the books alcine some public schools have magnet schools that are generally more openminded and thus more approachable i was just invited to speak to magnet school who are interested in tm raja rogers i will write dr hagelin about this jane shall we start ranking system for your emails 3 urgent 2 not so urgent 1 when you have time raja rogers yes that would be helpful merin just got back from dc course it was so blissful the program was so wonde rful we had 9 people from boone there may have large cic here when vedic experts come would their foodtravel expenses be covered elaine if you are in category then you need to cover their foodtravel if in category b then you may enter the expenses raja rogers i will doubl echeck this as i think i saw an email on it elaine news about raos maharishi wants dr rao and lakshmi to focus on know ledge programs ats and cic maharishi wants people to have deeper experiences they will do mvvts when in city for either ats or cic but will not travel to center just for mvvt need 5 ats for them to schedule tour they longe r offer the tmsidhi refresher course or tmsidhiat consultations tony newest at can do anytime elaine option to do anytime charlie check with course office to verify jeff m domain pays the raos expenses while resting in lex raja rogers yes alcine sorry missed this last point from alcine
