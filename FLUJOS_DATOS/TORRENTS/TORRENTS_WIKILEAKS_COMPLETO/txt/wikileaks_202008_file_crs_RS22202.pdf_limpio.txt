the restoration of state authority and the rehabilitation of state in stitutions according to s2005177 and other reports revenue customs immigration and local officials are gradually being deployed to localities outside monrovia but this process as well as the efficacy of central government ministries is hampered by wi despread resource constraints and lack of institutional and financial system capacities and trained manpowerhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22202crs4 2 irin news liberia world bank says toug her action needed to tackle corruption feb 21 2005among the most challenging issues facing current governance capacitybuilding efforts are continuing reports of corruption within the ntgl in some cases on large scale notably in the context of importexport transactions government contracts and the issuance of commodity marketing or cession rights the secretarygeneral reported in midmarch 2005 that there is lack of ntgl transparency in the collection and use of revenues and the resistance of some government nd public corporation officials to reforms and audits aimed at fighting corruption s2005177 the world bank and other bilateral donors have made similar obs ervations and called for transparency measures2 experts and donor governments have questioned the propriety of recent monopsony diamond c oncession deal with previously unknown firm some observers also question the ntgls award of offshore oil exploration permits to three relatively obscure firms just prior to elections and the ntgl expenditures on travel and vehicle for officials have drawn criticism from several quarters the ntgl has taken some steps to halt corr upt practices it established task force on corruption and cash management committee it has attempted to eliminate bribe taking in relation to commodity imports not ably by better managi ng monrovias port of which unmil took control in late april 2005 in addition the ntla created committee to investigate allegations of administrative and financial irregularities by its leadership which eventually led to the removal of key ntla leaders some observers however see the ntgl task force as lacking the capacity or political will to achieve significant results and there appears to be resistance among some liberian officials to donor and ecowasbacked transparency and audit m easures recent african development bank loan was reportedly not disbursed because libe ria failed to provide required fiscal data and an ecowassponsored auditing mission wa s opposed by liberian auditors and certain government officials who cited concern over viola tion of liberian sovereignty despite the publiclystated s upport of chairman bryant for the audit in july 2005 chairman bryant suspended two officials over th eir alleged diversion of funds paid by the satellite communications firm inmarsat to several liberian state entities set of proposals dubbed the liberia ec onomic governance action plan is under consideration by donor govern ments and the ntgl it woul d provide for contractbased management of the revenue and expenditure flows of key public sector entities notably the main port airport and fuel refining firm among others in order to strictly enforce centralized liberian government controls over state revenues it would also support diverse transparency and judicial capacitybuilding measures the ntgl reportedly rejects elements of the plan that would mandate an external management role on sovereignty grounds but would support capacity building assistance donors however including the united states reportedly w ill require strict conditionality over future assistance to liberia the united states has deployed severa l treasury department advisors to liberia in the areas of budget and tax policy manageme nt and administration central bank operations and fiscal policy nd regulation and s assessed liberias financial enforcement financial crime and corruption capacity the united states is reportedly pursuing talks with the international fi nancial institutions and other donors to examine ways to condition international assistance to liberia on its acceptance of compulsory management and uditing contracts these might cover state revenue receipthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22202crs5 and expenditure functions both within the executive branch and in specialized agencies notably those that administer importex port and customs functions at ports and airports and those that help regulate the marketing of key commodities such as fuel and rice concerns over transparency are widely seen as underpinning sometimes halting and conditional provision to liberia by donors of commitments of pledged aid as well the reticence of some to offer new commitments to fund unmet needs this has negatively affected the scale and pace of resettle ment reintegrati on and socioeconomic rehabilitation nonetheless network of national intern ational and private development and relief organiza tions has made considerable progress in these areas most of them participate in an intersectoral uncoordinated initiative the resultsfocused transitional framework rftf an apr il 2005 ntglunworld bank assessment of the rftf found that it has been effective in addressing shor tterm stabilization priorities but that medium to longterm posttransition institutional and reconstruction development will require more robust coherent nd comprehensive strategy charles taylor the future status of charles taylor an indictee of the special court for sierra leone scsl for his allege d involvement in war cr imes in sierra leone remains in question the scsl would like nigeri where taylor is in exile to transfer him to scsl custody when nigeria provided him with refuge however it stated that it was doing so to aid the liberian peace pro cess and would not countenance later pressure to extradite taylor nigeria also however required him to disengage from liberian politics either directly or through proxies taylor has reportedly extensively broken these conditions many human rights groups therefor assert that nigeria has good reason to surrender him and that his continued asyl um perpetuates culture of impunity for human rights abusers in africa others argue that taylors asylum in nigeria granted after considerable us and international pressure remains the best way to ensure continued stability in liberia us relations with the scsl have b een mixed while it has received 22 million in us funding some state department official s have questioned the advisability of actions taken by scsl prosecutor david crane incl uding his unsealing of an indictment against taylor during peace talks in june 2003 nd the accuracy of his claim that taylor sponsored the january 2005 attempted assassina tion of president lasana contÃ© of guinea such skepticism may in part explain th scsls failure to obtain authority under chapter 7 of the charter which woul d oblige member state cooperation with the scsl related question is whether unmil should be empowered to arrest taylor if he returns to liberia the united st ates will reportedly s upport security council resolution providing such authority to unmil on may 5 2005 presidents bush and obasanjo met and discussed the status of taylor among other issues prior to the meeting white house spokesman scott mccl ellan called for taylor to be held to account for the crimes he has committed and stated that th united states and nigeria are engaged in the question of how to addr ess the matterwhite house press briefing may 5 2005 he also expressed appreciation to nigeria for fac ilitating taylors departure from liberia in 2003 which he said had he lped bring peace in liberia he did not describe what such engagement entails his remarks closely mirrored state department statements on the issue during the past two yearshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22202crs6 congressional focus congress has shown considerable interest in the status of charles taylor and has genera lly with few notable exceptions shown strong support for the scsl it passed laws pl 108199 and pl 108106 urging that scsl indictees like taylor be transferred to the scsl and in may 2005 the house and senate passed hconres 127 royce it urges the same outco congress also provided substantial support for liberias rebuilding and peace buildin g processes levels of us assistance for this
