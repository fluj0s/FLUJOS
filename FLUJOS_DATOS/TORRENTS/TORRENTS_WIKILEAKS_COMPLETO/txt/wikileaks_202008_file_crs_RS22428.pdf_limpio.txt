surveys usgs mean estimate of technically recoverable oil from the fields on th is federal land is 77 billion or more barrels and reflecting recent technological advances and price tr ends usgs estimates that there is 5 chance there are 107 billion or more barrels of economically recoverable oil at 55 pe r barrel in 2003 dollars1 despite attempts by the administration and congressional leaders the first session of the 109th congress did not open the socalled 10 02 area of the refuge to oil and gas drilling2 however the administration has agai n assumed leasing of anwr by including

gas development on federal public domain lands 6 normally leasing would also have to be com patible with the major purposes of the national wildlife refuge system and with the purposes of the particular system unit congress could override the compatibility test if it wished deve lopment to occur as expeditiously as possibleresolution passed by the sena on march 16 2006 contains reconciliation instruction that directs the committee on energy and na tural resources to reduce budget authority by an amount equal to predicted revenues from anwr it was reported that senators hoped that such reconciliation bill might attract enough bipartisan house support to offset opposition by the 24 members who opposed its inclusion in larger reconciliation measure in the first session4 the house budget committee did not include such an instruction in its budget resolution on march 29 2006 leasing procedure variety of statutes and agency regulations govern leasing and permitting for oil and gas development on federal lands5 this summary focuses on those parts of the procedures that are most relevant to the estimation of lease revenues the leasing of federal lands usually is carried out under the mineral leasing act of 1920 mla by the department of the interiors bureau of land management blm for mla leasing blm determines based on data from federal agencies and oil company submissions how much and what specific lands will be offered and normally offers leases on competitive basis blm solicits bids on the tracts and selects the winning companies if not set in the legislation blm may use nominations submitted by companies and other information to determine what and how much land to offer and in what tract sizes blm usually leases in stages rather than offering the entire area for bidding at once discoveries and newly acquired geologic information deter mine the tracts for subsequent offerings as exploration and development pr ogress smaller fields may become attractive if and when infrastructure is in place blm or congress also may specify terms or conditions applying to partic ular tracts these conditions might include in the case of anwr limits on surface occupancy size of footprints seasonal availability to exploration wildlife protection measures reclamation standards and the like such terms and conditions might not necessarily apply to native lands sometimes the legislation that authorizes leasing specifies terms nd conditions including conditions applying to final approval to lease such provisions could affect the co st of operating the lease and therefore the amount company might be willing to bid6 once the sale tracts have been named furt her exploration might occur congress might specify whether additional exploration could occur before minations were due given the seasonality of arctic exploration this choice coul d lengthen the time required to make first lease offering leasing phase may overlap with an exploration phase both of these phases might be shortened by reducing envir onmental review requirements and seasonal restrictions there is limit to how much the process could be truncatedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22428crs3 7 as result if anwr turns out to have comme rcial oil deposits it might still earn the federal government millions of dollars 8 see crs report rl31115 legal issues related to proposed drilling for oil and gas in the arctic national wildlife refuge anwrmoreover current technology limits arctic exploration to the winter season since blm would wish to consider industrys views in lecting the tracts to be offered views that take time and more expl oration to develop this too c ould lengthen the leasing process leases under the mla normally are for 10 ears and continue as long afterwards as oil and gas is produced commercially cong ress could choose any length for the anwr leases however competition for leases among companies is based on the size of their upfront offer or the bonus bid which is required to be at least 2 per acre but can total many millions of dollars for some tracts payment of the bid occurs before the winning bidder can be certain that oil is present7 in typical mla lease successful bidder must pay 150 per acre in rent for its tracts in the first five years and 200acre thereafter the first years rental payment plus th minimum bonus bid and 75 administrative fee is due on the date of the sale the remainder of the bonus bi d must be received within 10 work days subsequent rental payments are due on the anniversary date of the lease once production starts companies pa standard 125 royalty on the sale of the oil they produce lessees may voluntarily surrender the lease subject to re quirements concerning abandonment of wells clean up and an payments that may be owed while the language in the alaska stat ehood act pl 85508 means that alaska is to be treated like other states for fede ral leasing conducted under the mla which indicates 90 10 split congress arguably has flexibility to legislate oil and gas leasing in the refuge including different disposition of revenues from such leasing it is expected that alaska would receive 50 of anwr leasing revenues8 how lease revenues are estimated estimates of bonus bid revenue s essentially stem from the process that oil companies go through when evaluating the prospects of nds that are anticipated to be leased for anwr only very limited and indirect geologic data are available in addition to the overall usgs assessment cited in footnote 1 ordi narily each company has data obtained from exploration and then bids on the most promising areas based upon its own resource assessment expectations of future price trends operating costs projections financial return criteria and assessments of alternative prospects elsewhere in the world companies essentially estimate their likely return on capital invested over as much as 3040year period in submitting nominations to blm on what tracts to offer company normally nominates more land than the areas it believes most promising in order to conceal its intentions and avoid excessive attention by possible competitors on what it believes are the best prospects in turn estimates of revenues from bonus bids constitute an attempt by interested government agencies to gauge the value of the leases to the winning bidders such estimates unavoidably are uncertain because timators not employed by the companies do not have access to the firms information and analytical paradigms and because firms can greatly differ in their assessment of the geologic prospects future market conditionshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22428crs4 and the financial and strategic value of the prospects noncompany estimators therefore use generic information such as resource assessments by the us geological survey published and selfgenerated oil price projecti ons bids on past lease sales in nearby or comparable geographic areas and indications of the extent of industry interest in the area as may be obtained through intelligence andor observed from industry investment trends for budgeting purposes government agencies also estimate the revenues they expect to receive from rental payments by the comp anies that win the leases and ultimately the revenues from royalty payments if commercial qua ntities of oil andor gas are produced and sold aggregate rental payments us ually are much smaller than lease bonuses published lease revenue estimates estimates of leasing revenues

holtzeakin director cbo letter of march 14 2005 to senator russell d feingold and 10 other senators p2 blm prepared the lease sale revenue estima tes for the administration it assumed that there will be lease sales in fiscal years 2008 and 2010 that will yield winning gross bonus bids of 7 billion and 1 billion respectively in those years table 1 annual rentals of those leases would yield 4 million in fy2008 and fy2009 and 6 million in fy2010 and fy20119 blms estimate of aggregate winning bonus bids was obtained by running an economic analysis under projected market conditions of its

final adjustments were made based on bidding patterns in nearby north slope oil and gas lease sales assumptions regarding infrast ructure or transpor tation were made10 in its analysis of the administrations budgetary proposals for fy2007 the congressional budget office anticipates that anwr lease sales will occur in fy2009 and fy2011 and estimates that those sales will yield aggregate

estimate of aggregate wi nning bonus bids is based on usgs projections of the mean volume of economically recoverable il that could be produced from federal land in anwr12 and on information from other federal agencies the state of alaska and private sources about oil and gas companies perceptions of key factors that affect the expected profitability of anwr leases in particular companies probable assumptions about longterm oil prices and required rates of return on such investments13 cbo projected potential cash flows based on altern ative assumptions regarding oil prices production patterns costs and ra tes of return for developing those reserves it included infrastructure in capital costs and projection of transportation costs14 both blms and cbos lease revenue estimates reflect the increase in crude oil prices through 2005 and both blm and cb assume that anwr production would not begin until after 2016 and that lease reve nues would be split 5050 with alaskahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22428crs6 15 richard fineberg updated economic estimates of effects of leasi ng on the arctic national wildlife refuge coastal plain february 9 2006 rev 21906 richard fineberg response to cbo march 14 2005 letter arctic refuge lease bonus numbers 16 march 14 2005 letter to senator feingold p 3 17 richard fineberg do cuments previously citedcrs has not located any anwr lease revenue estimates by other government agencies or by any private entity however one analyst has sounded cautionary note about estimating procedures15 probing the lease revenue estimates thus with somewhat different estimating procedures the estimates of lease and rental revenues by the two government agenci differ in at least two respects the difference in results conforms to what might be expected from the differences in estimating procedure for example cbo included infrastructure and transportation in its cost estimates whereas blm did not and blm s bonus bid revenue timate is one third greater than cbos it would be expected that higher projected costs would diminish projected rates of return and reduce bid amounts other things being equal second blms assumption that the lease sale s would occur year earlier than cbos assumption also may explain part of blms higher revenue estimate bids may be lower in fy2009 than in fy2008 reflecting projected decline in oil prices from present levels cbos later start of the rental income stream stems from the later date of its assumed lease sales reflecting the belief that winning bid amounts in past lease sales of lands in alaskas north slope should be considered blm us ed the levels of winning bonus bids in comparable sales from npra as factor that would affect the amounts bid on anwr tracts in contrast cbo assuming it has not changed previously stated approach does not consider average amounts paid per acre as useful metric for predicting bonus bids and it related lease bid amounts mo re directly to inferred long term oil prices and usgss quantitative assessment of oil resources in the refuge16 inasmuch as recent npra lease sales have generated only relatively modest revenues this methodological difference by itself would be expected to result in blm ss bonus bid estimate be ing lower rather than higher than cbos thus the counterintu itive results of the difference in blms and cbos estimating procedure apparently was more than offset by the effects of other elements of the agenci respective estimating methods so of those elements in the estimating procedures of both blm and cb entail nonquantitative human judgement reference to past lease bidding levels is key consideration of richard fineberg of research associates who has commented on the latest and several recent blm and cbo lease revenue estimates according to fineberg both blms and cbos bid revenue estimates are much too high he argues that prospects for large discoveries in anwr have diminished and analyzed recent winning bonus bid levels in other areas of alaska which show such trends the implie d bid per acre underlying blms and cbos estimates is many times the average winning bid per acre in those sales he says even when converting the revenues from past lease sales to 2006 dollars17
