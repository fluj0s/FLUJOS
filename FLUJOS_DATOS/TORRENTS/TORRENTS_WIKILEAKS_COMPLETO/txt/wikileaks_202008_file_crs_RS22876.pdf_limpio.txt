of the socalled reddead canal joint arabisraeli project designed to save the shrinking d ead sea using water from the red sea1 the canal has been in the works for decades and is controve rsial the israeli and jordanian governments are its staunch advocates asserting that the onl way to restore the dead seas water level is to construct 112mile pipeline to transfer water north ward from the red sea officials claim that this water while descending 1870 feet on its jour ney to the dead sea would generate enough hydroelectric ity to power desalination plan ts for producing fresh water this water could then be delivered to cities in israel jordan and parts of the west bankhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22876crs2 2 the 1955 johnston plan called for arabisraeli c ooperation in sharing the jordan river though most arab states rejected the uss ponsored plan jordan and israel adhered to its suggested allocations for decades in the 1990s th united states helped establish the multilateral working group on water resources which led to the founding of the middle east desalination research center in muscat oman in december 1996the canals arab and israeli supporters belie ve that the proposal is not only creative solution to an environmental challenge but potential model for arabisraeli cooperation opponents of the canal charge that israel and jordan are exaggerating its political symbolism in order to generate the needed 5 billion dollars or more in international financing for what is in essence desalination and hydroelectricity project with potentially serious environmental drawbacks as an alternative environmental and peace activists have called on regional g overnments and the international community to push for comprehensive settlement to the arab israeli conflict that would include water sharing agreements and the restoration of the jordan river and dead sea scientists assert that the reddead canal could potentially harm the dead sea further by changing its unique chemistry through the introduction of red sea water and is too expensive to justify the costs of construction moreover there is some concern that without an israelipalestinian settlement that addresses the dead sea border and water rights israel and jordan which concluded bilateral peace treaty in 1994 w ill disproportionately benefit from the canal at the expense of the palestinians the united states government has at times played key role in fostering cooperation on arabisr aeli water issues2 the bush administration has donated small sum 15 million to facilitate the worl d banks feasibility study however us administration has officially endorsed the proj ect if the current st udy supports the canals construction israel and jordan will most likely seek significant us pledge and appropriation from congress to ssist in financing the canal due to the slow progress in reviewing the canals constructi on some believe it may take as long as 20 years to build few us policymakers have addressed the issue in n ovember 2007 senator richard lugar sponsored sres387 passed by th senate november 16 2007 which among other things called for more international attention to the serious and potentially irreversible degradation of the jordan river and the dead sea the reddead canalhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22876crs3 3 like the dead sea the jordan river is under vere ecological strain in addition to having its waters diverted the river absorbs large amount s of raw sewage flowing untreated from east jerusalem israeli settlements in the west bank and c ities under the control of the palestinian authority political deadlock and ongoing violence have prevented israelis and palestinians from finalizing water management agreements tentatively reached during the oslo peace process 4 in testimony before the house international relations committee dr ihab barghothi advisor to the palestinian water authority stated that as result of water diversion of the upper jordan river tributaries by the israelis there is fresh water down stream of lake tiberias and the negligible quantity that reaches the palestinian riparian in the west bank is of deteriorated quality testimony of

lowest elevation on earth is slowly vanishing due to gradual water loss the sea has split into two separate lakes nd its coastline has receded significantly for years israeli and arab governments have diverted for agricultura l and industrial purposes up to 95 of the southward flow of the jordan river wh ich naturally replenishes the dead sea3 israel diverts an estimated 60 of the river while syria and jordan divert the rest the palestinian authority has demanded that it receive fair share of the rivers flow4 in the last 55 years the dead sea has lost 33 of its surface area scientists estimate that the water level of the salt lake drops approximately three feet per year israeli scientists estimate that even though the evaporation of the dead sea may slow in the coming decades it may lose another 33 of its surface area observers are concerned that its disappearance will have severe ecological nd economic repercussi ons and will deprive future generations of hist orical and religious

the dead sea theoretically enough red sea wate r flowing into the dead sea could restore most of its water level over time moreover hydroelectricity generated from the water coursing down the gradient

called for national undertaking to link the d ead sea to either the mediterranean med dead or red sea reddead via canal it was not until the peace process of the early 1990s that the reddead canal evolved fro m purely national israeli project to multilateral one associated w ith arabisraeli cooperation5 during the energy crisis of the early 1970s the israeli government began to pursue the construction of meddead canal seriously in order to genera hydroelectricity and end the countrys dependence on oil it commissioned several feasibility studies nd in one instance actually broke ground for the canals construction financ ial constraints eventually lted the project in 1985 cost estimates then ranged between 2 billion and 5 billion in addition jordan objected to meddead canal claiming that if built it w ould illegally traverse the previously israeli occupied gaza strip and harm jordans potash mining industry in the dead sea6 the optimism that accompanied the arabi sraeli peace pr ocess of the early 1990s helped bring about new canal proposal one that linked the interests of israel and jordan its champion was and still is former prime minister and current israeli president shimon peres in his book the new middle east peres wrote that politically this earthshaking enterprise can help maintain peace and establish mutual long term interests this benefits not onl the nations of the middle east but those outside the region i believe it will be built the water will flow along the arava the power stations will give light and the wasteland will bloom with life the region will experience peace serenity and progress people from other countries will use the sea port and airport visit the spas and vacation centers and enjoy the products of our flourishing desert7 though peres has been praised for his positiv vision other observers perceive the red dead canal as having tangible benefits for israel and jordan that transcend more abstract notions of regional

canal also could help restore the dead seas water levels task that neither israel nor jordan could undertake unilaterally fo r both political and financial reasons many experts assert that by marketing it as an ssential component of the peace process israel and jordan are able to solicit international financing for the multibillion dollar project according to roni milo former israeli min ister for regional coope ration jordan is the key to obtaining support from the world bank if the pipeline were situated on the israeli side we would not be able to get this financing8 upon concluding peace treaty in 1994 jordan and israel pledged to rehabilitate the jordan valley region and since then plans to construct the reddead canal steadily moved forward in 2002 at the world summit on sustainable development in johannesburg south africa jordanian offi cial proclaimed that the announcement of the canal proposal sent message that we do liv in one area with common destiny the environment ecology and nature know boundaries and political conflicts however other arab countries and the pa lestinians expressed their opposition to the announcement made at the height of the second palestinian intifadah uprising palestinian representative at the conference cl aimed that the project involves drawing new border between israel and jordan at the expense of the palestinian people9 israeli palestinian violence continued to hamper efforts to advance the canal for the next three years after the death of palestinian presid ent yasir arafat in november 2004 the process regained momentum at the may 2005 world economic forum held on the jordanian side of the dead sea israel jordan the palestinian authority p and the world bank announced that the beneficiary parties d agreed to launch twoyear 15 million feasibility study for the reddead canal af ter the 2006 hamas victory in pa elections the process stalled again as israel insisted that palestinian moderates rather than hamas members sit on the tripartite committee overs eeing the project as of early 2008 the world bank is steadily moving the feasibility study process forward it established multidonor trust fund for the study the united states contributed 15 million to the fund other donors include france spain greece japan netherlands sweden spain britain and germany environmental concerns israeli and arab environmentalists argue that rather than undertake complex and expensive engi neering project the regions governments should stop diverting the jordan river and llow the dead sea to replenish naturally10 however there is consensus even among st the canals opponents as to how countries could use less water amidst ri sing demand or find new sour ces of freshwater moreover some scientists believe that mixing water from the two seas would lead to algae blooms causing the dead sea to both change color from turquoise to brown and lose its famous buoyancy11 if this were to occur it could

project will lead to regional nd economic cooperation with our jordanian colleagues in the areas of energy water and agriculture regional development is an important step in promoting the political process12 the canals israeli project manager erez ron has argued that the canal may further integrate israel and jordan economically stating we are not maximizing the potential that can be obtained from the 1994 israel jordan peace treaty look how long border we have with them and how little is happening but the moment you create shared economic interests they will have to continue running with it its completely political project13 some critics believe that the projects peace dividend has been oversold gideon bromberg head of friends of the earth ddle east stated that there was tremendous pressure on the world bank to support the re ddead canal because its the only joint project between jordan and israel to come out of the palestinian intifada 14 uri wirtzberger who headed company to velop the canal two decades ago said the project may make shimon peres close friend of king abdallah ii but thats its only virtue finally other peace activists claim that the canal avoids the larger issues of managing transboundary water sources accord ing to one observer the world bank and its sponsors have intention of actually fo rcing regional actors to address their own responsibility in the water shortage as this would present very awkward questions for the wests regional allies why for example is the average israeli able to consume four times as much water per capita as the average palestinian15 despite the vocal opposition to the reddead canal many analysts believe that barring final settlement to the arab israeli conflict action is urgently needed to restore the dead sea and address other water issues particularly as climate change may threaten further environmental degradation and water supply reliability some ex perts note that even if the canal is never built it has already brought israel and jordan closer on issues related to water conservation and environmental restoration whet her governments go even furt her in addressing regional water shortages and the deterioration of the dead sea depends on political will external support and the ability to withstand politi cal pressures emanating from the expected continuation of israelipalestinian conflict
