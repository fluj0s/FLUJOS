equivalent of 138 trillion barrels of oil equivalent in place the shale is generally acknowledged as ri ch potential resource however it has not generally proved to be econo mically recoverable thus it is considered to be contingent resource and not true reserve also the finished products that can be produced from oil shale are limited in range to primarily diesel and jet fuel earlier attempts to develop oil shale under the 1970s era department of energy doe synthetic fuels program and the later synthetic fuels corporation loan guarantees ended after the rapid decline of oil prices and development of new oil fields outside the middle east improvements taking pl ace at the time in conventional refining enabled increased production of transporta tion fuels over heavy heating oils which were being phased out in favor of natural gas rising oil prices and concerns over declining petroleum production worldwide revived united states interest in oil shal after twodecade hiatus in addition to technological challenges left unsolve d from previous development efforts environmental issues remained and new issues have emerged estimates of the ultimately recoverable resource also vary challenges to development also include competition with conve ntional petroleum pr oduction in the midc ontinent region and increasing petroleum imports from canada the regions isolation from major refining centers in the gulf coast may leave production stranded if pipeline capacity is not increased the energy policy act of 2005 epact id entified oil shale as strategically important domestic resource among others and directed the department of the interior to promote comme rcial development since then the bureau of land management blm has awarde d six test leases for oil research development and demonstration rdd the ongoing program will confirm whether an economically significant shale oil volume can be extr acted under current operating conditions if so early commercial development may direc tly proceed blm has published final programmatic environmental impact statem ent peis in which approximately two million acres of oil shale lands out of approximately 354 million acres total are identified as potentially available for commercial leasing draft rules for commercial leases have also been issued and final rule making is proceeding the lease and royalties rates proposed in the draft rules ppear to compare with rates charged for similar resources but provide unique incentive for producing oil shale in previous report crs framed oil shal in the perspective of national energy security and reviewed the circumstances under which policies first promoted and then ended support for earlier oil shale devel opment this second report takes up the progress toward

mountain region should be opened for commercial development1 those concerned over rep eating past mistakes and compromising the environment however have urged caution and deliberation in proceeding earlier attempts to deve lop oil shale had received direct funding support under the 1970s era department of energy doe synthetic fuels synfuels program and the later synthetic fuels corporation loan guarantee program private sector interest in oil shale all but ended after the rapid d ecline of oil prices and the development of new oil fields outside the middle east in the early 1980s federal

transportation fuel the re siduum figuratively the bottom of the petroleum barrel had been processed into lowvalue heavy heating oil which was being replaced by cleaner burning and increasingly available natural gas then as now oil shale was considered strategic resource however its strategic value more recently had been tied to producing defense related jet fuel whic h now appears to be an uncertain prospect oil shale shows be tter potential as resource for commercial transportation fuels jet and diesel ho wever it faces regional competition from conventional petroleu m resources and

further information see crs report rl33359 oil shale history incentives and policy challenges to development oil shale has long been proposed as s ource of synthetic or substitute crude oil however the organic content kerogen of oil shale is only petroleum precursor the extracted oil lacks the lower boilingrange hydrocarbons that make up natural gasoline and the heavier hydrocarbons that refineries crack to make gasoline it does yield hydrocarbons in the middledistillate fuels boiling range naphtha kerosene jet fuel and diesel fuel thus it may face challenges as substitute for conventional crude oil it may also face competition from conventional petr oleum resources under development in the rocky mountain regi on and canadian exports to the region oil shale production continues to face unique technological challenges the kerogen occurs in the shale as solid and is not free to flow like crude petroleum the shale must be heated or retortedto extract petroleumlike distillates retorting oil shale involves destructive distillation pyrolysis in the absence of oxygen pyrolysis at temperatures above 900 f is needed to thermally break down the kerogen to release the hydrocarbons two basic retorting processes have been used aboveground retorting and in situ underground retorting the boveg round retort is typically large cylindrical vessel based on rotary kiln ovens used in cement manufacturing and now used by canadas oil sands industry10 the in situ process involves mining an underground chamber that functions as retort both concepts were evaluated under the form er doe synfuels program both in situ and aboveground retortin g processes have been plagued with technical and environmental problems plentiful water supply is considered necessary for aboveground retorting aboveground retorting also depends on underground or openpit mining to excavate th shale while either mining method is wellpracticed the expended shale that remains after retorting would present disposal problem in the case of open pit mining overburden rock had to be removed and set aside to expose the shale aboveground retorts also faced frequent problems from cakedup shale which led th em to shut down frequently apart from the problem of sustaining controlled co mbustion underground in situ retorting also caused groundwater contamination11 new approaches aim to avoid the past drawbacks associated with in situ extraction methods by adapting enhanced oil recovery methods such as horizontal drilling long term heating and freezewa ll technology

extract and has not competed well with conventional oil supplies in the past the major barrier has been cost but additional barriers are potential environmental damage during development and the cost of refining and transportation from th interior western united states the recent spike in crude oil price has once again stirred interest in oil shale as in the past however the rapid runup in prices to high of 145barrel was soon followed by rapid and precipitous drop in prices 64barrel at the time of this writing although the major oil companies have reaped record profits such price volatility discourages investment in contingent resources such as oil shale oil price volatility has produced patterns of boom and bust for oil shale as seen in the interest in oil shale development in the early 1980s followed by the cancellation of exxons 5 billion colony oil shale project in 1982 and the cancellation of loan guarantees under the synthetic fuels corporation volatility in the price of oil affects ll contingent or marginal hydrocarbon resources after considerable investme nt in unconventional oil sand resources canadian producers have announced cutback s in capital spending and are scaling back or cancelling plans for expansion altogether while opec cuts oil output to prop up prices the major and supermajor oil companies continue to use an oil price of 32barrel for their business planning in this climate the development of oil shale seems difficult indeed while oil shale development faces continuoushttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34748crs30 challenges the exploration and production of conventiona l oil and gas grows steadily in the region the regional isolation of the massive oil shale deposits of western colorado eastern utah and southwestern wyomin g provides both opportunity and challenges for developing shale oil there shale oil is best used to produce middle distillate diesel and jet fuel commodities in high demand in the region additionally the oil and product pipeline infrastructure into nd out of the region is limited so moving shale oil to another region for refining is difficult and impor ting refined product is equally difficult this isolation provide s an opportunity for shale oil as long as regional refining capacity is available an additional point of uncertainty is introduced by the governments changes in rules recent spending moratorium on finalization of the commercial leasing rules had added considerable uncertainty to oil shale development without final rule developer could attract investors or plan for full development of the oil shale resources the subsequent re scission of the spending mo ratorium now allows final rule making to be comple ted before the 111th congress convenes in the meantime much of the land surface that might be leased for oil shale development has already been leased for conventional oil and gas development adding further complication to the leasing process the oil shale boombust cycles are part of the cause of and also the result of an exodus of skilled labor and technical talent from the rocky mountain region whole communities grew up around the oil shale development of the 1980s only to disappear again when the projects stopped the uncertainty surrounding the viability of oil shale development combined with competition from the conventional oil and gas industry and from other regions makes it difficult to recruit and keep skilled labor for oil shale development finally the draft leasing rules are silent on co2 emission requirements and yet oil shale development may be accomp anied by troublesome emission of co2 as result of the retorting process full analysis of co2 emissions from oil shale development must wait until the research and development phase of shale oil production is completed such an anal ysis would probably be part of the environmental impact statement required for permitting commercial development canadas oil sands industr has demonstrated that emission concerns may be addressed over time as technology develops oil shale along with other unconventiona l and alternative energy sources will continue to struggle as long as oil prices are volatile sustained high oil prices will likely be required to motivate oil shale developers to make the massive investments required for ongoing production of oil from shale although the quantities of hydrocarbons held in oil shale is stagge ring its developmen t remains uncertain
