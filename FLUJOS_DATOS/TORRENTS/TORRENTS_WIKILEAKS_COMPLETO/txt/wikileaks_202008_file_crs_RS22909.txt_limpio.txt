individuals legislative activity in the 110th congress steven maguire specialist in public finance government and finance division jennifer teefy information research specialist knowledge services group httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22909 summary the alternative minimum tax amt for individuals was originally enacted to ensure that all taxpayers especially highincome taxpayers pay at least minimum amount of federal taxes however the amt is not indexed for inflation and this factor combined with recent reductions in the regular income tax has greatly expanded the potential impact of the amt temporary provisions intended to mitigate the effects of the amt expired at the end of 2006 and congress worked throughout 2007 to enact an amt patch the patch for the 2007 tax year as provided for in the tax increase prevention act of 2007 pl 110166 enacted on december 26 2007 set the amt exemption levels for 2007 at 66250 for joint filers and 44350 for single filers the amt exemption amounts for the 2008 tax year would have been 45000 for joint filers and 33750 for single filers without patch on october 3 2008 the house approved and the president signed hr 1424 the emergency economic stabilization act of 2008 pl 110343 which patched the amt for 2008 without an offset the act increases the amt exemption amount to 69950 for joint filers and 46200 for individuals this report will be updated as legislative action warrants introduction in 1969 after number of highvisibility television magazine and news stories about relatively small number of extremely wealthy individuals who paid virtually income taxes the alternative minimum tax amt for individuals was enacted to ensure crs2 that all taxpayers pay at least minimum amount of federal taxes1 it was designed so that individuals could not take unfair advantage of the various preferences and incentives under the regular income tax to substantially reduce their regular income tax liability below what was considered appropriate for their income level the amt functions as parallel tax system to the regular income tax taxpayers calculate their regular income tax and then calculate their amt if their amt liability is larger than their regular income tax liability then they pay the amt there is projected to be significant increase in the number of middle to uppermiddleincome taxpayers affected by the amt in the near future in 2006 about 42 million taxpayers were subject to the amt if not for the patch provided in pl 110166 enacted on december 26 2007 up to 23 million taxpayers would have been subject to the amt in 20072 for the 2008 tax year 257 million taxpayers would have been affected by the amt if not for the patch in pl 1103433 there are two main reasons for an increase in the number of taxpayers affected by the amt first the regular income tax is indexed for inflation but the amt is not over time this has reduced the differences between regular income tax liabilities and amt httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22909 liabilities at any given nominal income level differences that will continue to shrink in the absence of amt indexation the second reason is that the 2001 and 2003 reductions in the regular income tax have further narrowed the differences between regular and amt tax liabilities the combination of these two factors means that absent legislative changes there will be significant growth in the number of taxpayers affected by the amt since 1998 the effects of the amt have been mitigated through temporary provisions allowing certain personal tax credits to offset amt liability and temporary increases in the basic exemption for the amt the tax and trade relief extension act of 1998 allowed taxpayers to use nonrefundable personal tax credits in full against their regular income tax even though the use of the credits might reduce taxpayers regular income tax liability below their amt liability 4 the economic growth and tax relief reconciliation act of 2001 pl 10716 egtrra temporarily increased the amt exemption amounts from 45000 to 49000 for joint returns and from 33750 to 35750 for unmarried individuals with the changes effective for tax years between 2001 and 2004 the job creation and worker assistance act of 2002 pl 107147 extended the temporary provisions first enacted in 1998 and then extended in 1999 that allowed 1 there is also
