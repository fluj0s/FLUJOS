for the use of the temporary infrastructure and for their military contingents presence in those countries9 despite signing the declaration none of the central asian countries that hosted us nd other coalition bases called for immediately closing them and some observers speculated that the states were seeking higher rents for the bases however the day after refugees who fled from andijon to

regional security many observers judge that uzbekistans security relations with the united states appear seriously set back by its decision to terminate the k2 basing agreement and to curtail other military coopera tion with the united states according to 2004 us defense department assessment thenuzbek defense minister qodir gulomov had been very intent upon westernizing the armed fo rces including increasing interoperability with nato forces building noncommissione d officer corps and restructuring recruitment and retention11 however such plans appear ed scuttled in recent months as uzbekistan solidified ties with russia and china as the predominant suppliers of equipment and training that bolsters karimov s rule this trend was bolstered after the european union on october 3 imposed arms export and visa sanctions on uzbekistan in midnovember 2005 russia and uzbekistan signed treaty on allied relations that calls for both sides to have access to each others military installations and for mutual defense consultations in the event of threat to either party gulomov was replaced as defense minister in late 2005 by an intelligence official12 like russia china has backed uzbekistan fully in declaring that events in andijon are matter of uzbekistans in ternal affairs and hence off limits to international inquiry examples of closer uzbekchinese ties include karimovs visit to china in late may and the signing of an accord on chinese investment in the uzbek energy sector perhaps marking growing security cooperation china and russia held their first military exercises in china in august 2005 which were observe d by uzbekistan and other central asian members of the sco some observers question the capabilities of russia and china to adequately address terro rist threats in the region given their inadequate efforts before usled coalition operations began in afghanistan13 implications for us interests us policy since signing cooperative security agreements with the central asian states the administration has averred that the united states seeks permanent basing presence in the region however it also s argued that regional access will be needed as long as conditions in afghanistan require it as well as for future contingencies and to be involved in training and jo int exercises for the long term14 the overseas basing commission obc in its may 2005 report concurred with the administration that existing bases in kyrgyzstan and uzbekistan have been useful for supporting oef the obc has considered that there could be so possible

stand on the side of human rights even though the adminis tration knew that the uzbek government would then demand that k2 be vacated other observers suggested that the administration appeared less prepared fo r the uzbek demand uzbekistan not only requested that k2 be vacat ed but curtailed other anti terrorism cooperation including militarytomilitary exchanges and training these programs also aimed to inform uzbek troops about civilmilitary relations in democracy uz bekistan suspended other us funded democratization progra ms including those carried out by the peace corps the usfunded international re search and exchanges board and the eurasia foundation the defense department argued that the closure of k2 created some logistical problems but did not markedly affect coalition operations in afghanistan or other aspects of the global war on terrorism defense s ecretary rumsfeld made sudden trip to kyrgyzstan and tajikistan on july 25 27 2005 and announced that he had obtained assurances that these countries would continue to support coa lition operations in afghanistan thus seemingly highlighting the flexibility of lily pad approach to foreign military basing and the conti nuation of major us influence in the region some operations at k2 were transferred to manas and some to bagram afghanistan16 the united states may even gain regional influen ce according to some observers they point to recent statements by us and kazakh offi cials about boosting bilateral ties as evidence that kazakhstan continues to vie with uzbe kistan for regional dominance they also argue that the united states may gain more moral credibility in the islamic world other observers are less sanguine that the closure of k2 will have minimal effects on us strategic interests they argue that the future of us and coalition basing in kyrgyzstan and tajikistan may not be assured including because both the states had endorsed the july 2005 sco call for afghanistanrela ted bases to be closed they warn that the closure of k2 might thus mark the first success of russian and chinese push to consolidate their influence and largely eliminate the us security presence17 congressional
