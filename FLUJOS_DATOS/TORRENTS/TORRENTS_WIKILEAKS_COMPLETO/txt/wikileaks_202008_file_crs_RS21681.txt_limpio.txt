iraqi media under saddam hussein in the first half of the 20th century iraqs political culture featured thriving journalistic and literary environment what is written in cairo is published in beirut but read in baghdad is an old iraqi saying that testifies to an earlier somewhat less tightly controlled era1 however with the iraqi baath partys rise to power in 1968 iraq became completely authoritarian regime where the role of the media was to reinforce state control under the baath the number of daily newspapers published declined from hundreds to mere handful 1 daragahi borzou

journalists union over the next 11 years uday would come to control most newspapers and television stations promoting the image of his father while carving out his own personal media empire uday like saddam imagined himself to be populist figure and used the press to try to build his image uday also controlled shabbab tv youth tv station intended to appeal to younger audiences during saddams era iraqi authorities jammed foreign radio broadcasts and banned satellite dishes as well as most uses of the internet only wellconnected officials and members of saddams extended family were allowed to own dishes according to the international press monitoring group reporters without borders if the police found one at the bottom of your garden or hidden in cardboard box on the roof it would be immediately seized and if you were caught out second time you risked up to year in prison2 restricted internet access was introduced in 2000 though it remained luxury email usage was heavily monitored by iraqi intelligence agents httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21681 the usenforced nofly zones in northern iraq permitted iraqi kurds unprecedented political freedom as us air power kept saddam hussein from extending iraqi control into the northern enclave as result the iraqi kurds had relatively free press and enjoyed internet access long before other iraqis ussponsored broadcasting to iraq before the iraq war for fy1998 as part of congressional push for regime change in iraq congress appropriated 5 million for radio free iraq pl 105174 under the direction of radio free europeradio liberty rferl the radio service began broadcasting in october 1998 from prague soon after the creation of radio free iraq congress passed the iraq liberation act ila pl 105338 which authorized among other things 2

broadcasting satellite television into iraq from london although not specifically targeted at iraq radio sawa regionwide arabic language music and news station was launched by the voice of america voa in march 2002 the former iraqi government jammed sawas signal forcing broadcasters to constantly change frequencies and iraqis to scan the dial for the latest position today research indicates that radio sawa has respectably sized audience inside iraq3 the station broadcasts unique blend of modern arabic and western music and its challenge will be to establish trust with arab listeners interested in news broadcasts and analysis 2 reporters without borders iraq report 2002 march 26 2003 3 radio sawa is number one in iraq new survey shows broadcasting board of governors november 18 2003 crs3 the iraqi media postsaddam the dissolution of saddam husseins regime has led to media freeforall in many parts of iraq political parties prominent businessmen returned iraqi exiles islamic groups independent journalists and informal associations of citizens have launched over 200 newspapers although many of these publications may now be dormant4 iraqis also have more options than ever for televised news and entertainment foreign press reports of life in iraq have often featured stories of iraqis purchasing 200 satellite dishes in droves some estimate that over 35 of iraqis now own dishes which allow them to receive both arab and western stations internet access continues to be expensive for many iraqis though customers at internet cafes longer have their internet usage monitored by iraqi security agents aljazeera the controversial 24hour arab news network based in qatar has received mixed reviews from iraqis many of whom perceive it as having supported the baath regime in september 2003 the iraqi governing council igcbanned aljazeera and part saudiowned alarabiya from covering igc proceedings after the stations aired segment featuring masked iraqi fighters who advocated attacks against coalition forces httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21681 on november 24 2003 the igc with the approval of l paul bremer banned arabiya from broadcasting in iraq after it aired taped message purportedly from former president saddam hussein that called for attacks on iraqis cooperating with the american occupation the iranian government has markedly increased its broadcasting in arabic to iraq since the start of operation iraqi freedom as expected most iranian channels provide critical views of us policy and emphasize opposition to the us presence in iraq some stations such as sahar tv broadcast popular religious and cultural programs to iraq but accompany such programs with anticoalition news reports featuring demonstrations and statements by western officials critical of the us presence in iraq5 the coalition provisional authority cpa and the iraqi media the relationship between cpa officials and the iraqi media has been constantly evolving since the postcombat phase started in april 20036 many iraqirun newspapers in an attempt to project their own independence do not routinely print cpagenerated news stories many iraqi newspapers have been critical of the us presence in iraq and cpa officials have been challenged in differentiating between legitimate criticism and incitement of violence against us forces this process has been delicate balancing act for both sides particularly in the wars chaotic aftermath 4 media available in iraqforeign broadcast information service october 23 2003 5 sahar tv offers negative view foreign broadcast information service july 3 2003 6 some experts note that cpa and iraqi efforts to resurrect the national media are in many ways microcosm of the larger effort to rebuild iraq in this context policymakers are attempting to balance the need for maintaining order and stability with the need to transfer authority and sovereignty to iraqis crs4 sometimes publishers have crossed cpas threshold of acceptable journalism during the summer of 2003 the cpa shut down newspaper and radio station for encouraging violent resistance to the occupation some iraqis and international groups decried the cpas action calling it censorship according to general david petraeus us commander in charge of northern iraq what we are looking at is censorship but you can censor something that is intended to inflame passions7 in june 2003 cpa head paul bremer issued order 14 listing prohibited media activity section 2 of order 14 prohibits media organizations from inciting violence against religious or ethnic groups and women inciting civil disorder and rioting inciting violence against the cpa and advocating alterations to iraqs borders by violent means8 press reports also suggest that the cpa has restricted news coverage inside hospitals and morgues9 the cpa has started to form an independent media commission consisting of civilian iraqi journalists to enforce order 14 and develop new and more specific guidelines for journalists critics have denounced such regulations accusing the cpa of using an iraqiled regulatory commission to provide political cover for what they deem as cpa censorship the cpa sees the new regulatory board as practical compromise and as empowering iraqis as part of the democratization process in july 2003 iraqis and httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21681 other media analysts held conference in athens greece where they developed proposals for regulating future independent iraqi media the iraq media network in february 2003 as part of cpas efforts to rebuild iraqs media the defense department awarded yearlong contract to science applications international corporation saic to build the iraq media network imn10 the contract calls for saic to establish 3 news bureaus satellite tv network and national newspaper in addition to training iraqi journalists the contract at reported cost of 3 million to 6 million per month expires at the end of 2003 wartime and postwar chaos management turnover and reported lack of funds have worked to slow imns formation and development like many usrun reconstruction operations imn has inherited an aging iraqi infrastructure with old broadcasting studios filled with makeshift equipment some of which was looted after us forces entered baghdad many former employees of the iraqi state media have been fired but practical considerations have allowed some to remain joining mix of former iraqi exiles new hires and american media consultants some of iraqs communication towers were bombed during the war although some remain intact and in working order public reaction to imns televised content reflects what some analysts see as its conflicting missions of serving both as tool of us public diplomacy and an 7

defense for policy douglas feith see anatomy of contract the center for public integrity november 6 2003 crs5 independent iraqi network imn television has devoted considerable time to cpa public service announcements and without fully functioning iraqi government some us officials believe imn is one of the few vehicles capable of reaching large numbers of iraqis11 according to bremer aide dan senor the iraq media network is our only voice in sea of hundreds of other voices we dont unlike saddam shut down all the other voices and allow only ours to penetrate ours is one of many12although imn had initially resorted to rebroadcasting old programming from arab networks by the fall of 2003 imns television stations were devoting 6 hours to news per day including 30 minutes to an hour of local news coverage13 cpa head l paul bremer has appeared on imn most thursdays and fridays in taped messages to the iraqi people similar to those of the presidents weekly radio address in the united states some public diplomacy specialists have criticized imn for not distinguishing itself from the cpa and producing original programing observers note that saic has little experience in training journalists and establishing independent media and has previously performed defense functions such as psychological operations according to cpa spokesman charles heatly there has always been debate because our two aims are conflicting but we are very slowly going to develop into an independent voice to be seen and liked14 as imns technical capabilities grow there may be continuing disagreement over whether the network is httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21681 mouthpiece for the cpa an independent iraqrun news network or both ultimately most observers agree that imn will have to provide compelling content in order to reach wide audience of iraqis many of whom now have multiple choices for their news and entertainment possible issues for congress congress currently funds two ussponsored television networks in the middle east the department of defensemanaged iraq media network imn and the soon to be launched middle east television network metn based in virginia15 in addition to funding radio sawa and youthoriented arabic language magazine called hi many favor us sponsorship and control of these outlets on the grounds that the united states must have its own media distribution capability to counter biased antiamerican reporting in the middle east and muslim world others suggest that the united states would be perceived in more favorable light if us funds were channeled to independent media projects congress provides annual appropriations to the state department for grants to nongovernmental organizations ngos to train journalists in developing 11 recent

strategy funding for ussponsored arabic language broadcasting the fy2004 supplemental appropriations act pl 108106 set aside 100 million for the continued development of iraq media network with the objective of enabling iraqis to assume total private control over the network in two years this act also appropriated 40 million for metn the arabiclanguage television station designed to bolster us public diplomacy efforts in the middle east metn already received 30 million under the 2003 emergency wartime supplemental act pl 10811 and is slated to receive an additional 30 million under the commerce justice state and judiciary appropriations bill hr 2799 now being considered some lawmakers have raised questions regarding the possible duplicate missions of imn and metn both stations will be available to arabicspeaking audiences via satellite and through terrestrialbased network and are expected to provide us perspectives on the reconstruction mission in iraq as well as wider us foreign policy goals in the region during floor debate on the fy2004 supplemental senate foreign httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21681 relations chairman richard lugar offered an amendment that would have shifted funds for broadcasting in iraq from the defense department to the state department the amendment was withdrawn over concerns for lack of resources at state to manage such project according to officials metns mission differs from that of imn in that metn is more focused on the region and imn geared more toward iraqi audiences funding local media some analysts suggest that congress can hasten the democratic evolution of indigenous media by directing funds to local initiatives rather than usrun enterprises this approach is currently being used in afghanistan kosovo and bosnia where the united states agency for international development usaid the broadcasting board of governors and ngos have been funding local television stations and newspapers outside the control of the central government and training journalists in reporting techniques in afghanistan internews an ngo that receives some of its funding from grants from the state departments bureau of democracy human rights and labor manages the open media fund for afghanistan which provides grants to radio stations and journalists internews sees its activities as more subtle and effective way of fostering objectivity in afghanistan and elsewhere over the long term managing us public diplomacy members of congress have been concerned about perceived decentralized approach to public diplomacy and broadcasting in the middle east region with the defense department the state department the broadcasting board of governors and usaid playing roles in response section 59 of hr 1950 the house passed foreign relations authorization bill states that the department of state in coordination with the united states international broadcasting agency shall develop comprehensive strategy for the use of public diplomacy resources and assume prominent role in coordinating the efforts of all federal agencies involved in public diplomacy16 as the security situation remains tenuous in iraq both military and civilian
