clearly identifying united states government sponsorship unclassifiedfor official use only unclassifiedfor official use only page 2 of 9 u key findings ules the dhsoffice of intelligence and analysis ia has specific information that domestic rightwing terrorists are currently pl anning acts of violence but rightwing extremists may be gaining new recruits by playing on their fears about several emergent issues the economic downturn and the election of the first african american president present unique drivers for rightwing radicalization and recruitment ules threats from white supremac ist and violent antigovernment groups during 2009 have been largely rhetorical and have not indicated plans to carry out violent acts nevertheless the co nsequences of prolonged economic downturnincluding real tate foreclosures unempl oyment and an inability to obtain creditcould create fertile recruiting environment for rightwing extremists and even result in confro ntations between such groups and government authorities simila r to those in the past ules rightwing extremists have cap italized on the elec tion of the first african american president and are fo cusing their efforts to recruit new members mobilize existing supporters and broaden their scope and appeal through propaganda but they have not yet turned to attack planning ufouo the current economic and political climate has some similarities to the 1990s when rightwing extrem ism experienced resurgen ce fueled largely by an economic recession crit icism about the outsourcing of jobs and the perceived threat to us power and sovereignty by other foreign powers ufouo during the 1990s these issues contributed to the growth in the number of domestic rightwing terrorist an d extremist groups and an increase in violent acts targeting government facil ities law enforcement officers banks and infrastructure sectors ufouo growth of these groups bsided in reaction to increased government scrutiny as result of the 1995 oklahoma city bombing and disrupted plots improvements in the eco nomy and the continued us standing as the preeminent world power ufouo the possible passage of new restri ctions on firearms and the return of military veterans facing significant challeng reintegrating into their communities could lead to the potential emergence of terr orist groups or lone wolf extremists capable of carrying out violent attacks u rightwing extremism in the united states can be broadly divided in to those groups movements and adherents that are primarily hateoriented based on hatred of particular religious racial or ethnic groups and those that are mainly antigovernme nt rejecting federal authority in fa vor of state or local authority or rejecting government authority entirely it may include groups and individual s that are dedicated to single issue such as opposition to abortion or immigration unclassifiedfor official use only unclassifiedfor official use only page 3 of 9 ufouo proposed imposition of fire arms restrictions and weapons bans likely would attract new members into th ranks of rightwing extremist groups as well as potentially spur some of th em to begin planning and training for violence against the government the high volume of purchases and stockpiling of weapons and ammunition by rightwing extremists in anticipation of restrictions and bans in some parts of the country continue to be primary concern to law enforcement ufouo returning veterans possess co mbat skills and experience that are attractive to rightwing extremists dhsia is concerned that rightwing extremists will attempt to recruit and radi calize returning veterans in order to boost their violen t capabilities u current economic and political climate ufouo dhsia assesses that number of economic and political factors are driving resurgence in rightwing extremist recruitment and radicalization activity despite similarities to the c limate of the 1990s the threat pos ed by lone wolves and small terrorist cells is more pronounced than in past years in addition the historical election of an african american president and the pros pect of policy change s are proving to be driving force for rightwing extremis t recruitment and radicalization u recent example of the potential viol ence associated with rise in rightwing extremism may be found in the shooti ng deaths of three police officers in pittsburgh pennsylvania on 4 april 2009 the alleged gunmans reaction reportedly was influenced by his racist ideology and belief in antigovernment conspiracy theories related to gun conf iscations citizen detention camps and jewishcontrolled one world government u exploiting economic downturn ufouo rightwing extremist chatter on th internet continues to focus on the economy the perceived loss of us jobs in the manufacturing and construction sectors and home foreclosures antisemitic extremis ts attribute these losses to deliberate conspiracy conducted by cabal of jewish f inancial elites these accusatory tactics are employed to draw new recruits into rightwing extremist groups and further radicalize those already subscribing to extremist beliefs dhsia assesses this trend is likely to accelerate if the economy is perceived to worsen u historical presidential election ules rightwing extremists are harnessing this historical election as recruitment tool many rightwing extremists are anta gonistic toward the new presidential administration and its perceived stance on range of issues incl uding immigration and citizenship the expansion of social programs to minorities and restrictions on firearm s unclassifiedfor official use only unclassifiedfor official use only page 4 of 9 ufouo perceptions on poverty and radicalization ufouo scholars and experts disagree over povertys role in motivating violent radicalization or terrorist activity high unemployment however has the potential to l ead to alienation thus increasing an individuals susceptibility to extremist ideas according to 2007 study from the german institute for economic research there appears to be strong association between parents unemployment status and the formation of rightwing extremist beliefs in their childre nspecifically xenophobia and antidemocratic ideals ownership and use rightwing extremists ar increasingly galvanized by these concerns and leverage them as drivers for recruitmen t from the 2008 election timeframe to the present rightwing extremists have capitalized on related racial and political prejudices in expanded propaganda campaigns thereby reaching out to wider audience of potential sympathizers ules most statements by rightwi ng extremists have been rhetorical expressing concerns about the election of the first african american president but stopping short of calls fo r violent action in two inst ances in the runup to the election extremists appeared to be in the early planning stages of some threatening activity targeting the democratic nominee but law enforcement interceded u revisiting the 1990s ufouo paralleling the current national climate rightwing extremists during the 1990s exploited variety of social issues nd political themes to increase group visibility and recruit new members prominent among th themes were the militia movements opposition to gun control efforts criticism of free trade agreements particularly those with mexico and highlighting perceived government infringe ment on civil liberties as well as white supremacists longs tanding exploitation of social issues such as abortion interracial crimes and samesex marriage during the 1990s these issues contributed to the growth in the number of domestic righ twing terrorist and extremist groups and an increase in violent acts targeting government facilities law enforcement officers banks and infrastructure sectors u economic hardship and extremism ufouo historically domestic rightwing extremists have feared predicted and anticipated cataclysmic economic colla pse in the united states prominent antigovernment conspiracy theorists have incorporated aspects of an impending economic collapse to intensif fear and paranoia among like minded individuals and to attract recruits during times of economic certainty conspiracy theories involving declarations of martial law impending civil st rife or racial conflic t suspension of the us constitution and the creation of citizen tention camps often incorporate aspects of failed economy antigovernment conspiracy theories and end tim prophecies could motivate extremist individuals and groups to stockpile food ammunition and weapons these teachings also have been linked with the radicalization of domestic extremist individuals and groups in the past such as violent christian identity organizations and extremist members of the militia movement unclassifiedfor official use only unclassifiedfor official use only page 5 of 9 u illegal immigration ufouo rightwing extremists were conc erned during the 1990s with the perception that illegal immigrants were taking away american jobs through their willingness to work at significantly lower wages they also opposed free trade agreements arguing that these arrangements resulted in americans losing jobs to countries such as mexico ufouo over the past five years various rightwing extremists including militias and white supremacists have adopted the immigra tion issue as call to action rallying point and recruiting tool debates over appropriate immigration levels and enforcement policy generally fall within the real m of protected political speech under the first amendment but in some cases antiimmigra tion or strident pro enforcement fervor has been directed against specific groups and has th potential to turn violent ufouo dhsia assesses that rightwi ng extremist groups frustration over perceived lack of government action on illegal immigration has the potential to incite individuals or small groups towa rd violence if such violen ce were to occur it likely would be isolated smallscale and directed at specific immigrationrelated targets ufouo dhsia notes that promin ent civil rights organizations have observed an increase in antihispanic crimes over the past five years u in april 2007 six militia members were arrested for various weapons and explosives violations open source re porting alleged that those arrested had discussed and conducted surveillance fo r machinegun attack on hispanics u militia member in wyoming was arrested in february 2007 after communicating his plans to travel to th mexican border to kill immigrants crossing into the united states u legislative and judicial drivers ufouo many rightwing extremist groups perceive recent gun control legislation as threat to their right to bear arms and in response have increased weapons and ammunition stockpiling as well as renewed participation in paramilitary training exercises such activity combined with heightened level of extremist paranoia has the potential to facilitate criminal activity and violence ufouo during the 1990s rightwing ex tremist hostility toward government was fueled by the implementation of rest rictive gun lawssuch as the brady law that established 5day waiting peri od prior to purchasing handgun and the 1994 violent crime control and law enforcement act that limited the sale of various types of assault riflesand federal law enforcements handling of the confrontations at waco texas and ruby ridge idaho unclassifiedfor official use only unclassifiedfor official use only page 6 of 9 ufouo on the current front legisl ation has been proposed this year requiring mandatory registrati on of all firearms in the united states similar legislation was introduced in 2008 in veral states proposing mandatory tagging and registration of ammunition it is unclear if either bi ll will be passed into law nonetheless correl ation may exist betw een the potential passage of gun control legislation and increased hoarding of ammunition weapons stockpiling and paramilitary training activities among rightwing extremists ufouo open source reporting of wartime ammunition shortages has likely spurred rightwing extremistsas well as lawabidi ng americansto make bulk purchases of ammunition these shortages have increased the cost of ammunition further exacerbating rightwing extremist paranoia and ading to further stockpiling activity both rightwing extremists and lawabiding citi zens share belief that rising crime rates attributed to slumping economy make the purch ase of legitimate firearms wise move at this time ufouo weapons rights and gun control legislation are like ly to be hotly contested subjects of political debate in light of the 2008 supreme courts decision in district of columbia v heller in which the court reaffirmed an i ndividuals right to keep and bear arms under the second amendment to the us constitution but left open to debate the precise contours of that right because debates over constituti onal rights are intense and parties on all sides have deeply held sincer but vastly divergent beliefs violent extremists may attempt to coopt the debate and use the controversy as radicalization tool u perceived threat from rise of other countries ufouo rightwing extremist paranoia of foreign regimes could escalate or be magnified in the event of an economic crisis or military confrontation harkening back to the new world order conspiracy theories of the 1990s the dissolution of communist countries in eastern europe and the end of the soviet union in the 1990s led some rightwing extremists to believe that new world order would bring about world government that would usurp the sovereignty of the united states and its constitution thus infringing upon their liberty the dynamics in 2009 are somewhat similar as other countries including china indi and russia as well as some smaller oilproducing states are experiencing rise in economic power and influence ufouo fear of communist regime s and related conspiracy theories characterizing the us governments role as either complicit in foreign invasion or acquiescing as part of one world g overnment plan inspired extremist members of the militia movement to target government and military facilities in past years ufouo law enforcement in 1996 arre sted three rightwing militia members in battle creek michigan with pipe bombs automatic weapons and military unclassifiedfor official use only unclassifiedfor official use only page 7 of 9 ufouo lone wolves and small terrorist cells ufouo dhsia assesses that lone wolves an d small terrorist cells embracing violent rightwing extremist ideology are the most dangerous domestic terrorism threat in the united states information from law enforcement and nongovernmental organizations indicates lone wolves and small terrorist cells have shown intentand in some cases the capabilityto commit violent acts ules dhsia has concluded that white supremacist lone wolves pose the most significant domestic terrorist threat because of their low profile and autonomyseparate from any formalized groupwhich hampers warning efforts ufouo similarly recent state and municipa l law enforcement reporting has warned of the dangers of rightwing extremists embracing the t actics of leaderless resistance and of lone wolves carrying out acts of violence ufouo arrests in the past several years of radical militia members in alabama arkansas and pennsylvania on firearms explosives and ot her related violations indicates the emergence of small wellarmed extremist groups in some rural areas ordnance that they planned to use in attacks on nearby military and federal facilities and infrastructure targets ufouo rightwing extremist views bemo an the decline of us stature and have recently focused on themes such as the loss of us manufacturing capability to china and india russias control of energy resources and use of these to pressure other countries and chinas i nvestment in us real estate and corporations as part of subversion strategy u disgruntled military veterans ufouo dhsia assesses that rightwing extremists will attempt to recruit and radicalize returning veterans in order to xploit their skills and knowledge derived from military training and combat these skills nd knowledge have the potential to boost the capabilities of extremistsincluding lone wo lves or small terrorist cellsto carry out violence the willingness of small percenta ge of military personnel to join extremist groups during the 1990s because they were di sgruntled disillusioned or suffering from the psychological effects of wa r is being replicated today u after operation desert shieldsto rm in 19901991 some returning military veteransincluding timothy mcveighjoi ned or associated with rightwing extremist groups u prominent civil rights organiza tion reported in 2006 that large numbers of potentially violent neon azis skinheads and other white supremacists are now learning the art of warfare in the us armed forces ules the fbi noted in 2008 repor t on the white supremacist movement that some returning military veterans from the wars in iraq and afghanistan have joined extremist groups unclassifiedfor official use only unclassifiedfor official use only page 8 of 9 u outlook ufouo dhsia assesses that the combination of environmental factors that echo the 1990s including heightened inte rest in legislation for tighte r firearms restrictions and returning military veterans as well as several new trends including an uncertain economy and perceived rising influence of other countries ma be invigorating rightwing extremist activity specifically the white supremacist and militia movements to the extent that these factors persist righ twing extremism is likely to grow in strength ufouo unlike the earlier period the adve nt of the internet and other information age technologies si nce the 1990s has given domestic extremists greater access to information related to bombmaking weapons trai ning and tactics as well as targeting of individuals organizations nd facilities potentially maki ng extremist individuals and groups more dangerous and the consequences of their violence more severe new technologies also permit domestic extr emists to send and receive encrypted communications and to network with other ex tremists throughout the country and abroad making it much more difficult for law enforcemen t to deter prevent or preempt violent extremist attack ufouo number of law enforcement actions and external factors were effective in limiting the militia movement during the 1990s and could be utilized in todays climate ufouo following the 1995 bombing of the alfred p murrah federal building in oklahoma city the militia m ovement declined in total membership and in the number of organized gr oups because many members distanced themselves from the movement as resu lt of the intense scru tiny militias received after the bombing ufouo militia membership continue d to decline after the turn of the millennium as result of law enforcement disruptions of multiple terrorist plots linked to violent rightwing extremists new legislation banning paramilitary training and militia frustration that the revolution never materialized ufouo although the us economy expe rienced significant recovery and many perceived concomitant rise in us standing in the world white supremacist groups continued to experience slight growth ufouo dhsia will be working with it s state and local partners over the next several months to ascertain with greater re gional specificity the rise in rightwing extremist activity in the united states w ith particular emphasis on the political
