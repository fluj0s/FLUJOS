environmental policy analyst resources science and industry division managing electronic waste an analysis of state ewaste legislation summary pursuant to the resource conservation and recovery act rcra the us environmental protection agency epa has established regulations regarding the disposal of hazardous wastes although there are federal requirements under rcra for the management of hazardous waste some states have opted to implement more stringent requirements particularly with regard to the management of certain hazardous wastes generated by households and small businesses entities that are essentially exempt from rcras hazardous waste management requirements one category of household hazardous waste that many states are choosing to regulate more strictly is electronic waste commonly referred to as ewaste ewaste generally refers to obsolete broken or irreparable electronic equipment like televisions computers and computer monitors laptops printers cell phones copiers fax machines stereos or video gaming systems cathode ray tubes crts in televisions and computer monitors have presented particular concern to states primarily due to the potentially significant amounts of lead they contain and the large numbers in which they are generated state concerns specific to the landfill disposal or incineration of ewaste are largely due to its increasing volume and often bulky nature hazardous constituents such as lead and mercury it may contain its high cost of recycling and the inability of interested stakeholders such as electronics retailers and manufacturers to reach consensus on how to voluntarily implement national ewaste management system states have responded to this concern by enacting their own ewaste management laws requirements of those laws range from ban only on the landfill disposal or incineration of designated ewastes to the implementation of full ewaste collection transportation and recycling system to date 14 states have enacted some form of ewaste management law as many as 20 states proposed ewaste laws in 2006 and 2007 although the goal of each law is similar to avoid landfill disposal and incineration of certain types of ewaste approaches taken to achieve that goal differ significantly however most state laws and proposals have certain broad elements in common such as specifying the electronic devices covered under the law how collection and recycling program will be financed collection and recycling criteria that must be met to minimize the impact to human health and the environment and restrictions or requirements that products must meet to be sold in the state as more states propose ewaste legislation potentially regulated stakeholders particularly electronics manufacturers and retailers have expressed concern that they will be required to comply with patchwork of state requirements throughout the united states this concern has led to an increased call for federal legislation regarding ewaste management to help policy makers better understand the impact of state ewaste legislation this report discusses issues that have led to state action common elements in statewaste laws and

conservation and recovery act rcra1 the us environmental protection agency epa has established regulations regarding the transport treatment storage and disposal of hazardous wastes rcra establishes certain minimum standards that states must meet however states have the option to implement requirements that are more stringent than those specified under rcra many states have opted to do so particularly with regard to the management of certain hazardous wastes generated by households households and certain small businesses are essentially exempt from rcra2 this means that under federal law hazardous wastes generated by those entities may be disposed of in municipal solid waste landfills or incinerators one category of household hazardous waste that many states are choosing to regulate more strictly is electronic waste commonly referred to as ewaste there is universally accepted definition of ewaste but it generally refers to obsolete broken or irreparable electronic equipment such as televisions computers and computer monitors laptops printers cell phones vcrs dvd players copiers fax machines stereos and video gaming systems state and local agencies particularly municipal waste management agencies have become increasingly concerned about the landfill disposal or incineration of ewaste because of the large volumes in which it is being generated and because of the hazardous constituents the waste may contain 1 the solid waste disposal act swda enacted by congress in 1965 provided federal statutory provisions regarding solid waste disposal practices rcra was 1976 amendment to swda all subsequent amendments to swda including the hazardous and solid waste amendments hswa pl 98616 of 1984 and the federal facilities compliance act ffca pl 102386 of 1992 are commonly referred to as rcra 2 under rcra hazardous waste generators are regulated in accordance with the amount of waste they generate each month epa regulations specify three hazardous waste generator categories large quantity generators lqg generators of more the 1000 kilograms of hazardous waste per month small quantity generators sqg generators of between 100 and 1000 kilograms of hazardous waste per month and conditionally exempt small quantity generators cesqgs generators of less than 100 kilograms of hazardous waste per month cesqgs are largely exempt from rcras hazardous waste management requirements but may have some recordkeeping or reporting requirements also cesqg may be subject to more stringent requirements established by the state crs2 to avoid landfill disposal or incineration ewaste may be recycled recycling may include any of number of services or processes such as sorting to find reusable devices which may in turn be sold or donated to an entity such as school or charitable organization demanufacturing into component parts that can be resold or further processing components to extract materials such as metals glass or plastic3 for example leaded glass in cathode ray tube crt may be recovered and reprocessed to produce new crts recycling can be costly process see the cost of recycling electronics below challenge to many states is how to finance an ewaste collection and recycling program to date 14 states have enacted some form of legislation or regulations that will affect ewaste recycling and disposal practices as more states propose such legislation potentially regulated stakeholders particularly electronics manufacturers and retailers have expressed concern that they will be required to comply with patchwork of state requirements throughout the united states in 2005 two congressional hearings were held to explore issues associated with ewaste and the congressional ewaste working group was formed one goal common to both the hearings and the establishment of the working group was to explore potential national solutions to the ewaste management issue with increased legislative activity in the states it is anticipated that stakeholders will increase their call for federal legislation regarding ewaste management to illustrate the issues associated with individual state action this report discusses the key issues that have led to state action describes common elements in state waste laws and proposals and provides an overview of each enacted state law issues leading to state action the volume and bulky nature of ewaste the proliferation of and increasingly rapid technological advances in electronics means that the volume of ewaste generated in the united states is large and growing until recently data regarding electronic products sold stored recycled disposed of and exported in the united states were limited in 2007 epa completed study that attempted to gather more data4 according to that study as of 2005 of electronic products sold in the united states between 1980 and 2004 almost half 976 million units were still in use or reuse 3 for more information see the international association of electronics recyclers about electronics recycling web page at httpwwwiaerorgaboutrecyclinghtm 4 in april 2007 epa published the results of its study on electronics waste management in the united states the electronic products covered in epas analysis are televisions personal computers desktops laptops and computer monitors hard copy computer peripherals including printers scanners and fax machines computer mice keyboards and cell phones epa used two different approaches to gather its data the results from each approach are available at httpwwwepagovepaoswerhazwasterecycleecyclingmanage htm crs3 almost 42 842 million units were recycled or disposed of and almost 9 180 million units were in storage further in 2005 alone epa estimated that between 19 to 22 million tons of electronics became obsolete of that amount between 15 to 19 million tons were discarded primarily in landfills although epa estimates that ewaste comprises about 2 of the municipal solid waste stream it is anticipated that this percentage will grow as consumers continue to replace old and outdated electronic equipment and discard equipment in storage this will be the case particularly after the transition from analog to digital television broadcasts 5 and with the increased use of flatscreen televisions and computer monitors in addition to the bulky nature of electronic devices such as televisions and computers the increasing volume of ewaste concerns some states particularly state and municipal waste management agencies because these items have the potential to be reused or recycled some states have become increasingly interested in diverting such waste from municipal landfills hazardous components in ewaste the potential presence of various toxic or hazardous components is another reason that ewaste is concern for example cathode ray tubes crts6 computer central processing units cpus and other electronic devices generally contain significant quantities of lead7 crts contain an average of four pounds of lead but may contain more depending on the size age and make of the device electronic devices are also likely to contain number of other heavy metals such as mercury beryllium barium chromium nickel or zinc8 also brominated flame retardants are commonly added to the plastic housing of televisions computers and other 5 under the deficit reduction act of 2005 pl 109171 congress established deadline of february 17 2009 for the transition from analog to digital television for more information see crs report rl31260 digital television an overview by lennard kruger during this transition it is anticipated that many consumers will choose to buy new digital televisions potentially adding to the ewaste waste stream as old televisions are discarded 6 crts are the vacuum tubes that make up the video display components of televisions and computer monitors 7 lead is toxic metal that can cause delayed neurological development in children and other adverse health effects in adults including increased blood pressure nephritis and cerebrovascular disease for more information see epas final rule hazardous waste

httpewasteguideinfohazardous_substances crs4 electronic devices9 when disposed of in landfills or incinerated hazardous components of ewastes may be released into the groundwater or air10 in some instances hazardous materials are used in electronics to make those devices safe for consumer use or because less toxic alternatives are not readily available for example crt glass is infused with lead to protect users from radiation emitted from the tube flame retardants are added to plastics to prevent the heated electronic devices from catching fire although flat panel monitors are replacing crts those monitors often need mercury to operate efficiently the continued use of certain hazardous substances makes the need for recycling options greater if the goal is to minimize the disposal of those substances in landfill or incinerator the cost of recycling electronics there are various elements that contribute to the cost of state recycling program the recycling infrastructure itself includes the cost of collecting transporting and sorting the devices there is also cost associated with recycling the devices themselves recyclers and refurbishers often charge fee for their services because their costs outweigh the revenue received from recycled commodities eg glass metals or reusable components or from the sale of refurbished units although they will recover certain amount of usable scrap from ewaste they will also likely incur expenses when they have to handle and dispose of any hazardous components also unlike household consumers recyclers will be regulated under rcra and are subject to the more stringent requirements applicable to hazardous waste storage transportation and disposal some stakeholders argue that one method of lowering the cost of processing electronics is to improve economies of scale through increased volume until recently the primary sources of electronic devices for recycling have been 9 polybrominated diphenyl ethers pbdes are the most commonly used brominated flame retardants bfrs that became replacement for polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs study conducted in the late 1990s found that levels of pbdes in samples of human milk had increased exponentially in contrast to contaminants such as pcbs since the early 1970s see the environment canada web page brominated flame retardants at httpwwwnwricaresearchbrfehtml still the extent to which pbdes pose threat to human health is unclear see the department of health and human services agency for toxic substances and disease registry toxfaqstm for pbdes available at httpwwwatsdrcdcgovtfacts68pbdehtml 10 tests designed to simulate landfill conditions have revealed that crts and certain other electronic devices exceed regulatory limits for lead leachability see

httpwwweesufleduhomepptownsendresearchelectronicleaching defaultasp crs5 manufacturers and large businesses11 redirecting householdgenerated ewaste that has typically been disposed of in landfill or left unused in storage could provide recyclers with larger and steadier supply of products to recycle according to the government accountability office gao cost and inconvenience inhibit consumers from recycling used electronics12 although some computer manufacturers now accept their own products for recycling free of charge13 consumers generally have to pay the manufacturer fee to recycle their ewaste by packing and shipping them to the manufacturer themselves or they must drop off their used electronics at often inconvenient locations also often for fee if the consumer does not pay for recycling any recycling fees would likely be absorbed by the state or local agency collecting the device most stakeholders agree that if ewaste is to be recycled it must be as easy for consumers to recycle electronics as it is to buy them14 many local and state agencies retailers and electronics manufacturers have worked with epa to sponsor pilot programs providing convenient free recycling services to consumers the success of those programs demonstrated how successful ewaste recycling programs can be if they are convenient and inexpensive15 however most states do not want to bear the full financial burden of establishing an ewaste management program one factor driving states to develop ewaste laws is to implement system that will provide financing for an ewaste collection transportation and recycling system the inability of stakeholders to agree on national system for several years interested stakeholders have debated how to best address the ewaste management issue those stakeholders include electronics manufacturers and retailers local and state governments particularly waste management and water treatment agencies recyclers environmental organizations and charitable organizations that accept donation of used electronics in general these groups have agreed that the growth of ewaste has outpaced the development of infrastructure to 11 the international

encouraging recycling and reuse pp 810 crs6 appropriately reuse or recycle it however those stakeholders have disagreed about the best way to implement program to manage such waste in 2001 group of stakeholders formed the national electronics product stewardship initiative nepsi the groups mission was the development of system which includes viable financing mechanism to maximize the collection reuse and recycling of used electronics while considering appropriate incentives to design products that facilitate source reduction reuse and recycling reduce toxicity and increase recycled content16 relatively early in the process nepsi determined that federal legislation would be required to implement any plan agreed to by the group17 by 2004 the group had reached an impasse on how to finance nationwide recycling system that impasse divided the group into two camps those who believed that collection and recycling program should be financed through consumerpaid advance recycling fee arf assessed at the pointofsale of designated electronic devices and those who advocated producer pays model wherein electronics manufacturers either took back their own ewaste and recycled it or paid for system that would for more information about these two financing systems see the section mechanism to fund the program below in the absence of federal ewaste legislation or stakeholder consensus regarding an appropriate national ewaste collection and recycling program states have begun to implement their own programs provisions of each law vary significantly and range from ban on the landfill disposal of crts to implementation of statewide ewaste collection and recycling program common provisions of state ewaste laws fourteen states have enacted some form of ewaste management law although the goals of each law are similar to avoid landfill disposal of certain ewaste the approaches taken to achieve those goals differ significantly however most state laws and proposals have certain broad elements in common such as specifying the electronic devices covered under the law how collection and recycling program will be financed collection and recycling criteria that must be implemented to minimize impacts on human health and the environment and restrictions or requirements that products must meet to be lawfully sold in the state18 16 see the national electronics product stewardship initiative web page at httpeercrautkeducleannepsidefaulthtm 17 see solid waste digest ewaste brings together industry activists and government but is consensus near november 2002 at httpwwwwasteinfocomnewsstories archives200211nan02b11htm 18 some states have implemented effective voluntary ewaste recycling programs as part of their household hazardous waste management program voluntary recycling programs ie those that are not financed by an electronics manufacturer or through the assessment of an continued crs7 definition of products covered by the law each state ewaste management program identifies certain electronic devices covered under the law most often these are referred to as covered electronic devices ceds each state ewaste law defines ceds slightly differently but all include cathode ray tubes crts all state laws apply to crts in computer monitors most also include crts in televisions the laws also apply only to crts above designated screen size generally greater than four inches measured diagonally ceds may also include desktop computers including the central processing unit cpu flat panel computer monitors or televisions using plasma display or liquid crystal display lcd portable computers laptops combination units cpus with monitors peripheral devices such as keyboards printers and other devices sold for external use with computer facsimile fax machines dvd and video cassette players or recorders and cell phones19 each state law also specifies the types of electronic devices that are not regulated under the law which usually includes video displays that are contained within motor vehicle or piece of industrial commercial or medical equipment and certain consumer products such as clothes washers or microwave ovens mechanism to fund the program in attempting to reach consensus among the various stakeholders determining who pays for ewaste collection and recycling programs has been the most contentious issue many potential methods exist for funding an ewaste collection and recycling program20 most current state programs fall into two broad categories consumerpaid system or producer or manufacturerpaid system21 18 continued advanced recycling fee are not discussed in this report however for information about such program see the florida department of environmental protections endoflife electronics website at httpwwwdepstatefluswastecategorieselectronicsdefaulthtm 19 states that have requirements applicable to cell phones generally address that category of ewaste in separate legislation cell phonespecific requirements are not discussed in this report 20 for description of additional funding mechanisms see department of commerce office of technology policy recycling technology products an overview of ewaste policy issues july 2006 p 83 available at httpwwwtechnologygovreportshtm 21 in discussing ewaste management the terms producer and manufacturer are used interchangeably with regard to electronics manufacturers crs8 under any financing scheme it must be determined who will pay to manage orphan waste orphan waste is ewaste for which manufacturer can be identified or for which the manufacturer is longer in business given the high rate of turnover in the electronics business the large numbers of foreign manufacturers that may be difficult to track down and the large numbers of white box products electronic products put together by component assemblers without brand name affixed to the device the proportion of orphan waste is potentially substantial for example as part of its ewaste program washington state identified more than 1200 orphan brands of electronics potentially sold or likely to appear in the states ewaste stream22 the consumer pays model one method of financing an ewaste collection and recycling program requires consumers to pay an advanced recycling fee arf at the pointofsale of designated electronics proceeds from the arf would be used to implement the states ewaste collection infrastructure and recycling programs the collected funds may be managed by state commission or private thirdparty organization tpo suggested arfs are generally between 6 and 10 depending on the size of the device this amount is less than the cost of recycling individual ceds however because more products are sold than enter the waste stream the cost of establishing recycling infrastructure may be paid for at less than the perunit recycling price portion of the funds may pay for local collection so that the government does not assume the cost of developing and running the recycling infrastructure also retailers collecting the fee may keep certain percentage of the fee to cover their administrative costs the arf approach has been adopted in california and is favored by certain electronics manufacturers supporters of this system argue in part that it would immediately and reliably create sustainable source of funding for recycling infrastructure pay for recycling all returned products including orphan waste be simple and could be implemented efficiently and include fee that is transparent to consumers and may contribute to consumer awareness of the need to recycle stakeholders opposed to this approach argue in part that it would not be easily applied to internet sales presenting competitive disadvantage to retailers assessing the fee it would not provide manufacturers with an incentive to produce more environmentally benign products or to design products that may be more easily recycled and if the collected funds exceeded recycling costs those funds could be taken by the state and used for other purposes 22 see the washington state department of ecology washington recycles electronics establishing return share list web page under 2009 return share information orphan list at httpwwwecywagovprogramsswfaeproductrecyclereturnsharehtml crs9 the producer pays model this approach requires manufacturers to implement or finance collection and recycling program that takes responsibility for their share of returned ewaste and share of orphan waste generally assessed based on the companys total market share in the state this is often referred to as an extended producer responsibility epr or producerpays approach some models allow the producer to address its share of waste by establishing its own recycling program or one in cooperation with other manufacturers or paying the state for the collection consolidation and recycling costs of its share to date all state ewaste programs except californias implement some version of the producerpays model stakeholders in favor of this approach include environmental organizations retailers and certain manufacturers that have already established recycling programs for their products some of their arguments to support this approach include the system places limited responsibilities on retailers and consumers and avoids the creation of new taxes on consumers manufacturers implementing their own recycling programs have the flexibility to design their recycling program as they see fit and making manufacturers responsible for recycling their own products may make them more likely to design products that are easier to recycle or that would have fewer toxic components stakeholders opposed to this approach argue in part that the allocation of disposalrecycling costs to given manufacturer would likely require costly sorting to identify the appropriate manufacturer existing manufacturers would be responsible for the cost of recycling orphan waste and the internalization of recycling costs may ultimately cost consumers more than an arf once the recycling costs are subject to markup as the product moves through the distribution process another variation on the producerpays model involves manufacturers paying flat fee to sell their products in that state the collected fees are used to create grant program for local governments to implement an ewaste recycling program maryland is currently the only state with such program collection and recycling criteria state ewaste programs do not specify how ewaste must be collected that is they do not specifically require curbside pickup municipal dropoff centers retailer collection or producerestablished dropoff centers however each state program includes certain provisions regarding ewaste collection and recycling criteria that are intended to protect human health particularly the health of individuals involved with recycling operations and the environment ban landfill disposal or incineration although the details of state waste programs vary one goal they all share is to reduce landfill disposal or crs10 incineration of ewaste particularly crts to reach that goal some states have chosen to ban the disposal of ceds in municipal solid waste landfills or incinerators several states have implemented only landfill or incineration ban ie they have established program to fund collection and reuserecycling program those states are arkansas massachusetts new hampshire and rhode island in some states landfill ban preceded implementation of full ewaste recycling program see discussion regarding the california and minnesota programs below in other cases implementation of an ewaste collection and recycling program is required before landfill ban takes effect see discussion regarding the connecticut program below state specifically requires consumers to recycle therefore if landfill ban is in place the responsibility generally falls solely on the municipal government to collect ewaste and ensure that it is properly managed ie not sent to municipal landfill restrict ewaste exports according to the department of commerce much ewaste possibly 50 to 80 is sent overseas for recycling because it is more costly to recycle in the united states and most consumer electronics manufacturers who provide the market for materials recovered from recycled electronics have moved overseas23 also in states that ban the disposal of crts in landfills and incinerators within their borders ewaste can be recycled disposed of outside of the state or exported if recycling infrastructure is not present before disposal ban takes effect exporting ewaste may be the most likely choice even if there are recyclers present in given state recyclers manage significant percentage of the waste they receive by exporting it most often the exported ewaste is sent to nations such as china or developing countries of asia environmental organizations and certain other stakeholders are concerned that those countries do not enforce environmentally sound waste management practices or recycle in manner that would protect workers handling toxic materials24 these practices potentially expose vulnerable populations to toxic chemicals with few if any worker protections or framework to protect the local environment some states have responded to these concerns by banning ewaste exports set recycling standards some state programs address potential environmental concerns by attempting to ensure that the law does not exchange one potentially harmful disposal method eg disposal in solid waste landfill for another eg recycling in manner that may harm employees or the environment they may do so by directing their state environmental protection agency to develop recycling standards those standards generally specify criteria that should be met to ensure that ewaste is recycled in compliance with all applicable environmental 23 the department

httpwwwbanorgewaste technotrashfinalcomppdf crs11 health and safety regulations and in manner that protects the environment and the health and safety of workers in the united states and other countries prohibit the use of prison labor federal prison industries governmentowned corporation that does business under the trade name unicor runs ewaste recycling programs employing prison laborers some stakeholders are opposed to the use of unicor for example some recyclers have cited unfair competition from unicor which they see as an impediment to creating competitive recycling market because unicors low labor rates keep prices down25 others cite health and safety problems that have led to inmate workers being exposed to toxic and hazardous components26 these concerns have led some states to include ban on the use of prison labor in their recycling programs product restrictions most state ewaste laws specify some conditions that manufacturers or retailers must meet before product can be offered for sale in the state labeling requirements most state ewaste programs implemented to date require some entity eg state agency ewaste collector or other third party to determine the share of collected ewaste that can be attributed to individual manufacturers in order to more easily identify responsible manufacturers most state laws specify that manufacturer may not offer for sale in the state ced unless it has visible permanent label clearly identifying the manufacturer of the device registration requirements most state ewaste programs require electronics manufacturers to register with the state generally states require an initial registration an annual registration thereafter and payment of registration fee information required to be included in the registration varies significantly from state to state states may also require ewaste collectors transporters and recyclers to register with the state in order to be paid for their services restrictions on the use of certain materials although not common state ewaste laws may include certain elements of european union eu directive 200295ec on the restriction on the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment eee27 known commonly as the rohs directive it bans the use of certain heavy metals and brominated flame retardants from eee the 25 the department of commerce report

electronic equipment covered under the rohs directive is substantially broader than any ewaste legislation proposed in the united states it applies to virtually any device within ten broad product categories including it and telecommunication equipment that depends on electric currents or electromagnetic fields to work properly the directive is available at httpeuropaeuinteurlexprienojdat 2003l_037l_03720030213en00190023pdf crs12 rohs directive requires that eee does not contain lead mercury cadmium hexavalent chromium polybrominated biphenyls pbbs and polybrominated diphenyl ether pbde exemptions for certain applications of these substances are granted where substitution is not feasible or the potential negative environmental andor health impacts caused by substitution outweigh the environmental benefits by july 6 2006 manufacturers selling electronic equipment in eu member states were required to have made the required substitution for hazardous substances most electronics manufacturers sell to worldwide market since they cannot easily change their production processes to accommodate different markets it is likely that manufacturers that sell products in the united states will similarly meet the requirements of the rohs directive for those manufacturers that do not rohs like provisions in even small number of states could have the effect of nationwide requirement to date only california has included rohslike provisions in its waste law by prohibiting the sale of electronic devices that would be prohibited for sale under the rohs directive retailer restrictions some state laws make retailers party to enforcing the law in essence by prohibiting them from selling ceds that do not meet certain requirements for example retailers may be required to sell only those ceds from manufacturers that are registered with the state or that meet labeling requirements overview of enacted state legislation state ewaste laws are similar in that they intend to facilitate the recycling of certain electronic devices although the designated ceds vary slightly from state to state all include crts from computer monitors aside from that similarity each states means of achieving its goals is significantly different following this overview of enacted state ewaste laws table 1 compares key elements of each program arkansas on april 9 2001 the state enacted the arkansas computer and electronic solid waste management act28 the law applies to computer and electronic equipment defined as personal computer computer component audio player stereo player videocassette player facsimile machine copy machine cellular telephone wireless paging device video game console or any electronic item containing an intact or broken crt the law authorizes the states department of environmental quality to establish and implement rules and regulations banning the disposal of all computer and electronic equipment in arkansas landfills by january 1 2008 that deadline was extended from the original date of january 1 2005 the law also establishes program that requires state agencies to develop plans to sell reuse recycle or dispose of surplus computer equipment and electronics and 28 the march 18 2005 amended version of this law is available online at httpwwwarklegstatearusftprootacts2005publicact970pdf crs13 encourages those agencies to donate unsold equipment to arkansas public schools portion of the funds generated from selling surplus electronics must be allocated to computer and electronics recycling fund also established by the law among other activities funds may be used for product market research and development grants to determine the most efficient means of collecting transporting and processing scrap electronic equipment and to establish statewide contracts for computer and electronics recycling and demanufacturing businesses california californias electronic waste recycling act of 2003 was enacted on september 24 2003 and subsequently amended september 29 200429 the law applies to new or refurbished televisions or computer monitors that use crt or liquid crystal display lcd laptop computers or any other video display device larger than four inches beginning january 1 2005 the law requires that at the time of retail sale california consumers must pay an electronic waste recycling fee ranging from 6 to 10 depending on screen size recycling fee is assessed on the resale or reuse of covered device retailers are required to transfer the collected fees to the board of equalization which in turn deposits the money into an account managed by the california integrated waste management board ciwmb the ciwmb distributes the funds from this account to approved recyclers or to registered manufacturers that are collecting and recycling ceds following are additional requirements of californias ewaste program new or refurbished ced cannot be sold without clearly visible label showing the name of the manufacturer or the manufacturers brand ced wastes cannot be exported to foreign country without proper notification to the state department of toxic substances control the sale of electronic devices that would be prohibited for sale under the rohs directive would be prohibited for sale in the state state agencies purchasing or leasing covered electronic devices must require prospective bidders to certify that they comply with the law ban on the landfill disposal of crts went into effect under regulations issued by the state in 2001 29 see the california integrated waste management board web page electronic product management statutes regulations and related issues at httpwwwciwmbcagov electronicsregissues crs14 connecticut on july 6 2007 connecticut enacted its ewaste recycling law30 which applies to desktop or personal computers computer monitors portable computers crtbased televisions and noncrtbased televisions or any other similar or peripheral electronic device under this law by january 2009 manufacturers will be required to participate in program to implement and finance the collection transportation and recycling of certain electronic devices the law requires manufacturers to register with the state department of environmental protection and pay an annual fee that the state will use to administer the recycling program also by january 2009 municipalities must provide for the collection of ceds waste ceds must then be transported to and recycled by an approved recycler in addition to the registration fee manufacturers must pay reasonable costs of transportation and recycling ceds attributed to them and will be billed pro rata market share for orphan devices following are additional elements of connecticuts ewaste program by january 1 2008 manufacturer or retailer cannot sell ced in the state unless it has permanently affixed readily visible label with the manufacturers brand to be eligible to receive funds from the state ced collectors transporters and recyclers must meet performance standards established by the state retailers must provide consumers with information on recycling by january 1 2009 ceds collected through any state program can not be exported for disposal in manner that poses significant risk to the public health or to the environment landfill disposal ban will take effect in january 2011 maine on april 22 2004 maine enacted the act to protect public health and the environment by providing for system of shared responsibility for the safe collection and recycling of electronic waste31 the law applies to waste
