less the deductions for 50 of the selfemployment tax and contributions to certain pension plans second the duction may not be claimed for any period when selfemployed individual is eligible to participate in health plan offered by an employer or by spouses employer third the expenditures eligible for the deduction may not also be dded to the medical expenses eligible for the itemized deduction under irc section 213 finally lfemployed individuals must include their expenditures eligible for the deduction in the income base for the self employment tax the tax deduction for health insurance expenditures by the selfemployed has advantages and disadvantages on the one hand it is relatively easy for the irs to administer and for selfemployed taxpayers to claim and establishes greater parity between the tax treatment of health insurance for the selfemployed and the taxation of employer contributions to employee health plans on the other hand the deduction provides the greatest tax benefit for the same insurance policy to those who arguably need it the least selfemployed individuals with the highest incomes at least two bills in the 110th congress hr 3660 and s 2239 would eliminate one of the remaining obstacles to the equal tax treatment of health insurance purchased by the selfemployed and the taxation of health insurance obtained by employed individuals from their employers the obstacle lies in significant difference between the payroll taxes paid by wage earners and those paid by the self employed health insurance expenditures by the selfemployed are included in the income base for the taxes whereas employer contributions to employee health plans are not hr 3660 and s 2239 would allow the selfemployed to treat these expenditures as deductible

the federal tax code as temporary provision of the tax reform act of 1986 tra86 pl 99514 initially it was limited to 25 of qualified expenditures and was scheduled to expire at the end of 1989 although the act specified that congress was to assess the deduction s effectiveness before it expired such study was completed congress made several significant changes in the rules governing the deductions use before it c onsidered legislation to extend the deduction beyond 1989 the technical and miscellaneous re venue act of 1988 tamra pl 100647 added the limitation that the deduction cannot exceed selfemployed taxpayers earned income from the trade or business in which the health insurance policy was established tamra also added the requi rement that the duction be included

deduction through september 30 1990 and made it ava ilable to certain subchapter s corporation shareholders the omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1990 pl 101508 extended the deduction through december 31 1991 the tax extension act of 1991 pl 102227 exte nded it through june 30 1992 and the omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1993 pl 10366 extended the deduction through december 31 1993 for reasons that evidently had nothing to do with the effects of the deduction congress allowed it to expire at the nd of 1993 and did not extend it in 1994 but bill adopt ed in april 1995 pl 1047 permanently extended the deduction retroactive to january 1 1994 it also increased the deductible share of health insurance expenditures by the selfemplo yed to 30 starting in 1995 and continuing thereafter the 104th congress turned its attention to the deduction again in 1996 when it passed the health insuran ce portability and ccountability act of 1996 hipaa pl 10491 among other things the act tablished timetable for raising the deductible share of health insurance ex penditures from 30 in 1996 to 80 in 2006 and thereafter hipaa also permitted selfemployed taxpayers to include in the spending eligible for the deduction any pa yments they make for qualified longterm care insurance as of january 1 1997 im posed annual limits on the amount of long term care insurance premiums that could be deducted and indexed these limits for inflation the omnibus consolidated and emerge ncy supplemental ppropriations act 1999 pl 105277 accelerated the timetable for removing one of the differences between the tax treatment of employerpr ovided health insurance and the taxation of health insurance purchased by the selfemployed by raising the deductible share of health insurance spending by the latte r to 100 beginning in 2003 and thereafter effectiveness of the deduction one way to evaluate the effectiveness of the deduction is to determine whether it has achieved its intended pur pose congress was seeking to achieve at least two policy objectives in enacting the deduction as part of tra86 one was to provide the selfemployed with tax benefit for health insurance comparable to the exclusion for employee health benefits the othe r objective was to foster substantial expansion of health insurance covera ge among selfemployed individuals8 to what extent have these objectives been achievedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33311crs6 9 1994 study by the economists jonathan gruber and james poterba of the impact of the deduction on the demand for health insurance by the selfemployed found that 1 increase in the aftertax cost of this insurance lowe red the likelihood that single selfemployed person will be insured by 18 percentage points see jonathan gruber and james poterba tax incentives and the decision to purchase health insurance evidence from the self employed quarterly journal of economics vol 109 3 august 1994 p 727the deduction reduces the aftertax cost of health insurance for selfemployed individual by factor equal to his or her marginal income tax rate for example selfemployed individual in the 35 tax bracket realizes 35 reduction in the after tax cost of health plan by claiming the deduction all other things being equal reduction in the aftertax cost of this insurance can be expected to lead to an increase in the coverage rate among the selfemployed the extent of the gain would hinge on how sensitive their demand for health insurance is to changes in its cost ther is some evidence that the demand for health insurance among single selfemployed indivi duals is responsive to declines in this price9 yet unlike tax credit for the purchase of health insurance which would be of equal value to everyone who claims it the deduction is of lesser value to those with lower incomes and of greater value to those with higher incomes for the same health insurance plan this is because the tax benefit from deduction depends on taxpayers marginal tax rate for taxpayer in the 35 bracket 100 deduction reduces his or her tax liability by 35 but for taxpayer in the 10 bracket the same deduction yields reduction in tax liability of 10 to the extent that health insurance coverage among the selfemplo yed varies with household income the deduction reinforces this linkage does the deduction create level playin g field between wage earners and the selfemployed in the tax benefits they receive for the purchase of health insurance yes and on the one hand the deduction s the same direct effect on the after tax cost of health insurance as the exclus ion for employer cont ributions to employee health plans both lower that cost by f actor equal to an indi viduals marginal tax rate on the other hand the expenses elig ible for the deduction are subject to the selfemployment tax whereas employer contributions to employee health plans are exempt from payroll taxes this difference means that the aftertax cost of health plan is 153 higher for covered selfe mployed individual than for covered wage earner on truly level playing field lfemployed individuals would be able to exclude their payments for health insurance from the income base used to determine the selfemployment tax it should also be noted that the federal tax code does not provi level playing for every taxpayer who purchases health in surance there is preferential treatment for health insurance bought by the unemp loyed or individuals whose employers do not offer health benefits other than the itemized deduction for medical expenditures is there any evidence that the deduction has caused an expansion in health insurance coverage among the selfemployed such an effect seemed to materialize in the first few years after the deduction was enacted

urban consumers this cost rose at an average annual rate of 54 between january 1987 and january 2006 by contrast the overall rate of inflation for the same set of consumers in that period was 31 the price i ndex used to measure the rate of inflation for health care is the consumer price index for medical care services used by all urban consumers 198284100 overall inflation is measured by the consumer price index for all items used by these consumers 12 see craig william perry and harvey s rosen insurance and the utilization of medical services among the selfemployed working paper 8490 national bureau of economic research cambridge ma september 2001 p 26deduction was enacted 69 of the selfe mployed were covered through private health plans both plans they purchased individually and plans offered by former employers but in 1987 the first full year in which the deducti on could be claimed the share climbed to 76 it is possible that much of that rise in coverage was due to the advent of the deducti on still coverage has trended downward ever since it was 69 in 2006 the most recent year for which data are available10 in addition the share of the selfemployed population with individually purchased private health insurance was significantly lower in 2006 19 than in 1991 29 these declines raise the possibility that whatever initia l boost the deduction ma have imparted to the demand for health insurance by the selfemployed has been more than offset by certain other factors powerful counterva iling force has been increases in the cost of health care which is the main driver of trends in the cost of health insurance in recent decades the cost of health care has risen much faster than overall inflation11 this is not to suggest that the deducti on longer influences selfemployed individuals decision to purchase health in surance given that the deduction reduces the aftertax cost of health insurance health insurance coverage among the self employed since the late 1980s probably w ould have been notably lower if the deduction had not been available at the same time there is some evidence that the use of health care by the self employed is not as tethered to health insurance coverage as one might expect 2001 study by craig perry and harvey rosen of the role of health insurance in the use of medical services by the selfemp loyed found that the selfemployed had the same utilization rates for dical services in 1996 as wa geearners despite the fact that they the selfemployed were substantially less likely to be insured12 more specifically perry and rose n found statistically sign ificant differences between employees and the selfemployed in hos pital admissions hospital stays dental checkups and optometrist visits while the selfemployed had high er utilization rates for alternative care and chiropractor visits the authors concluded that the self employed were able to finance access to health care from sources other than insurance such as their own assets or loans their findings call into question one of the justifications made for the deduction during the debate over adopting ithttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33311crs8 namely that it was needed to raise health insurance coverage among the self employed thereby giving them the same access to health care as wage earners covered by employer health plans legislation in the 110th congress to modify the deduction many bills to create new tax subsidies fo r health insurance have been introduced in the 110th congress some of them would benefit the selfemployed case in point is the proposals eg hr 914 and s 1875 to establish refundable tax credit for individuals who purchase health in surance on their own depending on its design such credit could lead to more extensive health insurance coverage among selfemployed individuals as well as the popul ation at large key consideration is the effective rate of the credit if it is large enough to lower the aftertax cost of health insurance more than the deducti on does then selfemployed individual would be better off claiming the credit simple example illustrates this point suppose selfemployed individual in the 15 tax bracket buys health insurance policy for 3000 would he or she be better off with 50 refundable tax credit for that purchase or deduction of 3000 with the credit the aftertax cost of the policy would be 1500 but with the deduction the aftertax cost of the policy would rise to 2550 and the individual would recei ve the credit even if he or she has federal income tax liability at least two bills in the current congress would modify the deduction to get rid of remaining difference between the tax treatment of health insurance purchased by the selfemployed and the tax treatment of employer contributions to employee health insurance the difference lies in the disparate reach of the medicare and social security taxes paid by wage earne rs on the one hand and by the selfemployed on the other hand health insurance expe nditures by the selfemployed are subject to the taxes whereas employer contributions to employee health plans are not proposals by senator bingaman s 2239 and representatives herger kind schwartz and few others hr 3660 w ould exempt these expenditures from the selfemployment tax by allowing the selfemployed to treat them as deductible business expense it is not known what th revenue cost of the proposed exemption would be nonetheless this cost could be an important consideration in future congressional deliberations over whether to adopt such an exemption policy issues related to the deduction the tax deduction for health insurance expenditures by the selfemployed has several advantages it is relatively simple for the irs to administer and for self employed individuals to claim in additi on the deduction contributes to an expansion in health insurance coverage among the selfemployed and their immediate families by lowering the aftertax cost of health insurance many economists regard lack of health insurance as market failure becau of the negative externalities associated with being uninsured the uninsured are more likely than the insured to spread communicable diseases and the cost of uncompensated care received by thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33311crs9 13 jonathan gruber public finance and public policy new york worth publishers 2005 p 401uninsured is passed on to taxpayers throug h higher taxes and to insured patients through higher prices for medical care13 the deduction also tablishes substantial degree of parity between the tax treatment of health insurance purchased by the self employed and the taxation of health be nefits obtained by employees from their employers yet the deduction also has some di sadvantages some of which have implications for the debate in the current congress over the use of tax subsidies to shrink the size of the domestic uninsured population first the deduction leads to insurance outcomes that many regard as unfair or unseemly this is because its value to selfemployed individuals who claim it depends on their marginal tax rates under the tax systems progressive rate structure deduction of 1 is of greater value to someone with relatively high income as much as 035 than to someone with relatively low income as little as nothing although disposable income play s major role in decisions about whether to buy health insurance or how much c overage to buy the deduction delivers the smallest marginal benefit to those who arguably are in greatest need of public assistance in order to be insured one po licy option for avoiding such result is to enact refundable tax credit for the purchase of health insurance that phases out over some range of relatively high incomes such credit would deliver the largest marginal benefit to those most in need of assistance and the smallest or marginal benefit to those least in need of assistance second the deduction cannot compensate for or replicate the significant advantages of receiving health insurance through an employer those advantages stem from certain critical differen ces between the group and nongroup or individual health insurance markets on the whole wage earners who receive health benefits through their employers participat in the group market while selfemployed individuals who purchase health insurance from private insurers participate in the nongroup market group health plans genera lly cater to the health care needs of relatively large groups of people who are drawn together for purposes other than obtaining insurance such as employment the plans are managed by sponsors eg an employer who negotiate directly with insurers on behalf of the insured members by contrast individual health plans genera lly are tailored to the health care needs of the individuals seeking coverage insurers set premiums and benefits in the group market mainly on the basis of key characteristics of the particular groups seeking coverage especially their recent claims history demographic composition and geographic location premiums tend to reflect an insurers assessment of the expected cost of claims for medical services by the average memb er of group or risk pool by contrast insurers set premiums and benefits in the individual market mainly through practice known as medical underwr iting each applicant usually undergoes thorough medical examination to assess his or her risk for developing variety of serious health problems once the assessment is completed an insurer then decides whether or not to offer policy what covera ge to provide if it offers policy and the cost of that coverage within th requirements imposed by state lawhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33311crs10 14 crs report rl32237 health insurance primer by bernadette fernandez 15 kathleen mcgarry public policy and the us health insurance market direct and indirect provision of insurance national tax journal december 2002 p 795 16 gruber public finance and public policy p 409the differences between the two markets translate into more stable pricing and lower premiums in the group market than in the nongroup market14 premiums tend to be lower for comparable coverage in the group market for several reasons group insurance offers economies of scale in administrative functions such as billing marketing and claims processing that ca nnot be duplicated in individual insurance in addition relatively large employers can use their employment size to negotiate deals with insurers that provide more ge nerous benefits with lower costsharing requirements than individuals could obtain on their own there is simple or easy way to modi fy the deduction so that selfemployed individuals could enjoy the advantages of employersponsored health plans to the same extent as wage earners such an out come would require an overhaul of the us health insurance market that would allow any adult not eligible for public health insurance eg medicare or medicaid re gardless of his or her employment and health status to join any group health pl an on the same terms as those available through similar plans offered by large employers third like the exclusion for employer c ontributions to employee health plans the deduction has the potential to foster inefficient uses of medical care such an outcome is the result of market failu re peculiar to insurance markets known as moral hazard in the case of health insurance moral hazard refers to the impact of insurance on the demand for medical servi ces health insurance gives covered individuals powerful incentive to consume too much health care because the insurance allows them to pay only fracti on of its cost through deductibles or co payments as result they could use medical services until their marginal benefit equals their outofpocket cost and for someone with comprehensive firstdollar coverage that cost can be nothing wide spread use of health care whose marginal benefit is less than its true marginal cost entails social welfare loss neither the exclusion nor the deducti on are capped without an upper limit on coverage wage earners and the selfemployed are more likely to purchase generous health insurance coverage than they would if they were required to pay in aftertax dollars for coverage beyond the cost of typical individual or family policy in the regions where they reside indeed c onventional economic theory predicts that offering substantial subsidies for health insurance coverage will result in the purchase of more insurance than individuals would choose without the subsidies15 this extra coverage is more likely to activate the substantial costs of moral hazard than coverage that requires indivi duals to pay for most of the cost of routine medical procedures and fully insures only large medical expenses16 capping the deduction at an amount tied to average premiums in the nongroup market for individual or family plans is one way to curtail whatever welfare loss arises from overly generous health insurance coverage for example the presidents advisory panel on federal tax reform recommended in its final re port that the exclusion for employerhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33311crs11 17 presidents advisory panel on federal tax reform simple fair and progrowth proposals to fix americas tax system washington vember 2005 p 81provided health insurance be limited to 11500 for families and 5000 for individuals in 2006 these amounts were th projected average health insurance premiums that year17 and fourth the deduction does nothing to remedy lack of horizontal equity in the tax treatment of spending on health insurance under current tax law the unemployed and those whose employers do not provide health benefits receive abovetheline
