january 2005 have been reflected in the final report ii audit objectives 8 the overall objective of the audit was to advise directorgeneral unon on the adequacy of arrangem ents for handling staff entitlem ents this involved assessing the adm inistration of the education grant entitlem ent b evaluating the adequacy effectiveness and efficiency of internal controls c evaluating whether adequate guidance and procedures were in place d determ ining the reliability and integrity of the data available f rom the present system s and reviewing com pliance with regulations and rules and adm inistrative instructions iii audit scope and methodology 9 the audit followed up on the work undertaken in 2002 aa2002011 unon staff adm inistration sec tion and focussed on activities in 2003 it involved interviewing staff reviewing available docum ents and using audit software to sam ple and analyse data it also involved vis iting ten schools in the nairobi area which covered 30 percent of the eligible dependents iv audit findings and recommendations education grant claims prior year audit activities 10 oios recom mended that hrms should develop education grant guidelines specifying eligible expenses supporting doc umentation required and how staff m embers would be inform ed about the status of their claim s it was also recom mended that the guidelines should contain checklist showing the form s to be used and the expenses to be claim ed and staff m embers should com plete and sign copy of the checklist to show 2 what docum entation they have attached aa2000163015 the recom mendation was still not im plem ented when oios conducted its followup audit in 2002 and oios expanded its original recom mendation to provide details of the type of inform ation that might go on checklist to assist hum an resources officers in screening applications oios recom mended that the checklist should include such inform ation as date of birth contractual status school certification of ttendance school year and school invoices and identify which of these should be substantiated and what type of docum entary evidence is acceptable aa20020101018 consequently sas issued detailed memorandum to all staff outlining the procedures for the subm ission and processing of claim s and detailed checklist to be com pleted by the staf f member when subm itting the claim s the ohrm m onitoring team who visited nairobi in novem ber 2003 commented in their report issued in march 2004 that the check list for education grant is exem plary and constitutes best practice which should be shared with other offices whilst oios is pleased to see sas get credit for the work done the part of the recom mendation requiring staff to be inform ed of the status of their claim s and the collection of statistical data to m onitor the processing tim is yet to be im plem ented the prior recom mendations have been closed and the issue is taken up in recom mendation 3 of this report b processing claim s when p41b 100 is not subm itted 11 oios reviewed 40 out of 318 claim ants and noted that som staff m embers were not subm itting receipted school bills to support their claim s in cases where costs have not been item ized although actual receipts are not required when staff m embers subm it properly com pleted p41 499 form oios is of the view that where expenses have been grouped together in lieu of ite mizing staff m embers should be requested by sas to provide item ized receipts recommendation to ensure adequate docum entation to support education grant claim s chief staff adm inistration s ection unon should am end existing checklists for use by sas staff to ensure that receipts or their equivalent are always provided in support of claim s where costs have not been item ised on p41 499 sas should also consider issuing note to staff rem inding them of this rec 01 12 unon commented that it has been practice to request receipts only whenever the information on the p41 499 is incomplete or unclear however the checklist would be amended to ensure that receipts or their equivalent are always provided in support of claims where expenses have been grouped together oios thanks unon for the response and will close the recom mendation upon receipt and review of the revised checklist and note to staff rem inding them of this b late submission of claims 13 according to stic20025 paragraph 15 claim s are subject to staff rules 10315 ii and 2125 on retroactivity of paym ents and will be paid only if they are subm itted within one year f ollowing the date on which the staf f member would have been entitled to the paym ent of the grant oios had found adequate arrangem ents in place in prior audits and this audit reaffirm ed that this continues to be an area which is 3 well m anaged for staff handled directly by sa s however oios was concerned that claim s relating to unon unep and unhabit at staff at peacekeeping m issions in east tim or united nations transitional adm inistration in east tim or and jerusalem united nations truce supervision organisation were subm itted over one year late and explanation was on file explaining why sas explained that these claim s were approved at unhq through the departm ent of peace keeping operations and believed that the late paym ent was because of backlog in new york however the date of subm ission by the staff m ember was not clear from the docum entation w hilst appreciating the explanation oios m aintains that sas is accountable for the processing of these claim s within the rules oios is therefore of the opinion that sas should ensure sufficient docum entation is on file to support paym ent consequently unon should not process such paym ents without docum entation confirm ing that late paym ent is not due to late subm ission on the part of the staff m ember recommendation to ensure that unon staff adm inistration section sas can demonstrate that its responsibilities under stic20025 have been properly discharged chief st aff adm inistration section unon should request the departm ent of peace keeping operations and other entities concerned to ensure that education grant claim s to be processed by unon are subm itted on tim or that the reasons for any late subm ission are properly docum ented rec 02 chief staff adm inistration s ection unon should request the departm ent of peace keeping operations to send confirm ation that the late request for paym ent was not the fault of any of the 9 staff members who subm itted 19 claim s rec 03 14 unon commented that dpko has had backlog of education grant claims dating back many years and they are currently clearing this backlog sas is providing service to dpko by settling claims already certified by them and ioving their account the only reason that sas has to recertify the claims is so that they could be settled in our imis system nevertheless dpko will be requested to provide documentation to support the recertification of education grants on their behalf oios thanks unon for the clarification which oios believes is im portant to ensure that unon can dem onstrate that paym ents have been m ade in accordance with regulations and rules oios will close recom mendation 2 upon receipt of the procedures developed to ensure that education grant claim s to be processed by unon on behalf of third parties are subm itted on tim or that the reasons f or any late subm ission are properly docum ented b recom mendation 3 upon receipt of the confirm ation that the late request for paym ent was not the f ault of any of the 9 staf f members who subm itted 19 claim s c delays in processing claims 15 the followup on the audit of sas in 2002 found arrangem ents for processing education grant claim s to be adequate except for the lack of system to ensure that 4 claim s were processed within targeted tim fram and system to collect statistical data to help m onitor actual processing tim aa20020101019 sas im plem ented the first part of the recom mendation by incorporating the targeted tim fram of one month for processing education grant into the service level agreem ent signed on 15 june 2004 between unon hrms and unep unhabitat however at the tim of the audit sas had done nothing to put in place system to im plem ent the second part of the recom mendation and had m eans to track adherence to this indicator review of claim s com bined with discussion with sas staff suggested that sas was not achieving the onem onth target date the absence of such system means that sas is unable to demonstrate the efficiency of its operations for processing claim s and hence the adequacy of resources assigned to the task the original recom mendation is closed and replaced by the following one recommendation to enable unon hum an resources managem ent service to assess the efficiency of its operations and to determ ine the adequacy of current arrangem ents for processing claim s chief staff adm inistration section unon should im plem ent system similar to that currently used for travel claim s whereby all claim s are date stam ped when received and an em ail is issued to staff inform ing them of the date of receipt of the claim and staff are subsequently inform ed when processing is com plete following date stam ping paper tracer form should be attached to each grant claim form and an electronic equivalent of the form should be created within lotus notes this form should record the history of the grant claim within unon and will show which staf f member saw the claim form the date they received the claim and the date it left them the form should have box for review and signature by chief sas and one year after the introduction of the system an analysis of the data should be conducted and the results of this review subm itted to chief das f or his consideration rec 04 16 unon commented that sas will liaise with its to develop system for tracking the processing of education grant and to record timelines oios notes the response and will close the recom mendation upon notification of the im plem entation of system for tracking the processing of education grant and to record tim elines d education grant travel 17 oios reviewed 40 out of the 80 eligible dependents who received education grant travel in the period under review and concluded that arrangem ents for handling education grant appeared to be satisfactory with the exception of arrangem ents for ex post facto approval one staff m ember d his education grant travel approved six months after the travel took place the sta ff member has now left the since oios considers this as an isolated case further action is recom mended recoveries of education grant advance 18 inadequate arrangem ents exist for handling recoveries including poor co ordination with budget and financial managem ent service bfms 5 ten staff m embers advances totalling approxim ately us62000 rem ained outstanding since june 2001 according to stic20025 section 11 recovery from staff m embers will take place autom atically three m onths after the end of the academ ic year for headquarters staff and four m onths after the end of the academ ic year for field staff sas m anagem ent explained that recovery of advances was the responsibility of bfms oios em phasizes that hrms and bfms had joint responsibility to bring to each others attention such m atters and work together to achieve solution b advances were at tim authorised when the previous ones were not yet discharged which is not in accordance with stai20042 section 63 staff with the following index num bers received education grants before clearing in full the previous one 155389 176538 276508 and 387194 their total outstanding advances were approxim ately us10000 and they obtained new advances totalling approxim ately us42000 sas explained that the responsibility to enforce this directive rests with bfms oios em phasizes that sas and bfms had joint responsibility to bring to each others attention such m atters and work together to achieve solution recommendation to ensure adequate arrangem ents are in place for handling recoveries chief division of adm inistrative service das unon should request chief staff adm inistration section unon and chief budget and financial managem ent service unon to hold quarterly meetings to discuss m atters of com mon interest the first of these meetings should deal with outstanding education grant advances totalling approxim ately us62000 and the possibility of using imis to autom atically block staff m ember from obtaining second further education grant advances while the previous one is still outstanding rec 05 19 unon commented that an email alert is now in place to advise staff members of recovery dates of accounts receivable in cluding education grant and that sas would initiate meetings with bfms to resolve the outstanding education grant advances oios is aware of and is supportive of the excellent initiative to keep staff inform ed about receivables and will close the recom mendation upon receipt and review of evidence that the m atter of outstanding education grant advances has been resolved with bfms f special education grant conditions of entitlem ent 20 total of twenty staff m embers were receiving special education grant for the period 2003 to 2004 five were professional staff entitled to both regular and special education grant the rem aining f ifteen were gs staf f entitled to special education grant under staff rules 10320 k and 2038 j oios reviewed all cases and concluded the overall arrangem ent by sas for handling these cases appeared to be adequate with the following exception stai20042 section 151 and stic20025 paragraph 55 state 6 that staff m ember is required to provide evidence that he or she has exhausted all other sources of benefits that m ay be available for the education and training of the child including those that m ay be obtained from state and local governm ents and from the united nations contributory m edical insurance plans in all cases tested there was evidence that staff m embers were requested to verify that there were alternative sources of additional funding available recommendation to ensure that costs to the are m inimised and to com ply with stai20042 and stic200025 ch ief staff adm inistration section unon should am end existing form s to require staff members to confirm that there are alternative m eans open to them for the special education of their children to assist in verifying the accuracy of claim s from staff m embers chief sas should undertake research on the types of alternative sources and benefits that would be possible for staff m embers and this inform ation should be placed on the intranet rec 06 21 unon commented that sas would request staff members to sign an undertaking to confirm that there are alternative means open to them for the special education of their children the undertaking of research for sources of special education for staff members children should rest with the parents sas does not have the staff resources to undertake research of this nature however sas will obtain clarification from ohrm as to what constitutes proof that alternative means exist for the special education of their children oios appreciates the prom pt action taken in respect of requesting staff m embers to confirm that ther are alternative m eans open to them for the special education of their children oios appreciates the position put forward by sas with respect to research as well as the f act that sas will obtain clarif ication f rom ohrm on the subject of alternative m eans for special education oios will close the recom mendation upon receipt of copy of the form to be provided to staff to confirm alternative m eans are available to fund special education of their children and notification of the outcom of the request to ohrm on what is m eant by alternative means 22 whilst oios considered that sas arrangem ents appeared adequate oios was of the opinion that arrangem ents for handling such cases by the unon joint medical centre jms need to be strengthened there was docum entation indicating that the chief unon jms had been designated as the m edical officer authorized to determ ine the acceptability of the m edical certif icate attesting to the disability b in one case staff m ember with index num ber 697814 the chief unon jms had not indicated the date on which the entitlem ent should be reviewed on m edical grounds as required by stic20025 paragraph 54 c in one case staff m ember with index num ber 697814 the m edical certification on which the doctor based her recom mendation was letter from the high school principal atte sting to the student having learning 7 disabilities necessitating him to continue to attend the learning support program recommendations to ensure that there is adequate m edical inform ation to support claim s for special education grant the chief division of adm inistrative service unon should request ohrm to designate the chief unon joint medical service as the medical officer to determ ine the acceptability of m edical certificates attesting to the disability of children for education grant purposes rec 07 23 unon commented that chief das has requested the asgohrm for delegation of authority to the unon medical officer to certify disability oios thanks unon for the prom pt action taken and has closed the recom mendation to ensure that claim s for special education grant are supported by satisf actory m edical evidence regarding the childs disability the chief staff adm inistration secti on sas unon should assist the chief unon joint medical service jms in preparing checklist of actions that the jms should com plete the com pleted checklist should be filed in both jms and sas personnel records rec 08 24 unon commented that the chiefs sas and jms would work together on checklist or special education grant oios thank unon for the prom pt action taken and will close the recom mendation upon receipt and review of the checklist to assist jms in determ ining whether claim s for special education grant are supported by satisf actory m edical evidence regarding the childs disability b amount of the grant 25 oios reviewed and found controls to be adequate except for two out of the eight students entitled to regular education grant who were also certif ied as qualif ying f or the special education grant these students were being reim bursed at 100 percent in contravention of section 142 of stai20042 as there were special classes provided staff m ember with index num ber 655491 was overpaid us1500 however because the school was not providing accom modation the staff m ember was entitled to an additional flat sum mount of approxim ately us3000 for board because of these two adjustm ents there was an underpaym ent of approxim ately us2000 unon confirmed that appropriate adjustments would be made to the education grant settlement for staff member with index 655491 b staff m ember with index num ber 67602 had dependent child receiving special education grant however letter written by the university certif ying that the dependent was enrolled as full tim undergraduate student did not indicate that he attended special classes overpaym ent resulted in this case as the error was brought to the attention of sas before subm ission of claim to payroll 8 c need for clearer guidance 26 as consequence of the above oios concluded that this is an area where staff could benef it from guidance in determ ining eligibility which would also serve to guide hum an resources of ficers in assessing the correct entitlem ent g physical verification of schoolsattendance records 27 oios visited 10 out of approxim ately 35 schools based in nairobi covering 30 percent of the total students receiving education grant and noted the following retention of p41 499 stic20025 section 16 states that in order to facilitate confirm ation of data copy of form p41 499 m ust be given to the educational institution of the ten schools visited six kept form p41 499 while the rem ainder did not the education institutional m anagem ent explained that they did not see the need of keeping the form however when oios explained to them the advantages of keeping the form and the requirem ent to verify records should need arise at later date they all agreed with the audit team that it was essential that such records were kept w hile it is the responsibility of staff m embers to give copy of form p41 to the school the school is not com pelled to keep the form b cash discounts two of the schools visited offered cash discounts for early paym ent of fees this norm ally resulted in difficulties in filling form p41 4 99 as actual receipts did not tally with the tuition am ount on invoices oios verified the im pact this had on the am ount of refund given to qualifying staff members but noted that the com putations were based on actual receipts and therefore overpaym ents to claim ants occurred the two schools were advised to always state the net am ount as tuition so that the balance will agree to the actual am ount receipted c penalty charges for early w ithdraw from school three of the schools visited charged one term s fee in lieu of notice when student is suddenly withdrawn from school during the school ear because of an unexpected transfer of the parent to another duty station in oios opinion there appears to be m erit in allowing such expenditure which would norm ally be inadm issible sas should therefore take up the issue with ohrm so that penalties for early withdrawal resulting from transfer of pa rent due to exigencies of duty can be considered as adm issible costs recommendations to assist unon staff adm inistration section sas in ensuring the accuracy and com pleteness of inform ation received from schools and to minimise the possibility of fraud chief sas unon should compile list of schools to which staff send their children and track the num bers of children attending these schools for those schools which students regularly attend letter should be sent to 9 the schools giving them focal point within sas whom they can contact to discuss any problem s issues they com across rec 09 28 unon commented that the stai on education grant puts the onus on staff members to supply correct information and to keep appropriate records for the schooling of their children however sas would undertake to provide information to the nairobibased schools that have large number of students administered by unon furthermore instead of focal point sas would prefer to set up an email address for education grant queries from schools and will liaise with its on the matter oios notes the response and will close the recom mendation upon receipt and review of inform ation to be provided to nairobibased schools and the setting up of an em ail address for education grant queries to ensure that staff m embers who are required by the to m ove in the m iddle of school year to another duty station do not have to bear penalty charges im posed by schools for early withdrawal chief staff adm inistration section unon should seek approval from ohrm to treat this as an adm issible cost rec 10 29 unon commented that sas would address the matter of early withdrawal penalties to be treated as admissible costs to ohrm oios notes the response and will close the recom mendation upon notification of the outcom of discussions with ohrm to treat penalty charges im posed by schools for early withdrawal as an adm issible cost h distance learning 30 in its audits of unog and unhcr education grant oios noted that distance learning courses were not yet eligible for reim bursem ent stai20042 considers correspondence courses as nonadm issible except where such courses are the only available substitute for fulltim attendance at school of type not available at the duty station or where such courses are related to academ ic subjects that are not included in the regular school curriculum but are required for the childs subsequent education unon sas were of the opinion that the stai is sufficient and that they do not see any reason to disallow distant learning courses as long as the conditions in stai20042 are m et oios is however concer ned that the conditions of section 35 c would not allow distance learning as an alternative but only as an exception though this form of training can be cost effective alternative to attending classes and is finding very wide acceptance in som countries distance learning is especially im portant for duty stations such as unon recommendation to ensure that the widest possible training opportunities are offered to staff chief staff adm inistrati on section unon should liaise with her counterparts in unog and suggest to ohrm m odification of section 35 of stai20042 to give greater flexibility in the recognition of online training as an alternative rather than as an exception this would recognise current educational trends and developm ents and to allow for m ore convenient and flexible educational arrangem ents for staff m embers children rec 11 10 31 comments on distance learning noted the chief hrms will bring the matter up at the annual chiefs hr meeting in new york in 2005 oios notes the response and will close the recom mendation upon notification of the outcom of discussions with ohrm to m odify section 35 of stai20042 to give greater flexibility in the recognition of online training as an alternative rather than as an exception i dependency allow ance 32 in its prior audit aa2002011unon hrms sas oios recom mended that sas should ensure that questionnaires issued to staff m embers to verify continued receipt of dependency benefits are collected nd filed in the staff m embers files if the questionnaire is not subm itted to sas as required the entitlem ent to dependency benefits should be discontinued as pe r stic200126 section 29 aa20020101021 by failing to im plem ent the second part of the recom mendation sas dem onstrates that it has failed to discharge its responsibilities to ensure that dependency allowance is only paid to staff that have dem onstrated that they qualify it was observed that 3 out of the 40 staff m embers did not send back the dependency questionnaire but continued to receive the allowance in contravention of stic200356 paragraph 29 b sas did not m aintain record of staff m embers who did not send back the questionnaires this is an indication that sas had not intended to do anything about staff m embers who did not send back the questionnaire c staff m ember with index num ber 381064 was allowed to receive dependency allowance even though he did not produce proof that his wifes earnings were less than us10000 per annum 33 the recom mendation has therefore been left open pending sas taking action to discontinue paying dependency allowance to staff that do not dem onstrate that they continue to qualify oios will m onitor the situation and take appropriate action should it be proven that f ailure to im plem ent this recom mendation leads to any loss to the 34 unon commented that sas will put in place system to track the return of dependency questionnaires and will discontinue benefits for staff members who have not returned the questionnaires however in some cases if we are for example aware that child is in full time studies since we are processing the
