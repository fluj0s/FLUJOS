can be inaugurated pending its consideration of yushchenkos fraud charges on november 27 the ukrainian parliament approved resolution callin g the election invalid and passed vote of confidence in the central election commission although neither of these votes was binding on the government they denoted that the pro regime majority in the pa rliament was fragmenting or bending to popular pressure and represented serious blow to the regimes prestige on december 1 the parliament took the further step of dopting motion of noconfidence in the yanukovych government which required ku chma to decide whether to keep yanukovych as the head of caretaker government or appoi nt someone else another indication of the erosion of th regimes support after the second round vote was the refusal of journalists at pro government broadcast stations to continue to follow regime guidelines on coverage they provided more balanced coverage of opposition leaders and the massive oppositi on demonstrations in kiev the opposition kept the pressure up on the regime by holding massive rallies in kiev inhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32691crs5 6 cj chivers back channels crackdow n averted new york

chief intelligence agency said that they would not issue orders to use for ce against protesters the leading posts in ukraines internal security services were d eemed by analysts to be held by supporters of an oligarchic group led by ukrainia n presidential administration chief viktor medvedchuk however the large number of people that yushchenko managed to turn out into the streets appeared to give the regime pause moreover it appears that yushchenko and his supporters made substantial inroads in persuading rankandfile police not to obey orders to use force against protestors december 14

hundred thous and ardent yushchenko supporters in kievs independence square and the conti nuation of this people power pressure on the government for two weeks was extraordinary in several respects the demonstrators remained peaceful and we ll disciplined throughout extensive logistical support was put in place very qui ckly to support the mass demonstrations these efforts testify not only to

and dismissing the central election commission only if the pa rliament approved amendments to the ukrainian constitution to reduce the powers of the presidency and increase those of parliament and the

said president yushchenko was an ally in freedoms cause and president bush and the american people stand with him he said that the united states s upports ukraines aspirations to join the institutions that bind the free nations of the west17 us policy issues one important issue for us policy w ill be how to support the new democratic leadership in ukraine political measures could include an early visit to washington by yushchenko or visit to ukraine by president bush perhaps during his february 2005 trip to europe the united states c ould also increase bilateral aid and lending from international fina ncial institutions and offer othe r forms of support to the new leadership current aid levels are relatively modest the conference report for the fy2005 foreign aid bill pl 108447 pr ovides 70 million for ukraine in freedom support act aid for political and economic reform and 3 million in foreign military financing if the presidents fy2005 request for other accounts such as international military education and training the peace corps childrens health programs and nonproliferation assistance are fully funded the total would reach 849 llion some experts propose that congress approve legislation to graduate ukraine from the provisions of the jacksonvanik ame ndment which conditions normal trade relations ntr status on freedom of emigration18 ukraines efforts to join the world trade organization would be enha nced if the department of commerce designated ukraine as market econom such us assistance and similar assistance and support from the eu could be important to consolidating the gains of democratic forces in ukraine in th runup to the marc h 2006 parliamentary elections which have assumed even greater importance due to the political reforms adopted as part of the solution to ukraines political crisis there is also the issue of the impact of ukraines political crisis on the bilateral relationship between the united states and russia some observe rs have questioned whether the united states in hopes of fo stering good bilate ral relationship with moscow has overlooked long standing russian rhetoric and actions aimed at consolidating russian sphere of influen ce over many of the soviet successor states such as georgia moldova belarus and now ukraine they say that an alleged reluctance by the united states to strongly criticize

believe that the united states would not try to stop his efforts to s upport s imilar managed democracies in neighboring countries in response administration officials have noted that they have firmly rejected russian accusations of us interference in ukraines internal affairs saying the issue is one of democracy in ukraine not alleged geopolitical competition between russia and the west they say that publicly raising ukraine as an issue in overall usrussian relations would not help resolve the issue and could hurt usrussi an cooperation on vital issues such as the global war on terror19 there is also the question of possible nato membership for ukraine yushchenko has said that he favors ev entual ukrainian membership in nato although he has given more emphasis to the goal of eu membership the kuchma regime at least until the recent electi on campaign also said that it sought membership in the alliance and the unite d states expressed support for ukraines aspirations however ukraines lack of progress on reforms made such statements largely moot the emergence of westernoriented regime in kiev may make this issue more important if the united stat decided to strongly support ukraines nato aspirations it will likely also have to cope with moscows strident opposition to ukraines nato membership as well as tension with european nato allies more eager to accommodate moscow on the issue possible us efforts to urge the eu to take more flexible stance on possible eu membership for ukraine could also increase friction with so european countries iraq another important issue for us polic ymakers is the possible withdrawal of ukrainian troops from iraq us officials said before the presidential election that ukraines contribution of 1600 troops wh ile appreciated would not cause the united states to overlook ukraines demo cratic shortcomings however some observers were concerned th at ukrainian leaders were hoping that the united states would downplay election irregu larities if ukraine conti nued its troop deployment in iraq during the campaign yushchenko pled ged to withdraw the troops if elected yanukovych has supported the deployment but has raised the possibility that continued deployment coul d be conditioned on such factors as whether ukraine receives more reconstruction contracts in iraq on december 3 the ukrainian parliame nt approved nonbinding resolution
