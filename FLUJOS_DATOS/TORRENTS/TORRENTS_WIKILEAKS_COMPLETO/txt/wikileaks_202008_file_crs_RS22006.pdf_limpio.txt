the reed acts statutory ceilin gs that trigger surplus funds to return to the states accounts several times14 although the surplus funds are credited to the utf the revenue from futa becomes part of the general federal fund surplus or deficit an increase in utf trigger has the impact of lowering the federal deficit and decreasing the amount of utf monies that would have otherwise gone to the states there is legislation in the 111th congress that considers altering the statutory ceilings of fua or euca state administrators generally have maintained that all surplus revenue collected by the futa should be distributed to the states futa accounts through reed act distributions the national governors association nga has voiced its belief that the current ceiling for the loan account within the utf is too large fua 05 the nga has maintained position of reducing the ceiling to the rate that existed in 1987 0125 of covered wages paid in the last year the nga maintains that changes in uc laws now make it impossible for state to default on federal uc loans and thus the fua ceiling should be lowered fu rthermore they maintain that if there is need for states to borrow and the fua does not have sufficient funds to accommodate the borrowing by states the fua is authorized to borrow from the general fund 15
