issued during the current bush administration the report then brieﬂy identiﬁes key elements of the complex set of time periods established by the cra elements that deﬁne points during the disapproval process at which various actions may occur this discussion focuses on the cra provisions for carrying over the disapproval process into subsequent session of congress and indicates how rules submitted at the end of congress may be aﬀected by these provisions then the report identiﬁes the dates in previous sessions of congress after which rules have since the enactment of the cra been subject to these carryover pro visions and identiﬁes some of the rules that may be issued in the ﬁnal months of the current bush administrationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34633 order code rl34633 congressional

the congressional review act cra 5 usc 801808 established special set of expedited or fast track legi slative procedures primarily in the senate through which congress may enact joint re solutions disapproving agencies final rules members of congress have 60 d ays of continuous session to introduce resolution of disapproval afte r rule has been submitted to congress or published in the federal register and the senate has 60 sessi on days to use cra expedited procedures although the cra was cons idered reassertion of congressional authority over rulemaking agencies only one rule has been disapproved using its procedures and that reversal was the result of specific set of circumstances created by transition in party control of the presidency the cra also indicates that if rule is submitted to congress less than 60 session days in the senate or 60 legislative days in the house of representatives before congress adjourns session sine die then the rule is carried over to the next session of congress and treated as if it d been submitted to congress or published in the federal register on the 15th legislative day house or session day senate this restart of the cra process in new session of congress occurs even if joint resolution of disapproval had been introduced regarding the rule during the preceding session of congress review of the house and senate cal endars from the first session of the 100th congress to the first session of the 110th congress indicates that the date triggering the carryover provisions of the cra ie the date after which less than 60 legislative or session days remained in session has usually been determined by the house of representatives and that the date was almost always earlier in second sessions of congress during which congre ssional elections are held than in first sessions the median date after which the carryover periods began for all sessions during this period was june 25 and the median for ll second sessions was june 9 since the cra was enacted in march 1996 the medi an starting point for these carryover periods during second sessions of congre ss has been somewhat earlier june 7 at the conclusion of most recent presidential administrations the volume of agency rulemaking has increased noticeab ly in may 2008 the white house chief of staff generally required federal agencies to finalize all regulations to be issued during the bush administration by nove mber 1 2008 according to press accounts and other sources federal agencies are planni ng to issue number of significant final rules by the end of 2008 if any of these midnight rules are submitted within the carryover period of the second session of the 110th congress then they will be subject to the carryover provisions of the cra this report

introduction the congressional review act cra 5 usc 801808 requires federal agencies to submit all of their final rules to both houses of congress and the government accountability office gao before they can take effect the act also establishes special set of expedited or fast track legislative procedures primarily in the senate through wh ich congress may enact join t resolutions disapproving agencies final rules although the gene ral powers of congress permit it to overturn agency rules by legislation the cra is unique in permitting th use of expedited procedures for this purpose if rule is disapproved through the cra procedures the act specifies not only that the rule sha ll not take effect r shall not continue if it has already taken effect but also that the rule may not be reissued in substantially similar form without s ubsequent statutory authorization1 the cra was initially considered reassertion of congressional authority over rulemaking agencies but thus far it has had little direct effect on agency rules2 after enactment cra joint resolution of disappr oval must be presented to the president for signature or veto under most circumstances it is likely that the president would veto the resolution to protect rules veloped under his own administration and it may also be difficult for congress to mu ster the twothirds vote in both houses needed to overturn the veto of the nearly 50000 final rules that have been submitted to congress since the legislati on was enacted in march 1996 the cra has been used to disapprove only one rule the occupational safety and

the administ rations january 20 2001 memorandum gao02370r continueddeath6 for the only way that subsequent administration can change or eliminate the rule is by going back through the often lengthy rulemaking processes that are required by the administrative procedure act 5 usc 551 et seq and various other statutes and executive orders7 the current bush administration has responded to this situation by delaying and ultimately reducing the volume of effective rules issued in the last months of the clin ton administration and by protecting rules issued in its own last months from the possibility of similarly being rendered ineffective card memorandum during the final months of the clint on administration federal agencies issued hundreds of final rules number of wh ich were considered major under the cra8 in response to this action on ja nuary 20 2001 the chief of staff and assistant to the new president andrew h card jr sent memorandum to the heads of all executive departments and agencies generally directing them to 1 not send proposed or final regulations to the offi ce of the federal register ofr 2 withdraw regulations that had been nt to the ofr but not published in the federal register and 3 postpone for 60 days the effec tive date of regulations that had been published in the federal register but had not yet taken effect9 the memorandum cited the desire to ensure that the pr esidents appointees ve the opportunity to review any new or pending regulations in 2002 gao reported that 90 final rules had their effective dates delayed as re sult of the card memorandum and 15 rules still had not taken effect one year after the memorandum was issued10httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34633crs4 10 continued february 15 2002 11 between june 1 and august 8

and is the presidents chief representative in th rulemaking process see crs report rl32397 federal rulemaking the role of the office of information and regulatory affairs by curtis w copelandbolten memorandum the bush administration has also take n action in anticipation of possible midnight rules at the end of the curre nt presidents term on may 9 2008 white house chief of staff joshua b bolten issued memorandum to the heads of executive departments and agencies stating that the administration needed to resist the historical tendency of administrations to increase regulatory activity in their final months therefore bolten said that except in extraordinary circumstances regulations to be finalized in this ad ministration should be proposed later than june 1 2008 and final regulations should be issued later than november 1 200811 he also said that the administrator of the office of information and regulatory affairs oira within the office of management and budget would coordinate an effort to complete administration priorities in this final year and the oira administrator would report on regular basis regarding agency compliance with this memorandum12 cra time periods and their potential effect on rules proposed late in session the cra is complex statute and among the acts chief complexities is its use of at least four different ways to m easure the passage of time each for different purposes calendar days days of continuous session which excludes all days when either the house of representatives or the nate is adjourned for more than three days session days which include only calenda r days on which chamber is in session and legislative days which end each time chamber adjourns and begin each time it convenes af ter an adjournment the following sections describe how the cra uses each of these measures of time focusing especially on the way in which they affect congresss ability to use the crahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34633crs5 13 the administrative procedure act 5 usc 553d generally requires agencies to publish their rules 30 days before their effective dates but exempts certain categories of rules from this requirement eg interpretativ rules and statements of policy and allows agencies to make rules effective in less th an 30 days for good cause also the cra 5 usc 808 states that 1 any rule that establishes modifies opens closes or conducts regulatory program for commercial recr eational or subsistence activity related to hunting fishing or camping or 2 any ru which an agency for good cause finds and incorporates the finding and brief statement of reasons therefore in the rule issued that notice and public procedure thereon are impracticable unnecessary or contrary to the public interest shall take effect at such time as the federal agency promulgating the rule determinesdisapproval process for rules submitted toward the end of session of congress and especially toward the end of presidential term effective dates section 801a3 of the cra generally re quires that the effective dates of all major rules be delayed for 60 calendar days after the date they are provided to congress or published in the federal register whichever is later this delay in the effective dates helps to ensure that cong ress has an pportun ity to review and if necessary disapprove these majo r rules before they take effect all nonmajor rules are allowed to take effect as stipulated in the rules themselves13 nevertheless even if rule has already taken effect the cra can still be used to disapprove it if time remains in the periods established for congressional proceedings initiation and action periods section 802a of the cra states that joint resolution of disapproval may be introduced as soon as rule is received by congress but the resolution must be introduced later than 60 days after that date excluding days either house of congress is adjourned for more than 3 da ys during session of congress this 60 days of continuous session defines the initiation period for cra resolutions of disapproval for example if the house of representatives and the senate adjourn on friday and both reconvene on the following m onday or tuesday the 60day clock for the introduction of resolutions of disapproval conti nues to run throughout the weekend because neither house was out of session for more than three days on the other hand if the house is in recess for month but the senate continues in session then the 60day clock for this initiation period stops until the house comes back into session once introduced resolutions of disapproval are referred to the committees of jurisdiction in each house of congress the house of representatives would consider the resolution under its general pro cedures very likely as prescribed by special rule reported from the committee on rules in the senate however if the committee has not reported disapproval resolution within 20 calendar days after the regulation has been submitted and publishe d then the committee may be discharged of its responsibilities and the resolution pl aced on the senate calendar if 30 senators submit petition to do so httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34633crs6 14 the action period applies only to initial consideration in the senate because the cra establishes expedited procedures for initial house consideration 15 it is typically appropriate that the house component of the carryover period is measured in legislative days because the house usually adjourns at the end of each daily session so that its legislative days and session days generally coincide the senate on the other hand sometimes continues single legislative day through several actual days of session by using daily recesses rather than adjourning for this reason it is generally appropriate that the senate component of the carryover period is measured directly by days of sessiononce the senate committee has reported or been discharged the cra makes consideration of the measure privileged pr ohibits various other dilatory actions disallows amendment and limits floor debate to 10 hours section 802e of the cra states that the senate has 60 session days from the date rule is submitted to congress or published in the federal register to use these expedited procedures and act on joint resolution of disapproval14 this action period for the senate includes only the calendar days on which the senate is actually in session in contrast to the days of continuous session for the initiation period wh ich includes all days other than those when either house is in adjournment lasting more than three days because of this difference in which da ys are counted the action period will normally last longer than the initiation period carryover period section 801d of the cra provides that if congress adjourns its annual session sine die less than 60 legislative days in the house of representatives or 60 session days in the senate after rule is submitted to it then the rule is subject during the following session of congress to 1 new initiation period in both chambers and 2 new action period in the senate15 the purpose of this provision is to ensure that both houses of congress have sufficient time to consider disapproving rules submitted during this endofsession carry over period in any given year the carryover period begins after the 60th legislative day in th house or session day in the senate before the sine die adjournment whichever date is earlier the renewal of the cra process in the following session occurs even if resolution to disapprove the rule had been introduced during the session when the rule was submitted for purposes of this new initiation pe riod and senate ac tion period rule originally submitted during the carryover period of the previous session is treated as if it had published in the federal register on the 15th legislative day house or session day senate after congress r econvenes for the next session in each chamber resolutions of disa pproval may be introduced at any point in the 60 days of continuous session of congress that follow th is date and the nate may act on the resolution during the 60 days of ssion that follow the same date starting points for cra carryover periods in light of the cras requirement that major rules be delayed for 60 calendar days the may 2008 bolten memorandums requi rement that final rules be publishedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34633crs7 in the federal register by november 1 2008 indicates that these rules will have taken effect before the 111th congress begins and the ne xt president takes office in january 2009 as result the bolten morandum may so have the effect of preventing the next presidential administr ation from doing what was done via the card memorandum directing federal agencies to extend the effective dates of any rules that had been published during the bu sh administration but had not taken effect since the rules would have already taken effect by the time the next president takes office however many rules submitted before the bolten memorandum deadline will remain subject to congressiona l disapproval in the 111th congress because they will not have been submitted before the starting point of the carryover period and because the cra permits congress to enact resolutions of disapproval regarding rules that have already taken effect although the exact starting point for the cra carryover period in the second session of the 110th congress can be determined only after sine die adjournment has taken place the likely date or range of dates may be illuminated by examining congressional activity in prior years to identify these earlier starting points crs examined the calendars of the house and the senate for all sessions of congress during the previous 20 years ie from the 100th congress which began in 1987 through the first session of the 110th congress in 2007 counting backwards from the end of each session we determined the date after which there were either less than 60 days of session in th senate or less than 60 legislative days in the house although some of these sessions of congre ss predate the enactment of the cra the starting points for those sessions were in cluded to better unders tand the trends in these dates table 1 below presents these data for each session of congress the earlier of the house or senate starting point dates is shown in the table in bold face since the cra was enacted in march 1996 any rule s ubmitted after the specified date in that session was available for disapproval under the cra process during the following session of congress as the table indicat the starting points for the cra carryover periods varied between the two houses of congress in each session and across the sessions within each chamber the data also show the following in all but two sessions of congress during this period ie the first and second sessions of the 101st congress the starting point date for the house of representatives occurred earlier than the starting point date for the senate in every session since the cra was enacted in march 1996 the house starting point has determined the relevant date for cra carryovers to th next session of congress across all of these sessions of c ongress the earliest starting point for the carryover period was ma 12 second session of the 108th congress and the late st date was septem ber 9 first session 100th congress however it has been unusual for the starting point to be before june or after july the dian relevant starting point ie half occurring before half after fo r all of these sessions of congress was june 25 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34633crs8 16 the starting points for carryover periods in second sessions most commonly occurred in june with the dates ranging from may 12 to june 27 the starting points in first sessions most commonly occurred in july with the dates ranging from june 25 to september 9the starting points for the cra carryover periods were almost always earlier during the second sessions of congress ie during election years than the starting points in the first sessions16 the median starting point during all second sessions was june 9 the median during first sessions was ju ly 19 this difference in median starting points is explained by the fact that both houses often adjourn or recess just prior to andor after congressional elections since the cra was enacted in march 1996 the starting points for the carryover periods during second sessions of congress have been even earlier than for the full period ranging from may 12 to june 23 with the median starting point being june 7 any rule that was submitted to congress after the relevant starting point date in any session since the cra was enacted in ma rch 1996 would not have had 60 days of session in both houses and congress ability to introduce and act on cra resolutions of disapproval regarding the rule carried ove r to the next session of congress new initiation period and new action period for the rule began on the 15th session senate or legislative house day of that new session of congress

period in the senate 60 days of session for resoluti ons of disapproval house and senate calendars from previous sessions of congress particularly sessions that occu rred during election years second sessions suggest that any final rule submitted to congress after june 2008 may be carried over to the first session of the 111th congress and may be subject to resolution of disapproval during that session however the star ting point for the carryover period could slip to late september or early october if an unpr ecedented level of congressional activity occurs late the session expedited procedures in the senate and special rules in the house can help ensure that such resolutions are acted upon in each chamber however the enactment of any resolution of disapproval will still depend heavily on the action of the new president if the resolution of disapproval is vetoed it will require twothirds vote in both houses of congress for the ta rgeted rule to be rejected the memorandum issued by white hous chief of staff bolten directing agencies to issue most final rules by november 1 2008 would if fully implemented ensure that most of the rules even those considered major under the cra and whose effective dates must be delayed for 60 days woul d take effect before the 111th congress begins and the next presiden t takes office in january 2009 as noted earlier in this report the bo lten memorandum may also have the effect of preventing the next presidential administration from doing what was done via the card memorandum directing federal agencies to extend the effective dates of any rules that had been published during the bush administration but had not taken effect since the rules would have already taken effect by the time the next president takes office in addition some believe that th memorandum may be cited as reason why certain rules will not be issued before the end of the bush administration37 however as also pointed out earlie r the bolten memorandum will have impact on the next congresss ability to overturn agency rules that are submitted within the last 60 legislative or session days in each house of congress since the cra permits congress to enact resolutions of disapproval regarding rules that have already taken effect also once rule is disapproved the cra prevents the agency from proposing substantially similar ru without subsequent statutory authorization even without the cra though congress can stop rulemaking in other ways for example each year congress includes provisions in appropriations legislation prohibiting rulemaking within particular policy areas preventing particular proposed rules from becoming final and prohibiting or affecting the implementation orhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34633crs16 38 crs report
