introduction high crude oil and gasoline prices over th past few years have led to increased interest in the us fuel supply r ecent congressional inte rest has focused on alternatives to petroleum ways to improve the efficiency of the us transportation sector and ways to improve the stability and security of the petroleum s upply and refining sectors1 in spring 2006 high oil global oil prices spurred by high demand and refinery constraints in the domestic gasoline supply pushed us gasoline pump prices to historic highs in fall 2006 and winter 2007 gasoline prices eased somewhat but in spring 2007 returned to those highs where they have remained key components of federal policies to reduce fuel consumption include the promotion of alternatives to petroleum fu els and the promotion

legislative background combination of issues the oil crises of the 1970s the rise in awareness of environmenta l issues concerns over energy security increasing vehicle emissions and high gaso line prices spurred interest in moving the united states away from petroleum fuels for transportation and toward alternative fuels and advanced vehicle technologies5 the energy policy act of 1992 the 102nd congress passed the energy policy act of 1992 epact 1992 pl 102486 among other provisions this law requires the purchase of alternative fuel vehicles by federal agencies state governments and alte rnative fuel providers unde r epact 1992 certain percentage which varies by the type of fleet of new passenger vehicles purchased for federal or state agency or alternative fuel provider fleet must be capable of operating on alternative fuels including ethanol thanol natural gas or propane epact 1992 established tax credit for the purchas of electric vehicl as well as tax deductions for the purchase of altern ative fuel and hybrid vehicles the energy policy act of 2005 there was little congressional action on energy policy through the late 1990s in light of high fuel prices in the early 2000s continued growth in domestic and global petroleum dema nd and other energy policy concerns congress began working on compre hensive energy legislation in 2001 in the 107th congress an energy bill stalled in conference the 108th congress continued the debate over ergy legislation the c onference report hrept 108 375 included provisions on vehicle tax cr edits amendments to vehicle purchase requirements under the energy policy ac t of 1992 requirement that gasoline contain ethanol or other re newable fuels and tax cred its for ethanol and biodiesel fuels however this bill also stalled many of these topics were addressed in the 109th congress by the energy policy act of 2005 epact 2005 pl 10958 which was signed by president bush on august 8 2005 the energy independence and security act of 2005 continued pressure on energy prices and concerns ove r energy security after passage of epact 2005 led to continued discussion of energy policy in the 110th congress on december 19 2007

pl 109 59 and pl 105178 which established and reaffirmed tax incentives for ethanol nd other fuels and numerous laws that authorize federal research and devel opment on alternative fuels advanced technologies and enabling infrastructur such as alternative fuel pumps current issues recent events have renewed interest in alternative fuels and advanced vehicles for exam ple high pump prices for ga soline and diesel fuel have raised concerns over fuel conservati on and energy security including us dependency on oil imports in light of this there is growing interest in more efficient vehicles or vehicles that ab andon the use of petroleum alto gether this is especially true as the rapid growth in the sales of light trucks these include sport utility vehicles suvs minivans and pickups which tend to have lower fuel economy than passenger cars has lowered the overa ll fuel economy of th new vehicle fleet eisa requires an increase in fuel econom from passenger cars and light trucks to 35 miles per gallon mpg combined in 2020 from roughly 25 mpg today ongoing technological developments in hy brid vehicles ethanol fuel fuel cells and hydrogen fuel have raised key policy questions these questions include whether more generous tax incentives for hybrid andor fuel cell vehicles should be established the costs and environmenta l impacts associated with production of ethanol or hydrogen as major transpor tation fuels and whether research and development funds should be focused on ch potentially highrisk technologies as fuel cells or on nearterm t echnologies such as hybrids hurricanes along the gulf coast in the fall of 2005 led to fuel supply disruptions and high retail prices raising congressional interest in alternatives to petroleum in addition in spring 2006 high crude prices issues with refining capacity and concerns about ethanol supply led to high pump prices further raising concerns about the united states ability to supply fuel to th transportation sector as crude oil and gasoline prices returned to historic highs in 2007 and 2008 these supply concerns remain fuel tax incentives there are three key tax incentives for lternative fuels 1 tax credit for ethanol of 051 per gallon 2 tax credit for biodiesel and renewable diesel of 100 per gallon 050 for biodiesel made fro m recycled products and 3 credit of 050 per gallon for the retail sale of

production and purchase of alternative fuels supporters of this approach argue that the market favors conventional fuels and that the widespread infrastructure and nearly ubiquitous use of conventional fuels in automobiles ma kes it difficult for alternative fuels to compete without economic incentives th american jobs creation act of 2004 pl 108357 replaced previous excise tax exemption for ethanolblended fuels with tax credit of 051 per gallon this credit will expire at the end of 2010 in addition to the credit for ethanolblended gasoline there has been interest in promoting biodiesel fuel pl 108357 pr ovides tax credit of 100 per gallon for the sale and use of agribiodiesel biodiesel produced from virgin agricultural products such as soybean or canola oil there is smaller credit of 050 per gallon for biodiesel produced from r ecycled grease under pl 108357 the biodiesel credit would have expired at the end of 2006 four years before the expiration of the ethanol credit the energy policy act of 2005 pl 10958 extended the biodiesel tax credit through 2008 in addition pl 10958 expa nded the credit to include renewable diesel which is produced from different process than biodiesel and results in fuel with somewhat different chemical characteristics in recent guidance on the tax credit the internal revenue service rule d that renewable diesel includes synthetic diesel fuel produced from vegetabl oils at petroleum refineries8 most biodiesel producers are small plants and many biodi esel producers are concerned that this decision could lead to shift away fro m biodiesel production to renewable diesel production at large refineries ethanol and mtbe outside of tax incentives ethanol has been of key interest in recent congresses especially in its role as an alternative to mtbe methyl tertiary butyl ether9 mtbe and ethanol were used among other purpos to meet clean air act requirements that reformulated gasoline rfg sold in the nations

rfg and about 30 of the gasoline sold in the united states is rfg according to the environmental protection agency epa11 before amendment by the energy policy act of 2005 the clean air act required that rfg contain at least 2 oxygen by weight12 refiners met this requirement by adding number of ethers or alcohols any of which contains oxygen and other elements until about 2003 the most commonly used oxygenate was mtbe because it was cheaper and easier to use than competing oxygenates in 1999 87 of rfg contained mtbe number reduced to about 46 in 2004 according to epa mtbe has also been used ce the late 1970s in nonreformulated gasoline as an octane enhancer at lower concentra tions as result gasoline with mtbe has been used throughout the united states wh ether or not an area has been subject to rfg requirements mtbe contamination creates taste and odor problems in water at very low concentrations and some animal studies indicate mtbe may pose cancer risk to humans mtbe leaks generally from unde rground gasoline storage tanks have been implicated in numerous incidents of ground water contamination for these reasons 25 states have taken steps to ban or limit its use according to the renewable fuels association13 the most significant of the ba ns in california and new york took effect at the end of 2003 leading many to suggest that congress revisit the issue to modify the oxygenate requirement and set more uniform na tional requirements regarding mtbe and its potential replacements principally ethanol support for eliminating the oxygenate re quirement on nationwide basis was widespread among states the petroleum industry and some environmental groups in general these stakeholders concluded that gasoline can meet the same low emission performance standards as rfg w ithout the use of oxygenates but agricultural interests presented potential obstacle to enacting legislation to remove the oxygen requirement according to the us department of agriculture usda roughly 20 of the nations corn crop was used in 20062007 to produce the competing oxygenate ethanol14 if mtbe use were reduced or phased out but the oxygen requirement remained in effect ethanol use would have soared increasing demand for corn conversely if the oxyg requirement were repealed not only would mtbe use decline but so likely would demand for ethanol thus

policy act of 2005 pl 10958 and hr 6 by brent d yacobucci mary tiemann and james mccarthy 16 while the original mandate in pl 10958 covered only gasoline the expanded mandate applies to all transportation fuelsmembers of congress and gove rnors from corngrowing states took keen interest in mtbe legislation and re lated oxygenate requirements to help promote the market for ethanol if the oxygen standard were eliminated renewable fuels standard rfs was suggest ed this would require that all gasoline contain ethanol or other rene wable fuel this concept was supported by agricultural interests the oil industry and some environmental groups opponents included states that do not produce ethanol due to f ears that the mandate could raise gasoline prices the energy policy act of 2005 pl 10958 contains numerous mtbe and ethanol provisions it repeal ed the clean air act requireme nt to use mtbe or other oxygenates in place of this requirement the law established renewable fuels standard under the rfs annual gasoline supply is required to contain 75 billion gallons of ethanol or other renewable fuel by 2012 to prevent backsliding on air quality the law requires that reductions in emissions of toxic substances achieved by rfg be maintained and it aut horizes funds fo r mtbe cleanup15 the energy independence and security act of 2007 pl 110140 expanded this mandate requiring the use of 90 billion gallons of renewable fuels in transportation fuel16 in 2008 and 36 billion gallons in 2022 cellulosic biofuels ethanol the most significant biofuel in the united states is usually produced from corn however corn is key animal feed and is also used for human consumption further corn is resource intensive crop requiring significant use of chemical fertilizers and ge nerally grown on prime far mland there is growing interest in developing biofue ls that require less energy to produce and have smaller environmental footprint biofuels produced from cellulosic materials such as fastgrowing trees prairie grasses or agricultural wastes are seen as potential strategy for reducing the environmental impact of biofuels while expanding the united states ability to displace petroleum fuels the potential s upply of these feedstocks is abundant which is why it is expected that future ex pansion of the us biofuels industry will be in this area however breaking down cellulose and c onverting it into fuel requires complex chemical processing starches such as corn and sugars such as cane sugar are easily fermented into alcohol while cellulo must be broken down into sugars or starches through enzymatic or thermochemical processes before fermentationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33564crs7 17 mixture of hydrogen nd carbon monoxide that can be used to produce variety of chemicals and fuelsalternatively biomass can be converted into synthesis gas17 which can then be used to produce fuels regardless of the pathway processing cellulose into fuels is currently prohibitively expensive relative to other conventional and alternative fuel options therefore rd has focused on wering the costs of enzymatic and other processing techniques further questions remain about the feasibility of these fuels as well as the ultimate environmenta l footprint many of the pr oposed feedstocks have never been grown on large scale therefore rd is also focused on increasing the yield of potential biofuel crops veloping harvesting techni ques and finding ways to limit the environmental impact of dedicated energy crops the energy policy act of 2005 included pr ovisions to promote the development of cellulosic biofuels these include an authorization for increased research and development funding at the partment of energy grants loans and loan guarantees for the development of cellulosic biofuels pergallon incentives for the first 1 billion gallons of domestic production and manda that gasoline contain at least 250 million gallons of cellulosic etha nol annually starting in 2013 on december 20 2006 president bush sign ed the tax relief and health care act of 2006 pl 109432 among other pr ovisions this tax law established 50 depreciation allowance for cellulosic ethanol plants placed in service before january 1 2013 subject to certain limitations the energy independence and security act of 2007 expanded the renewable fuel mandate in epact 2005 and established specific requirements for advanced biofuels defined as fuels produced from feedstocks other than corn starch and with 50 lower lifecycle greenhouse gas emissi ons than petroleum fuels of the 36 billion gallons of renewable fuel re quired in 2022 21 billion gallons must be advanced biofuels within that mandate there are specific carveouts for cellulosic biofuels and biomass based diesel fuels ethanol imports corn growers and ethanol producers ar supportive of the renewable fuels standard because of its implications for hi gher corn and ethanol prices however concern over ethanol imports is growing am ong some stakeholders because of lower production costs and the avai lability of government in centives ethanol prices in brazil and some other countries can be sign ificantly lower than in the united states to offset the us tax incentive that all ethanol imported or domestic receives most imports are subject to relatively small 25 ad valorem tariff but more significantly an added duty of 054 per gall on this added duty effectively negates the tax incentive for covered imports and has been significant barrier to fuel ethanol importshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33564crs8 18 for more information on ethanol imports from cbi countries see crs report rs21930 ethanol imports and the caribbean basin initiative by brent d yacobucci

was produced in noncbi country in this scenario the ethanol is produced in another country historically brazil or european country dehydrated in cbi country then shipped to the united states in recent years these imports have reached as high as 5 of the us ethanol market this avenue for imported ethanol to avoid the tariff has been criticized by some stakeholders including some members of congress with the establishment of renewable fuel standard as well as high us gasoline and ethanol prices there ma be more interest in importing ethanol either through cbi countries or directly from ethanol producers in addition to the concerns over imports of dutyfree ethanol from cbi countries there is growing concern that large portion of etha nol otherwise subject to the duties is being imported dutyfr ee through manufacturing drawback19 if manufacturer imports an intermediate pr oduct then exports the finished product or similar product then that manufacturer ma be eligible for refund drawback of up to 99 of the duties paid there ar special provisions for the production of petroleum derivatives20 in the case of fuel ethanol the imported ethanol is used as blending component in gasoline and jet fuel considered like commodity is exported to qualify for the drawback21 some critics estimate that as much as 75 or more of the duties were eligible for the drawback in 2006 therefore critics question the effectiveness of the et hanol duties and the cbi exemption on december 20 2006 president bush sign ed the tax relief and health care act of 2006 pl 109432 among other provisions the act extended the duty on imported ethanol through december 31 2008 but did not address the duty drawback provisions or the cbi preference vehicle purchase requirements the energy policy

lightduty diesel vehicles that meet specified emissions standardsoperating on alternative fuels 90 of the vehicles purchased by alternative fuel providers23 must be alternative fuel vehicles24 the alternative fuel vehicle provisions of epact 1992 have been criticized as ineffective because while epact 1992 require s the purchase of vehicles capable of operating on alternative fuels it did not mandate the use of alternative fuels in most cases the vehicles purchased to meet the re quirement are dualfuel vehicles ie they can operate on either conventi onal fuel or an alternative fuel those vehicles are primarily fueled using gasoline because gasoline tends to be less expensive and more widely available than alternative fuels since the infrastructure to provide alternative fuels is limited compared with the existing infrastructure for gasoline and diesel fuel in addition despite the vehicle purchase mandate many agenci have failed to meet their statutory obligation as result in 2002 the center for biological diversity filed lawsuit with the us di strict court for the northern district of california in july 2002 the court ruled th at several federal agencies failed to meet their quotas and ordered thos agencies to prepare repor ts on their compliance with epact which those agencies have completed25 the energy policy act of 2005 section 701 modified the requirements for epact 1992 compliance all dualfuel vehi cles purchased to meet the epact quotas are required to operate on alternative fuels unless an agency is granted waiver by the secretary of energy in addition the secretary of energy is required to conduct study of the effectiveness of the epac t requirements further section 703 of epact 2005 allows state and fuel provider fl eets to petition the partment of energy doe to waive the vehicle purchase requirement if the fleet certifies other fuel saving measures eg using highereffici ency conventional vehicles or hybrids on january 28 2008 president bush

epact 1992 will be granted credits for th purchase of hybrid advanced diesel26 and fuel cell vehicles in addition to those alternative fuel vehicles already allowed in addition to the requirement s for federal state and fuel provider fleets epact 1992 grants the doe the authority to exte nd the requirements to local government and private fleets however as of 2002 doe had not made determination

of vehicles and fuels are more effective than any purchase mandate in addition to the ma ndatory purchase requirements epact 1992 established tax incentives for the purch ase of electric vehicles and cleanfuel vehicles including alternative fuel and hybrid vehicles the energy policy act of 2005 secti on 1341 significantly expanded and extended the vehicle purchase incentives establishing tax credits for the purchase of fuel cell hybrid alternative fuel and advanced diesel vehicles for passenger vehicles the credit is worth as much as 3400 for hybrids and advanced diesels and as much as 4000 for alternative fuel vehicles pending on vehicle attributes the expiration date for the incentives also varies depending on the technology27 in the case of hybrid and advanced di esel vehicles the number of vehicles eligible for the credit is limited for each vehicle manufacturer starting the second calendar quarter after manufacturer sells the 60000th vehicle eligible for the credit the credit for that manufacturers vehicles is reduced currently only toyota and honda have sold enough vehicles to tr igger phaseout for toyota and lexus hybrids purchased after september 30 2006 the credit was reduced by 50 the credit was reduced to 25 for vehicles purchased after march 31 2007 and is zero for vehicles purchased af ter september 30 2007 honda s phaseout began january 1 2008 and

and limit greenhouse gas emissions however biodiesel producti on is currently expensive wholesale biodiesel from virgin oils can cost up to two times more than c onventional 2 diesel biodiesel from recycled grease is less expensive but still costs considerably more than conventional diesel the cost barriers for biodi esel production have genera ted interest in providing tax incentives for biodiesel in the form of either production tax credit or an excise tax exemption or both further there is in terest in developing new technologies to help reduce production costs however the organic oils used as raw materials are one of the largest costs in production th erefore to significantly reduce biodiesel production costs the costs of soybean oil and other oils would need to decrease substantially as was stated above the american j obs creation act provi des tax credit of up to 100 per gallon for the sale and us of agribiodiesel biodiesel from virgin agricultural products the cred it is 050 per gallon for biodiesel from recycled grease in addition the law pr ovides an excise tax credit for biodiesel blends ie biodiesel and c onventional diesel producers are eligible for one credit or the other but not both see fuel tax in centives above these credits were set to expire at the end of 2006 the ener gy policy act of 2005 pl 10958 extended these credits through 2008 further

fuel cells over the past few years interest has gr own substantially in hydrogen fuel and fuel cells30 hydrogen fuel can be produced using any energy source and has thus been touted as way to limit dependence on energy imports further when hydrogen is used in fuel cell device that pr oduces electricity by converting hydrogen to water mostly heat and water are produced drastically reducing or eliminating vehicle emissions however hydrogen fu production is currently very expensive as are fuel cells in addition depending on the original fuel source overall fuelcycle emissions can be key

issues by brent d yacobucciadministration has strongly supported research and devel opment rd in january 2002 the administration ann ounced the fr eedomcar initiative which promotes cooperative rd between the big three american auto manufacturers chrysler ford and general motors and the federa l government while the partnership is conducting research on many t echnologies hydrogen and fu cell vehicles are key focus further in his january 2003 stat of the union address president bush announced the hydrogen fuel initiative which increased federal spending on hydrogen fuel and stationary fuel cell r d overall the president requested 18 billion between fy2004 and fy2008 for both initiatives including 720 million increase in funding from earlier appropr iations over that time congress appropriated total of 14 billion for the initiatives32 the energy policy act of 2005 authorizes total of 33 billion through fy2010 for fuel cell and hydrogen rd33 opponents of the initiatives argue that hy drogen fuel and fuel cells may never be commercialized and that the initiatives draw funding away from nearterm technologies such as hybrid vehicles further some argue that research and development alone will not reduce petroleum dependence and that congress should instead consider tightening fuel economy sta ndards for all vehicles as noted earlier congress did tighten fuel economy standards for all vehicles in the energy independence and security act of 2007 pl 110140 hybrid vehicles hybrid gasolineelectric and dieselelect ric vehicles are becoming increasingly popular in the united states hybrids comb ine gasoline or diesel engine with an electrical motor system to improve efficiency34 if their use becomes more widespread they could help improve the ove rall efficiency of the vehicle fleet and could help limit oil consumption further they could do so without significant changes to existing infrastructure which has been key barrier to the expanded use of alternative fuel vehicles by janua ry 2008 ford general motors honda nissan mazda and toyota offered vehicles with hybrid powertrains at the present time only hybrid passenger cars suvs and pic kups are available in the united states but hybrid versions of other vehi cle models and classes are expected in the near future because of their energy and environmenta l benefits some states have provided drivers of hybrid vehicles an exempti on from high occupancy vehicle hov lane requirements under tea21 which expi red on september 30 2003 states had the authority to grant hov exemptions for socalled inherently low emission vehicles ilevs the ilev standard re quires that vehicle have evaporativehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33564crs13 emissions standard that is not met by an current hybrid however because of the reduced emissions and improved fuel econom of hybrid vehicles there has been congressional interest in explicitly granting states the right to exempt them from hov lane requirements while not addressing hybrids di rectly the final version of the highway reauthorization act pl 10959 permits states to exempt certain high efficiency vehicles from hov restrictions further as was stated above the energy policy act of 2005 expanded the incentives for the purchase of hybrid vehicles see vehicle purchase tax incentives above for additional reading california energy commission abcs of afvs
