dese rt terrain will h ave on the conduct of operations and to introduce commanders and staff officers to thedifferent tactics and procedures i nvolved in these operation s 2 the essential doct rine and principles for military operations do not change because of the altered terrain conditions and thus this pu blication complements af m vol i part 1 formation tactics and afm vol 2 part 2 battlegroup tactics it also records those tactical factors that need greater emphasis where dese rt conditions af fect operations scope 3desert operations is split into three parts part deals with combined rms operation s the purpose of which is to pro vide guide for use by commander s staff officers and regimental planners in units and to some extent at formation level when operating in dese rt condi tions it describes the ef fects that this nvironment will h ave on combat opera tions the functions in combat the empl oyment of pa rticular weapon systems and the tactics used by the combat rms b part b deals with aspects that conce rn the individual how he rvives lives and operates in these regions and is designed for the young officer and nco as basis fu rther instruction it provides some tactical features about m ove ment of troops and some basic tactical features about operating in such condi tions part b concludes with some details about the extra individual and collec tive training needed for desert operations c part c is histo rical supplement which gi ves an insight into h ow soldiers h ave operated in the dese rt during previous campaigns 4 nuclear and biological weapons h ave not been used in these nvironmental condi tions and although chemical weapons h ave been used in rthern iraq during the 1980s the general prospect for their use in the future is considered to be remot nevertheless this assessment m ay change given the growing proli feration of nu clear weapons systems and the scope for rapidly producing biological and chemical agents many nations already have the ability to produce chemical and biologicalagents and it would be wrong to discount the possible use of these weapons or tooverlook the accumulated kn owledge gained about their ef fects on combat opera tions in these condition s these points are emphasised at greater length in chapter 9 of part aissue 10 dec 9 8 iv5 the implications surrounding the use of technology which became more apparent in the gulf war of 1991 h ave not been fully evaluated yet at formation and unit l evel there are bvious advantages to be gained from the coordinated use of such d evices as remote ground sensors rgs thermal image ry and nigh t vision goggles nvg more significantl the use of atta ck helicopters and the greater use of sup port helicopters in dese rt terrain is subject to dynamic d evelopment these could have significant ef fect on the tactics empl oyed by commander and m ay well speed up the overall tempo of operations 6 every effort has been made to avoid repeating tactical details discussed in other publications however some repetition is necessa ry for clarity and to provide verall coherence within this pu blication 7 in summa ry it is worth noting that the b ritish army has never had specialist dese rt trained units in its peace time organisation but in many campaigns of recent time s troops and h ave had to acquire and use these pa rticular skills and tactical pl oys to counter the ene my the side that best adapts and uses the nvironmental factors to advantage will be successful knowledge preparation and training ar as always the prerequisites for

worldissue 10 dec 98 1 1chapter i the environment section 1 the military significance of deserts background 1 most of the worlds deserts lie along the subtropical regions on either side of the equatorial belt where the rainfall is under 250 mm 984 ins year see map in figure11 over most of the north african and arabian deserts it is less than 150 mm 59ins and only 30 mm 12 ins near cairo although inhospitable tribes people live ontheir margins and in oases moving with their camels and goats to exploit whateverwater and vegetation there is wide range of animals reptiles and insects haveadapted themselves to eke out meagre existence the map also shows theneighbouring steppe country because its open terrain has many of the characteristicsof desert from the point of view of military operations particularly in the dry season 2 whereas in the past deserts were seen primarily as obstacles to invasion and states were content to shield behind them the discovery and exploitation of minerals oil andgas have obliged governments to secure their assets against potential threats fromhostile and predatory neighbours militarily the control of desert area may be asimportant as using it as means of defence or of getting at an objective on the far side 1 while deserts provided serious military obstacles to armies in the days of cavalry andanimal transport the advent of the internal combustion engine made it less difficultalthough by means easy to fight in and to cross them the setting 3 the desert is harsh environment punishing to both men and machines in order to survive to fight and to win the limitations imposed by terrain and climate have to beunderstood and provided for equipment and tactics need to be modified and adaptedto account for dusty and rugged landscape where the temperature may range fromtorrid to freezing and visibility may reduce from thirty miles to as many feet in fewminutes section 2 terrain variety 4 deserts provide an infinite variety of terrain the basic land forms are similar to those in other parts of the world but the top soil has disappeared through combination of 1 control of the khuzestan and kirkuk oilfields was amongst the objectives of the protagonists in theiraniraq war in the second world war the egyptian and libyan deserts provided on the one hand adefence in depth for the nile delta and the suez canal for the commonwealth forces and on the other anobstacle to be traversed to evict the axis forces from their bases in tripoli and tunisia sinai has beenused as shield by both egypt and israel in 1967 and 1973issue 10 dec 98 1 2lack of water heat and wind erosion to give deserts their characteristic stark appearance the bedrock may be covered by layer of flat sand or gravel or mayhave been exposed by erosion other familiar features are sand dunes and sandseas escarpments and gebels wadis and depressions the military implications ofthese features are examined below sand 5 thin layer of hard sand on shallow even rock base provides good fast going motorable in any direction up to 60 mph tracks made by wheeled vehicles or tankslast indefinitely but as time passes they lose their sharpness of definition and collecta sand infilling following period of heavy rain an extensively used track sets likeconcrete and remains for decades an experienced desert soldier can judge the ageof track roughly which may provide useful intelligence in those parts of the desertwhich are not laced with them 2 2 contrary to popular belief sand seas are not the main features of deserts only 30 in arabia10 in the sahara and 2 in the deserts of north america6 thick layer of sand about one metre deep on rock base makes for bad going with the inconvenience of constant towing or digging out sand blown into soft hillocksagainst bushes is also bad going and should be avoided 7 sand sea passable on winters morning before the sun burns off the hard crust formed by the dew is difficult to cross later in the day or in the hot season 3 8 sand dunes occur in two varieties issue 10 dec 98 1 3ajumbled dunes of deep sand virtually impassable to wheels and to all but light widetracked vehicles brazor backed dunes blown into series of waves at right angles to the prevailing wind with shallow gradient leading up the windward side to knifeedged crestand an abrupt descent on the leeward side vehicle movement is possible withthe grain of the country along the valley bottoms between the dunes but difficultacross the grain gravel 9 flat gravel surface provides excellent going in all directions the main problem in flat featureless desert whether gravel or sandy is concealment there is usually butnot always some dead ground to provide cover from direct observation from groundop concealment from the air is virtually impossible digging gives protection but canbe conspicuous rock 10 bare rock is generally rough and sometimes deeply pitted ledges make driving difficult cut tyres damage vehicles and tear boots digging in is slow and laboriousbusiness requiring drills and explosives 11 sangars can be built quickly from loose rocks but because they are visible and vulnerable to any weapon larger than small arms they are only suitable for defenceagainst lightly armed enemy to reduce the incidence of eye wounds sangar wallsneed to be topped with sandbags issue 10 dec 98 1 4mountains and escarpments 12 mountains gebel and escarpments offer major obstacles to movement sometimes for many miles the gaps through them have even greater significance than gapsthrough sand dunes because the ground is much firmer and they are difficult tobypass on the side facing the prevailing wind large sand dunes accumulate whilealluvial fans spread out from gorges on the leeward side the former can offer majorimpediments to movement while the latter are motorable except after heavy rain ifthey are not too deep 13 escarpments provide the good observation associated with hills anywhere and locations for radar to detect air and ground movement deep inside hostile territoryeven quite minor features give their possessors commanding views for manykilometers the construction of defences in rock suffers the disadvantages mentioned in paragraphs 10 and 11 above although bushes and scrub often provide somesparse but useful cover the emplacement and concealment of mines is easy in sandywadis but difficult on rocky slopes plateaux lend themselves to reverse slopepositions but defences are difficult to site and conceal on razorbacked ridges 14 low escarpments offer good defensive position facing in either direction the defender holding the rim with the cliff immediately behind him can tuck his commandposts and mortars in at the foot of the escarpment and carry out forward replenishment in its lee with measure of immunity from all but high angle indirect firehowever he has little depth to his position unless similar parallel escarpment runswithin mutually supporting distance behind it the defender whose escarpment faces issue 10 dec 98 1 5the enemy has the advantage of better observation and can make full use of the gentle reverse slope to site defensive positions in depth sometimes the prevailing wind pilesup low ridge of sand on top of the escarpment to provide useful cover bow windowshaped escarpments turn the gentle slope into semicircular saucershapeddepression offering the defender holding the outside edge of the rim an excellentconcentric fire trap but again depth defender facing the opposite way on thesame kind of feature holds strong position with refused flanks wadis 15 dried watercourses wadis vary from wide but barely perceptible depressions of soft sand dotted with bushes to deep steepsided ravines the former are seriousobstacle to movement only nuisance because the bushes and tussocks of grassoften grow on small hummocks combined with soft sand they make for slow goingin low gear steepsided wadis offer more serious impediment to tracks and wheelsbecause they are only passable in few places without engineer effort the sand inwadi beds can be mined usually only by hand because of rocks and tussocks toprovide useful obstacle 16 there is often motorable track at the bottom of dried watercourse which may provide the only practicable route through gebel or an escarpment wadis providecover from ground observation and possibilities for camouflage against visual airreconnaissance however if there is wet season they are liable to sudden flashflooding even though the rain may fall in gebel many miles away the consequencesfor the unwary may be serious particularly at night when men can be drowned in theirbivouacs issue 10 dec 98 1 6salt marshes 17 salt marsh sebkha is treacherous especially near the coast or in depressions there wet sebkha may be impassable away from the coast and on higher groundwhere it drains better sebkha may be passable the day after rain or even later on thesame day tracks have little difficulty in negotiating it but wheels bog down if turnedsuddenly turns should be made gradually and vehicles should not travel in the tracksof those in front because even in good weather the thin dry brittle crust soon breaksup as sebkha absorbs moisture it often darkens to provide warning if sebkha canbe avoided it should be but there may be occasions when risk is worth taking section 3 climate extremes of climate 18 because most meteorological stations are located near the coast or on high ground there is lack of accurate records and information on desert climates deserts areoften hotter or colder than the available statistics indicate the highest officiallyrecorded temperature is 58c 1364f for the libyan and mexican deserts and thelowest 4555c 50f for the gobi desert 3 3 the highest surface temperature recorded is for the mojave desert california 94c 201f wellbefore that temperature is reached objects in direct sunlight are too hot to touch issue 10 dec 98 1 719 there is also wide range of temperature variation between the heat of midday and early afternoon and the chill of night for example as much as 40c 72f in sinaisimilarly there are marked seasonal changes in temperature in winter the cruelblast of cold air blows down the gulf from the north such marked temperaturechanges produce heavy dew at night consequently pullovers and warm clothingare needed after dark and gunners have to keep constant watch on the changingmeteorological data heavy dew causes bare metal particularly weapon parts to rustquickly 20 deserts near the southern mediterranean shore are perhaps the most bearable the coastal strip is cold and often wet in the winter subject to sand storms in march andhot in the summer breeze usually gets up as the sun heats the surface and diesaway at sunset often to blow from the opposite direction at night south of the meagrewinter rainbelt about 180 kilometres 100 miles from the coast the sahara is dry andthe summers are scorching in the arabian peninsula the climate along the coast isuncomfortably humid in the summer but the temperature seldom rises above 39c100f in winter the littoral along the southern rim of the peninsula is pleasant61c 80f in the gulf the winter days are sufficiently chilly for warm clothing andsometimes wet enough for waterproofs the summers are hot and humid near thecoast and inland the heat is so torrid and oppressive in the rub khali the emptyquarter of southeastern arabia that it may be wise to rest under the shade of avehicle canopy or hessionbacked camouflage net in the middle of the day unlesscompelling operational necessity forces one to move or fight away from the coastthe iraqi desert is blisteringly hot in the summer 50c 122f or more and cold inthe winter frosts occur on northern iraqi winter nights the occasional oases likekufra and siwa in the sahara cover quite large areas and provide some shade anda supply of water wind and sand 21 even without wind the telltale clouds of dust raised by wheels tracks and marching troops give away movement wind aggravates the problem as the day gets warmerand the wind increases the dust signatures of vehicles may drift downwind for severalhundred metres in many deserts prevailing wind blows steadily from one point ofthe compass for most of the year switching to another for the remaining months toprovide the soldier with rough and ready sense of direction the equinoctial galesraise huge sandstorms which rise to several thousand feet and may last for severaldays at time in winter and spring the temperature rises sharply in the hot windswhich blow sand in from the sahara while gales and sandstorms in the winter can bebitterly cold muzzle blast shell bursts and the movement of tracks and wheels raisethick dust clouds which can reduce visibility to few yards orientation and directionkeeping become difficult and unexpected contacts with the enemy can take place withlittle or warning the effect of dust and sand on surveillance aids is discussed inchapter 3 22 sandstorms are liable to blow up suddenly and stop just as quickly interfering with the timings of military plans sand gets into everything and in thick sandstormmovement is slow and difficult satellite navigation systems make it possible to keepdirection and locate ones position accurately in the worst of conditions the limitingissue 10 dec 98 1 8factors are the damage inflicted by masses of blown sand on the moving parts of machinery and the lack of visibility it is only safe to drive when the ground to becovered is known to be good going in thick sandstorm one should remain undercover shirts must be worn sleeves pulled down the head neck and eyes coveredup sand goggles are invaluable but blown sand still gets inside if it is absolutelynecessary to leave cover even for few yards one should keep in touch with vehicleor trench by letting out length of string or cable to avoid getting lost 23 the wind can be as trying as the heat lashing face arms and exposed skin with stinging cloud of fine blown sand sand gets into eyes nose mouth throat lungsears hair and reaches every part of the body even speaking and listening can bean effort hats and camouflage veils can be blown away maps are ripped off theirboards 24 continual exposure to blown sand is exhausting and tempers become frayed operations come to an abrupt halt in sandstorm and the side whose desert trainingenables it to get back into action quicker when it subsides has the tactical edge for afew vital minutes even when there is not enough blown sand to impede movementstrong winds drown out most sounds and the first indication of hostile contact maybe casualty wind and blown sand hide small arms weapon signatures and makelocation of the enemy difficult and degrade the performance of lasers and thermalimagers such conditions hinder the observation of all types of fire 25 drivers have to observe dust discipline moving slowly and carefully in exposed forward areas where clouds of sand thrown up by reckless driving may give awaytactical dispositions and draw enemy fire even when air supremacy is availablevehicles should move well apart to avoid collisions in the clouds of dust thrown up bywheels and tracks during controlled moves traffic lanes should be separated by asafe distance whenever possible in rear areas dust can be serious nuisance in issue 10 dec 98 1 9headquarters administrative echelons combat service support css installations and rest areas tracks may be oiled or surfaced by mixinplace techniques to reducethe problem as well as to provide better surface for heavy vehicles where this isnot possible traffic patterns may be established to direct vehicles downwind of campsand bivouacs and into car parks to control the annoyance oiled tracks becomeslippery after rain special routes have to be set aside and marked for tracked vehiclesto avoid damage to roads and tracks used by wheels crossing places between trackand wheel routes must be properly engineered light 26 visibility is excellent in the early morning and good in the evening looking downsun conversely visibility is very bad looking upsun there is as distinct tacticaladvantage in manoeuvring to engage the enemy downsun in the desert as there wasin seeking the weather gauge at sea in the days of sail as the ground heats up ashimmer develops in the middle of the morning which turns into heat haze at middayand mirage in the afternoon objects appear to float about separate and mergetogether so that at 1000 metres vehicles and equipment become unrecognizable forsurveillance and target acquisition aids as well as the unaided eye high ground givingobservation above the heat haze is at premium even small hillock just fewmetres above the desert floor is sufficient because thermal imagery gives clearpicture through the heat shimmer it provides better observation and accuracy ofengagement than any other system there is one exception to the good quality ofvision in the early morning near the coast heavy mist may form overnighthowever the rising sun usually clears it within half an hour or so issue 10 dec 98 1 1027 the foreshortening of shadows in the middle of the day reduces the sense of perspective adding to the recognition problem it also makes range estimation withthe eye1 difficult especially when there are landmarks the margin of error is manytimes greater than in european terrain where horizons are shorter and there are plentyof objects like houses and pylons to lend sense of magnitude and scale forexample looking downsun an object can appear to be only half the distance awaythan it really is hence the usefulness of laser rangefinders and aimoff fed into opticalsights by computer haze and changes of light looking towards or away from the sunadd still further to the problem of judging distance light reflected from glass or talccan be seen for 40 miles and will cut through haze to give away position which wouldotherwise be hidden from the enemy 28 moisture on the ground is reflected by the clouds normally the reflection is sand coloured but within 20 or 30 miles of the sea the clouds acquire bluish sheen if asoldier is not too sure where he is this phenomenum can be reassuring 29 oil wells and installations set on fire by withdrawing enemy may produce thick clouds of black smoke which drift for miles by day the smoke dims or even hides the sunwith reduced visibility and shadows to give sense of perspective judging distanceand identifying the enemy becomes more difficult by night the glare from the firesmay help movement but enable troops in position to spot moving enemy first closeair support becomes harder to control and because gound to air recognition is moredifficult there is greater risk of attacks on friendly troops night 30 full moon almost turns night into day one can see for miles and even read map quarter moon gives sufficient light to drive without aids with moon or just thincrescent the night is pitch black especially in deserts near the coast where cloudcover at certain times of the year leaves ambient light let alone stars fornavigational use should other aids fail however movement on the darkest of nightsin all but the worst going is now possible with satellite navigation system and thermalimagery image intensification needs some ambient light even with aids movementacross very rocky and difficult ground is still slow and frustrating on the darkest ofnights progress on foot is possible but slow and in the absence of satellitenavigation aid with well trained navigation party the calculation of bearing anddistance can be very accurate in very bad rocky going it may even be quicker tomarch 31 the phases of the moon are an important factor in planning vehicle movement at night when the moon is in its first quarter there is sufficient light until midnight with fullmoon it is light all night and when the moon is in its last quarter driving is possible inthe second half of the night visibility is so good in moonlight that with just quartermoon vehicle dust can be seen for miles so that while movement is possible it is hardto conceal night observation driving and sighting systems have eroded the coverdarkness provided for rest and maintenance as in the second world war oneconsequence is that movement may only pass undetected from the ground if coveredby terrain features another is that now the 24 hour day battle has become realitycommanders and their soldiers will suffer from exhaustion much sooner than beforeissue 10 dec 98 1 11operation desert storm was concluded in four days even so everyone who took part in it was very tired at the time of the ceasefire in future commanders will have to planto deal with the fatigue problem perhaps by organizing individual reliefs at the lowerend of the scale and phasing operations to allow fresh formations or units to take overfrom exhausted ones at the upper end of the scale rpvs and satellites make surprisemoves difficult to achieve 32 noise carries great distances on quiet night adding still further to the difficulty of hiding secret move to gain surprise listening posts are an essential element of anyprotective screen on the other hand wind can drown the sound of engines andtracks and the possibilities for deception are considerable rain and thunderstorms 33 rainfall in the desert varies from one day in the year to intermittent showers throughout the winter usually far too much rain falls far too quickly to organizecollection on systematic basis the water soon soaks into the ground to cover thesurface with beautiful but brief sheen or runs in torrents down the wadis cisternsbuilt by local people or left over from vanished civilizations are to be found where thereis sufficient rainfall and while some wells and oases are replenished by local wintershowers most rely on subsurface seepage and artesian systems filled from sourceshundreds of miles away and centuries ago 34 while rain may bind sandy surface to provide transient good going like beach when the tide ebbs it may turn loam into an impassable morass rainstorms can be verylocal immobilising only one side to allow the other freedom of manoeuvre to gain atactical advantage when storm is approaching vehicles should be moved on to rockor high ground if the tactical situation permits heavy rain is often accompanied bysevere thunderstorms lightning strike is serious hazard in the open desert andprecautions to protect men and equipment are necessary vegetation issue 10 dec 98 1 1235 apart from the bushes and tussocks of grass growing in wadis already mentioned in connection with going see paragraph 15 above trees such as acacias also grow inwadis particularly near gebel to provide local landmarks and reference points highmountains in the middle of desert may attract sufficient rain to support carefullynurtured agricultural system such as on top of the gebel akhdar in oman 36 some plants like the desert gourd have vines which grow over the ground for up to 45 metres 15 feet others have wide lateral root systems just below the surfaceto take advantage of rain and dew while still others grow deep roots to tap subsurfacewater 37 palm trees usually indicate water within metre of the surface salt grass within two metres cottonwood and willows up to four metres apart from indicating the presenceof water some plants are edibleissue 10 dec 98 2 1chapter 2 operational factors in desert operations section 1 the potential threat background 1 history and experience shows that desert regions in the past have been crossed and recrossed by armies looking for decisive military result elsewhere to end thecampaign in more recent times these regions have generally formed geographical barrier between two or more states and it is this that tends to indicate that theregions may well be the first areas where combat starts in any new campaign 1 2 the vast scales and remoteness involved in the worlds desert regions precludes precise definition of any generic enemy however some outline definition is necessary as an essential background against which operational planning and tacticalprocedures can be set and from which training programmes can subsequently bederived 3 since 1989 the threat of soviet style invasion has virtually disappeared but it is entirely feasible to note that this large and potentially serious threat has been replaced by more aggressive form of nationalism or self determination based onother cultural values and that fresh tensions could appear almost anywhere in theworld including desert regions requests for assistance to the or nato by beleaguered nation states in vulnerable areas could result in some form of militarydeployment new technology and scientific improvement has also improved livingconditions to such an extent that it is now possible to take refuge and operate in andfrom desert regions on near permanent basis this form of activity has alreadyoccurred in morocco and algeria planning assumptions 4 overt armed aggression by the regular forces of one or more nations against an other in one of the many desert regions of the world is the most likely potential threatthat could develop this aggression could take many forms but at worst it could bean all out war in which these geographically hostile regions are used as the battleground for obtaining decisive result it is this assumption that forms the backdropto the subsequent chapters of this publication enemy characteristics 5 the various locations of the worlds desert regions do not preclude potential emy in the region from having large and generally well equipped armed forces butmore significantly having access to modern weapons systems and military resourcesit would thus be wise to assume that any future enemy is likely to be adequately 1 the gulf wars of 198086 and 199091issue 10 dec 98 2 2trained and equipped and could sustain land and air operations in these regions for some time 6 beyond this general categorisation it is well known that resistance fighters gueril and insurgents have used desert terrain to build their organisation and harassthe state or occupation forces these actions could take place within given theatreof operations for general war enemy aims 7 it should be assumed that an enemy has gained the ability and experience to fight in desert regions similarly it has to be assumed that the enemy has the ability toconduct operations on larger and more coordinated scale at up to formation leveland that he would aim to dominate and control areas and to defeat an adversary asquickly as possible while relying on firm base to sustain operations 8 an enemy could also take advantage of the same operational principles that we adopt and would doubt utilise the same sort of military resources to similarlevel of sophistication however the constraints and limitations that affect fighting indesert regions will apply equally to the enemy and this if used to advantage couldcontribute to his defeat if the operational initiative can be obtained section 2 joint and combined operations background 9 following government instructions to deploy force for operations in desert areas decisions would be taken within the mod on the type and size of force to be sent andon its

in conjunction with multinational allianceor coalition is much more likely ajp1a jwpo10 and adp vol i operations all provide further details on joint and allied cooperation coalitionsalliances 11 whether any military grouping would come under nato commonwealth or coalition auspices remains to be seen but whatever the circumstances there wouldneed to be integrated command and control arrangements 12 it is also likely that the british authorities would nominate self contained formation for commitment to such operations although it is perfectly feasible to nominate onlya formation headquarters or even individual trained staff officers observers andspecialist to assist other nations or governments 13 whatever the british contribution an awareness of the main characteristics of work ing within group of other military partners is important these are set out in chapter 6 of adp operations and will require careful studyissue 10 dec 98 2 3jointcombined operations 14 any british force committed to operations in desert region will invariably be joint at the appropriate level of command and will be working to single joint force commander 15 in the absence of alliance eg nato

16 an army trained and equipped for operations in temperate climates requires both specialist training and additional equipment for deployment to desert region thisessential prior preparation may engender apprehension and uncertainty amongstsoldiers who have never experienced these conditions and environment and couldplace additional pressures on commanders at all levels 17 the use of mission command and main effort 2 will be just as important as tools of command in desert conditions as elsewhere the commander who restricts flexibility by issuing overdetailed orders is likely to restrain his subordinates from usingtheir initiative and may miss the opportunities that changes in the general situationand the weather might present by designating main effort commander will beindicating where his priorities lie thus allowing subordinates to act in accordancewith the mission and in the absence of new orders 3 18 the military emphasis in deserts is likely to be on formation operations and ducted over extended distances and under difficult communication conditions therewill be danger that units may be cut off in these situations rigid style of command will not thrive in such an environment and subordinates should be encouragedto act in the absence of orders command and control c2 19 organisation the organisation of c2 in desert operations will depend upon the type of operation envisaged and the extent to which local conditions affect normalprocedures mobility will be one of the main command tactics and it may be necessary to reduce the size of headquarters in order that mobility can be maintained 2 see afm formation tactics for details of main effort 3 note that main effort is not merely the tool of operational commanders in desert operations par ticularly where resources are limited and lines of communication lengthy the use of main effort in combatservice support planning will also be crucialissue 10 dec 98 2 420relationships the command and control

headquarters because desert operations are so mobile it is necessary to have two identical main headquarters for an armoured formation each has its ownresident staff of watchkeepers signallers drivers administrators and its own commander rather than calling them main and alternate giving the impression that thelatter is only standin they may be designated alpha and bravo whichevercomplex is stationary open and manned by the primary staff is known as main whilethe other is moving to its next location the groups of vehicles making up thefunctional clusters should be kept as small as possible each should be surroundedby 2 to 3 metre high sand berm for protection when static if the commander hasa separate tactical headquarters it will normally rejoin at night in the absence ofsufficient armoured vehicles to form hard rover group the formation commanderand his headquarters may control the battle from one of the two halves of maindeployed specially for the purpose 22 rear headquarters the rear headquarters will be located with the support group ideally it should be armoured and capable of being split into two like main ifresources will not run to this sufficient communications should be allotted to providerear with stepup leapfrog facility to control the miscellaneous units in the supportgroup wheeled headquarters will suffice 23 visual and electronic pattern in addition formation will usually have at least two communication centres consequently headquarters tend to develop visual andelectronic pattern which it is important to disguise with good camouflage anddeception remoted communication centres help hide the exact location of theheadquarters itself if the campaign lasts long enough the creation of dummyheadquarters and radio emissions may be useful both for survivability and fordeception purposes 4 24artillery it may be expedient to divide the artillery into three functional groups direct support group of field regiments to support the formation

armoured reconnaissance artillery target acquisition andfire support siting 25 dispersion even in the flattest of deserts there are wide depressions and wadi beds with barely noticeable banks but which collect sufficient moisture to grow bushes scrub and patches of coarse grass over very wide area in the absence of deep sidedwadis broken hilly or moonscape country gebel and escarpments scrub mayprovide the best opportunities for camouflage and concealment but at the expense ofdispersion to some extent this can be offset by computer technology and repeatinformation displays round the dispersed branches however the operations andintelligence staffs should be kept together in the centre of the alpha and bravoheadquarters layouts conscious effort has to be made to keep all branches of thestaff in contact and fully informed of developing situation 26 survivability as survivability is so important the inconveniences of dispersion has to be accepted in open desert protection and concealment can be obtained bydigging in tracked vehicles below ground level using engineer equipment to raiseberms of sand round groups of vehicles helps to hide them from enemy groundobservation and provides protection from the splinters of enemy artillery fire 27 security although headquarters has to be able to protect itself from the minor threats of low level infiltration it should be sited within the defence pattern of itssubordinate formations and units to avoid being overrun or having to move at crucialpoint of battle even so distances and dispersion are so great in the desert that afar more substantial force is needed to protect formation headquarters thanelsewhere it should include reconnaissance antitank and mortar elements inaddition to the normal rifle and gpmg component protection group should also becovered by the envelope of an existing air defence system apart from terrain andprotection key feature in the siting of headquarters is ease of communication communications planning 28 expert advice desert battles are often fought at speed over wide area involving bewildering changes in the situation control and the passage of information on which it depends are of vital importance good communications capable of meetingevery eventuality have to be guaranteed and this can only be achieved by carefulplanning the operations staff will be guided by their communications advisers inselecting sites and alternative positions for formation and unit headquarters seefurther details of communications lessons learned in recent major desert exerciseduring

630 reconnaissance and siting depending on the type of radio equipment used line of sight communication involving intervisibility between two high points remoted from the headquarters concerned may be important because desert cartography may notbe entirely reliable it will be necessary to carry out reconnaissance to confirm thatline of sight communication is possible between the two points which from the mapappear to be intervisible rebroadcast stations will be needed to overcome napofthe earth screening problems 31 restrictions on the use of the frequency spectrum all combat net radio frequencies are affected to some extent by extremes of temperature the problemswith high frequency communications are that the sky wave is more affected byvariations in the atmosphere and the ground wave is absorbed quicker by sand thanby the soil of temperate climates very high frequencies are prone to thermal ductinga phenomenon which occurs when air temperature inversions cause air ductsbetween layers of the atmosphere relatively close to the ground vhf signals may betransmitted unpredictably at different times of the day over immense distances to bethe cause of long range interference and chance interceptions only very close andcareful management of frequencies will overcome the problem more generousallocation of frequencies will be needed and this in turn points to the necessity ofhaving one central authority for the allocation of frequencies in any multinational forceto provide all informed communications over the wide area occupied by formationin the desert the near vertical incidence high frequency skywave technique employing suitable horizontal antennas should be used skip distances are greater andfrequencies have to be changed at night to overcome these limitations long groundspikes are essential and antennae should be elevated whenever possible evenduring short halts 32 emission and frequency control equally the need to control or mask electronic and radio emissions has bearing on the siting of headquarters the emissioncontrol policy should be decided by the threat and should be looked upon as vitalelement of any deception plan in some desert areas will have good communicationinfrastructure of their own supplemented by commercial networks such as thoseprovided by the oil industry on the other hand in desert where there are few civiltelecommunications there is requirement for extra radios relay systems andfrequencies so that frequency control assumes greater significance 33 land lines vast amounts of land line are needed to provide communications within headquarters units and logistic installations whenever practicable cables should beburied whether buried or on poles well established vehicle traffic pattern is neededto preserve both communications and vehicles 34 trunk communications multichannel radio and satellites offer the most economi cal means of providing trunk communications in static conditions in mobile operations the trunk communication system may be unable to keep up with the pace of thebattle and reliance may have to be placed on vehicle antennae there is limit towhich trunk system can be stretched satellite system is invaluable for filling thegap between the various groups within the formation additional single channel radioaccess scra tracked vehicles are requiredissue 10 dec 98 2 735movement in mobile desert operations the movement of headquarters is likely to be far more frequent than in other environments two methods of changing position maybe used if headquarters has main and rear elements in addition to its tactical headquarters each may be split into two groups so that one is always in situ and open in the event of nuclear threat this arrangement also provides measureof survivability b headquarters with tactical main and stepup elements only may not be able to follow the same procedure the alternative method of operating is for thecommander to keep his tactical headquarters well forward with main morethan tactical bound behind the latter will catch up with the former wheneverit halts long enough for it to do so the stepup may be used to range wellforward relaying messages between main and forward units when necessaryin static conditions it may be necessary to move headquarters periodically inthe interests of security and survivability section 4 the conduct of operations concepts 36 this publication deals primarily with how to operate tactically in desert conditions wherever they may occur the land areas are normally vast and generally inhabitedby very few people as with other military operations there is clear advantage incapturing or holding areas of vital ground such as passes over mountains or highground where movement is canalised perhaps because of going restrictions 37 there is however every reason to prevent the enemy from making use of the terrain features and weather conditions to sustain his operations this can be achieved byseeking to dominate and control critical terrain and the airspace above it in such away that the enemy cannot operate there without disruption to his plans 38 when this is achieved the ground can be utilised to canalise or restrict enemy move ment which then can lead to more aggressive activity to destroy the enemys will andcapability to fight 39 for commander the first operational task could be to regain the tactical initiative from the enemy by establishing control and domination over the designated area ofoperations prior to making any further plans to defeat the enemy once this hasbeen established operations on larger and more coordinated scale can then begin 40 experience from history and previous campaigns in desert terrain indicates that at an operational level the use of bold thrusts that move directly to areas of vital interest while making use of deception to mask the obvious moves of reserves couldprovide the basis for military success the terrain weather conditions and seasonalchanges could have an overwhelming effect on the chances of success or failureand certainly alter the pace and tempo of operations commander who ignores theopportunities afforded by the terrain and changes in weather conditions will not succeedissue 10 dec 98 2 841 similarly commander will need to arrange his forces in such manner to make best use of the resources available the grouping and regrouping of forces to takeaccount of the task in hand will offer the greater potential for success the acquisition of the attack helicopter and the combat groupings that can be generated fromthis weapons platform have to be exploited to the fullest extent 42 there will undoubtedly be constraints and limitations that affect commanders abil ity to conduct operations in desert regions but these do not alter the approach tooperations described in chapter 2 of adp vol 1 operations and in more detail in afm vol 1 pt 1 formation tactics attacking an enemys cohesion 43 in the desert attacking and fragmenting an enemys cohesion and rendering his resistance ineffective is deemed to be potentially more rewarding than other tacticsat least initially 44 breaking cohesion can be achieved in many ways and commander will need to be flexible in utilising any number of factors to tighten the noose until it becomes astranglehold the main techniques that can be applied are firepower the selective application of firepower to attack vital bases commu nication sites command posts and logistic installations are probably those targets which have the greatest worth in desert terrain b tempo the rate of activity in relation to the enemy is the key factor the terrain will inevitably speed the pace of battle for all sides in comparison with operations elsewhere but if commander can make decisions quickly and controlthe pace of operations at faster rate than the enemy he will quickly gain theoperational initiative c simultaneous operations in conjunction with tempo this technique seeks to overload the enemy commander so much that he is forced to divert time andresources away from his main operational aims d surprise there are many possibilities for achieving surprise both in timing and location and these should be applied at every suitable opportunity across alllevels of command 45 liaison officers at all levels of command are essential they should be suitably chosen and briefed and capable of moving rapidly around the operational area probably by helicopter given suitable radio links liaison officers can back up and endorse the commanderss control of operations as well as confirming any changes intactical planning or reporting developments as they occur this should allow commander to be at the place of best information during periods of activity combat identification 46 positive identification of enemy targets is always difficult but in the desert and with extended visibility it is even more complicated the danger of contact between friendlyissue 12 feb 02 2 9forces is permanent hazard of operations and clear definition of boundaries objectives and other ground locations is necessary to reduce the change of thisdanger 47 misunderstandings and accidents cause casualties prejudice security and lower confidence sops have to contain precise instructions for identification both on theground and in the air policy for the accurate location and marking of mines andtraps should also be clearly defined section 5 the functions in combat general 48 the principles of war are the basis for the successful employment of military force in combat the guidance of these broad principles is translated into operational concepts which are known as functions in combat the practical expression of thefunctions in combat is combat power and physical capabilities when guided bydoctrine and with the human dimension added the result is fighting power whichdefines the ability to fight 49 these functions in combat their validation and their use on the battlefield are cov ered fully in afm formation tactics additional factors which apply to desert envi ronment are mentioned in subsequent paragraphs command 50 the sheer scale and nature of desert environment make the achievement of good and effective command and control c2 more difficult than elsewhere unless the aims of any military activity are very simple clear and direct 51 realistic timetables and timings based on sound practical knowledge of deserts are the key to successful tactical operations if in doubt plan for two or three times thetime it takes to achieve the task elsewhere particularly for movement by night 52 once operations begin the problems of command and control in practical terms devolve down to junior commanders very quickly simplicity is thus the key to planning at formation level commander should make his operational aim and themethod of achieving it very clear not least because it enhances control it is important to note that good workable and well rehearsed sops which include drills forlost soldiers as well as communications and medevac procedures are essential toallow for effective devolution of command and control 53 however large element of initiative and latitude has to be builtin to any plan to allow subordinate commanders the ability to overcome the changing pace of operations manoeuvre 54 manoeuvre enables friendly forces to engage and destroy the enemy this is vital particularly in the desert the use of engineers to improve mobility and equally toissue 12 feb 02 2 10prevent the use of critical terrain by the enemy is battle winning factor for tactical commander 55 sensible planning by formation staffs taking full account of the capabilities of the soldier his weapons systems and his level of training will prevent over ambitiousassumptions about movement and hence manoeuvre in desert operations thiscombined with an appropriate allocation of weapon systems will also keep the necessary balance and cohesion in the grouping of forces during moves and also allowsfor unexpected contacts or delays 56 in the desert mobility which forms major part in achieving manoeuvrability is three dimensional factor of great value commander who can make positive use ofthe ground the air and suitable terrain to move troops and supplies will gain thetactical advantage that mobility provides these are ground mobility the speed of movement will depend entirely on the terrain movement up and over challenging geographical features in hot conditions is difficult and time consuming keeping to known tracks ridges and higher groundis usually the easiest method of movement but correspondingly it may be themost obvious route to an enemy b helicopter support the availability and use of helicopters for observation reconnaissance attack protection and transportation significantly enhances acommanders ability to monitor and develop military operations in desert areasmany of these techniques have been practised elsewhere in other types ofterrain and are not new but in this environment the opportunity to profoundlyaffect the conduct of operations is enormous nevertheless their use in theseareas will require particular techniques this enhancement also provides alogistic penalty in terms of wear on rotors and turbine blades this has to betempered because helicopter payload and duration reduces with hot and high conditions at midday in high temperatures some helicopters may only be capable of flying for few minutes with reduced payloads b even with nvd night flying operations may be constrained by lack of ambient light during periods of moon or mist light levels may fallbelow the minimum necessary for night flying firepower 57 desert conditions by themselves do not reduce the effectiveness of the firepower available to modern armies however the problem of observation and accuratetarget acquisition particularly in poor visibility can inhibit the use of longer rangeweapons and can restrict the advantage of heavier supporting weapons despitethis artillery and mortar fire of all types can be particularly effective in halting anenemys advance or his withdrawal in addition artillery has the capacity to disruptlines of communication and contribute substantially to both deep and close operationsissue 12 feb 02 2 1158 manportable rocket launchers grenade launchers as well as hand grenades have all provided their worth against armoured vehicles and bunkers under almost any ditions and their usefulness in the open battle areas available in desert operationscould be enhanced 59 the firepower available in attack helicopters can materially assist troops operating in the desert provided suitable visibility is present protection 60 all round protection whether on the move or halted is absolutely essential at all times in defence the subtle use of any natural features available the relative lack of cover during daylight from both ground air and sensor observation can reducethe opportunity for infiltration deception and ambush strict track discipline andcontrol is necessary to keep enemy observation to the minimum compatible withgood security information and intelligence 61 general as in every other theatre of war major difficulty faced by the commander will be the problems encountered by his g2 staff in providing him with accurate and timely intelligence in desert operations these difficulties will be exacerbated andwhile the intelligence cycle see jsp 120 manual of service intelligence for further details remains unaltered by external influences the collection of information andintelligence and its subsequent dissemination will be made infinitely more difficult bythe speed and pace of operations 62 direction in defining his critical information requirements cirs the commander should consider the effects of any desert terrain on his own and the enemys operations the battlefield area evaluation bae carried out in the course of his intelligence

impact on the dissemination of intelligence allowance has to be made for the fact that intelligence together with plans and orders may take longer to reach its intended recipient anddecision and planning times may have to be adjusted accordingly novel methodsfor the dissemination of intelligence may have to be devised and adopted and at theissue 12 feb 02 2 12planning state of operations

this equipment has not so far been used extensively in adesert environment it has the potential to bring considerable improvement in surveillance capability to these types of operation while

support css 70 the principles of good combat service support pertain equally to desert operations as to any other operational area but the nature of the environment and its conditions could impose some severe and real constraint on normal operating procedures andmethods of support adp vol 3 logistics provides general background on the principles of css 71 it should be normal practice to assume that the enemy could have the ability to cut or disrupt the lines of communication alternative means of resupply and casualtyevacuation should always be considered and contingency plans prepared for such asituation along with sensible plans for protection surveillance and effective communications links 72 planning for css is described in afm vol 1 pt 6 on combat service support and also in afm vol 1 pt 1 formation tactics those aspects that have particular rel evance to desert operations are reiterated below css framework integrated with operational plans should be css plan which provides

stocks and to cater for the unexpectedissue 12 feb 02 2 14c opportunity css activity is best achieved out of contact with an enemy and when this occurs every chance should be taken to resupply evacuate casual ties and to repair equipment in desert operations constant awareness of thecurrent situation is the only sure means of anticipating opportunities or equallyimportant change in the weather conditions an effective css frameworkwill also enhance the ability to react quickly to events as they occur d distance careful balance of factors is needed to ensure that css units are close enough to sustain operations properly but are at sufficient distanceaway to avoid enemy attention in the circumstances of desert operations thisbalance is probably fundamental to the success of any operation and will require constant review by commander and his g1 and g4 staffs the factorsinvolved on any css decision are likely to be the value of destruction the rateof demand distance and duration coupled with weather and terrain there isvery little room for error and it may be appropriate despite the additional overheads to have more forward dumps with fewer stocks in each to offset potential shortages logistic control close application to the principles of command is essential to ensure that the logistic disadvantages of fighting in the desert are overcome astudy of adp vol 2 command and the relevant logistic sections of afm vol 1 pt 1 formation tactics is directly applicable to all unit and formation commanders basic requisite of logistic control in these conditions is that of centralisedplanning at the highest appropriate level followed by rapid decentralised execution in that way the normally scarce resources can be utilised in the mostefficient manner once operations start the problem of communication liaisonand logistic control effectively and rapidly devolve down to subordinate staffand commanders f protection of lines of communication protection and security for the lines of communication between bases and forward troop positions is vital for the cohesion of all operations in desert terrainissue 12 feb 02 2 1annex to chapter 2 communications planning 1 the following additional points concerning communications in desert areas have been obtained from recent large scale exercise in these environmental conditions 2 until suitable replacements for clansman and scra are in service it is not likely that range and reliability of communications can be guaranteed planners and operators should be aware of these shortcomings and make whatever suitable proceduralfixes are possible to overcome this growing problem 3 rising temperatures in desert areas can cause the range and quality of vhf radios to decrease the effects can be minimised by use of acub separating radio sets to allow air to flow between themc using frequencies in the range 5068 mhz as these are least affectedd utilize low power as appropriatee shielding vhf equipments from direct sunlightf reducing temperatures in communication vehicles 4 trunk links suffer from degraded signal strength at dawn and dusk the effects can be minimised by using band 1 frequencies whenever possibleb keeping link lengths downc minimising the use of shf during these periods 5 employ backup system such as inmarset when establishing communicationsissue 10 dec 98 3 1chapter 3 offensive operations section 1 introduction 1a pattern of desert operations the desert and the steppes lend themselves to mobile warfare in its purest form battle there most nearly approaches the theoreticalperfection of the force on force engagement commander will aim to seek decisionsmashing the enemys armour and then surrounding and annihilating the hostileremnants in the open desert ideally this may be achieved by encirclement failingthat pursuit may accomplish the same result the victor will attempt to reach andseize the next defensible position where he will be forced to pause to bring up suppliesand reorganize his loc before pressing on with further advance as in otherenvironments the pace alternates between the frantic activity of battle race to repairand replace battle damage and build up resources for the next trial of strength andlong periods of inaction between them because the open desert lends itself to heavyattrition rates and battles of virtual annihilation the tempo tends to be faster and thedemands on men and machines heavier than in closer country the weaker side willcling to the best defensible position available while the stronger attempts to bypassit where possible or breach and break through it where it is not or to do both whenthe enemy holds an attenuated line stretching miles into open desert from one secureflank opposing forces tend to keep further apart from each other when not engagedin battle than in other environments they are protected by mobile covering forceswhich operate further forward than in closer european terrain

problems for commanders with regard to security and outflankingaction 2 the types of offensive action the five main types of action are covered in the following sections but are preceded by section on reconnaissance and surveillance section 2 reconnaissance and surveillance aims 3the aims of surveillance and reconnaissance are fundamentally fourfold toa provide security against surprise enemy move

deception plan special forces such as the sas may play prominent part in both roles the terrain problem 5 the desert differs from other theatres in the immensity of the space to be watched there will often be an open flank stretching for hundreds of miles and threats candevelop from greater depth much faster than in european terrain observing it forwide enemy outflanking moves and even wider ranging reconnaissance and raidingparties calls for more surveillance and reconnaissance resources than elsewhereaccess to satellite system and arrangements for passing the information it providesquickly to the various headquarters which need it are of immense value it is importantthat all resources are coordinated in comprehensive surveillance and targetacquisition plan the manner in which medium and close ground reconnaissance areused to complement long range surveillance is described later in this section covering force activity 6 time and space factor the distance the covering force operates ahead of and to the flanks of main forces depends upon suitable features upon which to base lineof observation preferably high ground or an obstacle like sand sea with few routesacross it and the time needed to warn troops and especially the force commanderso that he has sufficient time to redeploy his formations or save precious hours in themounting of countermove usually it will operate within mlrs range it will normallyoperate much further forward of the main body than european setting 7 grouping the composition of the covering force will depend on the nature of the ground and the threat while based on an armoured formation reinforced byarmoured reconnaissance regiments and helicopters the forward screen may needextra infantry to hold high ground and defiles engineers to mine vulnerable approaches it will also require some armour and sufficient artillery support to enablethe covering force to maintain itself in position against enemy reconnaissance andminor probing

should be included within the air defence envelopewithin the theatre 8 helicopter support reconnaissance helicopters are an essential element of covering force or screen they can be used to extend the ground surveillancesystems especially to watch the inevitable terrain gaps and to investigate reports ofenemy activity which have been reported by other sources such as the air forcesatellite or radio intercept reconnaissance helicopters work in conjunction with andnormally under the tactical control of the armoured reconnaissance regiment in whosearea they are operating they are vulnerable but in the open desert with its long fieldsissue 12 feb 02 3 3of view it is possible to give them some protection in the visual surveillance role by operating them well behind the forward troops where they can fly sufficiently highand in reasonable safety to obtain good view over the haze and dust they arealso useful for lifting in dismounted op parties with their equipment to placesinaccessible to vehicles and for withdrawing them either on redeployment or if thescreen is driven in attackhelicopters can provide concentration of antitankfirepower quickly to meet sudden threat or in more offensive role to help to destroylucrative targets in order to inflict attrition on the enemy 9 surveillance coverage because darkness still offers opportunities for surprise the night surveillance coverage has to be as thorough as in daytime elevated ops arenot only useful for the extra ground they can cover but also because visibility is muchbetter from level just above the heat haze the role of the covering force is discussedin greater detail in the section on defensive operations reconnaissance 10 function the introduction of satellite imagery and jstars together with improve ments in air reconnaissance have led to revision of the employment of medium and close reconnaissance these sources provide so much information particularly in thedesert that ground reconnaissance longer has to grope blindly for the enemy thevulnerability of reconnaissance vehicles on the move to detection by thermal imageryoperated from stationary vehicles or static ops is far greater in the desert than ineuropean terrain consequently it is more necessary than ever for medium and closereconnaissance to use stealth in the open even in the flatest of deserts there areoccasional declivities and small rises in the ground to give some cover from enemyground surveillance instead of moving forward during an advance on continuousbroad front to make chance contact and suffer unnecessary casualties reconnaissance units can be tasked to answer specific questions based on an analysis ofinformation already available from satellies and other sources such as esm in deepoperations mrls and other divisional assets would normally cover medium reconnaissance when serious opposition is expected and it is necessary to fight forinformation tanks supported by artillery and armoured infantry should

reconnaissance plan the plan will be complementary to the intelligence preparation of the battlefield it will be formulated in conjunction with the air force if the commander has an offensive in mind he and his staff will issue policy concerningnot only the information they need for planning purposes but the pattern ofreconnaissance he wishes to simulate to mislead enemy intelligence as part of thedeception plan 13 extending the range of medium reconnaissance in the desert the opposing forces may be some distance apart and it may be necessary to establish forward patrolbases surreptitiously behind terrain screened from enemy surveillance from whichops and patrols can be sent out on missions to cover large distances it may bepossible to expand on the use of helicopters mentioned earlier to fly patrols forwardunder terrain screening to establish ops to watch the next bound carefully for signsof enemy activity if the information is negative the patrol can be lifted forward to thenext

and raiding 14 roles the main roles of long range reconnaissance and raiding in the desert are athe covert reconnaissance of enemy positions in depth to establish locations and patterns of behaviour while the enemy is unaware that he is being observedburst and coded transmissions can be used to report real time information bthe reconnaissance of enemy headquarters airfields air defence systemsmissile sites and key logistic installations with the aim of attacking them inconjunction with main force operation engaging them with long range artilleryfire or directing armed helicopters or ground attack aircraft on to them eithervisually or using laser designators croute watching to establish traffic patterns and the move of enemy formationsparticularly reserves and newly arrived units

vulnerable to ecmand homing missiles for this reason the ranges of active emitters are usually limitedhowever because there is often more space between opposing forces in the desertthan in european terrain the option to extend the range to acquire early informationis always open but it will have to be balanced against the risk of enemy retaliation 1 24covering the arc of responsibility reconnaissance detachments and ops will be given interlocking arcs of responsibility to ensure that the entire frontage and flanksare covered surveillance devices have limited fields of arc and there is tendencyto concentrate on expected enemy axes of advance at the expense of the remainderof the arc of responsibility which is likely to be wider in the desert than in otherenvironments operators

indisciminate use of illuminants particularly during nightadvance or attack can expose troops to damaging enemy fire up to great distancesin an offensive action the control of battlefield illumination should be vested in theheadquarters which is controlling the operation as whole in defence control willusually be delegated to low level unless the higher formation commanders plan isto lure the enemy into trap in which case some constraints may be placed on theuse of illuminants without reference to his headquarters in the overall plan for battlethe use of illuminants by the air force may also have to be coordinated with the groundplan 26 visual confirmation of sensor sightings turning data into intelligence and from intelligence into targets takes time particularly at the beginning of

air support aircraft and armedattack helicopters intopositions from which they can attack the enemy even more effectively 40 bypassing policy it often pays to bypass stubborn enemy opposition and the open desert provides better opportunities than most environments apart from the constraints imposed by artificial obstacles however bypassing requires room not onlyfor manoeuvre but sufficient space to deploy formation emerging from an enemyobstacle system the commander will determine the policy for bypassing andindicate probably with reference to phase lines where initially enemy positions haveto be reduced later they may be bypassed after reference to him and later stillavoided at discretion provided that their location and strength are reported 41 exploitation as the enemy position is

latter should be able to intervene with good effect against an enemy in the open especiallywhen he is obliged to make major move in reaction to initiatives provided that hisair defence system can be disrupted and degraded 43 the least expensive way of defeating the enemy is by destroying his main armoured forces in mobile battle in the open desert once this has been accomplished theenemy commander is left with the choice of flight or annihilation this may be achievedwithout the deliberate breakthrough battle just described when one or both theenemys flanks are in the air or during pursuit only the former case is consideredin this section the latter is discussed in section 7 the main features of mobileoffensive battle are those of obtaining good information keeping balance betweentroops for use and troops in reserve and knocking the enemy off balance in the battlewith concentration of fire preparation 44 much of the preparatory work will be similar to that for deliberate attack the main differences are highlighted below the time factor the need to be able to act quickly to take advantage of opportunities presented brapid reconnaissance the ability to quickly check or doublecheck information provided to ensure that tactical possibilities actually exist this may need rapidredirection of surveillance cover particularly the use of helicopter reconnaissance to verify information c concentration of force the capability to have forces reorganised and deployed to take the benefit of any tactical opportunities quickly and effectively 45 in addition to these requirements the commander will need to plan ahead to break the enemys decisionaction cycle by use of speed and subterfuge it will probably benecessary to mislead the enemy as to the intended target in order to achieve surprisegreater reliance may need to be placed on the use of feints such as simulate activityin one particular area or distracting the enemys attention in another area 46 in this process of rapid activity simple plans and sound common sense procedures will aid the rapid coordination of plans commanders will need reminding that inrapid and frenetic activity the safety of troops remains paramount one part of thisis to ensure that fatigue does not cut across or inhibit operational activity thecommitment of troops for battle in rotation is well tried system to alleviate fatigue execution 47 concentration and speed aexcept for sufficient troops to hold the enemy frontally and to launch the feint and subsidiary attacks the bulk of the armour should be kept together for the mainissue 10 dec 98 3 22outflanking move and the decisive armoured battle which will follow this does not mean that the main force should use just one route as many parallel routesshould be used as possible both to ease the traffic control movement and logisticproblems and to confuse the enemys intelligence staff however the armourits supporting armoured or mechanized infantry and artillery should be concentrated for the battle and not frittered away in penny packets b concentration is not achieved simply by massing formations and battlegroups which may only provide the enemy with attractive targets but rather by focusingall the available firepower artillery attack helicopters and offensive air in supportof each manoeuvre group eg an armoured brigade in turn to win the fire fightquickly the sequential commitment of manoeuvre groups has the addedadvantage that each one can be replenished once it has secured its objectivethe concentration of fire support and css effort on manoeuvre groupssequentially helps to maintain the momentum of the attack manoeuvre groupsshould be given objectives which are well within their capacity in order to keepup the tempo as well as to minimize casualties c if the enemy has been able to extend his field defences and obstacles far into the desert preliminary breaching operation may be necessary for flankattack if not armour will lead with reconnaissance elements well out in front untilcontact is made armoured or mechanized infantry will follow bound behindready to consolidate ground won by the armour or to

bumps unexpectedly into the enemy or vice versa should not occur in such openterrain nevertheless they have been recurring feature of desert warfare in the pastand are likely to remain so this is not

satellite surveillance are used properly to watch for points of resistanceand the concentration of enemy forces pursuit can be pressed home moredevastatingly than in other types of country planning 78 preparing the pursuit while fighting the battle the pursuit should be part of the plan for an offensive battle or for defensive one in which counterstroke isenvisaged to inflict crushing riposte as the battle begins to go favourably the outlineplans should be adjusted to take advantage of the situation if possible fresh troopsshould be kept in reserve to head pursuit or formation which has been taken outof the line at the end of an earlier phase given the task if this is not possible theformations which achieve the breakout or whose counterstroke wins the battle willhave to carry out the pursuit themselves short of sleep and with little opportunity forthe repair and replacement of damaged tanks vehicles and equipment their menshould be told that an extra effort while the enemy is disorganized will achieve resultswhich hard fighting and heavy casualties may be unable to realise few hours or dayslater if passing formations through each other can be avoided there will be betterchance of avoiding the confusion and delay caused by combination of congestionclouds of dust and desert tracks whose surface has been ruined by the passage oftoo many vehicles whichever

amphibious landingto seize key area behind the enemy should be considered 79 objectives pursuit operation may aim to seize certain objectives as well as to complete the destruction of the enemy it will be necessary to stop the pursuit on aline which is naturally defensible the capture of airfields and port will be at leastas important for us as their denial is to the enemy without airfields

all important to enable it to maintain momentum it may be necessary to ground formation in orderto provide the maintenance lift to support long pursuit the css plan for the pursuitmust be considered when the attack itself is being planned and not extemporised atthe last minute so that the material effort to support the operation can be identifiedand provided for if the resupply aspects of pursuit are not considered until thesuccess of an attack makes it feasible option it may be too late to improvise theresources to back it and the fruits of victory may fall from our grasp css units movingup

quick attack and fail he should reconnoitre theposition on wide front to find weak sector or an exposed flank either may providea fleeting opportunity for quick breakthrough or turning operation to render theissue 10 dec 98 3 39enemys position untenable and force him to retreat 88flexibility the critical item in mobile operations like pursuit is flexibility especially in the desert where the information decision making and action cycle is shorter thanin the closer country of europe while the leading troops are searching for way roundopposition the commander must be prepared to switch his main effort from one axisto another or to an entirely different one this involves thinking ahead to arrange visualand photographic reconnaissance with the air force to order armoured reconnaissance troops to probe any promising route and to warn formations to change directionin good time before they become committed in sector where they are unlikely tosucceed or become bogged down in bad going while formal orders have their placein battle of attrition the more one wishes to manoeuvre to exploit opportunities andto turn potential enemy defensive positions the more the force commander must tellhis subordinates the aim of the operation what he requires them to do and leave themto work out the details tactical flexibility has to be matched by css flexibility to shiftthe flow of combat supplies to support more promising axis 89 boldness allied to flexibility is boldness in fluid battle an audacious move may bluff the enemy into precipitate retreat although advancing troops are always worriedabout being exposed suddenly to hostile fire beaten enemy is even more concernedabout the prospects of being cut off in the desert risks may be taken against beatenenemy which would not be justified in setpiece attack 90 the pursuers dilemma eventually the leading troops will encounter better organized position the problem in the desert is distance with the emphasis on liftingfuel forward in pursuit battle groups will only have their unit mobile stocks ofammunition the artillery may be seriously short of it unless ammunition convoys havebeen organized before the pursuit started helicopters may be able to lift usefulamount forward but probably not enough to sustain major attack the pursuingforces will be tired their vehicles and equipment showing signs of wear and the csssystem strained to near its limit although morale will be buoyed up by success wearymen are less brave and tired commanders less resolute delay of few days to bringup more troops and ammunition to

tobe ready the enemy may have withdrawn or the opportunity for quick cheap victorymay have disappeared and the commander will have to resign himself to anothercostly battle of attrition it will be matter of fine judgment on the part of the forcecommander as to whether to risk quick attack or consolidate his gains much willdepend on the intelligence assessment as to whether or not the enemy has been ableto bring up fresh formations and additional logistic resources 91 consolidation inevitably there will come stage when pause is essential whatever happens the pursuit must not be allowed to falter in the open desert or infront of wellmanned position where weakened force at the end of its logistic tetheris vulnerable to crushing countermove as the force reaches successive

abandonment of ground may be distasteful from some points of view military advice should explain that battlefought on disadvantageous terms purely to save stretch of empty ground may invitean unnecessary defeat and serious consequences more essential than the retentionof ground is the survival of mobile armoured capability the loss of the mobilereserve makes defensive position untenable trading space for time to reinforce thiscapability enables commander to fight successful battle at time and place of hischoosing with the added advantage of forcing the enemy to fight at the end of anextended supply route once the enemy has been defeated the initiative will havebeen regained and the lost territory will be recovered however force commandermay be obliged to fight defensive battle rather earlier and further forward than hewould like in order to secure some vital asset such as base area an airfield complexan entry port an oilfield or an allys capital because deserts favour mobility andoffensive action defence can only be temporary phase and used to gain or recoverthe initiative defensive battles must be fought as aggressively as possible taking anyopportunity to seek local advantage before launching counteroffensive to regainthe initiative 2 force will only go on to the defensive for one of four reasons it is insufficiently strong to take the offensive it may already have suffered defeat and been forced to retreat b the two sides have fought themselves to standstill and take up improvised defensive positions ctemporarily at the end of rapid advance when force has become strung out and outrun its artillery support or for longer if it has outpaced its combat servicesupport particularly artillery ammunition or fuel and needs pause to bring uptroops and combat supplies to mount another concentrated blow d for political reasons our forces called upon to assist friendly state threatened with invasion take up defensive position aim 3 the aim of defensive battle in the desert is to reverse an unfavourable operational situation and turn the tables on the enemy by the use of ground obstacles firepowerand manoeuvre to dislocate and disrupt his attack in order to pave the way for renewedoffensive action the object of the latter will be the destruction of the hostile forcesissue 10 dec 98 4 2or such substantial portion of them that in the best circumstances the enemy will be annihilated or at least forced to retreat elements of defensive position 4types of defence defence in the desert may be deliberate when there is time to prepare position free from enemy interfer ence either before hostilities start or well behind the current battle area inanticipation of reverse b hasty improvised in contact with the enemy either after an unsuccessful offensive or at the end of withdrawal when the enemy is at the end of hisresources and is obliged to halt an example of how an armoured infantry heavyformation might adopt hasty defensive position is shown diagramatically infigure 4a c delaying mobile delaying battle may be fought in two circumstances 1 when there is little space to trade for time in front of some vital asset like port of entry and our forces are at temporary numerical disadvantage it may be necessary to fight delaying action in the open desert ona larger scale than covering force operation to gain time for the arrival ofreinforcements such situation may occur at the beginning of campaignany offensive action that can be taken to disrupt the enemys plans andforce him to react rather than pursue his aim will be to advantage forcesavailable are likely to be inferior in strength it will be necessary to taskintelligence and subordinate commanders to find vulnerable place in theenemys dispositions where the limited resources can effect the maximumdislocation and distract the attention of the enemy commander 2 when the desert terrain is very open and the available forces are numerically weaker than the enemy but not markedly so there may begood reasons for not withdrawing to the next really good defensive positiona considerable distance to the rear it may be necessary to hold someimportant locality or installation and there may be good chance ofsuccess in fighting defensive battle in considerable depth based on suchminor features and natural obstacles as the terrain offers reinforced byartificial ones by trading space for as much time as is consistent with thepreservation intact of mobile forces it may be possible to impose sufficientdelay for the arrival of reinforcements or forces reconstituted after aprevious reverse to offer battle on advantageous terms against an enemywhose communications are becoming increasingly attenuated ultimatesuccess will depend on our ability to launch counteroffensive 5 selection of defensive position to enable weaker force to beat larger and equally efficient one commander will aim to use favourable ground to redress theimbalance in

network of tracks natural or constructed isnecessary for the movement of reserves in the rear of the battle area on as manyroutes as possible 6 components of defensive battle as in central europe force on the defensive will ideally be divided into three components acovering troops btroops occupying the main defensive position cmobile reserves 7shaping the battlefield the mobile reserves include the main reserve whose role is to deliver the decisive counterstroke and smaller reserves for counterattack andcounterpenetration the commander will have design for defensive battle ascheme to hold key terrain and to canalize the inevitable enemy penetrations intoground of his own choosing where he can use his main reserve to defeat substantialportion of the enemy force and regain the initiative it will be convenient to discuss themain position and the use of the mobile reserves first leaving the covering troops tobe dealt with later because their role is subsidiary to act as an initial shield for theformer and to provide information section 2 the role of covering forces 8 role covering forces are deployed ahead of the main position ideally further forward than in the closer terrain of central europe to obtain intelligence on enemy dispositions and intentions and to provide warning of the strength and direction of an enemyadvance because the open desert offers such wide choice of approaches coveringforces should base their delaying positions on features which provide continuousbarrier to movement with as few gaps as possible where such obstacle lines existso that the enemy may be persuaded to disclose his main axis by the choice of gapor gaps he selects for penetration while covering force should be capable ofinhibiting enemy reconnaissance and imposing some delay it should not becomeinvolved in defensive battle to hold ground if it does so it risks destruction or seriouscasualties as the covering force may well be required to form part of or even the bulkof the force commanders reserve for the battle on the main position he will be facedwith the problem of how much of his force he can afford to commit beyond the febato achieve how much delay when there is risk that it might be severely mauled in theopen desert should the time factor be important to allow the organization of adefensive position then much larger force will be required to conduct

artillery forward than he would have wished shielded byarmoured reconnaissance units and atgw supported by reconnaissance and attackhelicopters and backed by as much armour as he can spare in order to obtaininformation provide security and gain time such shifts should be abandoned infavour of more orthodox tactics as soon as his armoured force has recoveredsufficiently in such circumstances attack helicopters will assume an even greaterimportance in countering the enemy tank threat 11 command because the covering force is likely to start operations further ahead of the main defensive position than in european terrain it may be better to use aformation headquarters to command the whole operation over the entire front thealternative delegating command to each major formation in its own sector wouldinvolve serious coordination problems and too many headquarters better usedorganizing the main position 12 organization the covering force comprises three elements ascreen reconnaissance

thrusts3 help to extract troops of the two other elements which are in danger of being pinned down or overrun 13 preparation the amount of engineer work and deception which can be undertaken will depend upon the time available if called in to assist an ally during period oftension there may be time to lay antitank minefields create phoney ones and cratergaps through escarpments similarly at the end of long withdrawal the enemy mayneed time to assemble his forces and build up stocks of ammunition and fuel timewhich we can put to good use the corollary is that the enemy will also have time toreconnoitre dispositions and to find out how the defensive battle is to be foughtdeception may persuade him to come to the wrong conclusions on the other handthe enemy may be pressing in considerable strength allowing little time for preparation and driving in the covering troops early again deception methods alreadydiscussed may buy extra time in critical situation 14 covering troops in the main defensive position each formation in the main position will be responsible for maintaining covering troops immediately in front of itsown position the position they occupy or line drawn in front of it will be designatedthe feba line which separates the areas of responsibility between the coveringtroops in the main position and the covering force forward of it careful coordinationbetween formations is essential to maintain the integrity of the screen and to ensurethat one formations screen is not jeopardized by the withdrawal of its neighbourseither prematurely or under enemy pressure

positions in the desert 16 the desert offers long fields of view and defending infantry and their supporting tanks have to be concealed from frontal observation defilade can be achieved on reverseslopes on the flat tops of low hills and in wadis and depressions ops should similarlybe sited so that they look obliquely across the front in pattern which affords mutuallyinterlocking arcs while high ground affords long range observation from above theheat haze obvious peaks should be avoided the shoulder of hill combines goodobservation and defilade because of the need to hold only ground vital to the defencein order to release as many formations as possible for mobile counteroffensiverole gaps are inevitable they have to be kept under surveillance antitank guidedweapons can be hidden from direct enemy observation their deployment alsoreleases tanks from purely defensive role to strengthen local reserves for counterattack and counterpenetration and for the forces main

while wadi beds depressions and some sand and gravel offer little difficulty in the construction of positions rock and soft sand presentserious problems high ground is usually hard ground power tools and explosivesare needed for rock and revetment for soft sand the mexe shelter and flexiblerevetting material have been developed to solve the latter problem if positions in softsand are prepared in

immediate approach to position high wire apron fencesand concertina wire stand out in the desert to betray defensive position from groundand air observation all this adds up to considerable construction effort involvingmore unit labour and engineer resources than in most other environments defencestores in the quantity needed in the desert produce heavy bill for transport which thestaff must anticipate early in the planning stage 18 tank positions there are two methods of constructing tank fire positions narrow and steepsided or saucershaped both deep enough to accommodate tank hulldown the advantage of the first is that it affords protection to tracks and suspensionsfrom shell splinters its disadvantage is that its sharp outline is readily identifiable byairborne surveillance so that row of such positions constructed for occupation tomeet threat from particular direction will give away the defenders plan whenissue 10 dec 98 4 8tanks ifvs and artillery are dug in care should be taken to ensure that they are able to engage targets from all points of the compass speedily because threats maydevelop quickly from any direction in the desert camouflaging large numbers ofalternative positions and keeping the camouflage in place in the normal desert windsis hardly practical proposition the saucershaped depressions scooped out to atleast three times the width of the tank are less obvious but do not provide so muchprotection once battle is in progress armoured bulldozers will be in great demandfor the construction of new positions under artillery fire

arrangements must be made to check minefield erosion aftera storm and to restore the integrity of the obstacle it may also be necessary to remarkthe minefield and to revise the mine records and traces coordination of positions obstacles and mobile reserves 21 coordination the force commander aided by his intelligence staff will examine every possible axis the enemy may use for real and feint attacks to minimise theissue 10 dec 98 4 9chances of surprise and being caught off balance he will aim to coordinate his obstacle deployment and fire plans to force the enemy to enter ground of his choosingwhere he can destroy the maximum number by combination of fire power and wellconceived counterstroke the obstacle plan should be so designed that in conjunction with the deception plan including dummy positions it does not bullseye thedefensive layout equally it should be planned in such way that it neither inhibitsthe mobility of our reserves nor indicates the axis of an intended counterattack justas in any other environment the commander will nominate key terrain which must beheld at all costs and if lost recaptured he will also designate important ground asthe battle develops he will decide which of the latter if any is worth counterattackwhile key terrain is usually more readily identifiable at formation and battle group levelin central europe in the desert it is very much the concern of the higher commander 22 mobile reserves force should be kept in reserve at each level for counterattack with number of contingencies in mind in order of priority for each of which theremust be fire and movement plan ideally troops should rehearse counterattacksbut if this is not possible either because of lack of time or for security considerationsthe track marks may give away the plan at least the commanders and theirsupporting arms representatives should walk the course to familiarize themselveswith the ground the decision to launch major counterattack involving formationwill normally be referred to the highest level the use of reserves in mass for decisivecounterattack is important in any environment but especially so in the open desertindeed defensive

the main position kept inlocal reserve ready for counterattack and counterpenetration tasks under sectorcommanders and retained under the force commanders hand for the decisivecounterattack requires fine judgment put another way the optimum balance isachieved by judicious assessment of risks calculation of the minimum resourcesthat can at least contain the enemys main strength in order to concentrate themaximum force to deliver counterattack preferably in the enemys weakest spotthe more open the country the larger the force commanders main reserve should beroutes for counterpenetration and the likely alternatives for the counterattackshould also be reconnoitred by commanders at all levels during the preparatoryphase the defensive fire plan 23 general the lack of cover in the desert

strict control on its employment initiallyat battle group level orders should allow its use either when position is in danger of being overrun or when the enemy starts to use it the aim should be toilluminate and dazzle the attacker and to catch him at disadvantage while minimising the same effects on our own troops the advantages of silhouetting theenemy by firing mortar illuminating bombs on low trajectory into dead ground hasalready been mentioned looking beyond the range of infantry armoured reconnaissance and artillery counterbombardment systems and supplementary intelligence gained from radio and other electronic intelligence are the air forces visualphotographic and electronic reconnaissance assets the latter are not limitlessand it will be necessary for the force commander and his intelligence staff to workclosely with their associated air headquarters to produce reconnaissance planwith tasks and areas listed in order of priority to cover both the expected threatother areas from which the enemy may spring surprise and to keep watch onthe enemys second echelon perhaps 80 to 120 kms away identification of features 29 in terrain where many of the minor features are not recorded on the map still less given names it is difficult to pinpoint enemy activity and report its precise location tosuperior headquarters or to direct fire on to it quickly and accurately the problem maybe overcome by establishing the systems of ops and surveillance devices with theiroverlapping arcs and using resection while all ops should have range cardsselected ops usually at battle group level may also have panoramas so that bearingscan be determined quickly without the need for repetitive compass work unmarkedfeatures are given nicknames for ready identification these together

will give the enemy theopportunity to use what cover there is for shelter and manoeuvre however bearingthis rider in mind the defender who judges the timing correctly and opens fire firstscores an immense advantage the authority to change from the passive to the activemode and to open fire will probably be vested at battle group level initially but may bedelegated to squadroncompany groups in

in heavy concentrations so ecm directedat particular enemy formation to interfere with as many of its command and firesupport nets as possible will have far more dislocating effect than using itpiecemeal used in conjunction with artillery and armed helicopters it may completethe disorganization of an enemy attack at crucial moment if bad going forces theenemy to use widely separated axes the disruption of the attack on one of them evenfor few hours may upset his whole plan and allow the defenders inferior resourcesto be concentrated on each threat in turn 41 air support provided that the enemys air defence surveillance and control system can be degraded by combination of jamming missiles long range artillery and airdelivered weapons conditions may be suitable for the employment of air power withthe long distances and lack of cover in the desert air power may best be used in aninterdiction role against the enemys second echelon and logistic system particularlyvulnerable supply convoys close air support guided by laser target markers infeatureless deserts may be useful especially in critical situation to help hardpressed counterpenetration forces stem dangerous breakthrough or to support animportant counterattack to regain vital ground 42 local countermoves sometimes counterattack mounted quickly will succeed against disorientated enemy before he has time to reorganize on capturedposition once this opportunity passes the local commander should weigh up thechances of success with the resources at his command attacks are best mountedfrom an unexpected direction as the battle develops and the enemy penetrates theposition to capture key terrain the formation commanders in the main position willcommit their counterpenetration forces and their reserves initially to execute preplanned tasks and then to meet the unexpected as the enemy plan unfolds graduallythe reserves will dwindle new mobile reserves must be formed because in mobilebattle they are the only means through which commanders can influence the situationreserves must not be frittered away for the sake of maintaining intact reserves lessimportant ground which is lost should be abandoned so long as key terrain is heldnevertheless within their resources the forward formation commanders may be ableto exploit opportunities which cost the enemy precious time throw his plans out of gearand exact an unacceptable rate of attrition should the enemy possess markedsuperiority in armour more circumspect policy of counterattacking with fire from aflank rather than attempting to recover lost ground may be expedientissue 10 dec 98 5 1chapter 5 delay operations section 1 the setting general 1necessity in certain circumstances it is possible that the enemy may be stronger more balanced and in position to attack there will be little time to create artificialobstacles but scatterable and remotely delivered mines could provide useful obstacles 2 limitations without firm static element mobile delaying defensive operation cannot be maintained indefinitely in the open desert against more powerful enemythe best that can be hoped for is to maintain the force in being using space as areserve and giving ground as sparingly as possible until either reinforcements arriveto enable us to turn the tables on the enemy or sufficient time has been gained for thepreparation of defensive position further back in the latter case the mobile delayingforce will aim to break clean and withdraw conduct of delaying action 3 in mobile delaying battle in the open desert the attention of commanders and observers tends to be riveted on major events the infiltration or movement round aflank of small groups of tanks and infantry often escapes notice especially if theenemy uses what terrain cover there is skilfully these two combat arms have atendency to look at the battlefield from different perspectives determined by the rangeof their weapons the tank commander searching the ground and engaging targets outto 2000 metres and beyond while the infantrymans attention is engrossed by eventswithin few hundred metres of him these differences in perspective can be put togood use the one arm warning the other of threats in its blind spots however bewarethe gap in the middle both arms have to consciously restrict or extend their foci ofattention to cover the middle distance 4 by day armour will hold the front backed by antitank guided weapons in rear operating from such defiladed positions as the open gently rolling desert offers inturn the antitank guided weapons should be protected by mechanized infantry in theopen desert air defence cover is even more essential than elsewhere armedhelicopters will operate well back taking advantage of any contours to provide coveredapproaches 5 at night the security of the armour and its replenishment may be accomplished in one of two ways depending on the aggressiveness or supineness of the enemy theproximity of the two forces and the availability of covered routes behind the positionoccupied by the tanks the infantry come forward after dark to the nearest position which affords cover from view to protect replenishment points to which tanks are withdrawn singlyissue 10 dec 98 5 2bin very open desert the tanks retire individually behind the next bound where the armoured infantry and antitank guided weapons are positioned for replenishment in reasonable security in either case the passive thermal imaging andgunnery systems of the majority of tanks remaining on the position plus thesurveillance of artillery ops can observe the front the risks inherent in pullingback all the armour behind the security of the infantry is that if the enemyobserves consistent pattern on successive nights he might advance to seizethe abandoned position in the dark the disadvantage of replenishing forwardis that shellfire could cause casualties and seriously dislocate the refuelling andrearming of the tanks 6 in mobile defensive delaying action every effort will be made to bluff the enemy into believing that the defending forces are stronger than they are opportunities will occurfor limited offensive operations manoeuvring tanks to engage the enemy by surprisefrom an exposed flank and from upsun when withdrawal becomes necessarychances may occur to ambush an overconfident enemy following up incautiously orto launch spoiling attack from flank exploiting the long range of tank guns and thelonger ranges of armed helicopters few successful ambushes may induce greaterdegree of prudence on the enemy at night there may be occasional opportunities fora stealthy infantry raid on isolated enemy positions but the universal use of night visionaids will reduce the possibilities of surprise and success to places where the approachcan be made in dead ground 7 weak ground forces will rely on armed helicopters and close air support to maintain coherent front however unless the enemys sam system can be neutralized byecm artillery and air weapons the air force may suffer unacceptably high losses 8 last man last round defence is inappropriate in mobile defensive delaying battle our forces will aim to avoid encirclement if position is surrounded its garrison willattempt to break out under cover of darkness or dust storm aided by mobile forcesoutside the encirclement giving direct support creating diversion or both section 2 the mobile defensive battle design for battle 9 lack of commanding hills and natural obstacles can be compensated for by fighting the battle in considerable depth within the range of our air defence umbrella and bythe skilful exploitation of good and bad going any time the enemy allows should beused for the construction of antitank ditches and tactical minefields of considerablelength linking what few natural obstacles such as shallow escarpments that natureaffords behind these minefields are stationed armoured formations in assemblyareas ready to move to threatened sector on the obstacle or to block or counterattack enemy bypassing it still further back other formations will similarly bestationed behind other artifical or natural obstacles these formations will form askeletal framework within which the main mobile reserve can manoeuvre becausethe outcome of the battle will depend mainly on the use of the main reserve should beas large as possibleissue 10 dec 98 5 310 the gaps between these positions will be much wider than in normal defensive position they must be watched by the mobile patrols of armoured reconnaissanceregiments surveillance devices including airborne radar and helicopters at leastone flank is likely to be open and will require combination of screen and airreconnaissance 11 the covering force will need to be strong enough to stop the enemys light reconnais sance troops and oblige the opposing commander to commit his main bodycompelling the enemy to deploy will buy time and help to determine his axis of maineffort fighting the battle 12 as the covering force retires and the direction of the main enemy axes of advance become apparent the forward formations use the tactical minefields to stop frontalattacks employing armoured or mechanized infantryheavy battle groups with thesupport of antitank guided weapons and artillery the armourheavy battle groupshould aim to counterattack the enemys mobile forces from the flank somepenetrations may be defeated but the enemys main thrust is likely to force its way tothe depth positions and perhaps beyond the covering troops may be used to watchan exposed flank and the gaps between the depth positions within the air defenceenvelope combination of armour holding the flanks of the penetration armedattackhelicopters close air support and artillery fire should inflict heavy attrition rate onboth the enemys combat troops and his resupply convoys similarly the enemysarmedattack helicopters and air force will suffer heavily operating in hostile airenvironment 13 at some stage the enemy thrust will slacken through combination of casualties obstacles bad going and lack of all kinds of supplies the problem will be torecognize the opportunity in sufficient time to exploit it so long as the intelligencestaffs have been watching for the right indicators the occasion will provide theopportunity for the commander to commit his reserve in concentrated fashion tosucceed the blow should be launched on good firm going supported by maximumeffort from armedattack helicopters the air force and all the artillery which can beconcentrated within range some of the units which have been bypassed may be ableto launch attacks at least strong enough to distract the enemy from other directionsecm should be particularly effective against an overstretched enemy trying toregroup to meet one or more threats 14 deception may be employed in number of ways dummy concentrations may mislead the enemy as to the position of the main reserve especially if electronicsilence is maintained by the real reserve and radio traffic simulated to and within thedummy reserve as previously mentioned phoney minefield located across themain reserves axis of attack may persuade enemy intelligence that attack is likelyfrom that direction the move of the reserve to the assembly area for action may bepossible at night if the going is good and there is some moonlight although drivingwith night vision aids is technically possible in starlight the clouds of dust thrown upby many vehicles may cause sufficient degradation to delay the move and dislocatethe planissue 10 dec 98 5 4section 3 the withdrawal circumstances 15types of withdrawal withdrawal operation may be planned as deliberate operation to trade space for time space when threatened with overwhelming numbers or to reduce commitments to create aconcentration to force decision in another part of the theatre if only anexpanse of valueless desert is at stake withdrawal does not have quite the samepolitical and military consequences as it does in central europe commanderin desert theatre may have little more freedom of action than his counterpartelsewhere b hasty as consequence of defeat in order to extricate as many of our own formations intact as possible so that they can be reorganized on positionfurther back the intention will be to resume the offensive as soon as individualreinforcements have been absorbed and trained equipment repaired or replaced and the force augmented by fresh formations withdrawal is the mostdifficult operation of war in any environment but in the open desert it is thehardest the most hazardous and testing operation likely to face any commanderand his troops 16 maintaining mobile force so long as an intact mobile force can be kept in being caution may be imposed on superior enemy and time may be bought to recuperateand go over to the offensive once an effective mobile armoured element ceasesto exist little or nothing can be done to influence the course of operations in anadverse situation it is necessary to trade space for time even if it means abandoningforward bases with large stocks and other useful facilities the reasons for awithdrawal has to be clearly explained to higher authority and pressure to attempt apremature defence or large scale countermove too far forward with too fewresources and on unsuitable ground must be resisted even though the forcecommander may become unpopular for doing so the troops have to be withdrawnto the next defensible position sufficiently far back to stretch the enemys lines ofcommunications and compel him to pause in these circumstances weakerdefender will be able to regain the initiative with countermoves against an overstretched and unbalanced enemy both sides could be exhausted after periods ofmoving and fighting but the first success the defender scores will provide useful fillipto morale principles 17 as in other theatres commander will be guided by the following principles although their implementation will be far more difficult in the open desert breakclean clean break may be achieved quite easily in planned withdrawal from prepared position with the help of good deception planhowever it will be extremely difficult to break off an engagement in open terrainafter tactical defeat against determined enemy buoyed up by victory and benton exploiting his success to the uttermostissue 10 dec 98 5 5b intact front the deployment of strong covering force is necessary to maintain an intact front to allow the main body to withdraw with the minimum ofinterference in the wide expanses of desert terrain the maintenance of acoherent front will be difficult helicopters both reconnaissance and armed orattack must be kept in readiness to watch any gaps which may occur and toprovide reserve of firepower to impose caution and delay on an enemyattempting to exploit them c rear area security it is necessary to protect the withdrawal routes from enemy air attack airborne activity and outflanking manoeuvres one of the main threats will come from parallel pursuit in deserts where the going is good an effectiveair defence will be essential with transport using one or two surfaced roads orraising clouds of dust on tracks across sand or gravel to betray movement in theopen desert and inevitably bunching at choke points under enemy air or longrange missile attack in spite of the best efforts of traffic control d balance every effort must be made to maintain as well balanced force as possible in the circumstances existing groupings should be preserved to retaincohesion the problem is to allocate just sufficient covering forces to hold theenemy off while the bulk of the force moves as fast as possible to prepare thenext main position or an intermediate one or both sufficient reserves have tobe kept in hand to extricate the covering troops should they be pinned down orto block penetration the former contingency is likely to occur frequently ona flat gravel or firm sandy plain because tanks ifvs and apcs become exposedas soon as they leave their fire or hide positions enemy penetrations candevelop with alarming speed and reserves must be kept in hand to preventenemy exploitation 18 the maintenance of control cohesion and morale makes heavy demands on leadership and organization particularly in hasty withdrawal should the enemyinjudiciously expose an element of his force to quick and limited countermove theopportunity should be recognized and taken caution will be induced on the enemydelaying his pursuit and small success will have heartening effect on our owntroops morale planning withdrawal 19 withdrawal in one or more stages ideally the force should move straight back to the next main position rather than occupy series of intermediate ones the newposition can then be organized and prepared as complete and coherent entityrather than piecemeal as and when formations arrive on release from successiveintermediate positions the covering force may be able to impose some delayallowing the main body more time to lay minefields and construct defences 20 intermediate positions these should only be occupied if it is necessary to buy extra time to reform force disorganized by severe defeat and to prepare the new mainposition intermediate positions can only be used to impose worthwhile delay withoutincurring unnecessary casualties if there are sufficiently good natural defences andobstacles to allow weak force to hold them with reasonable chance of successissue 10 dec 98 5 6they should be spaced out between the old and the new main ones and each other if there are several to oblige the enemy to redeploy his artillery and go through all thepreparations for major attack on each in turn 21 new main position as many formations as possible should be sent back to work on the new main position its preparation involving major engineer effort to lay largerminefields and construct longer obstacles than in other theatres and the considerablework to excavate weapon pits and shelters in difficult ground and rock need timereconnaissance parties and engineers should be sent back to coordinate and lay outthe new position before the old one is abandoned initially the organization of the newone may be delegated to one of the force commanders senior subordinates forexample if the force is an army corps commander and his headquarters may beused for the task 22 covering force to impose any effective delay the covering force should be as strong as possible in fire power especially mobile fire power such as armedhelicopters and armour following defeat the tank strength may be so depleted thatthe armour available to the covering force is insufficient however in withdrawalarmed helicopters flying napoftheearth and antitank guided weapons firing fromsuch defiladed positions as the terrain offers under defensive air system may be ableto compensate for lack of armour for ease of command and control and to avoidthe creation of gaps on formation boundaries the covering force task should be givento complete formation perhaps third of the total reinforced by armouredreconnaisance regiments and army aviation the air defence system should be leftintact for as long as possible to give the covering force adequate protection 23 reserves the covering force will have to find its own reserves to extricate threatened elements block penetrations and parry outflanking moves from an enemy parallelpursuit with the rest of the formations moving back to the main position and perhapsintermediate ones as well it will be hard to find force reserve small one may beformed from any troops which can be spared from manning the flot on the mainposition but the commander will rely mainly on keeping his covering force intact plusany troops released on the abandonment of any intermediate position 24 countermobility and mobility support planning the following factors must be taken into account when making the obstacle and mobility support plans to cover awithdrawal the force commander in conjunction with his engineer adviser will decide on the division of resources and effort between preparing the next main defensiveposition and any intermediate positions helping the covering troops on the oldposition to break clean imposing some delay between positions and repairingthe withdrawal routes to keep his forces moving the major engineer effort willnormally be devoted to the preparation of the main defensive position particularly if it has not been possible to work on it previously in anticipation of awithdrawal b if the force commander hopes to turn the tables on the enemy shortly he and his engineer adviser will control the siting of minefields carefully using selfdestruct timed deactivating fuses or in future remotely controlled minesissue 10 dec 98 5 7ctime and resources will be short especially for the creation of obstacles behind the old position to facilitate clean break the emphasis will be on rapidly laidmines behind our own troops and remotely delivered and scatterable obstaclesystems beyond the flot to supplement natural obstacles or conventionallyconstructed ones in defiles standard 800 metre mine panels can be laid parallelto the front with 600 metre gaps between them alternatively minefields canbe laid perpendicularly to the front with phoney minefields and gaps betweenthem when the covering troops withdraw the gaps and phoney minefields canbe closed with scatterable mines d all obstacles through which our forces are to withdraw must be especially well marked in featureless desert to prevent casualties and unnecessary delaysgaps through artificial obstacles and defiles either on the withdrawal routes orat intermediate positions will be marked guarded and included in the trafficcontrol organization liaison officers with communications to both the coveringforce and the commander of the appropriate sector of the intermediate or mainposition must be stationed at the gaps to check the covering forces through thegaps will be closed by engineer parties or remotely delivered mines on the ordersof the sector commander when the last of the covering troops have passedthrough all elements of withdrawing force and particularly the covering troops and any deception forces who move out last will need engineer support to maintain theirmobility and to prevent traffic jams concertinaing to provide the enemy air forcelong range artillery or his pursuing troops with lucrative targets engineer taskswill vary from repairing desert tracks and mixinplace roads which disintegrateunder heavy traffic especially on soft going and in defiles to rebuilding routeswhich have been damaged by enemy battlefield air interdiction at bottleneckswhich cannot be bypassed again the engineer commander must reconcile thecompeting demands on slender resources of manpower and plant for mobilitysupport and countermobility during the withdrawal and the preparation of thenew main position 25 denial plan apart from demolitions and nuisance mining on routes through defiles plan must be made early to deny the advancing enemy the use of ports airfieldrunways and installations and railways stocks especially of fuel water and foodas well as ammunition which cannot be lifted back must be destroyed becausedispersed ammunition stocks take time to destroy priority must be given to thedestruction of mines which can be used against us decision on whether to destroyor salinate water sources may have to be taken at high level for political as well asmilitary reasons 26 air defence vulnerability withdrawing force is vulnerable to air and missile attack and to long range artillery once it leaves its defensive positions and moves back downthe few tracks and roads which allow fast movement if the going is good units canmove in open formation but the clouds of dust they raise attract enemy attention if theforce has suffered defeat repeated hammering from the air could badly disorganizethe withdrawal and sap moraleissue 10 dec 98 5 827air defence protection even in situation of air inferiority our air force should be able to provide adequate protection within the area covered by our ground based airdefence system supplemented by the armys weapons in long withdrawal theseground based defences may be stretched dangerously thin particularly as proportion of our sam launchers and radars will be on the move well thought out plan isrequired to deploy the air defence resources to give point defence to bottlenecksintermediate positions gun areas headquarters and combat service support installations on priority basis and area cover to as much of the withdrawal route aspossible at least it should be possible to provide an effective system on the new lineto cover the move of formations into their sectors and the preparation of positions the conduct of withdrawal 28 timings the force commander will decide on the usual timings to control withdrawal these are mandatory 1 the time up to which the old position is to be denied to the enemy the key timing for the whole withdrawal plan 2 the time before which there will be thinning out except for formation and unit withdrawal reconnaissance parties and routine traffic to presenta picture of normal activity for as long as possible however this restrictionon movement will only hold for deliberate withdrawals which are notundertaken under pressure in hasty withdrawal after defeat thereconnaissance parties will move as quickly as possible b according to circumstances 1 the time thinning out may start in hasty withdrawal such control would be superfluous in deliberate withdrawal the force comander may wellmake the time mandatory to conceal his intentions for as long as possiblein the open desert there are obvious advantages in doing so 2 the time by which troops are to be clear of line behind the old position this is particularly useful in providing framework for the control of firesupport especially in giving artillery and armed helicopters free hand withconfidence that they are not in danger of attacking our own troops ideallythe line should be drawn along some feature clearly identifiable on theground and from the air like the enemy side of wadi in bare terrain linebetween such features as there are perhaps several miles apart or evena map grid line may have to suffice the line should be safe distanceahead of the covering troops if they have been deployed behind the main position before the withdrawal begins in addition the positive fireclearance methods described elsewhere should be used to ensure thesafety of our troops in what will probably be difficult fluid situationissue 10 dec 98 5 929sequence diagrammatic examples are given in figures 5a5c in deliberate withdrawal the sequence will be the same as in central europe areconnaissance parties and nonessential vehicles move back under cover of darkness and according to timed programme in order not to present pictureof sudden massive movement to enemy ground and airborne imint b the covering force deploys behind the main position local reserves take up station the depth squadroncompany groups prepare to cover the forwardones back through them if the withdrawal is likely to be interfered with c the withdrawal begins ideally at night when the depth battle groups and squadroncompany groups move first leaving the forward subunits to hold theold position tanks in forward fire positions may withdraw as usual after dark toreplenish and then keep going while the infantry and antitank weapons to theirrear cover them out the infantry and their missiles then follow if the enemydiscovers the move and follows up promptly the defenders can impose cautionand delay on him by firing white light to dazzle his tank and ifv commanders anddrivers weapon operators and foos as well as to bring down accurate firewhich will force commanders to close down and rely on the narrow fields of theirnight vision aids which white light will degrade d if withdrawal has to be conducted in daylight it can only be achieved by fire and movement depth squadroncompany groups and battle groups covering outthose in front artillery support will be provided by batteries leapfrogging backin turn armed helicopters using what terrain cover there is to fire their missilesfrom flank should prove effective particularly if coordinated with artillery fireto force tanks to close down enemy armour which penetrates the flot maybe particularly vulnerable to armed helicopter attack the aim will be to slowdown the enemy advance and halt it long enough for our forward troops to breakclean as the withdrawing force moves through an intermediate position or the final position the normal procedure for rearward passage of lines operation will beemployed as in the withdrawal of covering troops into defensive position theresponsibility for command will change at the handover line the formation in situ on either the intermediate or final position will provide protection for the passage of the withdrawing forces through the coordinating points these willhave to be clearly marked if they are to be recognized in the dark and guides maybe needed should the enemy pursue aggressively on the heels of thewithdrawing troops and threaten to jeopardize the operation or bounce newposition it may be necessary to halt one of the retiring battle groups or squadroncompany groups to act as counterpenetration or counterattack force underthe command of the formation holding the new position security and deception 30 security in deliberate withdrawal every effort will be made to present the enemy with picture

31 deception large scale withdrawal to more readily defensible position in order to reduce commitment or release formations and logistic support for some other partof the theatre will be the easiest to conceal because the enemy may not suspect itin such circumstances with the initiative there would be more time to prepare and putinto effect credible deception plan more often enemy intelligence will appreciatethe intention to withdraw in the near future and the aim of deception will be to misleadhim as to the date formations withdraw gradually with returning supply convoys atnight their empty positions remaining camouflaged with metal sheeting placedunderneath to provide radar and heat return to simulate the missing vehiclescombined with routine vehicle movement and normal radio traffic pattern theseruses may deceive the enemy for few vital days however while reconnaissanceof the new position may go undetected convincing cover plan will be necessary toexplain any work on it which will readily be picked up by modern surveillance exceptin hasty withdrawal forced by overwhelming enemy pressure the plan shouldinclude deception element hasty withdrawal and encirclement 32 the worst case is the need for precipitate retreat after heavy defeat to avoid encirclement and destruction there will be time for the detailed battle procedurefor deliberate withdrawal the force commander will nominate readily defensibleposition well in rear where there is good chance of making successful stand andwill order all forces not committed to withdraw there preferably under cover ofdarkness the troops in contact will impose as much delay as possible striving tomaintain an intact front it may be necessary to conduct fighting withdrawal usingfire and movement the enemy should be kept at arms length by exploiting suchfeatures that exist to open fire at maximum effective range and by using remotelydelivered mines 33 armedattack helicopters and ground attack aircraft may be able to impose significant delay if suitable feature exists on which to hold up the enemy it may be possibleto organize it as an intermediate position to be held by the most intact formation lefton the old battlefield this would enable the other forward troops to break contact andreorganize on the main position if not the commander will have to fight his way backthe best he can to the main position provided fuel stocks which cannot be carriedback are destroyed and the withdrawal is long enough the enemy may run short of fuel 34 having helped the forward troops to extricate themselves from the stricken battlefield the air force may best be employed in three ways by maintaining or regaining favourable air situation bby carrying out interdiction missions to slow the enemy advance by the attrition of his lengthening supply system and by attacking troops on the move beforetheir air defence system can be properly organizedissue 10 dec 98 5 14cin dire emergency such as serious enemy breakthrough by providing close air support 35 encirclement and destruction is very real fear in the chaotic conditions of lost battle and hurried withdrawal the best means of avoiding encirclement are goodinformation and mobility however in such conditions there may be lack ofinformation and such as there is may not reach threatened battle group or formationin time if battle group or formation is surrounded the best chance of extricatingit is for its commander to make rapid estimate as to where the weakest point in theencircling forces is and quick decision to exploit it even with modern surveillanceaids the enemys intelligence picture may be confused and incomplete night mayprovide the best opportunity to exploit the confusion which will almost certainly existon the other side concentrated lunge at the estimated weakest link preferably inan unexpected direction offers the best chance to battle group or formation whichstill retains its cohesion once this is lost the only remedy is for the encircledcommander to authorize small groups to break out in all directions in the hope thatmost will get through the weakest link in the enemy cordon may be directly towardshim his main strength having been committed in the encircling operation to create ablocking position in our rear in the chaos of mobile battle an enterprisingcommander can lead his troops on circuitous route to rejoin the main body furtherback command 36 position of the commander planned withdrawal when there is time to deploy covering force the overall commander with his tactical and main headquarters should move back toorganize the next position leaving subordinate formation commander tohandle the withdrawal of the covering force however if an intermediate positionis to be occupied the force commander will probably remain behind it in histactical headquarters long enough to coordinate the rearward passage of linesof the covering force once the intermediate position is abandoned the forcecommander will rejoin his main headquarters b hasty withdrawal with two or more formations deployed the force commander will have to remain forward with his tactical headquarters to control thewithdrawal sending his main headquarters back behind the final position if itis possible to organize an intermediate position to be held by one formation hewill leave it to rejoin his main headquarters once the intermediate position isabandoned 37 morale the worst threat to morale in withdrawal over long distances in the desert is the uncertainty of the situation and the fear of being overwhelmed or cut off on theassumption that the morale of the troops is basically sound the fear of the unknowncan be allayed by keeping everyone as well informed as possible about the situationfuture intentions and the support which is available from other battle groupsformations and the air force rumours which spread alarm should be scotched atonce but this can only be done if the local commander is sufficiently in the picture toissue 10 dec 98 5 15be able to reassure his troops any opportunity for successful local countermove should be taken in the interests of encouraging high morale as well as delaying theenemy or even destroying an isolated detachment control 38 movement phase lines and report lines help to control movement in the desert they are likely to be further apart than in central europe and should be drawn along the mostrecognizeable features available ease of recognition is more important than spacingthe lines out evenly in places where they cannot be readily identified on the grounda sound traffic control plan implemented and signed by provost is needed to movethe force over as many practicable routes as possible consistent with good going alllikely bottlenecks should be controlled by provost special arrangements must bemade to recover breakdowns extract bogged down vehicles from areas of soft sandwhich cannot be avoided transfer loads from breakdowns and destroy nonrunnerswhich cannot be recovered 39 reassembling scattered units an organization is needed to reassemble units and formations which have become dispersed during the withdrawal it should beestablished behind the new main position and assembly areas should be allotted toeach unit using officers and ncos at check points to recognize their men and vehiclesas they drive through and guides and signs to direct them to the appropriate locationthe echelons are likely to move separately under formation control specialarrangements will be needed to guide them to rv to rejoin and replenish their unitf echelons in their new locationsissue 10 dec 98 6 1chapter 6 transitional phases section 1 linkup operations circumstances 1application to desert operations because mobile operations in the desert are often so fluid confusing and unpredictable formations are apt to be cut off from themain body with little or warning the enemy will attempt to surround and destroysuch isolated forces in the open before relief can arrive alternatively force may behemmed in on terrain where it can be supplied by sea or air or both during awithdrawal force may be left quite deliberately to hold key position such as portto threaten the enemys communications compelling him to divert forces to blockadeit another scenario is largescale twopronged envelopment operation to cut offa sizeable element of the enemy or perhaps his entire force 2 the problem the main difficulties in achieving linkup in the desert are the enemys ability to foresee the necessity for relieving garrison or isolated force the ease withwhich the approach of the relief force can be detected in such open country andtherefore his ability to anticipate and thwart any moves the nature of the desert itselfmakes for further problems in that it is not always easy to identify on the ground theplace selected for the linkup and there are greater risks of shelling our own forces orattacking them from the air in such circumstances the positive clearance of targetswith both elements of the linkup becomes of even greater importance first to preventaccidents and second to avoid giving the enemy an unlooked for immunity fromartillery fire and air delivered weapons by allowing an undue margin of safety in theselection of fscl planning 3 time scale if the linkup is to be with beleaguered force which is holding its own in relative security there will be time for detailed planning when force is cut off bythe enemy in the middle of mobile battle linkup operation will have to beimprovised in hurry in either case details must be passed to both forces involvedin the linkup as early as possible consistent with security so that both elements havetime to coordinate their plans issue orders and take precautions to minimize the riskof friendly troops engaging each other either with artillery or direct fire weapons 4 coordination the main points to be considered at the planning stage are axes of advanceb linkup pointc commandd communicationsissue 10 dec 98 6 2e recognition between the linkup forces 5axes of advance the choice of axis or axes if the force to be linked up with is also to attack may be limited by the lie of the land the going and the geographical positionof the beleaguered force to only few practicable approach routes there may bescope for feints and diversions to divide the enemys forces so that battle may besought on favourable terms in large scale envelopment operation the axes may beonly rough guide to planning rather than rigid instruction because the actual routesmay have to be modified as the operation developes the enemy reacts and areas ofbad going are encountered 6 linkup point to help both elements of the linkup forces in their planning and to lessen the risk of friendly troops firing on each other it pays to arrange for the linkupto take place on some easily definable feature such as prominent track an easilyrecognizable hill or escarpment or perhaps even convenient tarmac road if thereis such readily identifiable feature it may be wise to order each force to occupyneighbouring less prominent features from which they can establish contact at adistance instead of risking an engagement between friendly forces 7 command the same measures to clarify command relationships will be needed as in other environments initially while the two forces are far apart they will operateseparately under the overall commander when the forces approach each other thecommand arrangements will differ according to the nature of the linkup operation envelopment in the event of large scale envelopment operation in which the forces comprising the two prongs are roughly the same size they are likely toremain directly under the overall commander right up to the linkup and beyondinto the subsequent phases of reducing the trapped enemy pursuing retreating foe mopping up disorganized elements or combination of all three in thisinstance the actions of the two enveloping forces are part of an overalloperational concept and coordination and control are better exercised by thehigher commander throughout b relief of or junction with smaller force in these circumstances it will be necessary to lay down the arrangements for the smaller force to come under thecommand of the larger although the overall commander may have specifictime in mind for resupply as well as for operational planning purposes in the fluidconditions of desert warfare he is more likely to reserve the decision until theforces approach to within artillery range of each other then he will issue thecode word to implement the change of command 8 communications common radio frequencies and codes to be used between the linkup forces must be issued to both elements ideally the two forces shouldexchange liaison officers who should maintain constant touch on dedicated frequencies in addition to the higher command net linking the two forces these measuresare aimed at passing uptodate information on progress and making arrangementsfor the linkup without breaching securityissue 10 dec 98 6 39recognition between linkup forces in the desert the dust raised by the movement of unidentified forces raises the observers suspicions and his fears ofbeing attacked because getting the first shot in particularly by surprise often confersa commanding advantage there is perhaps greater risk in the desert thanelsewhere of friendly linkup forces engaging each other at ranges and in lightconditions where recognition is not easy it is necessary to have as foolproof mutualrecognition system as possible ideally radio contact between the two elements willhave been achieved well before they come within sight of each other and they will aimto occupy adjacent features from where an exchange of recognition signals can bemade however the radio may fail messages may be delayed and the two friendlyforces may make contact at an unexpected time and place coloured verey lightsignals coloured smoke or machinegun tracer bursts fired vertically into the air in adistinctive pattern sequence offer alternative methods colour light and smoke codeshould be established for each day for the period of the battle and notified in advanceto both elements this not only ensures recognition whenever the linkup occursbecause planned timings may go awry but also guards against compromise shouldan enemy counterattack sever the linkup forces an operation to reestablish contactat later date will automatically use different colour code execution 10 effecting the linkup as just mentioned the plans for the linkup may not go according to schedule one force may not be able to reach either the prominentlandmark chosen as contact point or one of the neighbouring features from whichcontact was to be established it will be up to the initiative of the commander of theother force to press on until he makes contact as the two sides draw close togetherthe establishment of direct communications at lower formation and battle group leveland the use of light signals will become even more important in an uncertain situationeven with the latest night observation devices it is safer to arrange linkup in daylightin the desert however if operational imperatives dictate night rendezvous the riskswill have to be accepted and minimized by reinsurance on the communication andvisual signal arrangements described in the last paragraph 11 fire support offensive air support to exploit offensive air support to the utmost without endangering ones own forces it is necessary to clear targets positively becausereliance on fscl suffers from the disadvantages mentioned in paragraph 2air control teams which are in close contact with the leading elements of the twoforces involved in the linkup must be deployed to ensure the safety of their owntroops as well as accuracy of attack in featureless country b artillery radio contact must be established between the appropriate artillery headquarters as well as the formation headquarters they support to preventaccidents when the two forces come within gun and missile range of each otheras well as to provide mutual support 12 combat service support force which has been suddenly isolated in the desert may be dangerously short of supplies of all kinds when linkup is finally achievedissue 10 dec 98 6 4the staff of the relieving force must arrange for the rapid replenishment of such force and should have convoy of vehicles or helicopters or both ready to push throughthe gap once contact has been established 13 traffic control traffic control organization must be set up not merely to prevent convoys and small groups of vehicles going astray in the advance to the linkup pointbut also to control traffic in the area where contact is made because the initial gap maybe small in the desert the dust clouds of replenishment convoys can be seen formiles by enemy artillery ops the establishment of waiting areas so that vehicles canbe halted kept dispersed and trickled through the gap to reduce vulnerability will bean essential part of the linkup traffic control plan section 2 relief in place circumstances 14 the circumstances in which relief may take place are the same as for any other theatre except that the emphasis may be on the need to relieve forces which havesuffered so heavily that they have to be withdrawn to recover their strength in men andequipment the surviving troops will be available to reform the depleted units andformations and train them collectively 15 it may not always be possible to relieve battered units and formations in the middle of battle when every man tank ifv and apc counts as temporary expedient itmay be necessary to amalgamate units and even formations provided that commondoctrine exists throughout the army this is practicable proposition the problem willbe less one of how to operate than of establishing command and personal relationships in battle groups comprising men from many units the rest of this section dealswith planned relief in which there is time for proper handover planning and execution 16 security formations and battle groups are particularly vulnerable during relief when large proportion of the force is exposed in the open some bunching isinevitable and the two formations command structures are changing over furthermore the new formation will not be familiar with the ground an enemy attack duringa relief can cause immense dislocation in any environment but especially so in thedesert where the incoming troops will find it more than usually difficult to orientthemselves in featureless surroundings security is essential the same level ofpatrolling radio traffic and movement must be maintained for as long as possible 17 protection if the risk of minor enemy interference is high additional protective measures such as ambushes on likely enemy fighting patrol routes should be takenif there is risk of major enemy attack the relief should be postponed 18 liaison small but carefully selected advanced parties should be sent up from the relieving battlegroups and formation headquarters to join their opposite numbers afew days before the relief to familiarize themselves with the situation enemy habitsand the ground battlegroup and squadron or company group op parties shouldissue 10 dec 98 6 5spend at least day in their new ops before relief panoramas sketches and range cards must be handed over to the incoming unit the new battlegroup squadron andcompany commanders should be given chance to discuss the situation beforehandover if it is not possible for the relieving units to send up advance parties theunits being relieved must leave rear parties to brief their opposite numbers in daylightstrong engineer reconnaissance elements must accompany the advance party tofamiliarize themselves with the minefield layout and to take over the records andmaps 19 routes and staging areas as relief in place is almost certain to be nighttime operation routes must be allocated by the staff of the outgoing formation and markedand lit by the provost units of both formations if possible separate up and downroutes should be allotted to the incoming and outgoing formations to controlmovement and to prevent congestion particularly at bottlenecks staging areasshould be designated as necessary traffic posts with recovery vehicles to winch outvehicles which become bogged down in soft sand as well as to deal with vehiclecasualties should be set up on stretches of difficult going as well as at route junctionsturning off places staging areas and at any place where drivers might miss their way 20 phasing the headquarters under whose command both the relieved and the relieving formations come will decide whether the relief is to be carried out on one nightor spread over several nights in order to avoid compromising security by the noise oftoo many vehicles moving at once and the dust clouds visible for miles in moonlightanother decision will be required on whether to relieve battlegroups all along the frontof division simultaneously or whether to relieve one brigade at time if there is anyrisk of attack having one forward formation intact and organized for defence willprovide stability on at least half the divisional frontage 21 timings the headquarters in overall command of the relief will lay down the key timings for the amove of reconnaissance and rear parties bstart of the relief this may be qualified by moritorium on all movement beforea certain hour in the interests of security the moves up and down should betimed to coincide with routine replenishment ccompletion of the relief dchange of command 22provision of fire support the formation in the lines artillery will provide fire support until the relieving formation has taken over its sector of the flot the relievingformations artillery will support the withdrawal of the outgoing formation if possiblethe combat arms and artillery of the relieving formation should not be on the move atthe same time and vice versa because the location of the other sides gun positionsis so easy in the desert it must be assumed that the enemy has pinpointed the outgoingformations gun areas ideally the incoming artillery should occupy different gunpositions from the outgoing artillery in order to avoid counterbombardment at leastissue 10 dec 98 6 6for short period it will be necessary to send the relieving artillery units survey troops up with the regiments advance parties at least day before the relief in order to surveyin the new gun positions accurately 23 command both the incoming and outgoing commanders should be collocated at the latters headquarters during the relief the timing of the change of command will beagreed on mutually between the outoing and incoming commanders at each levelsubject to the overall policy of the formation commander in charge of the entire relieftroops of the outgoing battle groups and formations remaining in their old positionsafter the change of command will remain under the new commander for all purposesuntil they vacate their positions on relief 24 communications if practicable the outgoing formations radio links and the usual voices should remain on the air until the end of the relief operation by the time enemysigint discovers the changes in voices and other idiosyncrasies the relief shouldhave been completedissue 12 feb 02 7 1chapter 7 air and air defence factors section 1 air factors 1 favourable air situation because of the lack of natural cover in the desert it is even more important to obtain and maintain favourable air situation above own troops than it is in the wooded and builtup environment of central europe withoutcontrol of air space not only do forward troops become vulnerable to enemy airattack but artillery will be less able to support them resupply casualty evacuationrecovery and repair will become increasingly difficult and the movement of reservesfor counterattack will be seriously inhibited in the open desert this can result in thelack of ability to turn the tables in defensive battle let alone win an offensive one adefender with inadequate air cover may be forced into fatal dispersion which invites defeat in detail in such an unfavourable air situation the only recourse may bea withdrawal to broken ground or into gebel where concealment is easier the enemysground and airborne radar is degraded by screening and clutter and air attack ismore difficult 2 the functions and roles of air forces all the functions and roles of air forces are the same in the desert as for elsewhere the separate functions of reconnaissance interdiction close air support and air interdiction are the same the methodsby which these functions are controlled by the air force and further reference to thecontrol and use of air forces for land operations is given in afm vol i 1 the only significant differences in the method of air operations in the desert and elsewhere isthe climatic conditions which can affect air operations directly there can be occasions when it is too hot to fly particularly during the middle of the day airframesbecome intolerably hot air coolants cannot function properly and it can be unsafe tofly for helicopter operations this can also affect the lift capacity adversely whichcan have significant effect on their capacity to operate beyond this routine aircraftand helicopter maintenance in the sand and dust conditions is significantly moredifficult to achieve and this could affect operational readiness and the availability ofaircraft for use 3 command of air forces air forces in support of land operations will normally be controlled at the highest possible level usually by the air support operations centreasoc at force headquarters 2 whether that be the equivalent of an army or corps centralized control exploits the flexibility of air power enabling it to be concentratedin time and space to the best advantage however in certain circumstances controlof portion of the air effort may be delegated to lower formation for particular taskwithin specific time limits indeed such delegation is essential if the response torequests is to be sufficiently quick 1 the specific publications are afm vol 1 pt 1 formation tactics and afm vol 1 pt 2 battlegroup tactics 2 the asoc will probably be split into two cells one dealing wi th offensive support asocos at main headquarters and the other dealing with helicopter support asocsh at rear headquarters raf advisorswill be needed at divi sion and brigade hqs dalo and balo issue 12 feb 02issue 12 feb 02 7 2section 2 control safety and target identification 4 identification of friendly forward troops the desert appears even more featureless to pilot than to the soldier on the ground at the speed aircraft travel it is difficult to recognize equipment and to tell friend from foe in mobile operationsespecially on battlefield cluttered with disabled tanks and vehicles shrouded inclouds of dust and perhaps obscured by palls of black smoke from burning oilinstallations fluorescent panels are useful for identifying the position of forwardtroops if control of the airspace is certain it may be possible to display them all dayprovided that they are hidden from enemy ground observation in an adverse airsituation it may only be possible to display panels just before friendly aircraft arrive tomake an attack as further aid to identification distinctive markings can be paintedon or fixed to vehicle roofs in static situation transponders or beacons broadcastingan electronic signal which friendly aircraft can pick up on its navigation or audiosystem may be used to give pilots general idea of where forward troops are located 5 positive control and target indication in the desert where it is difficult for pilots to discriminate between enemy targets and our own positions it is necessary to usea positive clearance system for close air support missions while previously agreedand promulgated plans and orders form controlling framework they are apt toimpose undesirable limitations in terms of timeliness and flexibility positive clearancemust be obtained from those units which might be at risk from friendly attack eachformation and battle group is responsible for the positive control of fire brought downwithin the area it currently influences in addition should formation or battle groupwish to engage target on or dangerously close to its boundary it must obtainclearance from its neighbour the following means of exercising control and aids formarking targets are available fac and laser designator the optimum method for controlling attacks on pinpoint targets is combination of forward air controller fac using ground toair radio and laser designator used by field artillery ops the latter isinvaluable for identifying targets to fighterground attack pilots dedicatedcommunications to notify the fac supporting artillery and own troops in thefeba of the eta of the aircraft are essential to coordinate target markingsuppress enemy antiaircraft fire minimize the danger to aircraft of flyingthrough the trajectory of shells and provide for the safety of forward troops b airborne fac if the air situation permits an airborne fac flying out of range of the enemys air defence weapons and sufficiently high to obtain good viewof the battlefield can describe the ground and landmarks from the perspectiveof the close air support pilot changes in the deserts colour and texture are oftenmore apparent from the air than from the ground when laser designatorcannot be used an airborne fac can point out the target and the locations of ourown troops in way the close air support pilot can readily recognize c coloured smoke and illumination rounds artillery and mortar coloured smoke white phosphorous and illumination rounds set for low airburst may be used tomark targets or to act as reference points in featureless terrain however asthere is usually stiff breeze in the desert smoke ammunition expenditure ratesmay be uneconomically high issue 12 feb 02issue 10 dec 98 7 3d panels fluorescent panels laid out in v pointing towards the target with other panels laid behind the letter to indicate an approximate range in units of 500metres may serve in an emergency artifical landmarks while aircraft use their own navigational aids to reach the battle zone artificial landmarks are invaluable in the absence of prominentnatural features to orient the pilot and provide reference point from which thefac can direct pilots to the target area 6 fire control lines in the concept of three dimensional deep close and rear operations especially in the featureless desert the use of lines such as the restrictedfire line rfl the battlefield coordination line bcl and the fire support coordinationline fscl are of declining utililty in any case lack of easily recognizable featuressmall scale maps and incomplete survey may oblige the joint ground and airoperations staffs to choose line further away from the flot than would be normalin northwest europe to avoid the risk of air attacks on friendly troops reliance must be placed in the positive clearance system described in the previous paragraphattacks which are beyond the facs range of control may be made in safety if the closeair support mission leader checks with the brigade or division air liaison officer thatthere has been significant change in the situation since the request was made andthat he is satisfied that there is danger to our own troops 7 safety of friendly aircraft just as it is important to safeguard the troops on our flot from attack by friendly aircraft by mistake so too it is necessary to avoidunnecessary casualties to our aircraft from friendly ground fire particularly in anunfavourable air situation when soldiers who have suffered enemy air attack are liableto shoot at any aircraft the problem is the difficulty of recognising friend from foe inthe context of the short engagement times against high speed aircraft while iffsystems provide speedy challenge and response for artillery air defence units otherarms can only rely on observation aircraft recognition and aircraft behaviour theyhave to make split second decision on whether or not to open fire the safestmeasure is to route outgoing and incoming aircraft round an open flank or over thesea in the absence of convenient flank air corridors in which ground forces willnot open fire on aircraft unless they behave in hostile manner may provide the mostpractical solution in the open desert artificial landmarks may have to be constructedto help pilots to recognize them however when air support is required in areas awayfrom the corridors aircraft safety may have to depend entirely on aircraft behaviourthe way in which pilots make their attacks and return over our lines and on notificationof their etas to the forward troops section 3 air defence 8 air defence scale and priorities combination of area and point defence guided weapons systems thickened up with machineguns mounted on apcs ifvs and softskinned vehicles provide defence and deterrent to air attack because of theopenness of the terrain and the vulnerability of ground forces higher proportion ofarea and point air defence systems will be needed than in central europe the greaterthe enemy air threat the more air defence artillery will be required to avert thepotentially disastrous consequences of air inferiority in the desert even so there areissue 10 dec 98 7 4unlikely ever to be enough guided weapon launchers and an opponent who has air superiority may have the technical ability to counter them formation air defenceplans must establish priorities for the protection of their most essential and vulnerableelements for each phase of battle they must also provide continuous cover duringan attack an advance or pursuit as well as over defensive position andcounterstroke forces to avoid exposing unprotected troops to needless casualtiesand perhaps defeat the air defence plan must be made jointly with the air force toensure the coordination of the air superiority operation as whole as well as the safetyof our own aircraft this involves the normal air space management for controlling airdefence weapons weapons unlimited weapons free weapons tight or weaponsheld and safe lanes 9 application of air defence principles concentration the most important principles in the deployment of air defence resources are mass and integration the temptation to disperse the system togive everyone degree of protection will result in an ineffective defence theadvantages of concentrating the air defence system combining area and pointweapons to give an effective umbrella with two layers of protection can beexploited tactically units and formations concentrating for security from airattack under the air defence umbrella will be able to avoid dangerous degreeof tactical dispersion b air defence in an unfavourable air situation however concentration of air defences in particular area may signal commanders intentions to the enemythe risk is particularly acute when fighting defensive battle in an unfavourableair situation the concealment of the axis of vital countermove on which theoutcome may depend will place commander in the dilemma of whether to gofor protection or surprise ideally the force should be despatched to the theatrewith the extra air defences to provide sufficient protection on an area basis asthis may not be possible it may be necessary to resort to deception and aredeployment of air defence weapons to preselected sites at the last minute ifin countermove the leading elements are able to penetrate the enemysattacking forces in depth they may be able to create sufficient confusion to inhibitthe enemys ability to exploit his advantage in numbers of attack aircraft andarmed helicopters for critical period c flat desert terrain the lower and less cluttered air defence radar horizons in the open desert enable enemy aircraft to be acquired and engaged at longerranges offering combination of better protection and the infliction of higherrate of attrition than an enemy air force can sustain however there is theassociated problem in flat terrain that friendly response from an iff radar sidelobe can cause an operator to think that an enemy aircraft approaching headon is friendly d priorities defensive positions gun areas and css facilities will normally be high on formation air defence priority lists headquarters can be sited within the airdefence envelope and should be given point defence protection in additionissue 10 dec 98 7 5e light air defence weapons because air defence systems can be saturated and decoyed vehiclemounted machine guns and handheld launchers play an important role in boosting the system as whole and promoting troop morale inan unfavourable air situation even so only some enemy low level systems willbe deterred because the more sophisticated airtoground weapons can belaunched from aircraft outside the range of low level air defence weapons 10 action on enemy air attack logistic installations derive benefit from the depth of the air force radar coverage and are able to organize warning systems to caution mento take cover and alert designated launchers and automatic weapons for quickreaction in forward areas where attacks may develop in split second formationand unit sops will lay down the action to be taken by troops mounted in vehicles andon the move when attacked from the air much will depend on the seriousness of thethreat light attack if the attack is minor or sporadic one and the going is good and fast it may be possible to continue the move the vehicles speeding up and swerving except for those belonging to air defence missile detachments whichwill halt and go into action an effective tactic for lone vehicle singled out forattack is to drive fast towards the approaching aircraft forcing the pilot into thedanger of steepening his angle of attack and then to swerve 30 degrees to oneside when it is estimated that the pilot is about to fire his missiles or cannon b heavy attack in the face of serious attack column should stop troops in soft skinned or lightly armoured vehicles dismount and move well away from themwhile every air defence weapon is brought to bear on the enemy aircraft thisincludes the pintlemounted machine guns on armoured vehicles whosegunners should remain at their posts armoured vehicles may fire their smokedischargers to confuse the pilot provided napalm is not being used in the eventof napalm attack tank crews should close down and switch off their engines toavoid ingesting napalm through their air intakes the dismounted troops lightmachineguns should be used to thicken up the fire although air defencemissiles may take greater toll of enemy aircraft the sheer volume of tracer maydistract the enemy pilots and weaken their resolve to press their attacks homeeven if an aircraft is not brought down some damage may be inflicted althoughthis may not be apparent to the machinegunner even solitary bullet hole hasto be examined by ground crew on return to base to make sure that nothing vitalhas been hit thus denying the enemy the use of an aircraft temporarily whenevery sortie may count c armedattack helicopter threat the armed helicopter is likely to prove greater threat than the fighterground attack aircraft in war against first classenemy at the ranges they may engage our forces only longer range air defenceweapons such as hvm are likely to be effective however it may take friendlyarmed helicopter to deal with similar enemy weapon system because in theextended ranges of desert warfare the enemy pilot will be able to keep belowour air defence missile envelope the advent of the helicopter masthead sightand the jamproof fibreopticguided nonlineofsight nlos missile may helpour own armed helicopters to reduce the enemy armed helicopter threat in the issue 12 feb 02issue 10 dec 98 7 6open terrain of the desert without such protection our troops may be very vulnerable in the forward areas section 4 helicopters armedattack helicopters 11 characteristics of employment the long ranges and good visibility associated with the desert at least until tracks and shell bursts stir up the sand enhance the valueof the armed or attack helicopter adding to its already formidable potential as majordestroyer of enemy armour in the context of fast moving battle fought over widearea of desert the aviation regiment provides valuable firepower which can beswitched round the battlefield in effective concentrations with relative ease and speedbecause army aviation is organic to formations helicopter support may well beprovided more quickly and more easily than close air support but this will depend onmany factors pilots of armedattack helicopter pilots may have the advantages ofknowing the units they are supporting and being acquainted with the ground becausethe fscl is likely to be much further away from the flot this local familiarity will beparticularly valuable in dealing with enemy armour in confused situation when theopposing forces are intermingled and where clouds of dust may obscure much of thebattlefield as the action develops armedattack helicopters can be deployed in avariety of ways depending upon the task for counterpenetration operations theconcentration of fire teams in time or space may give the best results but for offensiveoperations intimate armed reconnaissance patrols may offer the most effective wayof allocating aviation resources 12 target priorities the formation commander will specify target priorities for each phase of battle while enemy armour may be the most important target priority willusually have to be given to enemy weapon systems which pose threat to friendlyforce aircraft and jeopardize the success of an operation particularly in the opendesert provided that it is possible to locate identify and recognize specific types ofenemy equipment the order of priority may be air defence systems radar missiles and guns which have not been sup pressed by artillery fire b command and support tanks used for the control of artillery and fighterground attack c command tanks and apcs or ifvsd remaining tankse engineer vehicles breaching obstaclesf artillery provided that it can be engaged without unnecessarily risking the attacking aircraft issue 12 feb 02issue 10 dec 98 7 713control of armedattack helicopters the aviation regimental liaison officers attached to formation headquarters will be responsible for advising the staff on the useof antitank and attack helicopters tasking the attack missions and arranging forsuppressive artillery fire on known enemy positions and weapons which pose threatin the desert reconnaissance helicopters are in good position to locate targets fromabove the level of the heat haze because of the lack of covered approaches in flatterrain it is essential to coordinate the suppressive fire effort to force enemy armourin the area to close down and to neutralize hostile air defences before the arrival ofthe helicopters at the predetermined rv the reconnaissance helicopters mustmaintain contact with the enemy in order to achieve this they must also brief themission commander and crews of the latter on the position of targets and advise themon the best approaches from the points of view of terrain cover and the avoidance ofsoft sand where their rotors may stir up giveaway dust clouds the squadroncommander will normally coordinate an attack in brigade area making use of theinformation provided by his reconnaissance helicopters and the uptodate picture ofthe tactical situation painted by the liaison officer at brigade headquarters only instatic positions is the enemy likely to present an unbroken line of air defence in amobile battle wide gaps open up enabling reconnaissance and armed helicopters toexploit them to engage the enemy from unexpected directions it is the task ofreconnaissance helicopters to find and probe these gaps 14 factors affecting the operation of armedattack helicopters much care must be taken in the desert to provide good terrain screening for landing sites and to reducethe dust problem with membranes mats or treatment with oil while the latter methodis the most efficacious it leaves prominent dark stain visible to enemy airreconnaissance drones and satellites covered approaches to forward rvs andengagement areas are essential because flying napoftheearth in the open can raisea distinctive dust signature which can be spotted 20 km away although low speedof only 15 knots about 18 mph is sufficient to reduce the dust signature pilots enroute to the target will be aware of the need to avoid the risks of loitering ideallytargets should be attacked from an open flank using terrain cover downsun to aidsighting and to blind the enemy and from upwind to avoid dust obscuration at thetarget in the desert armed helicopters as opposed to attack helicopters will beforced to operate behind the flot although armour can be caught unawares byattack from an unexpected direction because tank crews closed down cannot seewell let alone hear an approaching attack helicopter static positions are hard tosurprise because their sentries have all round vision and can pick up the engine androtor noise because it is usually necessary to camouflage helicopters waiting on alanding site in the open desert formation and unit headquarters must pay particularattention to their helicopter planning states air mobility 15 the desert offers scope for air mobile and airborne operations round open flanks to seize important features in the enemys rear such as passes through gebel and gapsthrough escarpments sand seas sebkha or depressions at the end of successfulcampaign in particular when the enemys resistance has been broken airborne orhelicopterborne forces may be used to stake out territory for use as bargainingcounter in peace negotiations as forces dropped by parachute or delivered byissue 10 dec 98 7 8helicopter are likely to be relatively small lack

sustaina defence until linkup the main ingredients for success are favourable air situationsurprise and speed of linkup with the main forces such operations may be mountedto cut off retreating enemy or to block an enemy counterattack route where brokencountry limits the enemys choice of axes 16 the main problems are likely to be achieving surprise operational surprise will be obtained by good security striking in an unexpected location and deception tactical surprise may beobtained by using approaches covered from enemy observation and surveillance radars where gebel or escarpments provide good terrain cover there isno problem in flat featureless desert there are usually folds in the ground whichcan be exploited but they are difficult to find in deserts which are well surveyedroutes can be picked off the map although it may be advisable to check them byreconnaissance in poorly surveyed deserts prior reconnaissance is essentialbut it needs to be undertaken discreetly to avoid forfeiting surprise otherwiseinsertion may only be possible at night provided that there is sufficient moonlightto make possible low level approach by aircraft or napofearth flying byhelicopters in the latter case helicopters must fly just high enough to avoidraising telltale clouds of dust which will not only alert the enemy but interfere withthe vision of pilots flying at the rear of the stream b avoiding enemy sam defences although more difficult in the desert this can be achieved by careful routing and suppressing the enemys search and firecontrol radars in the exploitation of

especiallydefensible defiles deeper in the enemys rear than in european environment c compromise between size of force and available lift ideally the whole force should be delivered in one lift this provides the best chance of combiningsurprise and concentration of effort especially in the desert where it is hard toconceal such an operation whether two or more lifts are used to deliver largerforce will depend on the intelligence assessment of the enemys ability tointerdict the air route and the enemys likely speed and size of reaction againstthe dropping zone these considerations affect the decision whether to land asmaller force complete with sufficient ammunition water and rations to last untillinkup or whether to land larger combat force initially and build up supplies insubsequent lifts the optimum balance can only be assessed at the time d command and fire support decision will be required as to the moment that command of the airdelivered force passes from the headquarters whichlaunched the operation to the headquarters of the ground linkup force commuissue 10 dec 98 7 9nications must be arranged so that the airdelivered force can call for close air support

night using lzs with masked directional lights even where there is cover fromdirect observation it will be necessary to select lzs with view to exploiting coveredapproaches preferably from more than one direction and treating them as describedin paragraph 17 above to reduce the dust signature where this is not possible thedust hazard may be reduced by running take offs and landings and not hovering closeto the ground lzs should be positioned downwind of headquarters and installationsto further reduce the dust nuisance if helicopter is to remain on the ground for anylength of time it

armed helicopters offer measure ofresistance or at least impose significant delay on enemy armour the accent will beon exploiting mobility to surprise enemy tanks from defiladed fire positions and thento shoot and scoot armour 5 concentration although the advantages of using armour in sufficient concentra tions to obtain decision has already been mentioned they bear repeating whetherin attack or defence armour should operate in the largest concentration possible butwithout crowding together to offer vulnerable target it must also retain its mobilityif it is to be able to move to counter developing threat or to exploit success as littleas possible should be tied down supporting defensive positions if superiorarmoured force is to be split to make double envelopment attack the risk that theenemy may hold off one thrust sufficiently long to concentrate on and beat the otherissue 10 dec 98 8 2must be weighed carefully at the other end of the scale the squadron should be kept together as the basic fighting entity 6firepower protection and agility in the open desert targets will be acquired at greater range than in central europe and massed target arrays may be exposed forlonger periods commanders may be tempted to open engagements at too great arange when accuracy and lethality are significantly reduced balance must be struckbetween the need to open up at long range to cope with the number of targets and theneed to hold fire in order to maximise surprise and conserve ammunition hesh isa useful long range weapon against soft area targets but gun with the rangeaccuracy and lethality to destroy hostile tanks at greater range than can the enemyis the prime prerequisite of tank next come armour and survivability because tankcrews feel particularly vulnerable in the desert speed and agility are also importantto move rapidly between the longer bounds prevalent in the desert or to dodge behindcover ideally tanks should move from cover to cover in short 15 second boundsto avoid presenting the antitank guided weapon operator with an easy targethowever tanks are exposed for longer periods in the desert than elsewhere so thatspeed and agility may be less important to crew survivability than armour ideally nounnecessary attachments or kit should be fastened to the outside of tank whichmight catch fire or act as projectile when struck by splinter or blast to wound orkill the tank commander who may have his head out of the turret in defence the abilityof the dugin hull down tank to hold ground should not be underestimated particularlyas infantry are vulnerable in the open desert tanks may use semiindirecthighellipse fire to good effect indirect fire is longer taught however should desertcampaign continue for some time it may pay to train crews in the technique so thattanks not engaged on the flot could be used to provide indirect support against areatargets using hesh 7 gunnery the importance of being able to achieve first round kill at long range cannot be overstressed while all tank crews should be trained to an equal standardof competence it is recognised that battle casualty replacements may not be capableof achieving such high standards until they acquire the skill and confidence that comewith battle experience in such circumstances it may be worth using particularly skilfulcrews as sniping tanks another essential skill is the ability to engage targets indifferent directions rapidly this facility is especially useful in the dust and confusionof close range battle when enemy tanks appear suddenly from unexpected quarterswhen muzzle blast raises huge clouds of dust tank commanders within troop mayusefully spot and correct each others fire in addition to watching for and givingwarnings of unexpected threats of the other gunnery problems facing the tank themain ones are the adverse effect of blown sand on lasers which emphasises theadvantages of stadiametric rangefinders the heat shimmer which degradesboresighting and the gunners lay and the difficulty of range estimation hopefullyin future conflicts there will be time to learn how to allow or compensate for theseproblems during training before committal to battle 8 allround vision and awareness the ability to beat the enemy to the draw and the need for quickness to spot threats from hostile tanks armed helicopters and antitankguided weapons in confused situation require that the tank commander beconstantly aware of the situation around him although tank turret periscopes give anissue 10 dec 98 8 3allround view it is necessarily restricted one this is serious disadvantage in the desert where threats can materialize unexpectedly from any direction with his headout of the turret tank commander has greater awareness of the situation and canreact much quicker than when closed down however headsup policy isexpensive in tank commanders regimental commanders will doubtless have theirown policies which they will review in the light of battle experience

forward tanks it may be necessaryto hold the front with armour using such cover and undulations as are availableto enable tanks to occupy hull down positions and to hold the infantry tacticalbound further back depending on the situation the infantry could either moveforward to temporary positions at night to give the tanks local protection andcover replenishment or the tanks could move back

companies and their affiliated support section 2 combat support arms artillery 12 roles and principles of employment these are the same as for warfare in europe in medium paced operations over the frontages associated with desert warfare it maybe possible to plan for the leapfrogging of batteries to ensure continuous support andhaving sufficient guns or rocket launchers in action at any one time to produce aneffective concentration of fire in fast moving operations over long distancesespecially in rapid advance leapfrogging may be impracticable it will be necessary 1 at the battle of

the point in signal in reply to one from churchill pressing for offensive action whenhe took over the middle east command it is quite clear to that infantry divisions however well trained andequipped

and deploy rapidly into action off the line of march it will be upto the operational commander to decide where the main artillery effort is required andthe artillery commanders and staffs to plan the move and deployment of regimentsand batteries to provide the necessary support 13 concentration of fire the lack of concealment in the open desert and the ease with which firstclass enemy can pinpoint gun positions by locating devices includingdrones and air reconnaissance may oblige us to disperse our gun positions to takeadvantage of such cover which minor folds of the ground and wadis offer thetemptation so easy to succumb to in the desert to disperse fire in ineffectual pennypackets must be resisted all artillery must be commanded at the highest level thelong fields of view combined with modern fire control surveillance and communicationsystems facilitate the dispersion of gun positions without reducing the capacity toconcentrate and switch fire rapidly and effectively against targets in successionconcentrated artillery fire not only has pulverising and demoralizing effect it raiseshuge dense clouds of dust which drift for miles in the wind so thick that the enemybecomes disorientated and incapable of effective mutual support by the same tokenenemy artillery concentrations can produce similar effect on our own troops and itis necessary to site ops observation devices and radars as widely spaced aspossible in terms of both frontage and depth so that not all are blinded simultaneously 14 target priorities the greater range and effectiveness of modern surveillance and artillery especially mlrs can best be exploited by grouping the medium reconnaissance effort tracked helicopter and drone together with the artillery under onecommander in formation the senior artillery officer provides the best focal pointbecause satellite information is also readily available at that level and the close airsupport effort can readily be coordinated with artillery fire for both close and deepoperations the direct support regiments will normally support the brigade contactbattle while the general support group engages targets further out as explained inchapter 7 in connection with offensive air support the control of fire support insimultaneous deep close and rear operations requires both procedural and positivecontrol while procedural methods such as orders and sops form basis for controlthey suffer the disadvantage of inflexibility in terms of quick reaction to an unexpectedsetback or opportunity 2 it is therefore necessary to obtain positive clearance from all those who may be affected by the engagement of particular target it follows thatformations and battle groups should assume responsibility for the positive control offire against targets within the area which they currently influence these areas needdefining and disseminating in real time and should take account of the air spaceabove them as well as breadth and depth 2 the linear control

been used to some tacticaladvantage and have even achieved some operational and strategic results 1 an enemy anxious for quick decision or facing imminent defeat who is prepared toaccept retaliation in kind from power which possesses such weapons or some otherform of retribution may hint at their use to induce caution or actually employ themthe threat or use of nuclear weapons may be less likely but cannot be ruled outespecially if vital interests are in jeopardy or total defeat seems possible becausecities and civilian populations are not directly affected by nbc weapons used in desertareas there may be fewer inhibitions on their tactical use and perhaps greater riskof their employment than in any other environment on the other hand thosepopulation centres which do exist are especially vulnerable because of their greaterrelative importance and potential initiator may be apprehensive that his own citiesand industrial infrastructure would be put at risk by first use 2 the uk does not possess biological or chemical capability to effect deterrence in kind however well practised and advertised defensive measures may persuade anadversary that their employment would be unlikely to produce quick and irreversiblevictory consequently an enemy would be obliged to appreciate that any result fallingshort of speedy decision may not justify the risk of incurring not merely internationalodium but possibly damaging retaliatory escalation of the conflict in manner whichwould be seriously injurious to the perpetrator nbc weapons effects in desert environment 3 temperature

operations which recovered much of her lost territorytowards the end of the war in the summer of 1988 starting with the recapture of the fao peninsula at theend of april the iraqis expelled the iranians from their bridgehead over the shatt arab in may and tookmehran on the iranian side of the frontier in the central sector and the majnoon islands in the marshes tothe east of qurna in june

attack is at night or in the early morning whenissue 12 feb 02 9 6it is cool enough for the attacking enemy to wear ipe and when chemical weapons would be at their most effective in terms of agent behaviour similarly biological attacks are most likely in the night hours the aim here will be attrition rather than preparation for an early attack 15 the withdrawal withdrawal in the face of nuclear or chemical threats should be carried out suddenly secretly with great rapidity and over as wide front as possibleto prevent the enemy from locating targeting and striking troops while they are at theirmost vulnerable on the move if time permits the rearmost troops and echelons shouldbe thinned out discreetly beforehand careful route planning and traffic control will benecessary to avoid offering profitable targets especially at defiles through brokencountry or in bad going 16 rear operations as almost every commodity to support life and combat in the desert has to be imported stored

peculiarlyvulnerable to nbc attack limited only by the range of the enemys delivery systemsand the means of targeting them ports airfields main supply depots and workshopsprovide particularly attractive targets where there is risk that the use of especiallynuclear weapons and persistent chemical agents is anticipated such installations mustbe dispersed and duplicated minor ports must be developed for use airfieldsidentified and stocks of every kind of commodity dispersed to present the enemy withas difficult problem as possible in disrupting our maintenance and repair system 17 medical plans must be made to cope with mass casualties proportion of which may be contaminated at the time of an nbc attack it will be necessary to establishan order of priority for dealing with affected formations because of the openness ofthe terrain much larger number of casualties can be expected from enemy nuclearand strikes than in european theatre if there is an nbc threat additional medicalunits should be sent out to the theatre so that more field hospitals and medical unitscan be cleared and held in reserve to meet sudden demand on the existing medicalresources medical units should be provided with collective protection to allowcontinued patient treatment and care in the face of enduring hazards equipment husbandry 18 the principal considerations effecting the conduct of nbc defence in desert environ ments arise from the effects of heat on the individual soldier as described at paras811 above additional factors include the open nature of the terrain with itsconsequent enhancement of certain nuclear weapon effects and the impacts of hightemperatures on chemical agent behaviour these too have already been discussedthere remain certain impacts on equipment that derive from the likely lack of watersupplies and the frequently dusty conditions these are decontamination water supplies will always be at premium in the desert and this problem will be compounded if water

uptake requirements in nbc ipeissue 12 feb 02 10 1chapter 10 combat service support css section 1 basic css considerations general 1 the principles of providing effective css are unaltered by desert terrain the terrain does however place an added burden on distribution storage and maintenance any military formation is likely to be well spread out and this combined with poorground communications adds to the problem of keeping combat units properly andregularly supplied and of dealing with casualties to both men and equipment principles 2 the principles of css are detailed in afm vol 1 pt 6 combat service support these remain the same for desert operations however priorities will change and factors that may be ignored in temperate regions could become critical elsewhere size and composition 3 the friction of the desert vehicle availability fatigue and driving conditions as expe rienced in recent desert operations suggest level of css support is required which is significantly above that normally established with the deployed formation in orderto successfully sustain operations the composition and size of any military forcethat can be sustained in desert conditions depends on the number and capacity of the roads and routes and the means of improving them b the amount of ground and cover available for deployment off routec availability of specialist transport equipment and suppliesd climate 4 other factors that also influence the logistic support of operations in desert terrain are as follows air situation b availability of air transport support c availability of css units to support the force including those required for air resupply section 2 css planning general 5 success in desert operations is unlikely to be possible without coordinated and flexible css plan such plan will stem from the sustat produced by pjhq and isissue 12 feb 02 10 2likely to be based on the principles of css after detailed appreciation of the facilities available the following paragraphs identify some of the topics which merit carefulconsideration during the formulation of css plan reconnaissance 6 detailed reconnaissance is required to cover the road and going conditions to decide the type and maximum number of vehicles that can be employed in the area the construction of new roads or improvements to existing ones may need to be considered in order to supportprotracted operations in isolated areas b possible deployment areas and suitable sites for administrative areas and bases c suitable sites for dzs lss and short range tactical airstrips d availability of water sources availability of local resourcesf special equipment required g availability of hardstanding for equipment support repair assets command and control 7 planning flexible and comprehensive css plan for supporting operations in the desert will depend on combination of forward planning reconnaissance stockpil ing and replication and adjustment by regular checks on the vital aspects of cssplan good communications reserves alternative supply arrangements and regular monitoring of stocks 8 echelon system echelon systems may help in the development of sound css plan although they do not vary significantly from that pertaining to other operations combat service support 9 supply the frequency of distribution of supplies will be affected by the terrain and disruption to lines of communication cross servicing of essential items between units will seldom be possible in such circumstances essential supplies should becarried within forward formations and units it may be appropriate to increase theinitial stocks and holdings of certain equipments or supplies partly to take accountof the increased affiliations of units and specialists 10 stockpiling in mobile operations excessive quantities of supplies should not be carried forward as this may limit mobility and require troops to guard grounded stocksin static or mobile operations centred on defended bases stockpiles may be established to provide buffer against failures in the resupply system such stockpilinggenerally requires an increased level of stock holding in theatre however if suppliesare limited centralized storage and control is usually more efficient particularly if anefficient air resupply system is in operationissue 12 feb 02 10 311 limited resources good communications centralized store holding and air resupply provide the most efficient use of limited supply resources in desert regions logistic support 12 scaling it is essential that there is close cooperation between g1g4 staffs and logistic support representatives at the planning stage of operations to ensure that the stores scalings reflect the specific equipment requirements for operations in desertconditions 13 unit replenishment unit replenishment may be done on push or pull basis depending on the environment and tempo of operations pull replenishment is basedon complete unit demands and coordinated through the bde dcos push replenishment has in the past been based on daily maintenance pack dmp where units areprovided with predetermined selection of commodities units may demand increases or reductions daily in individual items this system simplifies unit actionallows forward planning of transport particularly by air and establishes regularroutine the dmp scale can be revised in the light of experience gained during anoperation this procedure ensures that combat supplies are delivered regularly toforward units even if radio communications are poor 14 combat supplies terrain characteristics usually reduce the number and type of equipments deployed within the force this reduction in equipment dependency willbe reflected in reduced supplies requirement materiel support may be limited tospares for communication equipments and light weapons similarly combat supplysupport may be restricted to rations and small arms ammunition resupply by vehicle will increase fuel consumption and the need for repair units and larger stocks ofvehicle spare parts tyres gear boxes and engines 15 special pol there will probably be requirement for special pol products to support equipment operating in extremes of climate 16 ammunition the difficulty of observing fall of shot and increased use of smoke is likely to lead to high consumption rates the limited range of light artillery equipmentmay require frequent change of gun position so limiting the ability to stockpile ammunition furthermore ammunition resupply may be limited by the available transport it is thus essential that the resupply system for all natures of ammunition required for operations in desert areas is planned as early as possible 17 water in all theatres adequate water supply is essential to maintain fighting effi ciency hygiene and morale in the desert supplying water will pose difficult problems although efficiency can be maintained for short periods on emergency ratesnormal requirements for drinking have to be met as soon as possible it is importantthat ramc advice is sought before minimum consumption rates are set within atheatre of operations 18 selection and testing of water sources in general reconnaissance selection and development of water sources and subsequent treatment are an engineer responsibility the ramc is responsible for testing for poisons and toxic substancesissue 12 feb 02 10 4the collection of water is unit or re responsibility but rlc assistance may be required for bulk movement as suitable water sources in arid mountainous areasare often scarce or inadequate operational plans should always cover water supplyand distribution it may be necessary to hold positions specifically to retain accessto local water source 19 water discipline the human body cannot be trained to function without water or to operate on reduced intake if there is shortage of water the following rules ofwater discipline should be enforced there have to be orders for drinking to prevent troops husbanding supplies and precipitating state of dehydration leading to deterioration in performance this could be particularly important in chemical environment when troopsare forced to wear full ipe b all water should be sterilized before being used for drinking or for washing and cooking food water for personal washing does not need to be purified unlessgrossly polluted all water sources should be reported their positions loggedat unit or formation hq and medical officer should test them for diseases andpoisons individual sterilising kits are issued for use whenwater is not availablefrom military water point c issue of water has to be strictly controlled sources likely to be required for drinking must not be polluted by washing or by animals d if drinking has to be temporarily restricted when supplies are inadequate fluid balances must be fully restored by the end of each 24 hour period medical support 20 bulk resupply of medical resources in theatre requires particular coordinated plan ning and control by ramc and rlc staff specialist medical equipment can besupplied into the theatre in the normal way but allocated from there on under ramccontrol commander should note that the potential extremes of climate and thephysical conditions involved in operating in desert environment will raise the emphasis to be placed on medical expertise and resources it would be prudent toensure that medical staff are able to operate under the best possible conditions andthat these are clearly underpinned by an effective medical support process equipment support 21 general harsh desert terrain conditions are likely to increase the repair load par ticularly on tracked and wheeled equipment at the same time inferior road commu nications will make it difficult to carry out routine recovery from forward areas to thelocal base emphasis will therefore be on having repair teams and repair facilitiesforward with urgently needed spares being flown in whenever possible and on improvisation by individual craftsmen increased flying rates increase the servicingrequirement for light aircraft and helicoptersissue 10 dec 98 10 522camouflage equipment special camouflage clothing and equipment including nets are likely to be required in quantity stocks of camouflage paint should be heldfor the initial deployment and subsequent maintenance and replacement of vehiclesguns and equipments transport considerations 23 air transport support maximum use should be made of all available air transport to enhance mobility where possible helicopters should be used to deliver suppliesdirect to units and gun positions air support may be limited by weather availabilityof lzs dzs and the enemy air and ground threat these limitations may in certaincircumstances preclude reliance on air transport alone and alternative plans to usesurface transport should be made for fixed wing operations it is preferable to provide airland facilities due to the specialist equipment required for any intended airdrop engineer equipment may however have to be dropped in advance to enable asuitable airstrip to be prepared or constructed however in terrain at high altitudeheavy drop direct to units may be required recovering heavy drop and underslungload equipments will need careful planning 24 mechanical transport normal road transport should be used as far forward as possible although unit transport should be restricted to moving essentials units offthe main axis should operate on light scales using vehicles capable of carrying up toone tonne unit transport not required should be centralized in base areas 25 rail if railways exist in the general area they should be fully utilised as they are particularly suitable for l of c tasks the rlc retain small number of railwaytrained officers who would advise on local railway resources 26 loading drills when loading materiel in any form of transport for delivery to an area of operations items of low priority should be loaded first and those high priorityitems required first at the destination should be loaded last experience has shownthat this principle is important in desert operations traffic control 27 the methods of traffic control assume increase importance when routes are poorly marked in deserts in particular there is requirement for early location and marking of bottlenecks deploy ment areas for various types of transport alternative routes must be identifiedand allocated as soon as possible b good communications are essential especially between start and finish points on congested portions of the route and at any passing points c high standard of driving and discipline as required of all vehicle driversd there is need for an efficient organization to clear obstacles caused by emy action the elements or brokendown vehiclesissue 10 dec 98 10 6e particularly good signing is required for both day and night moves f whenever possible at least two routes should be selected one for vehicle traf fic and the other for troops on foot if possible additional separate routes forwheeled and tracked vehicles should also be allocated administrative g1 support 28 provost roads and tracks should be properly marked and crosscountry routes and hazardous points should be well signposted and marked with reflectors alltraffic control posts should be manned to provide for 24 hours assistance adviceand information 29 prisoners of war prisoners are serious embarrassment in forward areas even when they are adequately clothed and they often will not be their rapid evacuationto avoid their becoming medical casualties to prevent traffic congestion and to allowfor their timely interrogation is important when the enemy suffers reverses eithertactical or logistic the number of prisoners may well be large particularly if rationsare running short and morale is low arrangements must be adequate to cope withsuch situation if forward troops are not to be seriously hamperedissue 10 dec 98desert operations part b skills drills and minor tacticsissue 12 feb 02 1 1chapter 1 surviving in the desert section 1 acclimatization acclimatization 1 body adjustment the body needs to adjust gradually to the harsh conditions of the desert this section outlines the ways in which the environment affects the soldier adversely how to ensure that the man does not suffer and that he and his unit canoperate effectively in desert climate is matter of training initially and constantsupervision subsequently there are five aspects to the problem askin bcardiovascular system cfluidsalt balance dglare etime to acclimatize 2 skin constant exposure to the sun ages the skin and those who overexpose themselves to sunlight for long periods suffer much higher incidence of skin cancer severe burns can be inflicted at altitude where thinner atmosphere provides lessprotection from ultraviolet radiation similar penalty can follow the exposure ofunprotected skin at sea level under an overcast sky when the ultraviolet rays arescattered rather than absorbed by thin cloud suntan to protect the skin takes twoto three weeks to acquire sun creams such as sunscreen can be useful in the earlystages of achieving tan chapsticks or petroleum jelly for those allergic to themhelp to prevent cracked lips 3 cardiovascular system the system needs time to adjust to hot weather for two reasons it has to produce more blood to increase the amount required near the skinwithout robbing the main internal organs and it has to keep the pulse rate down 4 fluidsalt balance with an increased water intake the body needs to adjust its ability to retain sufficient salt until man is acclimatized he loses about 4 grammesof salt per litre of sweat thereafter he loses only 2 grammes per litre extra salt shouldonly be taken on medical officers advice because too much can be as harmful astoo little in certain circumstances medical officer may prescribe extra salt in waterfor the first three to four weeks in hot desert in order to adjust the balancethereafter the amount of salt in the daily compo ration is sufficient until more than 6litres of water day are drunk when the medical officer must be consulted 5 glare radiant light comes from all directions not only does glare damage the eyes but it is very tiring dark glasses or goggles are necessary but should be shielded fromdirect sunlight to avoid giveaway reflection if neither glasses nor goggles areissue 12 feb 02 1 2available and the light is very strong some soot from camp fire or brew can smeared on the cheeks under the eyes will absorb some of the glare 6 acclimatization the time it takes to become acclimatized depends on the season and location for example during the hot season in the north african western desertand sinai it usually takes about two weeks in the arabian peninsula about monthprovided that troops work in the heat and sweat very few men cannot acclimatizeproperly and they have to be sent home fit thin men do well in the heat fat mencannot lose heat so easily and hard work in high temperatures can be dangerous forthem some desert and gebel climates are so hot in the summer that operationsrequiring considerable exertion should be carried out at night 7 artificial accelerated acclimatization even during the hottest months provided troops are fit work in the heat and sweat profusely for two hours day 80acclimatization can be achieved within four days and 100 in fortnight as acorollary soldiers living in airconditioned barracks or ships can maintain gooddegree of acclimatization provided that they do hard physical work in the ambienttemperature but they will lack stamina the problem is that units may not have twoweeks to acclimatize on arrival in an overseas theatre in the event of an operationalemergency in very hot weather commander will attempt to fight by night avoidingunnecessarily strenuous operations in the heat of the day even so he may have tochoose between accepting high proportion of heat casualties and the loss ofimportant ground or an essential entry point if he is lucky there may be standoffperiod before the start of hostilities in all but the direst of emergencies it will benecessary to pace work to start with if troops arrive in extreme heat it may benecessary to work and train at night and rest by day heat illnesses 8 general in hot conditions and on the move crewmen in the back of afvs without air conditioning change physical state quickly and without noticeable symptoms while this remains the case procedural method of preventing this is to stop for 5 mins every20 mins during long marches the crew should then dismount drink water and walkaround in hastily erected shade the cause is drop in blood pressure and lack ofblood flow to the brain as the blood vessels near the surface of the body distend theremedy is acclimatization which conditions the body to produce more blood to balancethe system 9 heat exhaustion the causes are water or salt depletion and the symptons are similar water depletion this is brought on after period of heavy sweating without fluid replacement it is most common amongst the unacclimatized who have not learned to drink little and often or who ignore the dictates of thirst the thirstsensation will diminish when the body is lacking salt in addition thirst is satiatedwhen only about 75 of the water requirement is made good so drink waterpast the point of thirst quenching the signs and symptoms of water depletionmay be any of the following 1 exhaustion tiredness and anxiety2 dizziness and headacheissue 10 dec 98 1 33 lack of appetite 4 vomiting and stomach cramps5 fast breathing or gasping for air6 rapid weak pulse7 normal to raised body temperature8 scanty and highly coloured urine if palid urine is passed once day it is an indication of satisfactory hydration 9 damp clammy skin10 little or sweating11 decreased conscious level leading to fainting and collapse12 shivering with goose pimples on hot skin b salt depletion this may contribute to any form of heat exhaustion even without dehydration it may lead to severe cramp stokers cramp in some circumstances c treatment for both water and heat exhaustion the treatment is 1 stop exercise and walking2 move into the shade3 drink water slowly in frequent sips an added electrolyte mixture may be added with medical advice 4 lie patient down with feet elevated on any convenient object strip clothing to underwear 5 fan the patient to create air movement over the skin6 sponge or spray the whole body with cool water d response usually the condition will respond to treatment fairly quickly with continued fluid intake it should not recur should measures not be taken at thefirst signs of heat exhaustion the casualtys condition will deteriorate and couldbecome fatal if the patient does not improve rapidly he should be evacuated awareness directly symptons appear in one member of troop or platoon the commander must watch for further cases because the remainder may be closeto the limits of toleranceissue 10 dec 98 1 410heatstroke symptoms the bodys heat regulating mechanism fails and the victims temperature rises steadily heatstroke may or may not be produced by heatexhaustion the onset is sudden deterioration is quick and the consequencesare severe because once the body temperature normally 37c 986f risesabove 412c 106f the cell proteins start to cook and death often occursbeyond 433c 110f the symptons are 1 the skin reddens and becomes hot and dry to the touch2 severe headache3 staggering gait4 confusion5 irritability and aggressiveness6 delirium7 convulsions8 coma9 the change from full bounding pulse to rapid weak pulse is grave danger signal b treatment the aim is to cool the patient down as quickly as possible and certainly within an hour of collapse 1 lie the casualty in the shade immediately2 strip off all his clothing3 fan him continuously4 drench him with water or wrap him in wet towel5 give him small sips of water if he is still conscious6 send for medical help to start an intravenous drip of saline solution7 be prepared to give mouthtomouth resuscitation exhaled air resuscita tion ear

and the watchfulness of commanders are the surest ways to detect heat illness earlyissue 10 dec 98 1 5awork in buddy pairs 1 look for signs of heat illness in each other2 if one starts to lag behind the other must stop to help him warning his commander b if one shows symptons of heat illness make him rest cool him down and see that he drinks small sips of water often cstop and drink every hour commanders must ensure that there are hourly breaks for rest and water ddrink plenty of water often and keep away from alcohol other medical problems 12prickly heat the mechanism is not precisely known but inefficient sweat glands become blocked most people suffer from it in hot and humid climates to some extentbut it is seldom more than an irritating nuisance however if large proportion of thebody is affected the ability to sweat will be severely limited and such cases may beserious enough for evacuation to control prickly heat wear loose clothing keepequipment off the back and

rarely lethal theimmediate first aid is to reassure the victim immobilise the stricken limb as for afracture having washed away any excess venom and get the victim to medicalofficer as quickly as possible killing the snake or scorpion for identification is nolonger necessary because modern serums can deal with wide range of venoms butmight be advisable to prevent further casualties provided that it can be done withoutendangering the executioner as general precaution boots and clothes should beshaken out before putting them on latrine seats should be inspected before sitting onthem and

cannot be made to drink less than is neededto keep his sweating mechanism working efficiently any attempt to condition men towater deprivation inevitably leads to heat casualties the amount of water requiredto replace that lost through sweating varies with the severity of the climate and thedegree of physical activity as rough and ready guide man loses about litre anhour either working or sitting in an unairconditioned vehicle without replacement theloss of only 08 litres produces measurable deterioration in mental performance andof 2 litres significant lack of ability to do any hard physical

be too late to prevent trouble passing little urine is sign of dehydrationdark urine may be another indication but not very reliable one 17 bottled water is so bland that it discourages men from drinking sufficient water the optimum drinks for marching working and fighting are fruit juice and powderedlemonade jungle juice because they satisfy taste as well as thirst and contain usefulamount of sugar sweetened tea is an excellent drink and fortunately popular in thearmy but the soldier will normally have to make do on water surprisingly satisfyingand refreshing drink in the heat of the

vendors men with stomach ailments mustreport sick as soon as possible 22 flies are perpetual source of irritation and infection only good sanitation can keep the fly menace at bay latrines should be sited well away from and downwind ofcamps and leaguers whereas on the move personal sanitation is matter of takinga shovel to any cover which can be found when in camp or leaguer for any length oftime

spraying insecticides from vehicle exhausts or hand spraying machines mosquito nets can be chemically impregnated to give protection againstsandflies feeding 23 the initial effect of heat is to reduce the appetite so that the body uses up more calories than it ingests this is inevitable and acceptable for short period but watch mustbe kept for those whose appetites do not recover so that they can be examined by themedical officer before their health deteriorates 24 boilinthebag rations like the old compo provides balanced diet including enough salt extra salt should not be added without medical advice there is need forvitamin pills however packaged food becomes boring the problem is exacerbatedby the need to keep dispersed in the desert and consequently to cook on vehiclebasis anything an imaginative qm or staff sergeant can provide to make food moreinteresting is good for mens health and spirits with little flour and rice anenterprising cook can make the compo ration attractive fresh rations should beprovided whenever practicable 25 flies and sand get into food causing gastric disorder the need to keep rations covered from the moment they are taken out of the tin or unwrapped for eating cannotbe overstressed plastic plates and cutlery are especially hygienic because they aredisposable empty food cans and waste must be burned and buried as quickly aspossible because they attract flies subunit communal burning pits should be dugwhen static flies must not be swallowed because they feed on faeces there is arisk that sizeable proportion of newly arrived troops in tropical theatre will beafflicted by diarrhoea unless stringent precautions are taken if however it doesoccur with good hygiene the problem soon clears up if the trouble persists or ifunusual symptons break out in particular units or areas the medical services must bealerted quickly investigation may reveal the source to be more than lapse inhygiene which can speedily be rectified in the worst case it might be the first indicationof hostile bacteriological warfare campaign section 2 morale 26 operating in the desert is tiring and in hot weather exhausting both physically and emotionally although the stresses and strains may be different from those enduredin other extreme conditions such as high mountains or jungle the most importantingredient for success is the same positive state of mind the desert is essentiallyneutral and the side which is better prepared and better able to adapt to it has animmense advantage soldiers who are proud of being desert rats and haveconfidence in their ability to master the environment and turn it to good tactical useagainst the enemy have clear lead over those who are not at home in or evenfrightened of the desert despite its harshness it has compelling attraction andbeauty 27 the lack of natural barriers against surprise breeds feeling of insecurity the passive solution is good surveillance system and alertness the positive remedyissue 10 dec 98 1 9is offensive action to compel the enemy to dance to our tune the necessity to carry out repairs and replenishment in the dark the need to spend much of the nightplanning giving out orders and during fluid battle moving and fighting takes agreater toll of human endurance in the open desert than in most environmentscommanders in particular get very little rest in ten or twenty day operation sleepis important tired commanders are less resolute and make mistakes wearysoldiers are less brave and alert 28 good imaginative positive and sympathetic leadership is the key to high morale in desert operations as in any other to this add success in battle and soundadministration inevitably the latter will rely on resource and improvisation whensupplies and stores go astray in the hurlyburly of fast moving battle 29 situations vary when the army is successful and in the news such as at the time of oconnors victory at sidi barrani and his advance across cyrenaica in the winter of194041 montgomerys success at alamein and the campaign to liberate kuwaitin 1991 public support reinforced the boost for morale which follows victory at othertimes the forgotten army syndrome the feeling that the efforts and sacrifices of thesoldiers in severe climate are not appreciated by an indifferent public at home iscorrosive of morale good pr force newspaper and reports on the theatre in thenational and local press which find their way to the front are invaluable in promotingmorale equally important is the need to keep troops as well informed as security willallow on the progress of operations lack of information fosters an uncomfortablesense of isolation in the open desert where an attack can materialize suddenly fromany direction 30 after good leadership perhaps the most important elements in morale when troops are dispersed across the desert are the cohesion and loyalties within the small groupsuch as the tank crew the ifv section and the antitank guided weapon detachmentone mans lapse may jeopardize the whole groups survival discipline especiallyselfdiscipline and confidence in ones comrades competence and dependability arepriceless assets section 3 the effects of desert on equipment clothing and personal equipment 31 although combat helmets are needed by dismounted infantry sappers and towed gun detachments as protection against shell splinters and the showers of stones thrownup by shell bursts they become hot and uncomfortable when worn for prolongedperiods out of contact soft hat with brim to shield the eyes and neck is the mostsuitable headgear wide angle dark goggles or tinted glasses which do not blockperipheral vision prevent eye strain and fatigue they must be worn under the brimof hat or combat helmet to prevent telltale reflection fine blown sand penetratesbetween even the tightest fitting goggles and the skin to irritate the eyes and causeconjunctivitis eyedrops are useful antidote 32 the cotton desert combat suit proved its worth during operation granby of the alternatives loose shirts which absorb sweat or cellular which allow the body heatissue 10 dec 98 1 10to escape and sweat to evaporate are also suitable for the desert in very high temperatures the light cellular shirt is better trousers should be soft hard wearingand cool denim is an excellent material the temptation to smarten uniforms in ahot desert by making them close fitting should be resisted the problems of wearingnbc protective clothing in chemical environment are explained 33 in cold and wet weather the standard high combat boot provides useful support for the ankle on rough rocky ground and keeps the sand out in hot weather it is souncomfortable that desert boot has been designed to replace it for betterventilation the trousers should be worn loose outside the boot unless there is seriousdust or poisonous insect problem the rocky terrain is hard on boots and they wearout quickly they also dry out and crack unless nongreasy cleaner such as saddlesoap is used more informal footwear such as loose ankle length boots make forcomfort out of contact with the introduction of the desert boot there is real needfor other footware although some mounted long range reconnaissance units andirregular forces operating on foot in the gebel may prefer to wear them if chaplis areworn without socks care should be taken to acquire tan on the feet and ankles 34 the carriage of personal equipment is subject to role and local improvisation for the infantryman the standard 90 pattern

neck to keepout the sand within reason sartorial oddities are good for morale 35 protection against chemical weapons and nuclear fallout presents serious problem in the heat of the day because nbc suits would be stifling and remaining masked upextremely uncomfortable and b vehicles 36 effects of bad going on vehicles the main source of damage to vehicles is rock either loose stones and boulders or sharp ledges tyres become badly cut wholepieces being torn out of them they must be checked regularly and changed beforefailure higher scale of spare tyres is required in the desert than in europeantheatre and crews trained and equipped for puncture repairs tank ifv and apctracks are easily thrown on rocky ground hydropneumatic and hydrogas afvsuspension systems are particularly useful in the desert normal vehicle springs andsuspension systems are liable to fracture and damage with consequent requirementfor increased scaling other items which require constant checking are bevel andsteering boxes track wedge bolts sprocket nuts and transmission shaftsissue 12 feb 02 1 1137 desertization of vehicles the following points are relevant aideally tanks vehicles and other equipment should be modified for the desert before despatch from the uk however neither the vehicles accompanying aforce sent overseas at the beginning of campaign nor the replacements sentout for some time thereafter are likely to have been converted workshopfacilities to desertize vehicles have to be set up in the theatre agreement shouldbe reached between the ministry of defence and the force headquarters as towhat modifications should be carried out in the factories depots and workshopsat home and the vehicle depots and workshops overseas nevertheless thereis one important modification which must be carried out before embarkationdust ingestion poses such serious problem with tracked vehicles and helicopters that they have to be provided with adequate air filtration before they arrivein the theatre b modifications required for tactical reasons apart from the technical modifi cations required the essentials are the reduction of silhouette and shadowdefinition the removal or covering of glass to prevent the suns reflection 3 the means to extract vehicles from soft sand and to ensure the survival of strandedcrew and measures to defeat the wear and tear caused by grit c cooling systems in very hot deserts armour and any other vehicle which does not readily allow through draught should be fitted with cooling system heatmaking equipment eg radios need ventilation as well as the vehicle occupantsthe cooling system should be designed to function well whether the vehicle isclosed down or opened up air conditioner ductings should be insulated ductingmust be checked

lower the temperatureinside the vehicle if the material is allowed to droop in the centre over the vehicleit will increase the wind speed and the cooling effect in the same fashion as abedou tent top vehicle colours all vehicles should be repainted in suitable desert camouflage colours if possible before despatch overseas care should be taken to selectthe right colours not all deserts are yellow or brown some are predominantlygrey 38 desertworthiness as factor in planning the state of preparedness of troops and their equipment for the desert is significant factor in considering the timing

light and humidity 39 high temperature tyres heat increases tyre pressures to dangerous levels and it is necessary to carry out checks in the middle of the day and routinely on long journeys to make sure that the safety limit is not exceeded consideration needs to be givento the reinflation of tyres on vehicles that do not have an integral capacity b fuel and oil fuel expands under heat and vehicle tanks should never be filled to capacity oils tend to thin out in the heat and engines need higher viscosityoils in the hot season c tank gun barrels in the morning the suns heat expands the upper side of tank gun barrels while the lower half in the shade is only affected by the ambienttemperature consequently the barrel droops slightly and until it has beenwarmed evenly by firing several rounds shot tends to drop short as the daywears on the heat reflected from the desert surface particularly rock expandsthe under side of the barrel but not necessarily to compensate for the suns heaton the upper surface the mismatch between gunsight and barrel can exceed7 mils and result in miss from an apparently perfectly aimed round such adisability could result in an enemy obtaining the first hit and loss of the advantageof surprise in defensive ambush situation the gun tube sleeve used in europeis designed primarily to protect the barrel from moisture special thermalsleeve with builtin compensator is great asset in achieving first round killin the desert d spirit levels guns and instruments which rely on spirit levels for laying and sighting suffer from bubble trouble in the

bemeasured the angular measurement east or west of this imaginary line is theequivalent of longitude on earth but is called right ascension in astronomical parlancealthough the angular measurement can be expressed in degrees like longitude eastor west of greenwich it is usually stated in hours and minutes clockwise in thenorthern hemisphere and anticlockwise in the southern because the observer islooking at the opposite side of the celestial sphere 65 selecting convenient stars to tell the time star which lies on the zero24 hours right ascension line can be used to tell the time without any difficulty fortunatelythere are two stars one in the northern hemisphere caph in cassiopeia and one inthe southern beta ß in hydrus which are obligingly situated unfortunately the twostars cannot be seen all the year round at desert latitudes however when they areout of sight it is possible to use other stars by making simple correction to allow fortheir right ascension the angular distance between the first point of aries and thestar for all practical purposes this is the same as the angular distance expressedin hours between the star and caph in the northern hemisphere or beta in

westward drift although the day measured by clocks and the sun is 24 hours long the star sphererotates in slightly shorter period 23 hours and 56 minutes this is because the earthis moving steadily in its orbit round the sun throughout the year so that the stars rise4 minutes earlier each night this accounts for the changing pattern of constellationsin the night sky throughout the seasons the

up the vehicles at intervisibility distance and moving forward steadily in line good control is necessary to maintain the integrity of the line and to make sure that any dead ground is properly examined either reserve vehicles should be given the task of searching dead ground or the whole line should be halted while the hidden area is reconnoitred ideally control should be exercised by radio but if some vehicles are not equipped with set radio must be supplemented by flag signals square search designed to cover flat desert 78 air search air reconnaissance is the quickest and most efficient sea rch method particularly at night when survivors will use some of the m ethods listed in paragraph 75 above to attract attention air photography can be usefu l in training area in which there are few vehicles but on an old battlefield it may not be possible to tell the lost vehicles from battle casualties in peacetime police and c ivilian vehicles may show up on air photographs and have to be checked the most seri ous difficulty facing an air search is an overturned vehicle because its underside is perfectly camouflaged from weeks of driving across sand and the crew may be

depend on the amount of water he has with him or can get access to mans chances ofmaking successful escape are reduced the longer he remains prisoner and thefurther the enemy takes him away from the battlefield although prisoner should beallowed to keep his water bottle under the terms of the geneva convention anunscrupulous enemy may remove it in order to prevent escape the best chance ofmaking successful escape is therefore early on during the confusion of battleparticularly at night and when prisoner has the shortest distance to travel to reachthe nearest friendly unit two men stand far better chance of success than manon his own the support of companionship and the opportunity to discuss and weighup courses of action and check navigation more than double the likelihood of success 84 evasion man or party stand far better chance of reaching the security of friendly troops if capture can be avoided by timely decision to evade the party may still havesupplies of water some rations map compass protractor and with luck avehicle with reserve cans of fuel in the simplest case the party may only have to drivea short distance in one direction to reach friendly troops apart from avoiding enemyparties the next most serious problem will be identifying themselves to the first bodyof friendly troops they stumble into particularly at night in the latter case it may bepossible to get well clear of the enemy in the dark and then wait for dawn to approacha friendly position if long journey is in prospect the best course may be to placea safe distance between the evaders and the enemy and then to stop work out plana route or direction to follow and ration the available water and food to eke them outfor the length of time the journey is likely to take in the confusion of battle and quickmoves vehicles and parties are apt to get lost especially at night the party is thenin the same situation as an escaper but will have more opportunity to work out itsposition and plan its journey as the more dehydrated one becomes the more onesthought processes become confused it is better to make the soundest possible planearly and then keep to it in hot weather and when enemy parties are likely to beencountered it is better to move by night using the stars to keep direction and to lieup by day concealed in whatever shade can be found or provided by vehicle inorder to conserve water 85 survival navigation an escaping or evading party will be lucky to have trained navigator together with his theodolite sun compass astronomical tables and asatellite navigation aid

ground and briefing allied to the problems of navigation and map reading is the difficulty of pointing out the ground to visitor at an op commandermaking reconnaissance and the members of an group maps may seldom provide enough detail for briefing and the issue orders an air photograph or satelliteimagery provides useful aid for planning purposes 5 surmounting obstacles another essential aid to mobility is the forethought needed to position suitable engineer equipment near the head of column where it can becalled forward quickly to deal with the inevitable natural obstacles such as steepsided wadis and patches of soft sand infrastructural impediments to movement suchas surface pipelines and to improve routes through defiles which have been cut upby the passage of large numbers of vehicles equally important is the availability ofrapid mineclearing devices to deal with minefields other artificial obstacles whichmay be encountered are antitank ditches and fortifications constructed by bulldozingsand into steep banks both may be protected by mines where movement is likelyto be canalized traffic control system must be on hand to control vehicle flow andorganize diversions 2 vehicle axis signs are usually mounted on long angleiron pickets so that they are readily visible to drivers 6 crosscountry mobility route planning movement with the grain of the country rather than across it is quicker easier less tiring for drivers and troops less damaging to vehiclesand uses less fuel often it will pay to make detour along favourable going toavoid constant climbing in and out of wadis negotiating ledges and escarpments and grinding along in low gear through soft sand such diversion mayeven be an advantage in deceiving the enemy as to ones ultimate objective b crosscountry speeds an appreciation of practicable speeds over various types of going is important in estimating the amount of time and fuel required fora journey in bad going over rocky ledges and in soft sand progress may be asslow as 5 miles in the hour 8 kilometres in the hour even in daylight anaverage of 8 to 15 miles in the hour 128 to 24 kilometres in the hour might beachieved by normal service vehicles crossing mixture of softish sand studdedwith little bushes growing on small hummocks stony ground and wadis 2 considerable amount of planning and preparation went into the passage of viii us corps formations including 1 br armoured division through 1 us infantry division mechanizeds breach zonenormandy in the iraqi frontier border obstacle systemissue 10 dec 98 2 3although vehicles with hydropneumatic or hydrogas suspension systems are capable of crosscountry speeds in excess of 30 mph 48 kph speeds of 60miles per hour 96 kph can be achieved on hard firm flat sand the problemposed by sebkha salt marsh has already been mentioned in part chapter 1for planning purposes one should err on the side of caution and allow formishaps out of contact speeds of 15 kilometres in the hour 85 miles in thehour by day and 5 kilometres in the hour 3 miles in the hour by night were theplanning norm arrived at by trial and error for the kuwait operation in contactthe speeds are reduced drastically to 2 kilometres in the hour 125 miles in thehour and 1 kilometre in the hour 062 miles in the hour by day and nightrespectively when infantry have to move across really bad going particularlyon cloudy pitchblack night it may be quicker to march than drive cplanning data for planning purposes formation and battle group staffs should ascertain the average practicable speeds which can be attained over differenttypes of going in daylight and at night in varying phases of the moon in starlightor with ambient light with and without night driving aids of necessity theserules of thumb speeds can only be arrived at empirically in new theatre of warwith the types of vehicle and night driving aids currently in service if periodof grace is offered for training before committal to operations staffs should makea point of using exercises to obtain and evaluate planning data rather than relyon the trial and error of battle 3 7dispersion and protection afrontage with the need to keep at least 150 metres between vehicles to avoid presenting an attractive target to enemy aircraft long range artillery andmissiles units out of contact with the enemy move on as wide front as possibleonly when air supremacy is assured and the missile threat reduced mayvehicles move closer together 4 bformation reconnaissance the formation reconnaissance regiment should move as far ahead of the formation as possible consistent with the ability toobtain fire support if close air support is available this may be as much as 30to 50 km in advance if not it should not move out of artillery supporting rangeas rough guide about 20 km c battle group reconnaissance battle group should deploy its reconnaissance elements on broad front at least long visual bound ahead of the main bodyso that the latter will be well out of range of hostile tank guns and antitank 3 between the second world war and the evacuation of the canal zone in 1956 british formations inegypt planned on moving 20 miles 32 km in 2 hours 1 hour 40 minutes driving and 20 minute halt by dayand 10 miles 16 km in 2 hours at night over reasonable going out of contact in the 1991 kuwait campaign1st br armoured division used

operation granby desert sword vehicles in 7 armoured brigade could move at 50 metre intervals because the allies had air supremacyissue 10 dec 98 2 4missiles when the screen bumps the enemy this is essential if the main body is to retain its freedom of manoeuvre because threat may develop unexpectedly from any direction in mobile operations the flanks and rear must be watchedas well d battle group formations the battle group will move in formation appropriate to the tactical situation usually with an armoured squadron group in the lead andwith any artillery attached for movement tucked in behind the column preparedto deploy into action off the line of march if the country is open enoughsquadroncompany groups may be deployed on either flank perhaps two up ina square battle group and one up in smaller battle group guides are vital forthe control of vehicle movement in battle groups and subunits see annex dfor some suggestions on desert formations the antitank guided weapons willnormally move on the exposed flank or at each corner of the formation if thereis specific threat similarly the air defence detachments will be positionedwhere they can best provide protection size of battle group formations battle group less the screen deployed in such formation may cover frontage of about 2000 or more metres and adepth of over 3000 metres in less favourable terrain it may only be possibleto move on narrow frontage making battle group column 300 metres wideand over 5000 metres deep in the worst case where movement is confinedto single track or where the battle group has to negotiate defile the battlegroup will have to move in single file f standardization of formations as far as possible the formations used in european terrain should be used or adapted where necessary to the desertunits which may be committed to action soon after arrival in new theatre willat least have the benefit of using familiar drills and sops each vehicle mustbe allotted specific place in whatever formation is adopted not only does thissave time in forming up for move but it ensures that everyone knows wherecommanders and the smallest subunit can be found in hurry g planning from the planning point of view formation staffs must appreciate the effect of defiles on the passage of successive battle groups first so that aformation move can be organized to avoid huge traffic jams and massive targetsat bottlenecks second so that realistic appreciation can be made of the timerequired for move and third to anticipate any engineer effort required toimprove or maintain the route another aspect of planning concerns the needfor staffs to appreciate how much more space units and formations need fordispersal in concentration assembly and holding areas in the desert than ineurope h dust hazard air and mine threats small groups of vehicles should move in ragged echelon in such manner that they avoid each others dust clouds andoffer the least attractive air target if there is mine threat there are advantagesin moving in straight lines vehicles travelling in the tracks of each lines leadvehicle but beware the air threatissue 10 dec 98 2 58movement control aroute deployment organization control of movement is all important it may be expedient to set up permanent route deployment organization to create andmaintain the msr in the fcz particularly during breaching operation and anadvance it will need equipment to clear mines instruments to check for possiblenbc contamination and plant to build road b radio control and backup systems operational moves are usually made on

control may beexercised using flag signals by day and lights by night these signals alsoprovide reserve form of control for larger moves see annex b for details c route and axis marking 1by day battle group and formation axes are marked by long angle iron pickets with the appropriate tactical signs displayed at the top theheight of the signs is important to make them easily visible from driverscab 2 night signs homing lights and distance markers night signs are similar to those used in other theatres but more of them are needed because theystand on the ground and quite small slopes reduce the intervisabilitydistance it is more important to site them on the top of rises in the groundthan at strictly regular intervals formation provost and regimental policemust check that the next sign and preferably one or two more can be seenfrom the one coming abeam of vehicle in order to give the driver andvehicle commander confidence in the signing system to indicate line tosteer on and to allow

measured in kilometresfrom selected datum point to help units establish their position withaccuracy and to assist in the direction of fire support d vehicle lights for vehicles conning lights single red tail lights mounted high enough to be seen above the dust or rearward facing red torches should beused to give drivers steering mark and to prevent collisions if night visiongoggles are being worn use green or blue lights at the upper end of thespectrum traffic control and recovery traffic control is essential at defiles bottlenecks on entering harbour areas and especially when passing one formation throughanother wheels and tracks quickly churn up the desert surface so that trackedand wheeled vehicle routes must be kept separate battle group lads and unitissue 10 dec 98 2 6recovery vehicles should move at the rear of their columns to effect minor repairs or to tow nonrunners during move on really dark night it may only befeasible to recover breakdowns after first light 9 the dust danger driving on thin layer of soft sand on top of firm surface raises such immense dust clouds that vehicles may have to move at dust distance ratherthan the standard 150 metre spacing it may be necessary to restrict the speed ofmovement on such favourable going to reduce the immense telltale cloud of dustmiles long which may prejudice the security of move this precaution may even benecessary at night when half to full moon makes dust visible from far away in staticconditions military police will sign stretches of routes where vehicle speeds must bereduced to avoid creating dust clouds which bring down enemy artillery fire 10 the dust opportunity dust storms can be help as well as hindrance they may hide move round an unsuspecting enemys flank modern navigational systemsmake accurate navigation possible in bad visibility if the sand is blowing hard enoughin the enemys face the dust storm may make the enemy less vigilant and degrade histhermal imaging systems sufficiently to enable our forces to close on his position andachieve surprise for such an operation vehicle tail lights should be switched on butsidelights blacked out 11 identification of key officers one of the disadvantages of dispersion is the difficulty of finding commanders and key individuals one way to overcome theproblem is to fly distinctive pennants from their vehicle radio antennae eg twotriangular blue pennants for the cos command post blue and white pennant for aregimental or battalion headquarters coloured pennants for squadron and companycommanders black and white chequered flag for recovery vehicles and red crosson white background for the rap the pennants should be as small as possibleconsistent with recognition within the battle group large pennants merely tell theenemy which vehicles to shoot at first even small pennant can be readily identifiedwith pair of field glasses alternatively simple system of hessian rats tails maybe devised 5 eg commanding officer 4 secondincommand squadron leader company commander 3squadron company secondincommand 2troop platoon commander 1 standard pennant or alternative system should be designed within formation to avoid recognition problems on regrouping similarly call signs painted on tanksapcsifvs and other vehicles are useful for identification purposes but they shouldbe toned down discreetly to avoid providing the enemy with good aiming marks oncein contact it may be advisable to remove pennants and rats tails and rely on thepainted call signs and the recognition marks mentioned in the next paragraph 5 the rats tail system was introduced by 7 armoured brigade during the desert shield preparatory phase for desert storm in 1990 and 1991 and the details have been taken from the

sunrise within the formation everyone stands to whether in defensive positions headquarters or logistic units standtogives an opportunity to check weapons ammunition equipment the manning of localdefences observation areas and to discover whether enemy patrols have probed theposition during the night reports are collected from subunits sifted and passed tohigher headquarters everyone wants to know what happened during the night andwhat the assessment of the situation is at daybreak because events move fast in thedesert 3 in rear areas when the enemy air missile and artillery threat is so low that it can safely be ignored it may be convenient from the administrative point of view for units andheadquarters to move into close leaguer or harbour 10 yards between vehiclesdepending on the threat it may be possible to remain in close order 24 hours dayor it may be advisable to spread out into open order at dawn in these circumstancesthere should be drill for moving into open formation at first light and camouflagingup sufficient space should be left between units in close leaguer so that they canextend into open order without colliding with each other if replenishment is to becarried out in close leaguer strict traffic pattern must be established so that wheeledvehicles can be routed clear of the soft sand churned up by tank and ifv tracks analternative is to adapt the northwest european hide system in which subunitsdisperse into troop or platoon groups in which the vehicles halt in standard formationwith which everyone is familiar 4 if contact has been lost with the enemy screen during the night contact has to be re established as soon as possible this is essential to guard against surprise to detecta secret withdrawal or any other change in the enemys dispositions which mayprovide indicators as to his intentions 5 the day may be boring but vehicle camouflage must be checked and rearranged as the suns shadow varies in angle and direction every opportunity has to be takenduring quiet days to carry out repairs to vehicles weapons and equipment 6 the dangerous times are when the sun is behind the enemy and in our eyes during the midday shimmer when enemy moves may pass unnoticed and in sandstormswhich are not severe enough to stop all movement extra vigilance is required toissue 10 dec 98 3 2prevent surprise additional ops and armoured reconnaissance patrols may be necessary to cover vulnerable sectors during bad visibility the surveillance andtarget acquisition plan must take into account all weather and terrain

with lateral gapsat intervals to allow for the passage of liaison officers the assembly of groups andreplenishment the reason for sleeping between the front and rear of vehicles is thatan open formation is much greater in depth than in width and the arrangement makesfor quick passage longitudinally if however camouflage nets are left up at nighttroops may sleep anywhere underneath them but sentries must be prepared to warnoff approaching vehicles as far as possible battle group squadron or companygroup and troop or platoon command vehicles are located in the same column or fileof

discreet marking of headquarters and key facilities lights will be shown at night nor will there be any movement except for the essential operational oradministrative reasons mentioned in the last paragraph lads and workshops mustbe allowed to use lights and make noise at night they should be allocated an areaat discreet distance from the units they serve if person has to move away fromhis position or vehicle on pitch black night for any reason he must tie length of stringto his base and pay it out as he goes failure to do so is likely to lead to sleeplessnight trying to find ones

position but on dark night cookingand feeding without showing lights is very difficult although dispersion will oftendictate cooking on vehicle basis it should be centralized whenever possible to makethe most of the rations 13 when the opposing sides are well matched battle may go on for long time at high tempo troops and especially commanders must get as much sleep as possible sothat they go into battle which may last for weeks rather than days as fresh as possiblenow that satellite navigation and night vision aids enable armies to conduct intensiveoperations around the clock fatigue is going to wear down the endurance of troops inall environments but especially in mobile battle in the open desert where there is littlecover and few obstacles behind which an exhausted formation can find someprotection and respite it will be necessary to plan operations so that formations arerested periodically the system of committing manoeuvre groups sequentiallysupported by all the fire support available and then grounding them for replenishmentand reconstitution used by 1st armoured division in the kuwait campaign of 1991lends itself to providing at least some sleep for tired troops

date while this may sound trivial indifference is the first sign of slide into mental apathy and possibly fatal lack of alertness section 2 camouflage and concealment the importance of camouflage training 16 relevance camouflage is an essential part of all operations in the desert and the importance of the subject must be impressed on fresh units and individual reinforcements as soon as they arrive in desert theatre failure to convince new arrivals ofits importance will lead to unnecessary casualties and shortage of the essentials oflife when crews vehicle is destroyed even though they may survive badcamouflage may also compromise highlevel plan and lead to an operational failurewith all its attendant casualties one poorly concealed vehicle is enough to alertenemy intelligence to institute thorough search revealing battle group or an entireformation successful concealment camouflage and deception is as much matterof knowing how to use existing concealment kits as well as being able to improvisewith whatever comes to hand 17 supervision vehicle commanders and drivers must ensure that their vehicles are camouflaged whenever halt is to last more than ten minutes officers and ncoshave special responsibility for checking the effectiveness of their subunitscamouflage if stationary for several hours they must make periodic checks to makesure that the changing pattern of shadows caused by the movement of the sun ismatched by adjustments to the way nets concealment sets and hessian are draped vehicle and aircraft camouflage 18 desertization of vehicles the subject is covered in annex b the important aspects to note here are that windscreens and windows should be removed or wounddown to prevent reflection of the sun and that in the forward area vehicle silhouettesshould be reduced by removing unnecessary cabs and canopies however itemsremoved must be kept handy so that they can be refitted in cold wet winter weatherand during the sandstorm season to protect crews kit and equipment 19 paint tracked and wheeled vehicles towed equipment and helicopters should be suitably painted matt stone colour is suitable for many deserts other colours maybe required to tone in with other desert environments in bush covered desert eventhe standard dark green and disruptive paints used in central europe give somecamouflage if it is not possible to repaint the vehicles of unit despatched in anemergency one of the duties of the initial reconnaissance party sent to new theatreissue 10 dec 98 3 5is to select the colour and camouflage patterns most suitable to the area and signal the information home so that an early start can be made on painting vehicles1 20concealment sets these sets which include their own framework support system are ideal because the thermal camouflage material offers good concealment from thehuman eye near to the infrared end of the spectrum reduces the thermal signatureand defeats radar until special desert sets are made the moorland net designed forthe southern flank of nato will be better than nothing on very hot day concealmentsets may betray the equipment they are designed to hide by giving cooler return toan enemy sensor than the surrounding sand gravel or rock 21 improvised camouflage this paragraph deals with the occasions when it is appropriate hessian which bleaches to sand colour in the sun stretched on netsand poles just sufficiently high above vehicle to allow air to circulate between the twowill provide effective visual camouflage shade and welcome drop in temperatureadditional hessian or canopy laid on the vehicle metal surfaces will help to reducethe thermal signature because metal heats faster than sand gravel or rock in the suncamouflage should be built in shallow dome over vehicle with angles of morethan 15 or 20 from the horizontal to avoid telltale shadows if only camouflage netsand scrim are available hessian must be hung to hide the shadows caused by tracksuspensions and the space between the chassis and the ground nets and hessianmust be arranged so that they do not form pyramids over upright poles and straightedges along horizontal rails inflammable material must be kept clear of radioantennae and exhausts the latter should be screened if possible to reduce the heatemission which can be picked up by sensors in certain circumstances it may beuseful to improvise

operations take the force into adesert with markedly different coloured surface spray guns are useful for applyingthe appropriate paint 22 helicopters some helicopter blades may be damaged by hanging hessian over them others can stand the weight and in the case of fourbladed propellor theblades should be moved to make an angle of 45 over the fuselage in the pattern ofan x with the help of some additional poles and pickets camouflage nets andhessian can be draped in dome over the helicopter to disguise its shape all perspexsurfaces must be covered with material to prevent reflection from the

organization of training the collective aspect 1adapting existing doctrine force sent to desert theatre will fight with the equipment it has and in accordance with current doctrine while equipment anddoctrine can be modified to suit the new environment much will depend on how wellofficers and men battle groups and formations have mastered their individualtraining learned how to live on vehicle basis in the field developed battle proceduresbased on sound sops and perfected all arms tactics armoured units and formationswhich have trained in germany and at batus in canada will have the basic technicaland tactical skills which can be adapted for desert warfare the approach to battle begins on the training area in the years of peace before war in an arid countryprovided that the troops their commanders and staffs are well trained they can adaptquickly to the peculiar conditions of the new environment if their basic and collectivetraining have been neglected amount of desert lore will remedy the defects 2 training of formations warned for service overseas in the worst case the sudden despatch of formation from the uk or europe to desert theatre with theminimum of notice to meet sudden emergency it will only be possible to improvisea training programme as opportunity offers there may be chance to train duringthe concentration period and on the move up to the forward area should action notbe imminent it will be possible to draw up plan for training in the home location beforethe move and after arrival in the theatre activities and responsibilities may beorganized on the following lines home location 1 hq land will take over responsibility for the formations training in its peacetime location to relieve the formation headquarters which will befully occupied moving overseas planning future operations and organizingintheatre training 2 training in the home location will usually concentrate on completion of unit training including weapon firingb specialist training employing teams of specialists to teach the use of new equipment c familiarization with the new theatre including topography mapping etc using feedback from the new theatre d the absorption

that tactics for attacking them may be practised 5 formation training should include the integration of brigade support groups bsgs 6 track mileage restrictions may restrict tactical training sufficient spares and repair effort should be organized in the planning stage to provide forwear and tear on training as well as in the coming battleissue 10 dec 98 4 3d collective training 1 it will be necessary to establish liaison and good working relationship with the allied headquarters to which the british formation is to be subordinatedand those allied formations with which it will cooperate either on its flanksor on passage of lines operations the opportunity should be taken to workout joint procedures 2 cpxs and ftxs are not merely essential for the training and tactical integration of battle groups and formations together with their fire andlogistic support they also provide the opportunity to rehearse and refinethe procedures for future operations 3 the move of the formation up to its assembly area may provide the only opportunity to manoeuvre complete division by day and night and topractise major tactical and logistic regrouping 3 acclimatization the physical and medical aspects of acclimatization and living in the desert have already been covered as far as peacetime training in hot desertis concerned the initial prerequisite is high standard of physical fitness the soldierwill still need fortnight to month depending on the season to acclimatize but theprocess will be quicker and the individual will suffer less discomfort if he is fit in the firstplace this does not just apply to infantrymen it applies to everyone because fit mancan stand the heat of an armoured vehicle better than an unfit man and if tank anifv or an apc is knocked out the crew may have to walk long distance the timeavailable for training in overseas countries is limited for financial and political reasonsand because units must give priority to their normal tasks and commitments clearlythere is an advantage in planning overseas exercises for the cool season so that themaximum time can be spent on tactics at squadroncompany group battle group andformation level the shorter acclimatization period can be put to good use on theindividual specialist and small group training aspects discussed below in anoperational setting there may be one of two scenarios if the host nation has asked for assistance in good time the potential enemy may be deterred temporarily or permanently from aggression and the troops willhave time to acclimatize although they may have to prepare positions repairequipment and handle stores 1 at least the work load can be increased gradually and much of the heavy labour done in the cool of the evening and early morningor at night 1 the british concentration in the gulf in 1958 and the arrival of british forces in kuwait at the rulersrequest in 1961 deterred an iraqi attack on both occasions although troops stationed in the arabian peninsulawere acclimatized and those from kenya and the mediterranean partially so those from the uk were totallyunprepared for the blistering heat and humidity of gulf summer fortunately the rapid americanconcentration in saudi arabia following iraqs invasion of kuwait was not followed by immediate hostilities inthe hot season if saddam hussein had further designs on saudi arabia the american intervention may havedeterred them the weather was beginning to cool down when 7th armoured brigade arrived in the gulfissue 10 dec 98 4 4bif deterrence fails and the intervention forces are plunged straight into action the commander can only try to keep the tempo of operations initially at level whichhis troops can stand in the heat of the day and make his main effort at night thiswill not be easy as the enemy will have the initiative much may depend on goodnight observation devices and sights for fighting at the time of our choosing andon armed helicopters and air support bearing the brunt by day although this willsorely test air and especially ground crews 4 desert tactics initially the enemy familiar with the theatre may have the tactical edge on our forces while our troops are learning how to live in and adapt their tacticsto the new environment their force commander would be unwise to attempt tooambitious plan it takes little time to gauge what is and what is not possible in anew environment in terms of the time it takes to cover distance over various typesof going the effects of light and haze on judging distance and ranges the optimumconditions for bringing on an engagement the enemy ruses and tricks to watch for andhow to carry out such mundane tasks as replenishment on battlefield with little covercommanders at all levels will have to learn fast and make up for their inexperiencewith mixture of common sense resourceful improvisation and the mental flexibilityto adapt their existing equipment and tactical doctrine to the new scene the highestbritish formation headquarters in the new theatre can help to redress the balance inexpertise by issuing training notes illustrated with simple diagrams to explain thecommanders concept of operations this will ensure uniformity of doctrine so thatsubordinate commanders will train their formations and units to fight in accordancewith the same concept common doctrine helps to save time in giving out orders andenables commanders to think and act within logical framework of conceptualoperational and tactical ideas when the unexpected occurs and they have to work ontheir own initiative 5 reinforcement and training organization training organization based on an armoured delivery organization should be established to acclimatize and trainindividual reinforcements arriving in the theatre before they are sent forward to jointheir units with the passage of time it will be possible to withdraw suitablyexperienced officer and nco instructors from units in the line to provide the staff thereinforcements coming in from the uk will benefit from the experience of desertveterans and the veterans will obtain wellearned rest care should be taken in theselection of instructors they should not be those whom commanding officers wishto be rid of or who cannot resist an opportunity to inflate their egos in front of captiveaudience of tyros but men who will command the respect of the newcomers pass theirexperiences on to them in helpful way and be credit to the units from which theycame it may be possible and wise to structure the training organization to reflectthe composition of the force so that the reinforcements will as far as possible go tothe units or formations from which the instructors came the size of the organizationwill reflect the strength of the british

training occasionally it will be possible to pull complete formation out of the line for rest having enjoyed some well earned local leave the formationshould reassemble for training taking the opportunity to rectify deficiencies in thosetechnical and tactical aspects which battle experience has revealed if the enemy hasintroduced new and better weapons and equipment to swing the balance in his favourthis would also be the time to work out ways of compensating for the disadvantage withchanges in tactics and guile formations which are withdrawn and sent to another partof the theatre to meet possible threat should not be allowed merely to preparepositions and sit in them they must continue training for mobile operations 7 introduction and absorption of new equipment break from the line also provides the opportunity to absorb and train on new equipment as policy it is betterto reequip and retrain complete formations with new weapon rather than hand it outin small packets throughout the force not only is formation more effective if its unitsreequip and retrain all together but the problems of repair spare part and assemblyreplacements ammunition supply and the training of subsequent reinforcements issimplified this provides further argument for organizing the reinforcement trainingunit in way which complements the order of battle the individual aspect 8 there are

that not only is there apparently less recognizable detail in the desert landscape but often farless detail on the map the qualification apparently is used advisedly because withfamiliarity the soldier will develop the bedous eye for the seemingly trivial featureunremarkable to the soldier born and brought up in the city or countryside but whichprovides landmark for the desert traveller with little practice the soldier beginsto appreciate the distinctive shapes of individual sand dunes outcrops boulders wadibanks bushes and acacia trees officers and soldiers should be taught to make

1990issue 10 dec 98 3section 2 desert movement the approach to sidi rezegh november 19411 we did short night move some 14 miles and then two long day moves of 50 to 70 miles these were easy there was little dust and we rolled along trucks 150 yards apart stretchingfar out of sight monotonous neverchanging procession like convoy at sea then westarted on the night moves the trucks closed in until we were in 9 columns not more than20 yards apart and trucks almost head to tail this was done just before last light eachevening and meantime the provost sections went ahead planting posts with lanterns at ½mile intervals along the intended bearing all the brigades had different desert formationsin 4 brigade at this time 20 battalion led in 9 columns with companies abreast 18 battalionand 19 battalion followed each in 3 columns behind the flanks and brigade headquartersand the attached troops field antitank and antiaircraft gunners sappers field ambulance and supply vehicles followed the centre 3 columns fully closed up there was massof over 800 vehicles on front of some 200 yards and depth of 1500 or so whendispersed in the daytime the front was about 1 mile and the depth anything up to 10 brigade groups followed one another so that when each closed up for the night move there were gaps between them of about nine miles and they had to halt with similar gaps to leaveroom for dispersion at daylight always made forward and outward we had practisedmovement in desert formation by night and by day very often every truck had its allottedplace and everyone knew it the division in the desert always moved on the one axismarked by black diamond discs or by lights each formation and each unit had its regularand oftenrehearsed drill for passing defiles changing direction dispersing and closing indeploying to attack or taking up defensive position one great advantage to commanders staff officers and dispatch riders was that once truck was identified it was easy to findthe headquarters of the formation unit or subunit to which it belonged as relative positionswere known and familiar and unchanged this carefully studied and very often practised system enabled the division to carry out many great moves from egypt to tunisia with comparative ease and speed in time wecame to think not without reason that we knew all that needed to be known about themovement and the manoeuvring of masses of transport in the desert with every care and attention to system and detail these night moves were weary and slow in the move into libya it was my responsibility as the commanding officer of the leadingbattalion to lead the brigade on to the line of lights and hold it on the line which sounds easyenough the vehicles of the brigade ahead disappeared as they moved forward toconcentrate my first task was to find the three lights marking the brigade startingpoint andthese were invariably where i did not expect them if as happened once or twice i failedto find them before startingtime the only course was to lead off on the correct bearingpeering anxiously ahead into the darkness until light was picked up at the time the provostpeople had maddening habit of planting lights in hollows where these occurred at the 1 major general sir howard kippenberger infantry brigadier geoffrey cumberlege oup 2nd im pression 1949 pages 8285issue 10 dec 98 4correct halfmile intervals and they would be passed altogether if there was the slightest discrepancy in course or not seen until almost trampled under sometimes there weregaps in the line of lights perhaps through one being knocked over and broken and thenwe crawled on in acute anxiety until the next was picked up in later times the provostdetachments had learned more about our limitations and difficulties planted their lightsmore frequently and prominently and even let us know what spot in the desert theycalculated to be the startpoint but the move into libya remains in memory as nightmareof anxiety apart from these difficulties the night moves were not easy we used lights and most desert is bumpy and uneven leading vehicles travelled at two and half miles in the hourbut there was unavoidable concertinaing and the tail of long column usually had to movein fits and starts at anything up to twenty miles an hour twenty miles was long night marchunder normal conditions the drivers could see nothing of the ground in front those backin the column could only follow their leaders one was constantly slithering down over steepbanks bumping against hummocks falling heavily into abandoned slit trenches or gettingstuck in soft sand but every difficulty would be surmounted the lights were always foundin the end and few minutes after daylight we halted and dispersed and every truck brewedup for breakfast during the day the stragglers and cripples were brought in by theindefatigable lad and next night the performance would start again the men could sleepduring the day but there were conferences and affairs of various kinds for commandersand i was very short of sleep before the battle opened we crossed the frontier into libya through gap made in the wire on the night of the 18th few miles on i lost the line of lights and worked farther and farther offcourse in lookingfor them it was undesirable to stop the column to take bearing unless unavoidable buti got shock when inglis came up from the rear stopped and said kip youre ninetydegrees off your course i denied it but took bearing and found he was right in fact wewere more than ninety degrees off i accordingly led on round to complete circle and mycar travelling at three miles an hour moved across the rear of the column bounding alongat twenty on to the right track again very few knew that we had carried out this oddmovementissue 10 dec 98 5section 3 reexamining the jock columns dispersion revisited by bruce davey according the shelford bidwell the british army commenced the war in the western desert without any doctrine but with collection of military fads and fashions this essay will examine three strains of dispersion adopted by british command in the middle east duringwwii they were known as the jock column the brigade group and the brigade battlegroup the first of these was named after j c jock campbell vc dso mc it wascampbell who devised the tactics of small mobile columns which usually consisted of afew armoured cars lorrymounted infantry and troops of 25 pounder field guns and antiaircraft guns the purpose of these columns was to raid the enemys rear areas andcollect information paternity of these tactical formations can be traced to the support group of the 7th armoured division the support group was supposed to have providedthe hinge upon which the two armoured brigades of the division operated as commanderof the support groups batteries of royal horse artillery campbell was universally acknowledged as fighting commander reputation which he shared with the 1940 commander of the support group w stafer gott the celebrity of these two tenacious fighters had the unfortunate sideeffect of enhancing their views on tactical organisations tosuch an extent that useful minor tactic became elevated into major one several factors combined in the adoption of the tactics of dispersion the british army had undergone dual development prior to wwii at home the army gradually rebuiltand reorganised during the thirties it was process hampered by entrenched rivalriesbetween the arms of the service and by proponents of change and modernisation andhidebound elements remaining from the great war the outbreak of wwii hostilities sawthe british army in doctrinal disarray the field army in the middle east was unable toinstigate any needed doctrinal and organisational changes before the political decisionwas taken to attack the italian colonial possessions in africa the results of operation compass western desert forces successful expulsion of the italian army from cyrenaica perhaps made too lasting an impression on british commanders the figures were beguiling marshal grazianis numerically superior force hadbeen overrun in 58 days one hundred and thirty thousand italian troops and 845 gunswere captured three hundred and eighty light and medium tanks were destroyed thesefigures held compelling logic and left persuasive legacy the lessons learnt fromwestern desert forces campaign were later published as volume of narrative accountsand procedural cribs which fell short of taking the place of validated doctrine and whilstidentifying italian shortcomings tended to underestimate the benefits of the 7th armoureddivisions excellent desert training in retrospect british victory in this example of the offence at the operational level was not entirely dependent on the tactics employed by the victors lucio cevas assessment citesgrazianis failure to maximise his potential for mobilising infantry by means of the available motor transport as significant factor the italians were quickly made aware of thesuperiority of the british matilda tanks which demonstrated marked technical edge overtheir own m11s and m13s even though the latter mounted an effective 47mm gun itwas very slow although never much predisposed to attack the british the tank edgeissue 10 dec 98 6affirmed the defensive mindset of the italians this in turn encouraged the british to range widely over the desert in order to avoid wearing down their tanks the britishresorted to the use of small columns of armoured cars and lorried infantry supported byfield and antitank guns this was how the jock columns were born and vindicated as atactical formation the circumstances explained above had not motivated british commanders from the out set general wavell commanderinchief in the middle east had initially wanted generaloconnor the operational commander to use massed tanks however against the italians this was deemed inappropriate because the opening moves were against the staticdefensive positions of nibeiwa tummar east and tummar west for the reduction ofthese locations the concentrated artillery fire of the 7th medium regiment had beenharnessed in order to reduce the fortified cities of bardia and tobruk more orthodoxmixture of artillery infantry and tank forces had been required but it was the dashingexploitation phase of operation compass which captured the imagination of british commanders and this was only achieved by stripping units down to their mobile elements andby the use of captured transport often with the consent of their original drivers finally atbed fomm it was the mobile columns and light tanks of the british which took full toll ofthe italian forces retreating along the single coast road in the final battle of operationcompass the italians aided the british by attacking in pennypackets rather than inconcentrated waves on the battlefield the tactics of dispersion had proved successful but at that moment in the war the greatest practitioner of dispersion acted at the highest strategic level redeployment of forces to greece would allow the italians to hold on to their north africanposition until 1943 with the coming of erwin rommel to africa the british commonwealth forces would be faced with very different style of warfighting it was new andshocking experience almost all the gains made in operation compass were lost inless than three weeks british commonwealth forces with the exception of those holdingtobruk were swept out of cyrenaica despite holding ten to one numerical superioritythe incredible success of rommels first advances were due to the better use of firepowerthe germans used airpower artillery and the combined effects of directfire systemsto gain strength at decisive points the second variation of dispersion employed by the british in the clash of operational and tactical warfighting conceptions was that of the brigade group this way of fightingwhich was essentially the jock column writ large dominated the thinking of british commanders until the watershed appointments of general alexander and general montgomeryin the middle east during 1942 it featured heavily in all major operations from battleaxeto alam halfa the brigade group as an operational style was both forced upon the british by circum stances outside their control but was also natural choice by number of commandersthis method was embraced not as the result of any doctrinal process but as an emergency measure there was of course time and mechanism to conduct trials ofthese methods besides operation compass has provided recent operational vindication of dispersion scale was another area which found the british commanders wanting according to kenneth macksey the technique and practice of handling large mechanised forces in battle was only sketchily graspedissue 10 dec 98 7the objective of operation battleaxe was to bring the german to battle and to defeat it new tanks had been rushed out to egypt in the hope of achieving this victory by primeminister eager to attack at all costs the british armoured regiments now deployed avariety of tanks which determined the role of the units involved for battleaxe the 7tharmoured division contained two brigades each of two regiments the two regiments ofone of these brigades possessed matilda tanks whilst the other consisted of the faster butlighter and less potent a9 a10 and a13 cruiser tanks and the crusader tanks the widelydiffering speeds of these vehicles suggested different roles and in the battleaxe plan itcould be seen that each of the tank regiments was to advance along different axes towards different objectives the armour may have been designated as belonging to adivisional organisation but in practice they fought dispersed into individual regimentssquadrons and even individual troops british tank tactics at this time included preference for firing on the move which gave little chance of accuracy tactics were characterised by incorrect assumptions about weaponcharacteristics the british command believed that the german 88mm flak gun couldnot penetrate the armour of the matilda tank beyond 440 yards when they were in realityvulnerable out to range of 2000 yards it was in battleaxe and the later operationcrusader that the discovery was made that british tank gun shells disintegrated againstgerman frontal armour the opposite was not the case the most vital and dangerousmission in operation battleaxe was that of the 7th armoured brigade tasked withcontacting and destroying the german panzers the cruiser tanks did not find their german counterparts of hafid ridge as expected what they found was wellconcealed gunline of antitank weapons which brewed up the first few tanks causing the rest to veeraway as this force fought independently it could not rely on artillery or infantry to dislodgethe antitank guns on the ridge the force that was designed to provide this additionalcombat power to the 7th armoured division was unable to assist being involved in themost southerly of battleaxes independent thrusts the support group of the armoureddivision seems to have engaged nothing more than open desert during the operationgetting into trouble in the sidi omar area their 25 pounder batteries would have addedmuchneeded punch to the 7th armoured divisions advance with little to show for itsemployment in operation battleaxe the support groups moves are reminiscent ofthe tactic known as swanning described in the war diary of the second welsh guardsas wandering the battlefield in an unspecified and probably unknown direction for anunnecessary and probably illegal purpose john ellis has summarised british tank tacticsas being dominated by persistent dissipation the method of dispersion and the activityof swanning went handinglove it is not possible to examine in great detail each of the british offensives but the concept of dispersion can be identified in each of them up to operations lightfoot and supercharge in 1942 operation battleaxe set up lamentable precedent for thepractice of pennypacketing battleaxe despite achieving some gains on the first dayfor the british was found wanting on day two when the germans concentrated their tanksand counterattacked they were greatly assisted in this by nonexistent wireless securitybetween british corps and army headquarters the defeat of operation battleaxespelt the end for general wavell in the western desert and emphasised command deficiencies dispersion of effort was the real culprit operation crusader was rambling series of attacks and counterattacks conducted over the period of november 1941 to early january 1942 it was an offensive involvingissue 10 dec 98 8more units than eighth army headquarters had ever before controlled and was perhaps the most notorious example of dispersion and the brigade group nominally the forcecomprised seven divisions actually none of the involved units fought as divisions and forthe purposes of battle were dispersed into brigades and brigade groups generalcunningham eighth army commander was an artilleryman and inexperienced in theuse of armoured forces the operational plan that he inherited envisaged the three britisharmoured brigades of xxx corps engaging and defeating the three axis tank divisionsand in concert with the infantry of the xiii corps advancing to meet breakout forcefrom the tobruk garrison cunningham had first to deal with dispute between the twocorps for operational control of brigadier gatehouses 4th armoured brigade group whichincluded additional infantry and artillery cunningham compromised by giving the brigadeto xxx corps but stipulating that it should stay close enough to xiii corps to providearmoured support should this be needed to reduce the static german frontier defenceso it came about that this brigade group which was considered vital to the attainment ofboth corps objectives was given mission which precluded it from contributing to either in his book the military errors of wwii kenneth macksey labels the crusader plan as faulty since it sought to match tank against tank the three armoured brigades of thisdispersed corps proved to be match for the two german and one italian tank divisionsbut it was not only the tanks that split into brigades but the artillery regiments as well split up between the infantry battalions and companies when the assault opened thebritish armour charged in the best cavalry tradition john ellis describes these headlonggallops as bearing strong resemblance to the lumbering ironsides of oliver cromwellironically the british were about to learn the lesson of missile forces triumphing overshock forces that they themselves had taught the french at crecy and agincourt only thistime the boot was on the other foot the initial assault by xxx corps 22nd armoured brigade was stopped at bir gubi by the italian armour whilst elsewhere successes had been achieved at sidi rezegh the 7tharmoured brigade seized the airfield in an area dominating the eastern approaches totobruk but as happened in battleaxe rommels panzers quickly concentrated andadministered battering to the widely dispersed elements of xxx corps and foiling thetobruk linkup they pressed westwards with control slipping from his grasp cunninghampanicked and was quickly replaced by neil ritchie in fact it was general auchinleckhimself who commanded the army which continued to grind on against the germans the germans had become overstretched and would surely have succumbed to concen trated counterattack had it been within the capability of the eighth army to mount oneallowed off the hook rommel withdrew from cyrenaica with the british in pursuit theaxis had sustained heavy losses but crusader had not been decisive victory and onjanuary 21 rommel broke out of his agheila position yet again with the marginal success of crusader auchinleck dispensed with the division as fighting organisation the last variation of dispersion was the brainchild of general dormansmith who refined the brigade group concept even further the brigade battle groupswere an offshoot of the brigade group each of the three battalions of infantry was allocated two field batteries of artillery plus an antitank battery and expected to functionindependently in order to accomplish this the artillery regiments were dismantled aentities often employed in mined defensive boxes the general idea was that tacticsissue 10 dec 98 9were now to consist entirely of columns built around 25 pounders with lorry borne infantry in an escort role rommels assault on the gazala bir hacheim line almost resulted in his own destruction the germans encountered the new american grant tanks although fighting dispersed inpennypackets this tank packed surprising punch with its 75mm main gun starved ofpetrol and ammunition and with all forces virtually prostrate british command seemedunable to complete the necessary regrouping of forces and changeover to the offencewhich ought to have nailed the desert fox in his couldron lair once and for all like thewitches in macbeth the corps and army commanders brooded over their incredible catch eventually ritchie sat down to write sixpage explanation to auchinleck asking forhis approval macksey relates that it was all rather like staff college exercise inwhich the students submitted their written papers to the directing staff and waited forcomments in red ink by the second week in june rommel was able to escape from the cauldron and with the eighth army in flight tobruk fell by the third week and rommel was promoted field marshal gazala had emphasised the bankruptcy of dispersion and it seemed that matterhow many blunders rommel made british commanders the doctrine technique andcommunications system required to defeat him dissaffection with auchinlecks methodsbubbled to the surface brought about largely due to lack of an enforced commondoctrine with clearly laid down rules of interarm cooperation at this time with theeighth army and its commanders disintegrating only

eventually going to bernard montgomery this was the swansong of the jock columns brigade groups and the like but not of the interarms distrust that the experiment with dispersion had left as its legacy generalmontgomery demanded the concentration of artillery and tanks reversing the trend forpennypacketing in recent times the brigade groupjock column syndrome has beencalled by brian holden reid an attempt to develop combat organisations capable of conducting manoeuvre warfare this attempt was written off as unsound by montgomerysadmirers the historical accounts examined in this essay tend to show that it was notmerely montgomerys sympathetic biographers who were responsible for discrediting themethods of dispersion an analysis of german operations indicates some of the strong advantages they had in combat against the eighth army and its methods of dispersion the germans deployedtheir armour in divisional formations because combat had proven it to be the ideal unitsize to maximise the effectiveness of the tank consequently the operational mobility ofthe total force was increased whether it be panzergruppe or panzerargadesize organisation in battle bryan perrett writes that british regimental pride and closeness hampered the smooth addition of other arms which when combined with an obsession withdispersion resulted in failure against the balanced allarms approach of the germansaccording to one of the most successful german commanders of wwii herman balck itwas the organisational balance of tanks armoured infantry and antitank guns that wasthe key to the combat power of the panzer divisionissue 10 dec 98 10the germans had not arrived in africa with any magical doctrine which might automati cally translate into victory they were in the same boat as the british in the sense that thewar had interrupted the relaxed formulation of doctrine of modern armoured warfarebut what the germans did have was battle tested set of processes and unit drills known as auftragstaktik their methods required high degree of command skills and accepted that battle was chaotic and that the exercise of command was an art not science requiring command and control philosophy which held failure to act as an illegality thiswas much more complex than simple organisational preference for dispersion or concentration as general toppe related the germans themselves dispersed their armour inthe desert when need be usually as defensive response to british air superiority itcame down to the initiative of junior leaders and this has been cited as great differencebetween the germans and the british the british showed predilection for methodicalsetpiece offensives and when these met with unexpected reversals they lapsed intodefence whereas german leadership expected to have to adapt to the changing circumstances of battle the need for initiative throughout the chain of command was in wayencouraged in the document operations of armoured forces yet by the time this hadbeen superseded in 1942 initiative amongst junior leaders and the concept of concentration of force were both back in favour even so restrictive template for commandersresponsibilities in battle was still in existence based on the above examination of the british methods the inescapable conclusion is that british commanders really had idea about the operational level of war at this timead hoc formations and methods such as the jock columns and brigade groups weredesperate untrialled measures but can the commanders be held solely responsible itwas not their fault that the development of armoured warfare doctrine in britain had notproceeded along the favourable lines of the german model equipment deficiencies andthe consequent limitations experienced in building the right mix of all arms combat formations combined with poor operational plans to rob the eighth army of any early decisivevictory over the germans commanders must however shoulder portion of the blamesince series of them remained deaf to the advocates of concentration perhaps this wasbecause many of these advocates of concentration were dominion commanders the record shows that the jock columns brigade groups and battle groups were failed experiments in the desert war against the germans pennypacketing against the italianswas one thing but against the germans more thoroughly trialled and practised methodwas required dispersion brought out the need for doctrine of modern armoured warfare doctrine moreover which would identify the need to concentrate force at criticalpoints and not to disperse strength in faddish but courageous attempts to emulate thegerman methods of making war acknowledgement this section is taken from the combined arms journal of the

under neame 2nd armoured and 9th australian divisions both newly arrived in themiddle east and only partially trained logistic difficulties obliged the latter to split itsbrigades between the western edge of the gebel akhdar and tobruk leaving only 2ndarmoured division in the agheilamersa brega area wavell considered that the italian forces in tripolitania could be disregarded and that the italian navy would take months to move german armour to tripoli in sufficient strength tolaunch an offensive he reckoned without the arrival in the theatre of the dynamic rommelon 12 february followed by 5th panzer regiment the forerunner of 5th light division on11 march as the panzer regiment was only the equivalent of an armoured brigade therisk of attack was considered negligible so on 24 march it came as complete surprise when british armoured car patrol at agheila was driven in week later rommel attacked the screen itself at mersa bregawhen his frontal attack was blocked rommel improvised quick flank attack backed by adeceptive show of force using dummy tanks which had been constructed on volkswagenchassis by his workshops in tripoli and other vehicles to raise huge clouds of dust neamewas persuaded that he faced vastly superior enemy and wavell gave him discretionaryauthority to evacuate benghazi if necessary this neame did when agedabia fell on 2 aprilrommel exploited his success by advancing along four separate axes into cyrenaicaadding to the impression of superior force as well as offering multiplicity of threats oconnor was sent back by wavell to take over from neame both

command system collapsed and by 11 april the germans had overrun the whole ofcyrenaica with the exception of tobruk which resisted all attacks rommels success wasdue to the surprise he achieved by attacking earlier than expected deception to make hisforce appear more formidable than it really was and relentless pursuit along several axesto disrupt the british defence and command structuresissue 10 dec 98 13section 5 operation bertram the deception plan for alamein the aims of bertramoperation bertram worked on the principle that strategic surprise was impossible to achieve because rommel was expecting an attack after his defeat at alam halfa the aimwas to deceive the enemy as to the date and the sector in which the main effort was to belaunched the outline deception plan to delude panzerarmee intelligence into thinking thatthe chief thrust would be launched in xiii corpss sector in the south on 7 november wasmontgomerys idea as part of his overall operational concept which was to attack with xxxcorps in the north on the night of 2324 october he also wished to pin down the two axisarmoured divisions in the south 21st panzer and ariete until 27 october to prevent themfrom reinforcing the two armoured divisions already deployed in the north 15th panzer andlittorio because their combined strength would effectively block eighth armys breakout the brains behind the detailed planning was lieutenant colonel c l richardson the gso 1 plans the implementers were force special deception unit in ghq melf in cairothe two corps in the line and x corps the formation designated to exploit the breakthroughthe props were provided by 85 camouflage company base workshops pioneers and locallabour who combined to construct quantities of dummy vehicles guns and equipment ahuge amount of rasc transport was required to deliver the goods to the sites disinformationa force fed false information into the german and italian espionage networks known to be operating in cairo and throughout the middle east rumours were leaked from thebritish embassy in cairo and from r g casey the australian who was churchills ministerof state in egypt that montgomerys attack was scheduled for moonless night on 67november further disinformation was put about that the new shermans arriving in themiddle east were suffering from technical desertization troubles and would not be fit forservice until november bogus conference was arranged for 26 october in teheran tobe attended by alexander cinc melf wilson from the persia and iraq command wavellcinc india and air marshal tedder from the uk the officers and their adcs were just alittle indiscreet in booking air passages and accommodation some well publicised cocktailparties and nile boat trips were organized for late october

divisions and 24th armoured brigade were badly in need of training on aformation all arms basis to correct the deficiencies exposed in earlier battles theseexercises took place in the southern half of the area between the mediterranean and theqattara depression with the accent on movement in southwesterly direction although8th armoured division had been disbanded to make the other armoured divisions up tostrength its headquarters was retained in the south to broadcast bogus signals traffic 7tharmoured division was also stationed in the south to launch holding attackissue 10 dec 98 14a

from the leaky oldfour gallon petrol cans were laid alongside it at night the trench would be filled in and thedummy pipelines carried forward to the next stretch few miles to the east of samaket gaballa nine mile square patch of desert codenamed brian was made to look like dump containing 9000 tons of combat and engineer supplies by building 700 dummy stacks one of the armoured exercises in the southern area causedthe builders some concern but left realistic pattern of wheel and track marks work on brian started on 7 october and finished fortnight later the northern hoaxduring the night of 1819 october and the following day x corps concentrated its armoured formations quite openly in three staging areas murrayfield north and south and melting pot they looked like any concentration area for an exercise but were carefully located where the track patterns ran in southwesterly direction towards the southern sector the real assembly area for x corps martello was to be further forward in the northern sector within an easy 15 to 20 miles of the intended point of attack there could be hopeof hiding such concentration in an area 12 miles by 8 and so it was decided to establisha pattern over three weeks in advance of dday which axis reconnaissance aircraft andintelligence would get used to and accept as something not out of the ordinary transportfrom base and lofc units was brought in to the area and dummies added to bring the totalnumber of vehicles or substitutes to equal the total in x corps two years earlier wavell had suggested the manufacture of quickly detachable wheeled vehicle dummies which could be used to disguise tanks 722 sunshields as they were nicknamed were delivered to martello where they were placed in the precise positions to be occupied by x corpss tanks each hide was given serial number which correspondedwith the serial number given to an individual tank crew the crews were sent up to martello in trucks which appeared to be part of the normal maintenance traffic and shown where togo when they moved up on the two nights before dday 2021 and 2122 october number of tracks had to be constructed between the staging areas and martello to allow x corpss night moves forward to go without hitch the problem was that the tracks wouldgive away the direction of montgomerys thrust near the coast the solution was to planthe routes from combination of ground reconnaissance and air photography to chooseterrain where engineer work would be least conspicuous having decided on the lines thetracks were to take the engineers began work at different and to start with apparentlyunrelated sections of the track only when the sections were joined up just before ddaywas the pattern clear then reliance was placed on intercepting enemy reconnaissanceaircraft the move went without hitch as the tanks and trucks left the murrayfield and melting potissue 10 dec 98 15staging areas dummies replaced them to present axis air reconnaissance with consistent picture similarly the vehicles which had been sitting in the martello assembly area for three weeks were withdrawn as x corpss trucks took their place even the resources ofthe base workshops could not cope with making the vast number of tank dummies toreplace the real tanks as they left the staging areas egyptian fellahin in the fayoum oasiswho make the traditional hurdles for beds and packing cases were set to work and aningenious officer worked out how to assemble them with thread and hessian and paint themto look like passable dummies hiding the artillery and double bluffconcealing the 400 field and medium guns concentrated in assembly areas behind the front and in their eventual gun positions was solved by erecting dummy canopy over the quadguntowers which had distinctive shape and their 25 pounders and limbers gun andlimber were backed up together with the limbers pole overlapping the guns trail to producethe pattern of four wheel vehicle the dummy canvas tops called cannibal because it swallowed the real equipment completed the disguise the assembly areas and the gunposition areas were accordingly dubbed cannibal 1 and cannibal 2 the disguise was only thrown off after dark on the night of the attack in the centre and southern sectors dummy artillery camouflaged well enough to disguise its bogus nature was set up to compensate for the artillery concealed by cannibals in the north in the munassib depression double bluff was organised to support 7th armoureddivisions holding attack and headquarters 8th armoured divisions simulated attack toprevent 21st panzer and ariete from reinforcing the sector in the north where the real blowwas to fall three and half field regiments worth of dummy guns and vehicles were setup in munassib special effort was made to give good imitation of normal activity and not to make the camouflage too perfect few days before the attack the camouflagemaintenance was allowed to lapse so that axis air reconnaissance would discover their truenature at the last minute the dummies were replaced by real guns to support 7th armoureddivisions holding attack although the attack was held up after penetrating the screen andthe first axis minefield the surprise added to the credibility of the feint hiding the supply dumpsthen there was the task of concealing 6000 tons of combat supplies in two large dumps one at alamein station and the other near imayid station 15 miles to the east at elalamein the problem was how to hide the main petrol dump fortunately the area had beenprepared for defence with well constructed stonerevetted trenches layer of petrol canswas stacked up against each wall of trench so that the internal shadows looked virtuallyunchanged from the air the raf was invited to look for the hidden cache and satisfyinglyfailed to do so rations were stacked in piles shaped like 3ton trucks and camouflaged at the standard 150 yard spacing between vehicles small quantities of stores were disguised to look likebivouacs traffic was deliberately diverted through the dumps to simulate realistic activitythe problem of theft was solved by stowing the attractive items like cigarettes milk sugarand tea in the centre of each stack with less attractive supplies forming the outside layers an assessmentissue 10 dec 98 16bertram was the largest and most successful battlefield deception plan executed by the british army up to that date in scale it was only surpassed by the elaborate fortitude plan to divert german attention from the normandy beaches to the pas calais nearly twoyears later prisoners and captured documents showed how well it succeeded when vonthoma the new commander of the dak was taken prisoner he told his captors that heexpected the axis for the attack would develop from the munassib depression in the southwhere largescale vehicle movements were believed to have taken place the concentrations in the north had escaped their notice panzerarmee intelligence thought that threebritish armoured divisions were assembling in the southern sector for four vital days 21stpanzer and ariete armoured divisions were held back in the south classic model ofdeception at the operational level operation bertram made major contibution to the victory at alameinissue 10 dec 98 17section 6 some views on desert warfare general rommels rules of desert warfare of all theatres of operations it was probably in north africa that the war took on its most advanced form the protagonists on both sides were fully motorised formations for whoseemployment the flat and obstructionfree desert offered hitherto undreamedof possibilities it was the only theatre where the principles of motorised and tank warfare as they hadbeen taught theoretically before the war could be applied to the full and further developedit was the only theatre where the pure tank battle between major formations was foughteven though the struggle may have occasionally hardened into static warfare it remained at any rate in its most important stages ie in 194142 during the cunninghamritchieoffensive and in the summer of 1942 marmarica battles capture of tobruk based onthe principle of complete mobility in military practice this was entirely new for our offensives in poland and the west had been against opponents who in all their operations had still had to take account of their nonmotorised infantry divisions and had thus had to suffer the disastrous limitation in theirfreedom of tactical decision which this imposes especially in retreat often they had beenforced into actions quite unsuited to the object of holding up our advance after our breakthrough in france the enemy infantry divisions had simply been overrun and outflanked byour motorised forces once this had happened they had had choice but to allow theiroperational reserves to be worn away by our assault groups often in tactically unfavourablepositions in an endeavour to gain time for the retreat of their infantry nonmotorised infantry divisions are only of value against motorised and armoured enemy when occupying prepared positions if these positions are pierced or outflankeda withdrawal will leave them helpless victims of the motorised enemy with nothing else but hold on in their positions to the last round they cause terrible difficulties in generalretreat for as i have indicated one has to commit ones motorised formations merely togain time for them i was forced to go through this myself during the axis retreat fromcyrenaica in the winter of 194142 when the whole of the italian infantry and considerablepart of the german including the majority of what was to become 90th light division werewithout vehicles and had either to be carried by shuttle service of lorries or to march itwas only the gallantry of my armour that enabled the retreat of the italogerman infantryto be covered for our fully motorised enemy was in hot pursuit similarly grazianis failurecan be attributed mainly to the fact that the greater part of the italian army was deliveredup helpless and nonmotorised in the open desert to the weaker but fully motorised britishformations while the italian motorised forces although too weak to oppose the britishsuccessfully were nevertheless compelled to accept battle and allow themselves to bedestroyed in defence of the infantry the british forces in contrast to ours were all fully mobile and the war in africa was in fact waged almost exclusively by mobile forces out of this pure motorised warfare certainprinciples were established principles fundamentally different from those applying in othertheatres these principles will become the standard for the future in which the fullymotorised formation will be dominant the envelopment of fullymotorised enemy in the flat and gooddriving terrain of the desert has the following resultsissue 10 dec 98 18a for fullymotorised formation encirclement is the worst tactical situation imaginable since hostile fire can be brought to bear on it from all sides evenenvelopment on only three sides is tactically untenable situation b the enemy becomes forced because of the bad tactical situation in which the encirclement has placed him to evacuate the area he is holding the encirclement of the enemy and his subsequent destruction in the pocket can seldom be the direct aim of an operation more often it is only indirect for any fullymotorised forcewhose organisational structure remains intact will normally and in suitable country be ableto break out at will through an improvised defensive ring thanks to his motorisation thecommander of the encircled force is in position to concentrate his weight unexpectedlyagainst any likely point in the ring and burst through it this fact was repeatedlydemonstrated in the desert it follows therefore that an encircled enemy force can only be destroyed when it is nonmotorised or has been rendered immobile by lack of petrol or when it includes nonmobile elements which have to be considered b when it is badly led or its command has decided to sacrifice one formation in order to save another c when its fighting strength has already been broken and disintegration and disorganisation have set in except for cases and b which occurred very frequently in other theatres of war encirclement of the enemy and his subsequent destruction in the pocket can only beattempted if he has first been so heavily battered in open battle that the organic cohesionof his force has been destroyed i shall term all actions which have as their aim the wearingdown of the enemys power of resistance battles of attrition in motorised warfare materialattrition and the destruction of the organic cohesion of the opposing army must be theimmediate aim of all planning tactically the battle of attrition is fought with the highest possible degree of mobility the following points require particular attention the main endeavour should be to concentrate ones own forces in space and time while at the same time seeking to split the enemy forces spatially and destroythem at different times b supply lines are particularly sensitive since all petrol and ammunition indispen sable requirements for the battle must pass along them hence everything possiblemust be done to protect ones own supply lines and to upset or better still cut theenemys operations in the enemys supply area will lead immediately to his breakingoff the battle elsewhere since as i have indicated supplies are the fundamentalpremise of the battle and must be given priority of protectionissue 10 dec 98 19c the armour is the core of the motorised army everything turns on it and other formations are mere auxiliaries the war of attrition against the enemy armour musttherefore be waged as far as possible by the tank destruction units ones own armourshould only be used to deal the final blow d reconnaissance reports must reach the commander in the shortest possible time he must take his decisions immediately and put them into effect as fast as he canspeed of reaction decides the battle commanders of motorised forces musttherefore operate as near as possible to their troops and must have the closestpossible signal communication with them speed of movement and the organisational cohesion of ones own forces are decisive factors and require particular attention any sign of dislocation must be dealtwith as quickly as possible by reorganisation f concealment of intentions is of the utmost importance in order to provide surprise for ones own operations and thus make it possible to exploit the time takenby the enemy command to react deception measures of all kinds should beencouraged if only to make the enemy commander uncertain and cause him tohesitate and hold back g once the enemy has been thoroughly beaten up success can be exploited by attempting to overrun and destroy major parts of his disorganised formations hereagain speed is everything the enemy must never be allowed time to reorganiselightning regrouping for the pursuit and reorganisation of supplies for the pursuingforces are essential concerning the technical and organisational aspect of desert warfare particular regard must be paid to the following points the prime requirements in the tank are manoeuvrability speed and long range gun for the side with the bigger gun has the longer arm and can be the firstto engage the enemy weight of armour cannot make up for lack of gunpower asit can only be provided at the expense of manoeuvrability and speed both of whichare indispensable tactical requirements b the artillery must have great range and must above all be capable of great mobility and of carrying with it ammunition in large quantities c the infantry serves only to occupy and hold positions designed either to prevent the enemy from particular operations or to force him into other ones once this objecthas been achieved the infantry must be able to get away quickly for employmentelsewhere it must therefore be mobile and be equipped to enable it rapidly to takeup defence positions in the open at tactically important points on the battlefield it is my experience that bold decisions give the best promise of success but one must differentiate between strategical or tactical boldness and military gamble boldoperation is one in which success is not certainty but which in case of failure leaves onewith sufficient forces in hand to cope with whatever situation may arise gamble on theissue 10 dec 98 20other hand is an operation which can lead either to victory or to the complete destruction of ones force situations can arise where even gamble may be justified as for instancewhen in the normal course of events defeat is merely matter of time when the gaining oftime is therefore pointless and the only chance lies in an operation of great risk the only occasion when commander can calculate the course of battle in advance is when his forces are so superior that victory is foregone conclusion then the problem isno longer one of the means but only of the method but even in this situation i still thinkit is better to operate on the grand scale rather than to creep about the battlefield anxiouslytaking all possible security measures against every conceivable enemy move normally there is ideal solution to military problems every course has its advantages and disadvantages one must select that which seems best from the most varied aspectsand then pursue it resolutely and accept the consequences any compromise is bad rommels view of the part to be played by heavy antiaircraft artillery in operations comes out admirably in his order 264042 secret on the operational role and chain of command of german fla and flak formations issued on 16 april 1942 during the reorganization after crusader two flakabteilungen were to be placed permanently under command of dak and kept available for ground operations this ground role will always have priority over the antiaircraft role when largescale operations are undertaken the antiaircraft artillery wasnormally under command of the luftwaffe but rommel disposed of fieldmarshal kesselring oberbefehlshaber süd by the simple process of ordering that the com mander of flakregiment 135 will coordinate the operations of all german fla and flak formations in respect of antiaircraft employment in accordance with the orders of pzaok panzerarmee oberkommando supreme command panzer army he will issue the necessary orders on behalf of the aok iaflak any correspondence arising herefrom will be restricted to essentials the operations of italian flak formations will be controlled by the commander of the italian army artillery nicolini the commander of flakregiment 135 was also entrusted with the training of all fla units throughout the area under rommels command colonel kriebels views on training1 the operational lull during summer and autumn 1941 was used by the german divisions for preparations of all sorts and for intensive training the panzer divisions applied thelessons of the spring to bring their training in mobile warfare up to the desired standardduring the summer and during the autumn battle the divisions more particularly 15thpanzer division had developed battle tactics of an entirely new kind 1 during the interval between the battleaxe and crusader operations the germans devoted consider able time to the problem of tactical training colonel rainer kriebel 1a or chief of operations 15th panzerdivision contributed an article to der feldzug in nordafrika 194143 edited by w nehring which was reproduced in j i agarhamilton and l c f turner the sidi rezegh battles 1941 oxford cape town 1957 pages 5658 the italics are colonel kriebelsissue 10 dec 98 21in order to understand the operations between november 1941 and february 1942 it is essential to understand these new tactics unlike the european war theatre the desertterrain permitted the use almost everywhere of vehicles of every imaginable kind in thedesert it was not necessary for large formations to move in columns which would then whenthe necessity arose proceed to take up battle formations with all the consequent delay itwas advisable to move in the kind of formation which would enable the full strength of adivision to be brought to bear immediately where there were roads to justify movementin columns at high speed the divisions moved in flaechenmarsch plainformation with the battle groups one behind the other and in such move the depth of each battle groupwas more than about four times its width in desert warfare operations against armoured units were more frequent than operations against entrenched infantry it was therefore advisable to have the most important arm ofthe divison ie the panzer regiment supported by all other units of the division even if itwas question of operations against enemy armour tactics of this kind had thus far beencustomary only in operations against mixed formations of all weapons the most important support weapon was the heavy antiaircraft battery of 88 cm guns which were able to penetrate the armour of the enemys heavy tanks at exceptionally longrange when the division was on the move therefore the guns were placed in the marchcolumn of the panzer regiment these 88 cm guns together with elements of the panzerregiment engaged the enemy armoured formations while the main body of the panzerregiment approached the enemy armour at top speed until they had brought their guns ortheir tanks within range motorized artillery also proved very valuable supporting weapon for armoured opera tions it was the task of the motorized artillery to provide fire protection for their own armouras it attacked to hold down enemy antitank artillery and armoured artillery observers andalso to lend flanking protection to the attacking forces by their fire it became evident thatenemy tanks were extremely vulnerable to concentric artillery fire it was frequentlypossible to disperse concentration of enemy tanks which had been assembled for theattack or at least to delay attack for this purpose the artillery in question moved dispersedat intervals through the panzer regiment the armoured artillery observation vehiclestravelled with the leading tanks the staffs of artillery units usually travelled with thecommanders of the armoured units with the rear battle groups of the division on the movethere was usually only one artillery unit which was responsible for flank protection the artillery soon learned to take up positions and open fire so rapidly that the tank attack suffered practically delay at all it very soon became clear that enemy armoured formations frequently avoided the attack of wellled and powerful german panzer division taking advantage of the higher speed of their tanks they tried to bring their armour to bear against the unprotected flanks and rear of the panzer division hence the panzerjaegerabteilung tankdestroyer group was charged with covering the flank of the division most open to enemy attacks and also with antitank operations in the vicinity of thesoftskinned parts of the division there were however occasions when the tankdestroyer groups were used in pursuit and also to strengthen and broaden the attack oftheir own armourissue 10 dec 98 23section 7 operation desert storm some early thoughts by colonel sellers ro1 author 1991 it is likely that the intelligence staffs overestimated both the strength and capabilities of the iraqi forces divisions are assumed to be at their war establishment the effective strengthof the iraqi army in the kuwait theatre of operations was probably nearer 260000 than500000 at the beginning of the air campaign reducing by death wounds and desertionduring the fiveandahalf weeks of the air preparation to figure nearer 200000 by g dayon 24 february the republican guard had reputation like napoleons guard or thewaffenss but they had acquired this reputation against iranian troops who were not welltrained the republican guard had expanded far too quickly for its own good so that itsexaggerated efficiency was eroded still further however some of its units did stand to fightit out with inferior weapon systems it was probably bad thing that the iraqi capability and strength were overestimated at least coalition force sufficiently large well trained and equipped to guarantee quick andcheap victory was despatched to the gulf in time to gain decision before ramadan andthe hot weather using sledgehammer to crack nut is better than sending lad on amans errand fault of which we have too often been guilty in the past the americans werehaunted by vietnam they had to make sure of rapid success for the sake of their armedforces their people at home and world opinion the 38 day air campaign and the 100 hourwar laid the ghosts of vietnam the coalition forces especially the american and british had vastly superior equipment to the iraqis the latters t72 was only marginally better than the us marines m60 butno match at all for the m1a1 abrams and the challenger with their excellent night and badweather visual equipment for commander gunner and driver however most of the iraqitanks were ancient t5455s the iraqi artillery was good but without night and bad weatherobservation aids it could not bring its shells down in the right place the coalition air forces and attack helicopters were superior to anything the iraqis had and were soon able to establish not just air superiority but air supremacy the main benefitswere that the iraqis mobility on the battlefield was severely limited iraqi intelligence wasdeprived of its eyes the armys supply system was interdicted especially by the destructionof most of the bridges over the euphrates feat which took tremendous effort in thesecond world war with only iron bombs by the time the ground war started the iraqi airforce had been neutralized and the fighting capacity of its army degraded it is interestingto note that the coalition artillery tube or mlrs proved more destructive on the battlefieldthan air weapons schwarzkopfs solution of the command problem was tour force making khalid partner in command satisfied the amour propre of the arab rulers generals and troops it was also the most efficient way of controlling and issuing orders to so many nationalitiesschwarzkopf played his first among equals role with great tact and understanding the allocation of formations to tasks was handled to perfection the solid hitting power of vii corps was concentrated round the american armoured mechanized and cavalrydivisions to which the british were able to make magnificent contribution in the shape ofissue 10 dec 98 24the 1st br armoured division these formations understood and could apply the principles of the airland battle moving fast and fighting in three dimensions theirhelicopters working in partnership with their armour perhaps the corps was unlucky notto have wade hampton or phil sheridan to direct it in xviii corps the french 6th light armoured division was ideally suited to its flank protection role the 101st air assault division had the mobility and massive attackhelicopter air power to interdict the euphrates valley the 24th us infantry divisionmechanized gave the corps heavy punch and was eventually used to reinforce viicorps for the battle against the republican guard the us marines were ideal for thedogged battle through the main belt of iraqi fixed defences and provided confident supportfor the jfcs on either flank the jfcs were well grouped from the point of view ofoperational compatibility and given tasks within the capability of such mixed forces theegyptian corps was professional painstaking and thorough it reminded one of thosebritish divisions in the second world war which habitually lived in minefields from elalamein onwards the egyptians already had some experience of their desert storm role in the attack on the bar lev line in 1973 air supremacy made possible schwarzkopfs hail mary concept for the battle except that it was not the quarterbacks desperate last minute effort to snatch victory from the jaws ofdefeat but carefully thought out gambit because the iraqi army was immobilized by thecoalition air forces and had concept similar to the airland battle philosophy itscommanders had way in which they could interfere with the coalitions operations orinfluence the situation the iraqis slogging matches against the iranian army were nopreparation for war of manoeuvre the other factor which made the coalition victory possible was its logisticians competence everyone from lieutenant general pagonis at the upper end of the command scale tocolonel martin white who managed the british divisions logistic effort performedoutstandingly in desert environment it was perhaps wise to overinsure and to bring inammunition and fuel for possible 60 day campaign from the mechanical engineers point of view the fine dust of the iraqi desert makes special filters essential sand erodes helicopter blades but tape reduces the rate of erosion the weather was not kind winters in middle eastern deserts are often bitterly cold and wet the shamal blows rain and sand with stinging ferocity to everyones intense discomfortit reduces visibility although thermal imagers can see through it better than the human eyein areas of soft sand the bottom falls out of the desert seriously reducing mobility at leastthe desert on the iraqikuwaiti border where vii corps met the republican guard wasmostly good hard firm gravel further inland the french had to cope with some very roughshale which is as unkind to tyres track rods and suspensions as it is to passengers skilfuldriving which involves knowing how to tackle everything from low rocky ledges to soft sandis only acquired through training and experience in the environment from the navigators point of view the introduction of gps was revolution in the art of finding ones way in the desert and knowing ones precise location when an enemy isobliging enough to dig an elaborate defensive system which can be photographed andissue 10 dec 98 25overprinted on maps the two can be used in conjunction with so few natural features the british use of metals as code names to identify defensive positions provided useful plot all in all the campaign was triumph for western and arab diplomacy allied cooperation the selection of an attainable but limited aim sound logistic planning and the highprofessional standards of well trained regular forces the west currently enjoys atechnological superiority which it was able to apply to great advantage in the empty desertthe conflict and the preparatory period leading up to it gave our forces the opportunity toadapt the art of mobile warfare learnt on the training areas of germany to an environmentunfamiliar to many the experience gained may prove useful at some future date in anunstable world finally the political background to desert shield and desert storm could not have been more favourable saddam husseins blatant act of aggression placed him beyond the palein the international forum the majority of the arab world was united with the west underun sponsorship to remove the aggressor from kuwait the aim was limited to the liberationof the sheikhdom and member of the coalition had any designs on iraqi territoryoverwhelming force was applied with wisdom civilians and civilian targets were scrupulously avoided whenever possible it is unlikely that many future crises in an increasinglypolycentric world will be so readily manageable and command so much
