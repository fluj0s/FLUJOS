eight years of debate over whether to re authorize trade promotion authority tpa formerly called fasttrack authority this authority allows the president to submit to congress legislation implementing new trade agreements under special legislative procedures that do not allow for amendment while there is unlikely to be trade legislation over the next two years that will be of the magnitude or divisiveness of the trade act of 2002 particularly given the power shift in the midterm elections the 108th congress will have busy trade agenda the bush administration is expected to ask congress to approve free trade agreements ftas with chile and sing apore and perhaps other countries in considering whether to approve ftas submitted by the administration congress will evaluate how these agreements affect the often divergent interests of exporters importcompeting industries c onsumers and workers as well as the progress of two broader trade negotiations that are sche duled to be concluded by 2005 the free trade area of the americas ftaa and the wto doha development agenda as us dependence on trade has grown along w ith record trade deficits controversy concerning the costs

importantly congress faces the challenge of bringing varied us laws into conformity with world trade organization wto rules absent compliance the european union and other trading partners could impose sanctions on us exports congress is also expected to consider legislation that would provide russia with permanent normal trade relations status pntr efforts again will be made to re authorize the

agreements the western hemispheres ftaa and the wto doha development agenda are ongoing and scheduled to be concluded by january 2005 the 108th congress will likely face the questi on of whether to approve one or more free trade agreements it is also expected to closely monitor negotiations on other free trade agreements and on the wto doha development agenda the agreements and negotiations raise several important policy questions do the agreements and the ongoing negotiations serve us interests is the administration fulfilling its obligations under the new trade promotion authority are bilateral and regional free trad agreements and negotiations on the one hand and the us mul tilateral agenda in the doha development agenda on the othe r hand mutually supportive or in conflict how are fta partners chosen and what economic or foreign policy criteria must be met in deciding whether to approve bila teral free trade agreements members of congress may weigh potential costs and benefits to their constituents and to the us economy as whole pointed concerns may focus on how specific agreements differentially affect the interests of exporters im portcompeting industries consumers and workers as well as achie ve negotiating objectiv concerning labor and environmental standards for example the chile and singapore agreements are characterized as primarily opening up new markets for us exporters without making any significant reduction in u s import protection agreements withhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31780crs3 morocco and central america however could produce strong competition for the us textile and pparel sector possible raisin g labor and industry opposition committees with jurisdiction ove r trade agreements particularly the house ways and means and senate finance committees may raise questions regarding the administrations fta strategy as well how are fta partners chosen what economic or strategic criteria must be met does the strategy complicate or support efforts to negotiate larger regional and global agreements some critics maintain that bilateral ftas offer limited economic benefits to the united states some question the adminis trations choice of fta partners some are concerned they will further limit ec onomic opportunities for americans who do not have higher levels of education others worry that they could undermine efforts to conclude broader regi onal and global trade agreements while the larger agreements offer greater ma rket opening opportunities for us exporters and service providers they also would require the unite d states to cut farm subsidies and open up stillprotected sectors such as textiles faster the american publics reaction to some free trade agreements such as nafta has been chilly the bush administration maintains that ftas support larger foreign policy goals such as bolstering democratic regimes the administration also views bilateral ftas as springboards for concl uding more ambitious regional and global pacts agreements with chile and central america are seen putting pressure on south american countries pa rticularly brazil to negotiate on the free trade area of the americas progress in the ftaa in turn is seen as pressuring the european union and others to make progre ss in the wto trade negotiations congressional role in trade agreements lenore sek specialist in intern ational trade and finance 77768 through its constitutional responsibility for the conduct of foreign commerce congress has decisive role in whether and how the united states participates in these and other trade negotiations it d ecides whether or not changes under trade agreements which are negotiated by the executive branch will be implemented in domestic law in 2002 the 107th congress passed and the president signed the trade act of 2002 pl 107210 which among other thin gs granted the president socalled trade promotion authority tpa previous ly known as fasttrack authority tpa allows the

of trade agreement under strict timetables and without amendment provide d that the administration follows rules set out by congress regarding negotia ting objectives consultations and other matters by increasing the likelihood that congress will approve trade agreements as negotiated tpa bolsters the negotiating leverage and credibility of us trade negotiators at the same time congress limits its ability to amend implementing legislation under tpa and critics argue that this ties congress to trade agreements negotiated by the executive branchhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31780crs4 if congress determines that the executiv branch is not observing the provisions of the trade legislation that it approved last year it coul d consider several responses it could withdraw expedited procedures for implementing legislation for trade agreements thus allowing amendment of th legislation members also might insist on more active participation through access to negotiating documents and as observers at negotiating sessions the executive branch probably would not favor or would even oppose both of these responses implementing legislation for the chile and singapore fta agreements is likely to be submitted to congress this year implementing legislation for other bilateral agreements could be submitted in 2004 regarding the ftaa and doha agenda implementing legislation is not expected to be submitted assuming agreements are reached until the 109th congress or later but the 108th congress having an expanded oversight authority as defined in the trade act of 2002 will play crucial role

statutory authority for export controls on sensitive dua luse goods and technologies items that have both civilian and military applications including those items that can contribute to the proliferation of nuclear biological and chemical weaponry efforts to renew the act have been co mplicated by continued tension between national security and commercial concerns some observers contend that current export controls hurt us business by subjecting technology exports to what they consider cumbersome and ineffective licen sing process that co sts sales and loses markets to overseas competitors others maintain that current controls are not strong enough to prevent the spread of dualuse technologies to adve rsaries or potential proliferators and that eaa legi slation as introduced in the 107th congress would further weaken this system congressi onal interest in eaa reform has been heightened by questions about the efficacy of export controls in the fight against terrorism and by revelations about the unauthorized transfer of sensitive items to nations restricted by current regulations including china the eaa which originally expired in 1989 periodically has been

substantially similar to s 149 to different degrees the house versions conferred additional authority on the depa rtment of defense to bloc k license applications and decontrol decisions tightened the criteria for decontrol of certain items and mandated the denial of licenses for certa in exports the administration supported s 149 and opposed the competing house versions negotiations between the administration senate and house participants to rec oncile differences between the versions of the legislation continued for the remainder of the session without success because the substance of this debate has not been predominantly partisan in nature the change in party composition of the 108th congress is not expected to alter the dynamics of the debate many expect bills similar to those
