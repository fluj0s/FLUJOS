order code rs21821 updated june 30 2008 evaluating the current stance of monetary policy using taylor rule marc labonte specialist in macroeconomics government and finance division summary oversight of the federal reserves feds monetary policy decisions rests with httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21821 congress but oversight is encumbered by the absence of straightforward relationship between interest rates and economic performance further the feds policy decisions are discretionary meaning there is objective transparent yardstick for evaluating their decisions simple rule of thumb guide to monetary policy decisions called taylor rule is an intuitive way to judge actual policy against some objective albeit simplistic ideal taylor rules can be adjusted to reflect variety of policy goals this report compares current policy to number of taylor rules and finds that actual interest rates are currently lower than the rules would prescribe because of the feds decision to sharply reduce rates to protect against potential recession despite rising inflation the government has two main tools for influencing overall economic conditions fiscal policy and monetary policy monetary policy can boost economic activity and inflation by lowering shortterm interest rates the federal funds rate or depress economic activity and inflation by raising interest rates changes in output and employment caused by monetary policy are of temporary nature in the long run changes in the money supply affect only inflation and have effect on the economys sustainable growth rate in essence monetary policy has two attainable goals to promote economic stability minimize fluctuations in the business cycle and price stability low and stable inflation because the fed has only one tool at its disposal influence over interest rates it faces tradeoff in the pursuit of these two goals when the two goals conflict they cannot both be pursued at once1 congress has delegated responsibility for monetary policy decisions to the federal reserve but maintains oversight responsibilities oversight is made difficult however by the absence of straightforward relationship between interest rates and economic 1 for more information see crs report rl30354 monetary policy and the federal reserve current status and conditions by marc labonte and gail makinen crs2 performance because of changes in investment demand any given interest rate may be expansionary when the economy is booming but contractionary when the economy is in recession furthermore the feds policy decisions are discretionary it justifies policy decisions qualitatively rather than quantitatively its decisions to change interest rates need only be consistent with the broad mandate that it maintain full employment stable prices and moderate interest rates when these goals are mutually exclusive as they frequently are the mandate can be used to justify virtually any policy decision in this context congress frequently finds itself in position where it must take the feds word for it that the policy change will have the effect it is said to have because there is objective outside yardstick to evaluate it this report attempts to offer such yardstick one way to evaluate fed policy for oversight purposes would be to use complex econometric models to generate predicted results of monetary policy change and see if these results conform with the policy changes stated or mandated goals but this requires sophisticated knowledge of econometric modeling that may not be practical for oversight particularly since different models yield significantly different results this report uses simpler popular alternative called taylor rule to quantitatively evaluate the current stance of monetary policy2 economist john taylor recently treasury undersecretary httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21821 proposed the following rule to set interest rates that balances the goals of maintaining economic stability and price stability3 ffr r i 05 x output gap 05 x i it where ffr federal funds rate r equilibrium interest rate assumed here to equal 2 output gap percent difference between actual gdp and potential gdp i inflation rate it inflation target assumed here to equal 2 the goal of maintaining economic stability is represented by the factor 05 x output gap which raises interest rates when actual gdp is greater than potential gdp and lowers rates when it is below potential the output gap is the difference between actual and potential gdp potential gdp is the level of output that would be produced if all of the economys labor and capital resources were being utilized in economic downturns actual gdp falls below potential because some resources are idle likewise because prices adjust slowly the economy can temporarily be pushed above level of output that is sustainable once prices adjust output will return to potential there is direct way to measure potential gdp so it must be inferred different estimating methods yield different results4 this taylor rule states that when actual gdp is say 1 above 2 for background and analysis of taylor rules see crs report rl31050 formulation of monetary policy by the federal reserve rules vs discretion by marc labonte 3 john taylor discretion vs policy rules in practice carnegierochester series on public policy vol 39 1993 p 195 robert solow and john taylor inflation unemployment and monetary policy cambridge ma mit press 1998 p 45 the specific mathematical form of this rule does not appear to be formally derived from theory or empirical evidence 4 this report uses cbos estimate of potential gdp see congressional budget office cbos continued crs3 potential gdp the federal funds rate should be increased by 05 percentage points if policymakers wanted more less aggressive reaction to changes in growth they would place larger smaller weight on the coefficient than 05 the goal of maintaining price stability is represented by the factor 05 x iit which states that interest rates are to be raised when inflation i is above its target it and lowered when inflation is below its target unlike the output gap the inflation target can be any rate that policymakers desire this rule assumes 2 inflation target which is close to the 19942003 average of 18 as measured by the gdp deflator as measured by the consumer price index cpi the 10year average inflation rate was 25 this rule weights the response to deviations from the inflation target equally to deviations from potential gdp one percentage point increase in inflation above its target would lead to 05 percentage point increase in the federal funds rate if actual gdp is equal to potential gdp and inflation is equal to its target the rule calls for an inflationadjusted federal funds rate of 2 or an actual federal funds rate equal to 2 plus the current inflation rate this is often called the neutral interest rate at which monetary policy is neither stimulative nor contractionary httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21821 current policy prescriptions according to different taylor rules in the first quarter of 2008 actual gdp was 16 below potential gdp and inflation using the gdp deflator equaled 27 over the previous four quarters entering these data into the taylor rule above and rounding to the nearest quarter point yields federal funds rate of 2 27 05 x 16 05 x 27 2 425 higher than the current rate of 2 with inflation at 27 the current neutral rate is 475 according to the rule the taylor rule calls for an interest rate below the neutral rate because the size of the output gap outweighs the increase in inflation above its presumed target since this rule considers only current inflation and the output gap it cannot consider other factors that counsel against tightening policy such as the potential for financial turmoil since august 2007 to slow growth5 figure 1 plots actual federal funds rates against rates determined by the taylor rule from 1998 to 2003 this figure should not be used to directly evaluate actual policy for two reasons first because economic data are released with lag and subject to subsequent revisions figure 1 is based on data unavailable to the fed when actual policy decisions were made6 second since subsequent events would have differed had 4 continued method for estimating potential output august 2001 5 major drawback to taylor rules is that they cannot cover all contingencies for example in times of crisis the other function of monetary policy to serve as lender of last resort could not be adequately incorporated in rule arguably the feds more aggressive stance in 2001 than the rule would suggest was partly motivated by the unique circumstances surrounding september 11 which rule cannot take into account on the other hand some economists argues that because of uncertainty over the proper way to model economic activity simple rules perform more robustly than complex rules across different models 6 athanasios

the chart cannot be interpreted as consistent alternative policy option over time as can be seen in figure 1 while interest rates under this rule followed the same general pattern as actual rates monetary tightening in the 1990s followed by easing in the 2000s there were some shortterm differences the rule called for lower interest rates in 1998 because inflation was below the target the rule called for similar interest rates in 19992000 but less aggressive policy response to the economic downturn that began in 2001 if the rule was based on data available at the time the rate reduction would have been even smaller since the gdp data have since been revised downward this rule would have tightened policy slightly in the second half of 2003 as the economy picked up speed rather than leaving interest rates at 1 as the fed did figure 1 federal funds rate actual and prescribed by taylor rule 19982003 7 6 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21821 5 interest rate 4 3 2 1 0 1998i 1999i 2000i

table 1 how other rules based on different policy goals compare to current policy for example economist lars svensson argues that since monetary policy affects the economy with lag if policy is based on current data it will always be backward looking and fighting the last war since policy decisions made today affect future economic conditions he argues they should be based on projections of future growth and inflation7 of course different forecasters have different projections of future growth but this problem can be mitigated by using the blue chip consensus forecast blue chip is private company whose monthly consensus forecast is the average forecast of 50 different private sector forecasters based on the june 2008 consensus forecast gdp one year from now is projected to be 30 below

actual gdp and potential gdp i inflation rate measured by gdp deflator results are rounded to nearest quarter point making price stability the sole goal of monetary policy inflation targeting has been widely implemented abroad in economies such as the united kingdom and the euro area and bills to switch to inflation targeting have been introduced in the 110th congress hr 6042 hr 60538 proponents support inflation targets for three reasons related to this report first many economists have reservations with fine tuning in monetary policy since the fed can make mistakes and markets can eventually adjust on their own they argue that the best monetary policy is hands off one that does not try to respond to every small change in the economy second some economists have argued that monetary policy should focus less on stabilizing output since only the inflationary effects of monetary policy are permanent third in the context of taylor rule strict inflation target could be justified on the grounds that measurements of the output gap are too uncertain to be useful as discussed below9 to see how strict inflation target would operate the traditional taylor rule can be adapted by removing the output gap and increasing the weight on the inflation target to say 10 under this rule the current interest rate would equal 525 above the neutral rate because inflation is 07 percentage points above its presumed target when inflation does not follow the business cycle closely strict inflation target rule causes monetary policy to become less countercyclical and this rule would not have followed actual policy very closely recently as practiced by inflation targeters abroad monetary policy has still attempted to stabilize economic growth usually under the rationale that 8 see crs report 9816 should the federal reserve adopt an inflation target by marc labonte and gail makinen 9 bennett mccallum should monetary policy respond strongly to output gaps national bureau of economic research working paper 5952 april 2001 crs6 stable growth helps maintain stable prices10 therefore the strict inflation target used here does not reflect international experience with inflation targeting11 alternatively policymakers may prefer more aggressive response to changes in economic conditions more fine tuning than the traditional taylor rule provides more fine tuning can be incorporated by raising both coefficients on the original rule from 05 to say 10 when this change is made the current interest rate would be 375 see table 1 as has been discussed there are an unlimited number of weights that can be placed on the inflation and output factors because there are an unlimited variety of policy preferences rather than arbitrarily assigning set of preferences to the taylor rule another approach is to determine what weights best parallel actual federal reserve policy historically taylor does this in 1999 paper and shows that taylor rule has high goodness of fit the rsquared is 083 and the coefficients are highly statistically significant in the greenspan era12 in other words most of the decisions that the fed made in the greenspan era through the third quarter of 1997 are the same as if the fed had been following taylor rule this is reassuring for the use of taylor rules to aid oversight the historical taylor rule turns out to have similar weights to the traditional one suggested by taylor the weight on the output gap would be raised from 05 to 08 and the httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21821 weight on inflation would remain 05 the real equilibrium interest rate is slightly higher in this period 22 than assumed in the original taylor rule 2 comparison of current interest rates and those predicted by this historical taylor rule can be interpreted as showing whether current monetary policy decisions are similar to ones taken by the fed in the past if the fed had continued its historical behavior interest rates would have tended to be higher than they actually were recently and interest rates would currently be 4 see table 1 one drawback to evaluating monetary policy using taylor rule is that the policy prescriptions made by the taylor rule are very sensitive to the choice of data sources and coefficient weights in particular since the output gap is constructed series that can be estimated using number of different methods different output gap series produce widely different results likewise there are several equally valid measures of inflation available and sometimes these series diverge for short periods of time kozicki shows that different data sources can change the taylor rules recommended interest rate by as many as several percentage points13 discretionary policy is able to weigh conflicting data in way that rule cannot nevertheless discretionary policy still must be based on the same conflicting data as rules so this advantage should not be overestimated 10 the output gap might not be removed if future rather than current inflation were targeted under strict inflation target in that case the rule might still react to changes in the output gap in so far as changes in the output gap affect future inflation
