significant developments background before enactment of tanf american indians or alaska natives indians inuit eskimos or aleuts received family cash welfare on the same terms as other families in their state with benefits and income eligibility rules of the program of aid to families with dependent children afdc set by the state and costs shared by the state the law had provision for administration of cash aid by tribes however some wisconsin tribes subcontracted with the state to provide afdc independently on their reservations in fy1994 13 of the national afdc caseload about 68000 families were american indians and alaska natives in addition more than 65000 needy indians who were not in categories eligible for afdc received cash aid based on their states afdc benefit standards but paid by the bureau of indian affairs bia under pretanf law more than 80 tribes and tribal organizations exercised an option to run their own work and training programs called job

do not apply to tribal assistance programs their rules are set by the health and human services hhs secretary with tribal participation tribal assistance programs eligible for tribal assistance grants are the more than 330 federally recognized tribes in the contiguous 48 states and 13 alaska entities as of september 15 2004 45 tribal tanf grants were approved for 230 tribes plus some nonreservation indians in alaska arizona california idaho minnesota montana nebraska nevada new mexico oklahoma oregon south dakota utah washington wisconsin and wyoming annual federal funding deducted from the basic tanf grant of their states totals 1342 million for funding by tribal plan see table 1 grantees estimated their monthly caseload at 33510 families according to the fifth annual tanf report the average number of indian families served by state governments under regular tanf programs was about 35000 in fy2000 down 50 from the corresponding fy1996 figure part of the decline represented persons who moved from the regular state program to tribal program some features of tribal programs follow recognized tribes and tribal organizations may operate family assistance programs in their service areas tribes tanf grant equals federal afdc payments to the state for fy1994 attributable to indians in its service area the tribal grant is subtracted from the states tanf grant tribal tanf plans are for three years rather than 2 as for states and contain many fewer required elements than state plans however regular tanf data collection and reporting rules apply to tribal plans the hhs secretary with participation of the tribe establishes work participation rules time limits for benefits and penalties for each tribal family assistance program in general indian tribes in alaska must operate plans in accordance with rules adopted by the state for tanf the national congress of american indians has asked for removal of this provision and for the restrictive definition immediately below saying that it wants alaskan tribes to be treated like other tribes tanf law generally defines an indian tribe as in section 4 of the indian selfdetermination and education assistance act but it specifies that an eligible indian tribe in alaska means one of 12 specified regional nonprofit corporations plus reservation tribal tanf regulations permit 35 of tribal grant to be used for administrative costs in the first year 30 in the second year and 25 thereafter state tanf programs however generally may spent more than 15 of their grants on administration crs3 the state governor must certify equitable access from the tanf program to indians not eligible for help from tribal family assistance plan the law gives explicit permission for state tanf programs to use money from the tanf loan fund for aid to indian families that have moved out of the service area of tribe with tribal family assistance plan special rule exempts from the 60month tanf benefit time limit any month in which the recipient lives in indian country or an alaskan native village with an adult unemployment rate of at least 50 the law makes tribes eligible for tanf loans but not for bonuses offered to states for high performance or for cutting nonmarital births hhs has ruled that state funds contributed to an approved tribal assistance plan may be counted toward the spending level maintenance ofeffort that state must achieve to qualify for full tanf grant 1999 amendment permits tribes like states to reserve tanf grants for assistance ongoing needs and supportive services for the unemployed in any future year since july 1 2001 tribes also have been allowed to reserve unobligated new funds for assistance in any future year pending legislation the housepassed tanf reauthorization bill hr 4 and the senate finance committee substitute version of hr 4 pride renew tribal grants at their current level and make indian tribal organizations eligible for proposed marriage promotion grants and the proposed employment achievement bonus both bills require tribal family assistance plans to provide assurance that tribes have consulted with their states regarding the plans design the senate committee bill also authorizes appropriation of 100 million annually for five years for tribal tanf improvement fund which could be used to provide technical assistance to tribes fund competitive grants and conduct research the american indian welfare reform act s 751 hr 2770 proposes many changes they include federal payments to states that contribute with tanf moe funds to costs of indian tribal assistance programs increased tribal funding from the child care and development block grant ccdbg authority for tribes to receive federal funds for foster care and adoption assistance and on demonstration basis to determine eligibility for food stamps medicaid and schip child care and child support the 1996 law reserves between 1 and 2 of its child care funds for payments to indian tribes and tribal organizations to be subtracted from national totals previously afdcrelated child care funds were earmarked for indians in fy2002 96 million was allocated to tribes 2 each of mandatory and discretionary funds discretionary funds are provided under the child care and development block grant ccdbg the law also allows indian tribes subject to hhs approval to use ccdbg funds for construction the 1996 welfare law authorizes direct federal funding for child support operations to indian tribes and again alaska native organizations with approved child support plans by regulation tribes receive 90 federal funding for the first three years 80 for later years as of march 2004 9 tribes received direct federal funding and handled more than 21000 cases final regulations replaced interim rules in march crs4 characteristics of tribal tanf plans data compiled by the division of tribal services show that most tribal tanf plans have adopted the 60month lifetime time limit for federally funded tanf to an adult the two oregon tribes klamath tribes and confederated tribes of siletz indians adopted limit of 24 months within an 84month period similar to oregon state plan limit work activities shown in most tribal plans are the same as those specified in tanf law but several tribes make additions thus two washington tribes list as additional work activities teaching cultural activities and barrier removal including counseling and chemical dependency treatment the tanana chiefs conference in alaska includes as work activities approved subsistence hunting fishing gathering most two tribal plans limit the service population to indians however the red cliff band of lake superior chippewa indians in wisconsin says it will serve all families including nonindians on the reservation and tribal member families in bayfield county and the white mountain apache tribe in arizona also says it will serve all families on the reservation the sissetonwahpeton sioux tribe serves only oneparent families with its tribal plan its 2 parent families are aided by bias general assistance program table 1 shows that most of the tribal tanf plans have set work participation rates below the allfamily rate of 50 and the 2parent family rate of 90 specified for state tanf programs in fy2002 the table also shows that 36 of the 45 tribal grantees including the navajo nation in arizona and
