powder cocaine even though the tw substances are chemically similar and have the same physiological and psychotropic effects prior to this amendment the guidelines called for prison terms for crack cocaine offenses that were three to six times longer than those for offens involving equivalent amounts of powder cocaine the crack cocaine amendment which became effective on november 1 2007 reduces this crackpowder penalty disparity by recommending sentences that are on average between two and five times longer than ntences for equal amounts of powder cocaine on december 11 2007 the sentencing

of retroactivity7 and holding public hearings to consider the issue8 the commission voted 7to0 in favor of retroactivity on d ecember 11 2007 while the commission found that the statutory purposes of senten cing are best served by retroactive application of the amendment it emphasized that not all previously sentenced crack cocaine offenders will automatically receive reduction in sentence rather federal sentencing judges will have the final authority to make that determination based on the merits of each case after considering variety of factors including whether public safety w ould be

encing guidelines had employed 1001 ratio that treated 100 grams of powder cocaine the same as one gram of crack cocaine11 in other words 100 times more powder cocaine than crack cocaine was needed to trigger the same punishment for particular drug offense12 yet over series of reports issued since 1995 the commission has announced its determination that the crackpowder sentencing disparity is unwarra nted and fails to meet the sentencing objectives set forth by congress the commission concluded that the 1001 ratio was the product of incorrect assumptions about the relative harm fulness of the two forms of the drug and overstates the seriousness of mo st crack cocaine offenses13 the commission observed that because 85 of defendants convicted of crack offenses are black the sentencing guidelines more severe prison terms for crack versus powder fuels widelyheld perception that they promote unwarranted disparity based on race14 finally the commission pointed out that the disparity results in an anomalous outcome retail crack dealers get longer sentences than the whol esale drug distributors who supply them the powder cocaine from which their crack is produced15 to address these concerns the co mmissions 2007 crack cocaine amendment eliminates the 1001 ratio in the federal ntencing guidelines the revised ratio now varies at different offense vels ranging between 251 and 801 note however that the amendment does not alter the statutory 1001 ratio found in 21 usc 841b1 which provides mandatory minimum sentences16 of five years for drug offenses involving 100 grams of powder cocaine or 5 grams of crack cocaine and 10year minimum sentences for defendants accountable for 50 grams of cr ack or 5000 grams of powder reduction of the statutory 1001 ratio would re quire

the commission must periodically review and revise the federal sentencing guidelines pursuant to 28 usc 994u the commission is statutorily authorized to designate guideline amendment for retroactive application this section of the us code provides if the commission reduces the term of imprisonment recommended in the guidelines applicable to particular offense or category of offenses it shall specify in wh at circumstances and by what amount the sentences of prisoners servin g terms of imprisonment for the offense may be reduced 18 usc 3582c2 prohibits sentenci ng courts from modifying term of imprisonment once it has been imposed unless ch reduction is consistent with policy statements issued by the sentencing commission22 section 1b110 of the us sentencing commissions guidelines manual sets forth the policy statement that helps guide court considering modifying prev iously imposed imprisonment term pursuant to 18 usc 3582c2 where defendant is serving term of imprisonment and the guideline range applicable to that defendant has subsequently been lowered as result of an amendment to the guidelines manual listed in subsection c below reduction in the defendants term of imprisonment is authorized under 18 usc 3582c2 if none of the amendments listed in subsection c is applicable reduction in the defendants term of imprisonment under 18 usc 3582c 2 is not consistent with this policy statement and thus is not authorized23 subsection c of 1b110 lists the amendm ents that the commission has decided may be retroactively applied fu rthermore subsec tion b states in

listed in subsection c been in effect at the time the defendant was sentenced it should be noted however that an amendment listed in 1b110c does not entitle defendant to reduced term of imprisonment as matter of right but rather confers discretionary authority upon fe deral judges to reduce such term24 thus offender is automatically eligible for downward sentence reduction by virtue of guideline amendment being made retroactive judicial approval would still be needed in addition judge could not reduce sent ence below statutory mandatory minimum also defendants who received enhanced sentences under the armed career criminal act25 18 usc 924e are inelig ible for sentence reduction factors that the commission considers when deciding whether to make an amendment retroactive include 1 the purpos of the amendment 2 the magnitude of the change in the guideline range made by the amendment and 3 the difficulty for court applying the amendment retroactively to determine an amended guideline range26 motion under 18 usc 3582c2 to re duce previously imposed sentence may be filed by the defendant th director of the bureau of prisons or on the sentencing courts own motion27 in considering such motion the sentencing court must evaluate several statutory factors including the following the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant the need for the sentence imposed to reflect the seriousness of theoffense to promote respect for the law and to provide just punishment for the offense b to afford ade quate deterrence to criminal conduct c to protect the public from further crimes of the defendant and d to provide the defendant w ith educational or voca tional training medical care or other correctional treatment in the most effective manner the sentencing range establishe d by the sentencing commission any pertinent policy statement issued by the sentencing commission regarding application of the guidelines the need to avoid unwarranted sentence disparities among defendantswith similar records who have been found guilty of similar conduct and the need to provide restitution to any victims of the offense28 previous

which the drug oxycodone is measured for purposes of calculating the guidelines offense level33 this amendment was made retroactive as well34 the commission did not provide substantive reasons for making any of these amendments retroactive and there is lack of such information in the public record public reaction judges public defenders and sentencingreform activists widely endorsed the decision to make the cr ack cocaine amendment retroactive35 among other things supporters of the decision pointed to the fairness of treating crack offender who is sentenced prior to november 1 2007 in the same manner as one who committed the same crime but is sent enced after that date36 others argue that because the other three amendments that were previously made re troactive involved drugs lsd marijuanaand oxycodone that affect comparatively few bl ack defendants the decision to make the crack cocaine amendment retroactive helps to combat the perception of racism and unfairness in the criminal justice system within minority communities37 us department of justice officials have been critical of the commissions decision stating that retroactive application will divert valuable resources from federal courts and prosecutors for resentencing at time when violent crime is rising in many vulnerable communities around the country38 the attorney general has also expressed concern about the potential effect of early re lease of prisoners on public safety39 while some members of congress have pr aised the retroactivity deci sion others have opposed it legislation in the 110th congress hr 4842 introduced by representative lamar smith on december 19 2007 would provide for only prospective effect of the sentencing commissions crack cocaine amendment thus the reduced crack cocaine sentencing guidelines would be applied to cases pending on and after november 1 2007
