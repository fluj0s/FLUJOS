unit docomo also has been building an international network primarily by purchasing shares of foreign telecommunications companies the company already is moving into europe and is attempting to purchase controlling share of the englewood colorado based verio inc for 55 billion verio is major provider of internet services to corporations the fbi has raised national security concerns about this planned acquisition3 under section 721 the exonflorio provision of the defense production act of 1950 enacted in 1988 the president is authorized to suspend or prohibit any foreign acquisition merger or takeover of us corporation that is determined to threaten the national security of the united states4 the committee reviewing the case has until august 14 2000 to either have the fbi and ntts docomo reach satisfactory compromise or to report its decision to the president who than has 15 days to take action on may 25 2000 seven republican members of the house commerce telecommunications subcommittee sent letter to the ustr citing ntts failure to institute fair cost based interconnection rates and criticizing the proposed verio purchase5 it is unclear whether the provisions of s 2793 hollings which strengthens the limits on the holding of and transfer of broadcast licenses and other telecommunications media to foreign persons or governments would apply to the ntt verio case since internet service providers do not need telecommunications license both ntt and ntt docomo are huge companies according to business week ranking of global corporations as of may 31 2000 ntt docomo was valued at 24724 billion which made it the worlds eighth largest company up from 27th in 1999 by market value ntt was fifteenth down from thirteenth in 1999 at market value of 18916

june 2000 p 8figure 1 ntts organization and plans for future internet tv and other servicesbackground in us economic relations with japan the united states has pursued multifaceted approach that has included encouraging major structural reform in japan to open more sectors to competition the global internet revolution has pushed internet access and the provision of internet service in japan to the forefront of concerns by us companies this is an area in which us providers are competitive and offer leading technologies since the denver g7 summit on june 19 1997 the united states and japan have been negotiating over various issues under the framework of the enhanced initiative on deregulation and competition policy with respect to the telecommunications sector under this initiative japan is to undertake specific new measures to introduce more competition into its 130 billion telecommunications market specifically japan is to ensure that interconnection rates the rates charged competitors of ntt to access the majority of japanese customers are set below retail rates define measures that will assure ntt docomos mobilecellular service provider interconnection rates are more fairly priced by being purely based on costs authorize an interconnection clearing house for new entrants in the japanese market which will dramatically speed market entry and liberalize the use of flexible network arrangements thus allowing businesses to build out their networks more rapidly and efficiently7 over the more than two years that the united states and japan have been negotiating over ntts inter connection rates the japanese position has been that ntts pricing policies are justified by its costs the us side however has pointed out that ntts method of calculating costs includes too many fixed costs that have already been incurred rather than using meth odology long run incremental cost model scheduled to be implemented by ntt by the end of 2000 that uses only futurehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20633crs4 8 us japan fail to agree on telecom deregulation expect new try inside us trade march 24 2000 internet edition 9 landers peter japan signals truce in us phone

broadband internet access background and issues by lennard g kruger and angele gilroycosts in calculating rates8 ntts argument that it requires more costly interconnection rates has been weakened considerably by the high rate of profit reported by its east regional telephone company9 the cost question also is muddied by ntts role as provider of universal telephone service in japan as shown in figure 1 the ntt holding company is organized into ntt east and ntt west regional telecommunications companies ntt communications long distance and international and ntt docomo mobile cellular telecommunications under the regional telecom companies ntt plans to offer internet service ebusiness and tv broadcasting as profit seekingactivities an important question is to what extent ntt should have to provide services to customers in remote areas at the same price charged those in cities as it has traditionally done for telephone services the amount ntt charges other companies to connect to its lines in urban areas determines to some extent the funds it will have available to subsidize highcost remote connections figure 1 also shows ntts plans for future provision of profitseeking activities in the internet and in broadband services tv broadcasting this is where interconnection fees would become critical for foreign companies hooking into ntts transmission system the company

market on an equitable basis and in accord with japans obligations under the world trade organization as part of the deregulation of japanese companies governmentmandated divisions and governmentsanctioned monopolies have been disappearing in the case of ntt it had held domestic monopoly on the provision of telephone services but it also had been barred from doing international business done by kdd kokusai denshin denwa among the major carriers in the world it is the only one that has not developed international operations ntt now is attempting to become global power hence its recent deals to acquire foreign telecommunications companieshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20633crs5 table 1 lists foreign acquisitions and the establishment of overseas subsidiaries by ntt as is apparent ntt is attempting to establish worldwide network through focusing on asia and on the more industrialized economies of the world it is in the us interest to ensure that us and other companies have comparable access to japans home telecommunications market as ntt has in us and other telecommunications markets in the world monitoring japans compliance with the july 2000 agreement pressure on japan to further deregulate its telecommunications sector and if necessary for the united states to take unsettled issues before the dispute resolution mechanism of the world trade organization is the
