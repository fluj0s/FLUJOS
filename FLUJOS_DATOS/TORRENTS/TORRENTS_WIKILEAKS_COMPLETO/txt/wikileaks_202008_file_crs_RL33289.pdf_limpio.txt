social security plays an important role in reducing poverty not only among the aged but among children as well children may be eligible for social security benefits when parent who is covered worker dies becomes disabled or retires in addition to receiving social security in their own right children may economically benefit from social security by living with other family members receiving benefits based on congressional research service crs analysis of us census bureau survey of income and program participation sipp data in january 2005 an estimated 65 million children lived in families in which one or more family members received social securitynearly 9 of all children of this number an estimated 41 million were either child beneficiaries in their own right or lived with parent or guardian who reported receiving social security the remaining 24 million children lived in families in which social security was received only by extended family members eg grandparents aunts uncles nieces or nephews or other family members adult siblings for the former group social securitys effect on child poverty is more directly related to social security policy whereas for the latter group social securitys effect on child poverty is more directly related to childrens incidental family living arrangements children living in families who receive social s ecurity are only slightly more likely to be poor than other children in january 2005 225 of the 65 million children living in families in which social security benefits were received were estimated to be poor nearly 15 million compared to 220 of children in families in which social security was received children estimated to have received social security benefits on their own behalf andor to live with parent or guardian who received social security were more likely to be poor 260 than children who incidently were living in families in which social security is received only by extended family members eg grandparent aunt uncle or adult sibling 162 social security benefits lifted an estimated 13 million children above the official poverty line in january 2005 among children in families that received social security an estimated 421 2737 million would have been considered poor based on family income other than social security the addition of social security to family income reduces the incidence of poverty among these children to 225 1459 million in january 2005 its estimated that over one in every three social security dollars paid to families with children helped children who otherwise would be counted as poor social security benefits paid on behalf of children andor their parents or guardians amounted to nearly 25 billion in january 2005 or nearly 295 billion on an annualized basis of this amount little over 43 or 128 billion on an annualized basis went to families who would have been considered poor based on their pretransfer income ie excluding social security which is more than double the estimated 52 billion in federal cash welfare sp ending under the temporary assistance for needy families tanf program in fy2005 this report will not be updated

administrative data provide broad overview of the numbers of individuals receiving social security benefits and the type and amount of benefits received they provide little information about the characteristics of individuals receiving benefits or the importance of social security to individual and family economic wellbeing in order to address questions relating to the income and poverty status of families in which children live and the impact of social security benefits on income and poverty status of families with children other data sources must be used for this analysis us census

interview representative sample of families every four months over 48month period from february 2004 to january 2008 the sipp collects detailed information on family composition labor force participation income and program participation among families and their members in each of the 48 months they are included in the survey the analysis presented in this report relies on sipp data for january 2005 the latest month in common from data released for the full sipp sample1 appendix further describes the methodology used in this report crs analysis of sipp data for january 2005 indicates that among an estimated 73 million children under age 18 of which an estimated 65 million 88 lived in families in which one or more family members received social securityover twice the number of children estimated to receive social security benefits directly 31 million based on the administrative data discussed above as discussed in greater detail in appendix which describes the methodology used in this report it is not possible to precisely identify the social security beneficiary status of children on the sipp among the 65 million children living in families that received social security in january 2005 based on sipp data an estimated 28 million 43 were in families in which social security was reported as having been received on behalf of at least one of the children in the family see figure 1 as noted appendix most but not all of these 28 million children are probably child beneficiaries another 13 million 21 lived in families where parent or guardian reported receiving social security benefits though not directly on behalf of child these 41 million children are grouped together in analyses that follow as child beneficiaries and children of parents or guardians that receive social security the remaining 24 million children 36 lived in families where social security was received by someone other than child or the childrens parents or guardians in such cases social security benefits may have been received by an extended family member eg grandparent aunt or uncle cousin niece or nephew or an older adult sibling for this latter group children may incidently be affected by social security but not directly as matter of policy aimed at them 1 the sipp is designed such that the census bureau interviews survey respondents in waves wave represents set of interviews staggered over fourmonth period with approximately onequarter of the sample being interviewed in each month for example in wave 1 of the 2004 sipp pa nel onequarter of the sample was initially interviewed in february 2004 recounting labor force participation income and program participation information in the previous four months october 2003 through january 2004 another quarter of the sample was initially interviewed in march 2004 recounting information from november 2003 through february 2004 the final interviews for wave 1 were conducted in may 2004 collecting recounted information for the period from january 2004 through april 2004 consequently for wave 1 january 2004 is the first month of data in common among the full sipp sample as of january 2008 the census bureau has released data from the first four waves of the 2004 sipp panel first interviews for wave 4 were conducted in february 2005 collecting information from october 2004 through january 2005 and final interviews in may 2005 collecting information from january through april 2005 consequently the last month in common among the full sipp sample in wave 4 is january 2005 which represents the data presented in this report httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33289g21g152g140g146g138g149g561g21g142g140g158g155g146g157g162g514g156g561g7g143g143g142g140g157g561g152g151g561g5g145g146

at first appearance there is little difference in the overall poverty status2 of children living in families that receive social security and those living in families that do not however differences become more apparent between children living in families in which social security is received on behalf of children andor parentsguardians and those living in families in which social security is received only by extended or other family members also the afterthefact comparison of poverty status by family social security receipt doesnt take into account the effect that social security itself has in reducing poverty for such purposes poverty status of children must be estimated both before and after counting families income from social security figure 2 shows the poverty status of children based on total family income as multiples of us census bureau poverty income thresholds the figure shows for example that 212 of all 2 for statistical purposes under the official us poverty definition an individual is counted as poor if hisher family cash pretax income is below specified poverty income th resholds which vary by family size and composition in 2005 for example the applicable annual income poverty threshold for single parent under age 65 with one child was 13461 and for married couple with two children 19806 for purposes of counting the poor families are defined as consisting of all persons living in household who are related by blood marriage or adoption for such purposes families may consist of parent or parents and th eir children but may also include other related family members such as childrens grandparents aunts uncles nieces and nephews if living together in the same household

one way to gauge the effect of social security on childrens poverty status is to estimate poverty by excluding social security from family inco and comparing the result to the extent of poverty when social security is added back into family income figures 3 through 5 depict childrens pre and posttransfer poverty status for children in families that receive social security compared to children in families that dont figure 3 for example compares all children whereas figure 4 compares only children who are child beneficiaries or live in families where the parents or guardians received social security figure 5 compares children who are in families where only extended or other family members other than children parents or guardians reported receiving social security with children in families where social security was reported the comparison of pretransfer poverty status based on measure of family

to posttransfer poverty status which includes the social security benefits families received provides one indication of social securitys effect on reducing child poverty figure 3 shows for example that 421 of children living in families that received social security would have been considered poor based on their families incomes from sources other than social security when social security is added back into these families incomes child poverty is cut nearly in half to 225a level just slightly above that of children living in families that do not receive social security 210 on this basis social security lifted nearly 13 million children 1278 million above the poverty line in january 2005 see table 2 it should be noted that this effect is limited to just the 65 million children that are in families that received social security which noted earlier amounts to just about 9 of all children if one examines the relative effect of social security on the poverty status of all 73 million children in the us overall the effect appears much more modest see table 2 in all 16729 million children were estimated as being poor in january 2005 on pretransfer basis or 229 of all children the 1278 million reduction in the nu mber of poor children as result of counting social security benefits reduces the total number of poor children to about 15451 million resulting in 212 of all children being considered poora 17 percentage point or 76 decline while social security benefits received by families with children have the effect of reducing the incidence of child poverty to nearly the same level as that of children in families that dont receive benefits their equalizing effect is attenuated at somewhat higher income levels among children in families that receive social security 318 have family income below 125 of the poverty line compared to 272 of children in families that dont receive benefits among children in families that receive social security 412 have family incomes below 150 of the poverty line compared to 328 of children in families that do not receive social security see figure 3 figure 4 focuses on just the 41 million children who are classified as either child beneficiaries andor children whose parents or guardians received social security contrasted to the 24 million children who are in families where social security is received by only extended family or other family members other than child parent or guardian figure 5 the former group has much higher pretransfer poverty rate 491 than does the latter group 299 in families where social security benefits are received on behalf of children or by parents or guardians social security reduces their poverty rate from 491 to 260 rate that is still significantly higher than that of children in families that dont receive social security 210 in contrast for children living in families where social security is received only by extended or other family members social security reduces their poverty rate from 299 to 162 rate well below that of children in families that dont receive social security 210

going to childrens families based on their families pretransfer poverty status ie poverty based on total income excluding social security income that the family reports receiving the figure shows for example that based on sipp data families with children reported receiving over 38 billion in social security benefits in january 2005 or about 459 billion on an annualized basis of these benefits an estimated 364 nearly 14 billion or about 167 billion on an annualized basis went to families who were poor based on their total cash income excluding any social security benefits they received see table 3 thus over one out of every three social security dollars paid to families with children goes to children who would otherwise be counted as poor among families with child beneficiaries about 25 billion in social security benefits were reported in january 2005 about 295 billion on an annualized basis of this amount 433 about 11 billion or 128 billion on an annualized basis went to families that had total incomes excluding social security below the poverty line which is more than double the estimated 52 billion in federal cash welfare spending under the temporary assistance for needy families tanf program in fy2005 whereas tanf may be considered target efficient in terms of targeting the poor in that nearly all tanf dollars go to families that are poor on pretransfer pretanf basis

provide the comprehensive detail to precisely identify child beneficiaries it should also be noted that estimates of the pretransfer poverty status of children ie poverty status excluding social security from total income provide one measure of the relative importance of social security in combating poverty the pretransfer poverty estimates should not be confused with the full effects on

it is not possible to precisely identify the social security beneficiary status of children on the sipp the sipp collects information on social security receipt and the reasons for receipt for persons age 15 and over additionally it collects information about whether an adult defined as person age 15 and over collects social security on behalf of children under age 21 in such cases however it does not identify the specific ch ildren in the family for whom social security benefits are received nor the specific reasons benefits are received on childrens behalf in such cases it is uncertain whether all or only some children under 21 in the family are direct beneficiaries moreover some adults may include the childs portion of their social security benefit as their own without explicitly indicating that they received social security on behalf of child in total about 65 million children under age 18 were identified on the sipp in january 2005 as living in families in which social security benefits were reported either on their own behalf or on behalf of another family member in this analysis all children of parent or guardian who are under the age of 18 are identified as social security child beneficiaries if the childs parent or guardian reported that heshe received social security on behalf of child under age 21 in the family to some extent this method will overstate the number of children under age 18 who received social security as potentially some but not all children of the parent may be beneficiaries in their own right 3 in january 2005 an estimated 2758 million children under age 18 on the sipp were identified as social security child beneficiaries on the basis of parent or guardian indicating that they had received social security benefits on behalf of child another 48000 children ages 15 to 17 reported directly receiving social security on the sipp in january 2005 thus an estimated 2807 million children were identified on the sipp as potential social security child beneficiaries an additional 1332 million children lived with parent or guardian who reported receiving social security on the sipp in january 2005 but who did not indicate that benefits were received on behalf of child in some cases the benefits received by these parents or guardians may contain an allowance for beneficiary children that is not separately identified because of issues in identifying child beneficiaries on the sipp and the avenues by which they receive social security eg child survivor dependent of retiree or disabled worker the two groups mentioned above are combined for purposes of analysis as child beneficiaries and children of parents or guardians that receive social security these 41 million children are differentiated from the remaining 2361 million children who live in families in which social security was received only by extended family eg grandparents aunts uncles nieces or nephews or other family members adult sibling for the former group social securitys effect on child poverty is more directly related to social security policy whereas for the latter group 3 for example some children of the parent may be surviving children from previous marriage and others may be adopted stepchildren from current marriage in this case the children from the previous marriage might be eligible for survivors benefits but the adopted stepchildren from the current marriage would not
