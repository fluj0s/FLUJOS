affairs defense and trade division shirley kan specialist in national security policy foreign affairs defense and trade division congressional research service the library of congress european unions arms embargo on china implications and options for us policy summary the european union eu has been considering lifting its arms embargo on china which was imposed in response to the june 1989 tiananmen crackdown france germany and other eu members claim that the embargo hinders the development of strategic partnership with china the bush administration and members of congress strongly oppose an end to the eus arms embargo and urge stronger arms export controls the united states contends that engagement with china need not send the wrong signals on chinas human rights record and military buildup that threatens peaceful resolution of taiwan and other asian issues the eu argues that the arms embargo which is not legally binding is weak and largely symbolic indeed some eu members reportedly have allowed defense related exports to china under the arms embargo while such sales have raised questions about the effectiveness of the eus arms embargo on china they also point to the potential for future sales of military equipment or technology to china particularly without the political restraint of the embargo eu governments led by the united kingdom stress that if and when the embargo is overturned its end would be accompanied by stronger eu arms export control regime including an enhanced eu code of conduct on arms exports that will improve accountability and better control arms sales to china and elsewhere us critics however remain skeptical that even tighter eu code will contain sufficient enforcement and transparency mechanisms to dissuade eu countries from exporting advanced defense technologies that could enhance chinas military buildup and ultimately threaten common us european and asian interests in peace and stability all 25 eu member states must agree before the embargo can be overturned although many observers had expected that the eu would lift the embargo in the spring of 2005 some members grew hesitant amid vocal and highlevel us opposition especially since early 2005 those arguing against lifting the embargo have cited persistent human rights problems in china including refusal to reexamine the tiananmen crackdown and chinas adoption in march 2005 of its antisecession law warning of possible use of force against taiwan at present ending the arms embargo on china does not appear to be high on the eus agenda still the eu is politically committed to overturning the embargo and many observers believe that its end is ultimately only matter of time in the meantime us diplomacy could be effective and the disagreement presents chance for closer coordination of useuropean policies including those dealing with arms export controls and rising china overall there are two sets of questions for congress in examining us policy toward the fate of the eus arms embargo on china what are the implications for us interests in transatlantic relations and china if us interests are adversely affected what are some options for congress to discourage the eu from lifting its arms embargo on china and if it is lifted to protect us national security interests in both asia and europe issues raised by these questions are the

the 1990s 41 european unions arms embargo on china implications and options for us policy background policy dilemmas over the last two years the european union eu has been considering lifting its arms embargo on the peoples republic of china prc imposed after the june 1989 tiananmen square crackdown1 many countries imposed sanctions on china after deng xiaoping and other prc rulers ordered the military the peoples liberation army pla to violently suppress peaceful demonstrators in beijing on june 4 1989 although the killing of demonstrators took place beyond the tiananmen square in the capital of beijing the crackdown is commonly called the tiananmen crackdown in reference to the square that was the focal point of the nationwide prodemocracy movement the bush administration opposes an end to the eus arms embargo on china seeing it as relaxation in the eus human rights and arms export policies toward china and out of step with us sanctions on arms sales to china that have remained since 1989 overall there are two sets of questions for congress in examining us policy toward this question what are the implications for us political and security interests concerning europe and china if us interests are adversely affected what are some options for congress to discourage the eu from lifting its arms embargo on china and if it is lifted to protect us national security interests the purpose of this crs report is to discuss us concerns and implications for us interests as the eu considers the future of the arms embargo as well as options for us policy given strenuous us objections there are concerns that decision made by the eu to expand engagement with china by lifting the arms embargo would negatively impact the transatlantic alliance if there is division in us and european approaches toward china and defense cooperation if the united states responds by restricting technology transfers to europe or defense procurement from europe at the same time the current disagreement presents an opportunity for closer coordination of useuropean policies including controls over militaryrelated exports and strategy towards china the united states has important interests in maintaining strong alliances with common approaches toward rising china 1 the 25 members of the eu are austria belgium cyprus the czech republic denmark estonia finland france germany greece hungary ireland italy latvia lithuania luxembourg malta the netherlands poland portugal slovakia slovenia spain sweden and the united kingdom also see crs report rs21372 the european union questions and answers by kristin archick crs2 like europe washington increasingly has engaged beijing on the economic political and military fronts fundamental issue then has been how engagement is pursued and whether it contributes to more responsible china in domestic and international affairs or aggravates developments in china with adverse implications for decades usprc relations have expanded with trade and cooperation on international issues there remain western concerns however about restrictions on human rights and democracy in china and about the impact of chinas weapons proliferation practices and military buildup on peace and stability in asia and other regions around the world because some european companies have transferred defenserelated systems to china under the arms embargo that is not legally binding the united states has called for the eu to maintain the embargo and strengthen export controls there are fears that any acceleration of chinas military modernization with european defense technology would result in instability in the taiwan strait which could involve us military intervention this concern stems from one dilemma for us policy adherence to the one china policy since the nixon administration started secret talks with the prc in 1971 while maintaining diplomatic relations with the republic of china commonly called taiwan until 1979 and unofficial relations since then taiwan remains the major usprc issue that could bring the countries into conflict the 1979 taiwan relations act tra pl 968 governs us policy toward taiwan including offering arms to assist its selfdefense the tra did not commit the president and congress to determine any decision to intervene in the event of threats to taiwan other than to consider any nonpeaceful efforts to determine taiwans future of grave concern to the united states nonetheless among the stipulations of us policy the tra declared that it is us policy to maintain the capacity of the united states to resist any resort to force or other forms of coercion that would jeopardize the security or the social or economic system of the people on taiwan2 thus in addition to issues about arms sales to taiwan and the extent of any us commitment to help defend taiwan one question is whether the us forces have the capability to deter or defeat the pla not only in the event of use of force but also coercion against taiwan maintenance of crossstrait stability has required careful balance of ties with both the prc and taiwan there have been periodically heightened tensions between the prc and taiwan since the taiwan strait crisis of 19951996 sensitive assertions of separate national identity in taiwan since 1999 and president bushs articulation of stronger us support for taiwans selfdefense in 2001 later qualified by criticism of taiwans president in 2003 for perceived attempts to change the crossstrait status quo 2 see crs report rl30341 chinataiwan evolution of the one china policy key

effectiveness of the bush administrations diplomacy toward europe since 2004 us officials have pressured eu member states not to lift the arms embargo congress has supported this stance congress also has expressed concerns about policy toward china including promotion of human rights moreover congress has expressed increasing concerns about the plas modernization particularly following the military exercises and missile launches targeted against taiwan in 19951996 because many eu member states have narrowly interpreted the arms embargo as banning only lethal weapons some eu countries have sold defenserelated technology to china there is concern that without the arms embargo eu countries might sell additional dualuse technology andor weapons systems to china the pla could then employ european technology and weapons against us forces and friends in the event of conflict with china moreover there is concern about the potential for eu companies involved in useuropean defense cooperation to transfer us defense technology to china undermining us export controls and sanctions on arms sales to china in may 2004 the house passed its version of the national defense authorization act for fy2005 hr 4200 reported out of the house armed services committee which included provision to impose procurement sanctions against any foreign person that transfers certain military items to china also see section on legislation below in early 2005 senator richard lugar warned that the technology the us shares with european allies could be in jeopardy if allies were sharing that through these commercial sales with the chinese3 senator joseph biden said that lifting the embargo is nonstarter with congress4 in the house representative henry hyde wrote that the choice for europe could not be clearer it is between policies that promote the development of democracy in china or those that support chinas military buildup and threaten us security interests5 at hearing of the senate foreign relations committee on march 16 2005 senator lugar cautioned that if european militaryrelated transfers to china rises markedly we should reassess sales to europe of our most critical military technology referring to chinas adoption two days earlier of its antisecession law threatening the use of force against taiwan and raising crossstrait tensions senator lugar counseled that this is time to be taking steps that might either help china achieve decisive military advantage over taiwan or send the wrong political signal likewise senator biden urged the europeans to maintain the embargo as well as strengthen the code of conduct on arms sales particularly given the timing 3 edward alden and demetri sevastopulo lugar threat on eu arms sales to china

modernization of artillery ammunition production facilities modernization of avionics in f8 fighters called the peace pearl program sale of four mark46 antisubmarine torpedoes and sale of four antpq37 artillerylocating radars8 however in response to the tiananmen crackdown the united states suspended militarytomilitary contacts and arms sales first imposed by president george hw bush on june 5 1989 the ban on arms sales was later codified among sanctions passed in section 902 of the foreign relations authorization act for fys 1990 and 1991 pl 101246 approved in february 1990 faced with the sanctions in april 1990 china canceled the peace pearl program to upgrade the avionics of the f8 fighters9 in december 1992 president bush decided to close out the four suspended fms programs

committee13 the eus arms embargo on china european countries took action that corresponded to steps taken by the united states in june 1989 to respond to the tiananmen crackdown the eu arms embargo on china is based on one sentence in political declaration issued on june 27 1989 by the then12 member european community the eus precursor the declaration condemns the brutal repression taking place in china requests that the chinese authorities cease executions and respect human rights and contains measures agreed by the member states these include the suspension of military cooperation and highlevel contacts reduction of cultural scientific and technical cooperation programs and the prolongation of visas to chinese students the specific wording of the arms restrictions on china calls for interruption by the member states of the community of military cooperation and an embargo on trade in arms with china14 while the eus june 1989 declaration on china is not legally binding it represents political commitment that all eu members are supposed to uphold and enforce15 each eu member however defines and implements the arms embargo differently this has allowed some eu countries to continue to export certain types of military equipment to china despite the embargo according to the eu the embargo does not cover large proportion of sensitive items which are covered by other eu legal mechanisms16 these ongoing sales to china have raised questions about the effectiveness of the eus arms embargo on china and the eus wider defense export control policies 12 crs report rl33001

february 2005 httpeuropaeuintcommexternal_relationsusbushchinapdf crs6 current status prc pressure on the eu to end embargo since 2003 china has been increasing pressure on the eu to end the embargo in october 2003 china issued its policy paper on the eu urging the eu to lift its arms embargo in order to remove barriers to greater bilateral cooperation in defense industries and technology17 the eu began reexamining the arms embargo in early 200418 france and germany were key drivers of this review process the euchina summit on december 8 2004 came three days before crucial elections in taiwan for which its president campaigned unsuccessfully to win majority for his coalition in the legislature that some feared would lead to constitutional changes considered by beijing to provocatively push for jure independence the eu decided to maintain the embargo at that sensitive time although it asserted its political intention to continue to work towards lifting the embargo china welcomed this positive signal for development of the comprehensive strategic partnership with the eu19 the decision to end the eu arms embargo rests with the member states of the union and requires unanimity in other words all member states of the now25 member eu must agree before the arms embargo can be lifted at the december 16 17 2004 meeting of eu heads of state and government in brussels eu leaders reaffirmed the political will to continue to work toward lifting the arms embargo20 the eu did not state firm date for ending the embargo but statements by eu officials strongly suggested that the embargo would be lifted in the spring of 2005 france and germany under the previous leadership of german chancellor gerhard schroeder have been key proponents of ending the eu arms embargo on china other member states have been more hesitant the united kingdom uk and the netherlands have shared us concerns about the strategic implications of an end to the embargo while some of the scandinavian countries and other smaller states with strong human rights advocacy policies have also been less enthusiastic but by early 2005 sufficient consensus appeared to have been built up among eu members to lift the embargo in may or june 2005 the willingness of the uk and others to overturn the embargo appeared based on their view that the embargo itself was largely ineffective and that it would only be lifted if stronger eu export control regime was put in place at the same time some observers also suggest that london was eager to burnish its european credentials and keen to avoid another fight with paris and berlin so soon after their rift over the war in iraq however the eu did not move ahead with lifting the embargo in the spring of 2005 eu officials attribute the delay largely to the prcs antisecession law 17 xinhua new china news agency october 13 2003 18 eu business december 12 2003 craig smith france makes headway in push to permit arms sales to china new

httpueeuintuedocscms_datadocspressdataenec83201pdf crs7 warning of the use of force against perceived efforts at establishing taiwans independence on march 14 2005 china adopted its antisecession law declaring in article 8 that if the separatist forces of taiwan independence use any name or any means to cause the fact of taiwans separation from china or major incident occurs that would lead to taiwans separation from china or the possibilities of peaceful unification are completely exhausted the country may adopt nonpeaceful means and other necessary measures to safeguard national sovereignty and territorial integrity21 the european union quickly criticized this antisecession law stating that the eu opposes any use of force and asks all parties to avoid any unilateral action which might rekindle tensions22 uk foreign secretary jack straw stated that the new prc law created quite difficult political environment23 the prc move appeared to strengthen us arguments that lifting the embargo could send the wrong signal to beijing and that pla possibly equipped with improved euprovided defense technologies could pose threat to taiwan and us forces in asia highlevel eu delegation to washington in midmarch 2005 failed to convince us officials and members of congress that existing eu plans for tighter export controls would sufficiently constrain arms sales to china strong us opposition and lingering human rights concerns about china also caused some eu members to consider postponing the decision on the arms embargo24 as result ending the arms embargo on china does not appear to be high on the eus agenda for the near to medium term the new german government of chancellor angela merkel which assumed office in november 2005 is perceived as being much less enthusiastic about lifting the embargo especially without us consent than the previous schroeder government the united states and the eu have also begun strategic dialogue on china and other asian security issues however many analysts point out that the eu remains politically committed to lifting the embargo and believe that its end may ultimately be only matter of time china continues to maintain that the eus arms ban is outdated and should be lifted eu officials stress that if and when the embargo is lifted its end would be accompanied by the simultaneous introduction of package of measures including 21 translation of portion of chinas antisecession law adopted on march 14 2005 22 council of the european union declaration by the presidency on behalf of the european union

york times march 22 2005 crs8 an enhanced eu code of conduct on arms exports to curtail more effectively european arms sales to china and elsewhere and to address us concerns25 administrations position on the embargo the bush administration has opposed an end to the eus arms embargo on china based on two major points the first argument is that chinas human rights violations that formed the basis for the embargo still exist the second is that any expanded eu defense sales to china would damage us security interests the us national interests threatened by lifting of the arms embargo deal with security and valueprojection especially human rights and democracy whether the eus arms embargo is significant or symbolic lifting it would reduce the leverage of the united states and europe on china to improve its human rights situation from the viewpoint of us concerns relaxation would send signal to china that it can continue to violate international standards of human rights and that the united states rather than china is increasingly isolated in its views the pressure would also lessen on the rulers in beijing to reexamine the tiananmen crackdown since the late 1990s the united states has urged china to ratify and adhere to the international covenant on civil and political rights26 on the eve of the euchina summit in december 2004 china acknowledged that it was still studying how to ratify the covenant27 on january 28 2004 state department spokesman acknowledged that the united states had held seniorlevel discussions with france and other eu countries about the issue of whether to lift the embargo on arms sales to china he said certainly for the united states our statutes and regulations prohibit sales of defense items to china we believe that others should maintain their current arms embargoes as well we believe that the us and european prohibitions on arms sales are complementary were imposed for the same reasons specifically serious human rights abuses and that those reasons remain valid today28 the bush administration reportedly also lodged diplomatic protests with eu members29 at hearing of the house international relations committee in february 2004 representative steve chabot asked secretary of state colin powell about the eus reconsideration of the arms embargo against china as supported by france powell responded that he raised this issue with the foreign ministers of france ireland united kingdom and germany and expressed opposition to change in the eus policy at that time in light of the plas missiles arrayed against

january 28 2004 29 philip pan us pressing eu to uphold arms embargo against china washington post january 31 2004 crs9 referendums on sensitive political issues then planned in taiwan and chinas human rights conditions30 state department spokesman argued on january 25 2005 that the united states would continue to champion human rights in countries whether they are small or big and that chinas human rights situation not only has not improved but has suffered some negative developments31 on february 28 2005 the state department issued its report on human rights in 2004 it reported that chinas human rights record remained poor and the government continued to commit numerous and serious abuses although it amended the constitution to mention human rights for the first time moreover authorities were quick to suppress religious political and social groups that they perceived as threatening to government authority or national stability especially before sensitive dates such as the 15th anniversary of the 1989 tiananmen massacre and other significant political and religious occasions the prc government also used the international war on terrorism as pretext for cracking down harshly on suspected uighur separatists expressing peaceful political dissent and on independent muslim religious leaders32 however there is an apparent inconsistency in the administrations claim that the eu is not taking into adequate consideration chinas human rights conditions on march 17 2005 china released uighur woman named rebiya kadeer whom china arrested in 1999 in xinjiang and on the same day the state department announced that the administration decided not to introduce resolution on chinas human rights abuses at the human rights commission in geneva citing some significant steps on human rights the state department acknowledged that kadeers impending release was factor in the decision the decision raised question about whether it undermined the us position that the eu should not end the arms embargo because of human rights concerns the state department responded that the embargo was imposed because of the tiananmen crackdown and there are hundreds of demonstrators that remain imprisoned and there is complete unwillingness to revisit or examine that incident in critical light so with regard to the conditions leading to the embargo those have not changed at all period33 regarding this us argument chinas government remains unmoved in its position that it was justified in using military force in the tiananmen crackdown the state departments report on human rights noted that the prc government outlawed public commemoration of the 1989 tiananmen massacre zhao ziyang the prc premier at the time of the tiananmen crackdown who was put under house 30 house international

hundreds of the former leaders of the 1989 prodemocracy movement relatives of victims of the crackdown and other activists wrote letter to secretarygeneral of the council of the european union and the president of the european commission contending that the human rights situation in china has not undergone any fundamental change since 1989 moreover they warned that doing away with this sanction without corresponding improvements in human rights would send the wrong signal to the chinese people including especially those of us who lost loved ones who are persecuted and for all chinese who continue to struggle for the ideal that inspired the 1989 movement35 in early february 2005 newlyappointed secretary of state condoleezza rice visited brussels and expressed opposition to lifting the arms embargo on china and optimism that the europeans are listening to our concerns she cited concerns about human rights and the military balance with china in asia namely the transfer of technology that might endanger in some way the very delicate military balance while there are still american forces in the region36 later that month the administration carried out diplomacy at the highest level with european allies president bush visited brussels and cautioned that european defenserelated transfers would change the balance of relations between china and taiwan37 during rices first visit to asia in march 2005 since becoming secretary of state she publicly warned that because the us maintains military presence in the pacific region to support stable environment for economic growth and democratic development anything that would appear to try and alter that balance would be of concern to us she expressed concerns about the rise of chinas military spending and potential military power with its increasing sophistication rice stated that the european union should do nothing to contribute to circumstance in which chinese military modernization draws on european technology or even the political decision to suggest that it could draw on european technology when in fact it is the united states not europe that has defended the pacific38 34 robert marquand zhao remembered but

minister continued crs11 nonetheless there are questions about the effectiveness of us leverage and diplomacy in part because of perceived mixed messages in the policy of engagement toward china including the decision not to introduce resolution at the human rights commission also while the united states has provided support to taiwans selfdefense it has adhered to the one china policy of working with the prc on range of international issues with north korean nuclear weapons frequently cited as common problem the united states also pursues permanent normal trade relations and significant trade with china now ranked as the third largest us trading partner but with 2005 us trade deficit of 203 billion in chinas favor39 there are questions about whether us policy actually has promoted crossstrait stability democracy and human rights in china40 the tone in policy toward taiwan changed from president bushs declaration in april 2001 that the united states would do whatever it took to help taiwan defend herself to his criticism in december 2003 stated next to the visiting prc premier of taiwans leader for attempting to change the status quo some say the administration has paid greater attention to arms sales to taiwan than promotion of crossstrait dialogue41 us criticism of european defense trade with china has been publicly harsher than that of russian or israeli sales to china successive presidents have issued waivers of us arms sanctions as discussed above still the administration argues that us engagement with china does not contribute dangerously to the plas buildup chinas accelerated military buildup on the eve of the euchina summit in december 2004 chinas foreign ministry asserted that the eus arms embargo should be ended because it represented political discrimination against china china argued that its demand on the eu to lift the arms embargo had nothing to do with buying massive weapons from the eu since china has neither the capacity nor the intention to do so42 nonetheless if the eu lifts its arms embargo on china there are us concerns that this step could increase chinas leverage if there are more competing bidders increase

donald rumsfeld further stressed the implications of an end of the eus arms embargo the report cautioned that the consequences would be serious and numerous china would be able to improve current weapon systems and indigenous industrial capabilities for future advanced weapons the pla would have greater interactions with european militaries and access to military software eg operational doctrine training logistics china would seek joint ventures with european companies to acquire expertise and technology acquisition of european defense technology would significantly improve pla capabilities in the medium to long term china would seek to acquire advanced space technology radar systems early warning aircraft submarine technology and advanced electronic components for precision guided weapons the prc would have greater leverage over russia and israel the pentagon warned that such an acceleration of chinas military modernization would have direct implications for stability in the taiwan strait and the safety of us personnel it would also accelerate shift in the regional balance of power affecting the security of many countries67 eu perspectives both political and economic considerations have been driving eu proclivities toward lifting the arms embargo on china however eu policymakers argue that the current eu arms embargo on china is largely symbolic and weak its end they assert will pave the way for strengthened eu arms export control regime including revised and enhanced eu code of conduct on arms exports that will be more effective in controlling arms sales not only to china but also globally political motivations68 the eu is seeking to develop strategic partnership with china the eu views china as rising political and economic power whose policies will have implications for global challenges ranging from weapons proliferation to environmental degradation the eu believes that engagement with china on such issues would be mutually beneficial and hopes to further entrench china in the international system this is as true for the uk and other eu member states that have been more hesitant about lifting the arms embargo on china as it is for france germany and others that are more supportive some european leaders seem convinced that china shares their desires for strong united nations and world governed by multilateral rules and institutions 66

rs21372 the european union questions and answers by kristin archick crs19 us critics contend that few eu members such as france are eager to engage more robustly with china in order to promote their vision of multipolar world observers point out that china has made concerted attempt to talk to the eu as an entity in recent years and that this effort contrasts sharply with the perception of us ambivalence toward further european integration and an enhanced eu role in international affairs most european officials reject the notion that the eu is seeking to counterbalance the united states however the eu views forging external relationships with other major powers such as china as key part of building its common foreign and security policy cfsp and boosting the eus role as an actor on the world stage69 many european policymakers perceive the arms embargo on china as hindrance to developing closer euchina ties they concede that ending the embargo is the price demanded by china in order to deepen euchina relations but many agree with the chinese position that the arms embargo lumps china in with other nations such as burma and zimbabwe which are also subject to eu arms embargoes and thus sends negative signal about the state of euchina relations eu leaders argue that lifting the embargo on china would be politically symbolic act and that it would remove psychological barrier to improved relations with china they stress repeatedly that their intention in lifting the embargo is not to sell more arms to china in january 2005 javier solana the eus high representative for cfsp stated that lifting the arms embargo on china will be more political decision than military one it simply involves putting stop to political decision made at specific time in the history of china rather than modification of military relations between the eu and china it does not mean increasing arms exports70 chinas human rights record remains concern for many eu member states but others argue that china has evolved since 1989 and that the eu has engaged china in meaningful human rights dialogue since 1996 they point out that the generation of leaders that ordered the tiananmen crackdown is longer in power and they doubt that the eu arms embargo on china has made difference on human rights conditions in china the european parliament opposes lifting the arms embargo on human rights grounds also but the parliament has role in the decision which rests solely with the member states71 the eu asserts that it will continue to pressure china to improve respect for human rights and the rule of law despite any eventual end to the embargo 69 reginald dale transatlantic dispute over arming china international herald tribune july 15 2005 robin niblett the united

nonbinding opinions on foreign affairs issues for more information see crs report rs21998 the european parliament by kristin archick crs20 commercial interests eu commercial interests are also at play some us officials believe that france and germany among other member states have been pushing to lift the arms ban chiefly to increase defense sales to china as noted previously total eu arms licensed for export to china have increased in recent years given that european defense companies are more dependent on arms exports than their us counterparts many analysts believe that some european leaders are eager to gain greater access to chinas growing defense market some observers suggest that european frustration with what they view as limited opportunities in the us defense market is fueling european interest in the chinese defense market french officials argue that european sales of weapons technologies to china could slow beijings efforts to develop its own capabilities72 on the other hand some defense experts point out that eu companies and countries will have to weigh the benefits of selling arms to china against possible losses in the us defense market especially if congress were to impose restrictions on us procurement efforts from eu member states as result73 also see the section on transatlantic relations below some europeans bristle at us concerns regarding their potential arms sales to china they point out that washington is far less critical of russian or israeli arms exports to the prc they also note that australia lifted its arms embargo on china in 1992 and canada never imposed one following the tiananmen crackdown but us policymakers have not taken these countries to task many observers assert that nonmilitary economic objectives such as deepening the eus foreign investment profile and closing the eus trade deficit with china are also key motivating factors for several eu member states they hope that lifting the embargo will encourage favorable procurement decisions by prc authorities in areas such as commercial aircraft automotives civil engineering and transportation infrastructure for example analysts point out that chinas orders are crucial to the success of europeanowned airbus a380 civilian jumbo jet and prc leaders have reportedly linked more orders for the a380 to an end to the arms ban at the same time some europeans suspect that us economic interests and concerns about growing european competition especially in the commercial aircraft sector might be motivating some us opposition to an end to the eus arms embargo on china74 72 peter spiegel and john thornhill france urges end to china arms embargo financial times february 15 2005 73 william matthews wholl get hurt defense news march 14 2005 74 niblett op cit

february 24 2005 discussions with european eu and us officials crs21 symbolic embargo in any case eu officials argue that the eus current arms embargo on china is far from watertight and many view it as largely worthless they point out that the language in the eus 1989 political declaration calling for the embargo is extremely vague and each member state defines and implements it differently many countries including the uk and france have interpreted the embargo narrowly to cover lethal military items but have continued to supply avionics radar and other military related equipment nor does the embargo apply to dualuse items that can be used for both civil and military purposes75 nevertheless some defense experts and us officials claim that the embargo has exerted restraining influence on many member states and thus has prevented sales to china of weapons systems such as fighters and submarines european officials claim that they have intention of selling their next generation weapons systems to china even if the embargo is lifted french defense minister michele alliotmarie has asserted that we dont sell our stateoftheart technologies to just anyone76 some defense analysts however believe that an end to the eu embargo could cause ripple effect in this view other countries already selling to china such as israel may be compelled to sell even more advanced or hightech items to china in order to remain competitive with european sellers77 the eus code of conduct and arms export control regime78 eu officials also stress that the arms embargo is neither the only nor the principal mechanism governing member states military exports to china member states maintain their own national export controls and in 1998 they agreed on the eu code of conduct on arms exports79 the code sets out eight criteria for eu members to utilize when reviewing license requests and making decisions on whether or not to make an arms export these can be summarized as follows 1 consistency of export with international commitments arising from eu or the organization for security and cooperation in europe osce arms embargoes 2 risk that export would be used for internal repression or where the recipient country has engaged in serious violations of human rights 3 risk that export would provoke or prolong armed conflicts 4 risk of recipient using export to undermine regional peace and security 75 judy dempsey britain seeks to tighten rules on arms to china international herald tribune march 9 2005 interviews of european eu and us officials 76 craig smith in us visit french envoy

purchaser to fight terrorism and uphold international law 7 risk of diversion to third parties or to terrorist organization 8 risk that export would undermine the sustainable development of the recipient country in june 2000 the eu adopted common list of military equipment covered by the eu code in an effort to encourage standardization across the union80 the eu asserts that the code is intended to complement national arms export control legislation adopted by member states some eu members such as germany have also reportedly translated the code into their national legislation the code also applies to dualuse goods if the enduser may be the recipient countrys police or military forces in addition eu member states exports of dual use items are governed by an eu regulation that is directly applicable in eu member states it establishes requirements that must be met and procedures to be followed for granting export licenses for dualuse goods in june 2003 eu members also established common rules to control arms brokering to prevent circumvention of eu or osce embargoes on arms exports and the criteria established in the eu code it calls on member states to put in place legal norms for lawful brokering activities including obtaining written authorization prior to engaging in arms brokering and to keep records for least 10 years81 many europeans argue that the 1998 code of conduct has been much more instrumental in blocking arms sales to china including hightech and dualuse exports than has the 1989 arms embargo because the code spells out specific criteria and sets up denial notification and consultation mechanism and other arms sales reporting requirements these measures they claim exert considerable peer pressure on the member states to abide by the code for example under the denial notification procedure member states are required to transmit through diplomatic channels information on licenses refused and reasons for the denial before member state authorizes license for the same transaction that has already been refused by another member state it must first consult the member state that rejected the license if member state decides to issue the license it must inform the state that refused to grant authorization nevertheless numerous analysts have criticized the code for containing several weaknesses and loopholes that militate against the code being strong regime in its current form for example some point out that although the code sets up denial notification procedure there is requirement for notification of licenses granted many also say that the codes general reporting requirements do not provide 80 the eus common list of military equipment was updated in november 2003 see httpeuropaeuintcommexternal_relationscfspsanctionscommonlistpdf 81 the eus regulation that governs exports of dualuse items is council regulation ec 13342000

httpeuropaeuintcommexternal_relationscfspsanctions468pdf crs23 sufficient transparency or accountability the code calls on each member state to prepare confidential annual report which is to be circulated by each member to the other eu states on its defense exports and implementation of the code consolidated public report is subsequently produced based on the submissions of individual eu members however the complete details of actual arms exports made by eu states are not set out in this public document although it does provide values of arms export licenses issued and values of deliveries made if available by the exporting country supplier list is also provided giving total of sales denials made but not what specific weapon sale was denied nor to whom consequently some analysts say that the codes reporting requirements do not provide full or clear picture of all eu arms exports this in turn fuels suspicions that some eu member states may be understating the extent of defense deals already taking place with china furthermore critics argue that individual states have different arms trade licensing data collecting and reporting practices so there is often lack of uniformity in reporting across the membership of the eu for example the eus 2003 public report on the codes implementation breaks down the export data by eu common military list category for those states whose licensing systems categorize their arms export licenses in detail it is possible to get sense of what general types of military equipment are being licensed however the uk provides detailed breakdown of its licenses because the way its standard export licenses are valued in its national licensing system currently preclude this the same is true for italy and the czech republic france and germany are able to break down the categories of their licenses for purposes of the eu report82 another complaint that some us critics level against the code is that it is neither legally binding nor enforceable they are skeptical of eu arguments that the code represents an effective politically binding commitment or that its reporting requirements dissuade member states from financially profitable arms exports as evidence they point to the increase in eu arms sales licenses to china over the last few years eu officials maintain that although the code is not legally binding it is not voluntary either all member states have agreed and are expected to implement the common foreign policy goals and moral imperative embodied in the code some analysts suggest that the code should be transformed into an eu common position in the context of the eus common foreign and security policy the treaty on european union the maastricht treaty states that member states shall ensure that their national policies conform to the common positions83 they believe this would lend added credibility to the code and would effectively require its 82 the eus annual reports on the code of conduct are published in the official journal of the european union links to all of the annual reports may be found on the eus website httpueeuintcms3_foshowpageaspid408langenmodeg for critique of

enforcement would still be up to the competent authorities in the eus member states which could leave some differences in terms of implementation across the union more importantly the decision to grant or deny any arms export would likely remain at the national discretion of each member as the current code states for the foreseeable future member state would be willing to cede sovereignty over its national export control policies to the union or to agree to sanctions scheme if one or more members were found noncompliant with the code in other situations in which eu members have agreed to enact penalties on their partners if they do not live up to their commitments as with the financial requirements set out in the eus stability and growth pact for the eus single currency member states have been reluctant to actually impose such penalties for political reasons however the eu is working to revise and strengthen the code to make it more effective arms export control tool with better builtin peer pressure mechanisms see below84 eu plans and other options as noted previously the united states opposes an end to the eus arms embargo on china and continues to urge the eu to maintain its embargo and strengthen export controls in the event that the eu opts to overturn the embargo eu officials insist that it will not lead to more arms sales to china they point out that at the eus december 2004 summit the eu pledged that any eventual eu decision to end the arms embargo on china should not result in an increase of arms exports from eu member states to china neither in quantitative nor qualitative terms this pledge has been dubbed the standstill clause in addition the eu announced plans to adopt revised code of conduct and new toolbox ie measures that will pertain to arms exports for countries like china that are emerging from an eu arms embargo both the revised code and the toolbox seek to improve consultation transparency and accountability among member states the united kingdom and some smaller member states with human rights concerns about china have been key drivers behind these efforts aimed at strengthening the code they claim that the eu arms embargo on china will not be lifted until there is agreement on more robust code and on the toolbox85 the strengthened code and the toolbox have reportedly been finalized at the technical level but await political approval from eu leaders86 publicly available details of the contents of both documents however are currently sketchy press reports and discussions with european officials suggest that provisions in the revised code will seek to tighten requirements for technology transfers and the export of dualuse goods and to clarify the codes annual reporting requirements for member states the toolbox is expected to call on member states to inform one another of defense export licenses granted as well as those denied to postembargo countries 84 interviews with european eu and us officials

httpwwweurunionorglegislatchinexpcontrsystsdoc crs25 the current code only requires notification of denials to establish baseline to judge whether some member states are violating the eus standstill clause on china the toolbox will also require eu member states to exchange information on all licenses approved and denied for the last five and three years respectively many observers however doubt the credibility of the eus standstill clause given what they view as strong european commercial interests in increasing arms sales to china they question how compliance with the standstill clause or even strengthened code of conduct will be measured or enforced they also remain skeptical that eu member states possess the political will to significantly improve the code or to increase informationsharing among themselves about their arms exports some member states have been resistant to sharing detailed information about licenses granted arguing that company confidentiality must be respected furthermore it is unclear how long the toolbox will apply some member states reportedly want its provisions requiring informationsharing on new licenses granted to be applicable for only few years perhaps three while other members have advocated that the toolbox should remain in place for decade at least87 eu officials hope that their efforts to strengthen their arms export control regime will address us concerns about lifting the arms embargo on china additional options the eu might consider to ameliorate us concerns include seek explicit commitments from china on human rights the eu claims it has been pressing china to ratify the uns 1976 international covenant on civil and political rights and for the release of chinese political prisoners press reports suggest that the eu may ask china for significant gesture on human rights as condition for lifting the embargo88 seek commitments from china on nonproliferation of weapons of mass destruction and an agreement from china that it will refrain from reexporting conventional arms and weapons systems obtained from eu member states establish sell list with the united states that would set out specific weapons and advanced

joschka fischer acknowledged to reporters that germany sees need for further discussion with china on human rights and on taiwan90 in his testimony to congress on april 14 2005 under secretary of state nicholas burns reported that the administration would soon begin strategic dialogue with the eu on the arms embargo on china and other asian security issues however he stressed that the talks would not be negotiation over terms for lifting the embargo implications for us interests transatlantic relations both us and european officials believe that the eus lifting of its arms embargo on china could torpedo recent useuropean efforts to revitalize the transatlantic relationship if the eu ends the embargo and us policymakers remain unconvinced that the eus strengthened export control regime will sufficiently constrain european arms sales to china some in washington may take it as sign that the eu cannot be trusted to be responsible security partner given that 19 eu member states are also nato allies this could worsen useuropean tensions within the alliance amid transatlantic divisions over the war with iraq and other foreign policy disputes number of us officials and experts question the extent to which the european allies share us interests and threat perceptions decision by 19 nato allies to lift the eus arms embargo on china in the absence of stronger eu arms export control regime may further erode washingtons confidence in natos value or the allies willingness to join with the united states in sharing the security burden not only within but also outside of europe on the other hand if the eu succeeds in creating more robust arms export control regime with greater accountability and transparency that is more effective than the current embargo in curtailing arms sales to china this may help to better protect us interests in the 89 continued discussions with european officials 90 eu to consider lifting arms sales ban on china dow jones newswiresap january 26 2004 crs27 region and demonstrate to us skeptics that the european allies are committed to being credible and reliable security partners lifting the embargo in order to pave the way for closer euchina ties may also heighten us concerns that the eu is seeking to create multipolar world to constrain us influence eu members argue that they are not trying to strengthen china in order to balance or rival the united states european policymakers admit that they did not adequately anticipate us strategic concerns about ending the embargo but that they are now trying to address us worries at the same time some europeans bristle at such vocal us opposition because in their view the bush administration has appeared uninterested until recently in consulting with or listening to its longtime allies on range of international issues from iraq to climate change they also worry that washingtons attempts to encourage one or more eu member states to veto ending the arms embargo on china may hinder eu efforts to develop more common foreign policy some us and european officials and defense companies are concerned that if the eu moves ahead with ending the arms ban on china this could impede us european defense cooperation on weapons systems and technology transfers over the years the united states has developed defense arrangements with individual eu members states either by the direct sales of us defense articles defense services and military technology to them or by engaging in joint cooperative ventures in the defense area overturning the eu embargo on china would probably increase us fears that military equipment or sensitive weapons technologies sold to or shared with european countries might be reexported to china consequently should the united states decide to impose severe restrictions on current or future sales or on defense cooperation due to concerns raised by the lifting of the eu arms embargo on china the effect on useu defense industrial cooperation and the quality and quantity of defense items sold to or purchased from eu countries could be significant these potential effects are illustrated by the following american sales of defense articles services and technology to individual states of the european union have been notable from 20002003 the united states concluded governmenttogovernment arms sale agreements with poland for 37 billion with greece for 33 billion with the united kingdom for 18 billion and with italy for 13 billion91 regarding potential future sales as an example the defense ministry of the united kingdom has estimated that in coming years the value of new business in the uk for american defense contractors could approach 13 billion this would be in addition to the defense supplies or programs for which american firms currently hold contracts92 us defense industries have expressed concerns about the implications for their business 91 for more information see crs report rl32689 us arms sales agreements with and deliveries to major clients 19962003 by richard f grimmett 92 information provided by the ministry of defense of the united kingdom crs28 prospects should the us place significant restrictions on their exports to eu nations93 between 2000 and 2004 the united states has imported from single member of the eu the united kingdom approximately 6 billion in defense products94 various eu member states are suppliers of defense articles to the united states for incorporation into us weapons systems the supply of these defense articles could be curtailed or ended should given eu states choose to do so in retaliatory response to us restrictions on military sales to them see the text box below for examples of such weapons systems and the eu members that supply these defense articles to the united states although the united states could generally find domestic sources for defense components currently received from eu member states this would require delays in production of given weapons systems and would increase costs until viable alternate us domestic sources were identified and qualified manufacturing facilities were created and placed under contract and production to existing quality standards was initiated in addition if the eu were to end its arms ban on china most observers believe that neither the bush administration nor congress would be likely to support exempting the uk or other eu member states from existing us arms export controls for several years efforts have been underway to exempt in particular the united kingdom from the requirements of section 38j of the us arms export control act aeca this has generally been referred to as seeking waiver from the international traffic in arms regulations itar95 under such an exemption unclassified defense items equipment and intellectual materials could be exported without the need for us export license the rationale for such an exemption has been that certain allied countries with proven records of strict arms export controls and common concerns about weapons proliferation should be permitted to obtain us defense articles and services with minimum of regulatory review prior to the recent controversy over the eu embargo on china the uk had not yet fully overcome congressional concerns about the nature of uk export controls including concerns about retransfer controls in october 2004 congress passed provision in the ronald w reagan national defense authorization act for fy2005 pl 108 375 that directs expedited processing of uk requests for the purchase of us defense articles or services but does not provide for waiver of their review under us law and regulations see the legislation section below for details 93 see for example matthews op cit 94 information provided by the ministry of defense of the united kingdom 95 section 38 of the arms export control act delegates authority to the president to promulgate regulations to govern the export and import of defense articles and defense services pursuant to this authority the president has created the international traffic in arms regulations itar which sets the rules and guidelines for us arms exports and contains the united states munitions list which in turn stipulates those items for which the us government must give approval prior to us company exporting any of them crs29 some speculate that european frustration with existing us export controls on sensitive weapons technologies may play role in the eu decision to lift or maintain the embargo they suggest that some european defense policymakers are doubtful that they would ever obtain itar waivers as result such european officials might feel that they have little to lose in this regard by agreeing to lift the eu arms embargo on china96 key us weapons systems with eu suppliers the patriot advanced capability pac3 missile the next generation upgrade to the patriot air defense systems used to destroy tactical ballistic missiles cruise missiles or aircraft the united kingdom germany the netherlands and belgium are eu member suppliers of component parts to the united states the department of defense has stated that the capability to produce all pac3 components domestically does exist though assessment of production capacity has been announced except for one the lethality enhancer manufactured in germany97 the tactical tomahawk missile the next generation surface and submarine launched standoff weapon used by the navy for critical longrange precision strike missions the united kingdom and italy are eu member suppliers of component parts there are us domestic suppliers with comparable capabilities available to produce the foreign source items given some additional qualification time and cost the defense department has not made public any assessment of the capacity of us industry to manufacture these components in quantity the predator unmanned aerial vehicle uav semiautonomous retaskable unmanned aerial vehicle reconnaissance system providing surveillance reconnaissance target acquisition and direct strike capability to theater commanders belgium austria and the united kingdom are eu member suppliers of component parts there are multiple us domestic suppliers available to produce the foreignsupplied components given additional qualification time and cost source office of the deputy under secretary of defense for industrial policy study on impact of foreign sourcing of systems january 2004 supporters of strong transatlantic partnership caution that both the united states and its european allies must not allow the eu arms embargo issue to drive wedge in the useuropean relationship some say this would fulfill what many chinawatchers believe to be prc goal ie to separate the united states from its traditional allies and increase us isolation atlanticists argue that the united states 96 china and the eu the economist may 15 2004 niblett op cit discussions with us and uk officials 97 study on impact of foreign sourcing of systems office of the deputy under secretary of defense for industrial policy january 2004 crs30 and europe stand much better chance of addressing the challenges posed by chinas rise if they work together rather than at cross purposes many suggest that despite the tensions surrounding the arms embargo issue it has created an opportunity to establish useuropean dialogue on security challenges in east asia and their implications for us and allied interests on the other hand they believe that if the united states sanctions european companies or restricts useuropean defense industrial cooperation in response to an end to the eu arms embargo on china this would severely sour transatlantic relations significant transatlantic rift over the eu arms embargo on china could also hinder washingtons ability to gain allied support and cooperation on other global concerns ranging from countering terrorism to promoting peace in the middle east to making the world trading system more open and efficient us policy toward china if the eu ended its arms embargo on china particularly without corresponding improvement in the useuropean dialogue one implication might be reduction in coordinated western leverage on china to improve its human rights practices moreover there might be less pressure on chinas rulers to reexamine the tiananmen crackdown reexamination that would undermine chinas justification for possible military crackdown on prodemocracy demonstrators in the future us policymakers might also review the priority placed on improving human rights conditions in china in the broader approach towards china on the security side since the nixon administration in the early 1970s the united states has promoted policy of peaceful engagement with china including vast economic ties but remained vigilant to destabilizing moves by china in the current bush administration the us national security strategy stated that we welcome the emergence of strong peaceful and prosperous china at the same time there are concerns the same strategy also warned that in pursuing advanced military capabilities that can threaten its neighbors in the asiapacific region china is following an outdated path that in the end will hamper its own pursuit of national greatness98 despite the engagement policy there are concerns about chinas rising economic political and military power because of what some perceive as conflicting uschina strategic interests for maintenance of global peace and stability the bush administrations quadrennial defense review qdr of 2001 declared that one us security objective is to preclude hostile domination of critical areas particularly europe northeast asia the east asian littoral and the middle east and southwest asia issued after the ep3 aircraft collision crisis with china in april 200199 the qdr cautioned that although the united states will not face peer competitor in the near future the potential exists for regional powers to develop sufficient capabilities to threaten stability in regions critical to us interests in 98 president george w bush the national security strategy of the united states of america september 2002 99 see crs report rl30946 chinaus aircraft collision incident of april 2001 assessments and policy implications coordinated by shirley kan crs31 particular asia is gradually emerging as region susceptible to largescale military competition while china is not named explicitly the report points out that the possibility exists that military competitor with formidable resource base will emerge in the region moreover the report noted one particular area of concern the east asia littoral is defined as the region stretching from south of japan through australia and into the bay of bengal100 security implications would not be confined to the asian region or the united states the eu also has recognized that weapons nonproliferation is an issue with china at the euchina summit on december 8 2004 they issued joint declaration on nonproliferation and arms control there is concern that foreign cooperation with prc defenseindustrial corporations benefit and subsidize some that have engaged in weapons proliferation including to unstable areas such as the middle east moreover as china obtains more advanced technology it can sell its older equipment to poorer countries or those with problematic human rights records the united states has imposed sanctions on prc entities including some in the defense industries with multiple sanctions imposed in certain cases on the same serial proliferators european companies have cooperated with some prc organizations of concern for weapons proliferation for example eurocopter signed an agreement with the hafei aviation industry company and china aero technology importexport corporation catic to assemble hc120 helicopters101 the state department imposed sanctions for weapons proliferation on catic in may 2002 and december 2004 italys iveco company has cooperated with north china industries corporation norinco to produce an antitank weapon defenseindustrial organization norinco has been subject of us sanctions on six occasions us sanctions also have been imposed on prc entities in the shipbuilding and space launch industries alcatels sale of the chinasat9 communication satellite undercuts us sanctions for prc weapons proliferation which have prohibited the export of us satellites to china102 furthermore the eus consideration of an end to its arms embargo on china has raised us concerns about the eus support for us efforts to discourage an aggressive prc posture in the taiwan strait and elsewhere in asia us efforts to uphold asian stability has fostered conditions benefitting us european asian and other economies in particular us efforts have intensified since the summer of 2004 to focus on resumption of crossstrait dialogue washington worries that in ending the arms embargo the eu could inadvertently send different message from that of us policy which denies beijings claim to any justification to use force against taiwan according to this view such move would also undermine the eus stated policy of supporting peaceful resolution of the taiwan question 100 department of defense quadrennial defense

policy issues and crs report 98485 china possible missile technology transfers under us satellite export policy actions and chronology both by shirley kan crs32 the attention on the eus arms embargo could also lead to review of whether us arms sanctions on china should be maintained eased or tightened periodic issue concerns whether to issue further waivers of the sanctions imposed for the tiananmen crackdown including for satellite exports as discussed above in us sanctions on arms sales to china in 2002 the state department considered boeings request to export chinook heavylift helicopters to china103 chinas organizers and american exporters could urge transfers of us equipment related to security surrounding the olympics to be held in beijing in 2008 equipment that also could be used for internal security there is increasing concern in the us government that chinas military modernization is accelerated offensive and destabilizing threatening us forces and allies among us allies japan in particular has increased concerns about the plas buildup japanese officials publicly have expressed opposition to the eu lifting its arms embargo particularly after incidents that raised tensions on november 10 2004 pla hanclass submarine intruded into japanese territorial waters and japans maritime selfdefense force deployed antisubmarine aircraft and destroyers to track the submarine on january 22 2005 japans maritime self defense forces tracked the pla navys two sovremennyclass destroyers in waters under japanese surveillance104 japanese foreign minister nobutaka machimura told the eus top foreign policy official javier solana on february 8 that japan opposes the lifting of the arms embargo because that would have negative effect on security not only in japan but also in east asia105 the united states and japan issued joint statement on february 19 2005 which explicitly declared that they seek the common strategic objectives of encouraging china to play responsible and constructive role regionally as well as globally and encouraging the peaceful resolution of issues concerning the taiwan strait through dialogue106 in september 2005 the pla navy deployed five ships including sovremenny destroyer to disputed waters between china and japan with conflicting claims to gas and oil drilling rights thus the impact of us diplomacy with the eu would affect us security interests as well as those of allies such as japan especially given the new level of usjapan allied coordination on security concerns attention on the eus arms embargo also raises questions about broader concerns over the range of arms suppliers to the pla including russia europe and israel see tables 1 and 2 at the end of this report in response to the national defense authorization act for fy2000 pl 10665 enacted on october 5 1999 the pentagon has submitted annual reports to congress on prc military power in the national defense authorization act for fy2002 pl

issued the joint statement of the us japan security consultative committee february 19 2005 crs33 technology to china congress did not limit the scope of this reporting requirement to transfers from russia or other former soviet states as in the original language passed by the house however the new section of the report submitted in 2002 cooperation between the former soviet union and china only discussed arms sales by former soviet states excluding israel and other countries the report submitted to congress in 2003 did not have this section the report in 2004 included subsection on former soviet union arms sales and technology transfers to china since 1991 again excluding israel this report briefly raised concerns about an end to the eus arms ban options for us policy continue to urge the eu to maintain its arms embargo conveying specific us concerns about chinas ongoing human rights abuses to eu interlocutors may heighten concerns that lifting the embargo could increase internal repression in china this argument may be especially cogent for member states such as sweden the netherlands and ireland which have strong human rights advocacy traditions some of the new eu members from central and eastern europe may be more receptive to us arguments that lifting the eu embargo could also damage useuropean relations in nato if the us strategy however is perceived as trying to divide and weaken the eu it could backfire and increase transatlantic tensions washington might also more systematically and publicly raise concerns about russian and israeli arms sales to china in order to deflect european complaints that eu members are being singled out for criticism encourage the eu to strengthen its code of conduct the united states could encourage significant strengthening of the european unions code of conduct to enhance its transparency and provide eu member states with nearrealtime notice of prospective arms sales to china prior to issuance of an export license in this way those eu members concerned about the negative implications of such sale could bring peer pressure to bear within the eu arms control context sufficient to dissuade the prospective seller from agreeing to such sale urging the eu to make the eu code of conduct in its strengthened form common position could also enhance its credibility as an instrument of arms exports control the united states could also encourage the eu to incorporate into its own military control list the munitions lists of all major international arrangements including the wassenaar arrangement military control lists fully encompassing all weapons lists in one place would further enhance the credibility of the eus code as the principal vehicle for eu arms exports control promote cooperative useu strategy the united states could promote cooperative strategy toward china and possibly on east asia more broadly the united states the eu and japan have begun strategic dialogue on east asia many europeans say they were surprised by the strength of us opposition to ending the eu ban because they did not view crs34 it as posing threat to us interests in the region sustained institutionalized dialogue on east asia may also enable washington to draw its european allies and friends into deeper engagement on the question of taiwan greater intelligence sharing might be pursued within this broad strategic dialogue the united states could promote regular consultative meetings on potential us and eu arms sales to the region the united states could in this way express to the eu what its greatest concerns may be regarding specific types of arms transfers to china such vehicle would not intrude on the sovereignty of the eu member states by mandating prohibited arms sales list for china but would provide the eu the united states and possibly japan with clear picture of what arms sales may be in prospect and afford private opportunity for the united states in advance of any sale to china to explain in detail its concerns about such sale in this way it is possible that controversies over potentially problematic sales to china could be minimized or avoided pursue robust bilateral efforts on european arms exports the united states could seek bilateral agreements with individual eu member states to constrain arms sales to china and possibly to ban the transfer of sensitive us weapons or technology to china this might help ensure that us interests are taken into consideration by each eu member state given that national sovereignty concerns still limit the coordination of arms export control policies at the eu level such arrangements would also protect us defense cooperation with those eu member states that have agreed with us conditions however it is unclear whether eu member states would be receptive to such bilateral arrangements some may prefer an euwide agreement in order to bolster harmonization of export controls throughout the union some member states might demand itar waivers or greater access to the us defense market as the price of such bilateral agreements engage with the european parliament members of congress could seek to play role in shaping the transatlantic debate on east asia by engaging in discussions with counterparts in the european parliament through the existing transatlantic legislators dialogue the european parliament has passed several resolutions urging the eu to maintain the arms embargo although the parliament does not have formal role in the decision to maintain or lift the embargo some analysts believe the parliament has become an important forum for foreign policy debates in the eu members of congress could encourage continued parliamentarian vigilance of the status of the eu arms embargo on china and of euchina relations more broadly retaliate to protect us national security impose restrictions on sales of defense articles and technology to eu member states if the eu lifts its arms embargo on china many members of congress have asserted that they would be prepared to restrict us sales of defense articles and technology to eu member states that sell certain defense items to china this would help ensure that us defense exports and advanced military crs35 technology are not redirected to china such restrictions could be imposed by placing specific conditions beyond those required by current us law in the contracts for sale by specifically stating that the contract would be null and void should the buying companys nation make specific classes of arms sales or technology transfers to china this could be done by specific amendment to the arms export control act by freestanding bill or through an amendment to an available legislative vehicle impose restrictions on us military procurement from eu states the united states could place restrictions on defense industrial cooperation with eu states that make weapons sales to china the united states determines to be problematic this could include suspension of cooperation with eu states currently participating in joint defense projects with the united states such as the joint strike fighter jsf program it could also include termination of defense article purchases from eu states that are currently procured for integration into weapons systems produced by the united states with the us replacing the foreign defense article with one domestically produced legislation itar waivers on june 22 2004 the senate approved an amendment samdt 3429 to the national defense authorization act for fy2005 s 2400 that would have waived section 38j of the arms export control act for the uk and australia section 38j requires that for foreign country to become exempt from us defense export licensing requirements it must have first concluded binding bilateral agreement with the united states which obligates the foreign country to have or to establish domestic defense export control regime consistent with the detailed guidelines set out in sections 38j 1 and 2 of the arms export control act in order to permit an export licensing exemption for the uk given the differences of its national export control system from that of the united states congress must waive section 38j on october 9 2004 the house and senate approved conference report on bill that removed the senate provision waiving section 38j replacing it with new provision section 1225 of hr 4200 which requires expedited processing of defense export licenses for the uk and australia but does not exempt them from review hr 4200 was signed into law pl 108 375 on october 28 2004 resolutions urging the eu to keep the embargo on february 2 2005 the house passed hres 57 to urge the eu to maintain its arms embargo on china on march 17 2005 the senate passed sres 91 urging the eu to maintain its arms embargo on china defense procurement sanctions in may 2004 the house passed its version of the ronald w reagan national defense authorization act for fy2005 hr 4200 which included provision to impose procurement sanctions against any foreign person that transfers certain military items to china the senates bill did not have similar language and the section was dropped in conference crs36 on may 25 2005 the house passed hr 1815 the national defense authorization act for fy2006 hr 1815 with provision section 1212 that among other things would forbid the secretary of defense from procuring by contract or otherwise any goods or services from any foreign person the secretary determines has exported transferred or otherwise provided to governmental or nongovernmental entities of the peoples republic of china any item or class of items on the united states munitions list foreign persons determined by the secretary of defense to have engaged in any of the forbidden

109163 on january 6 2006 east asia security act on june 29 2005 representative henry hyde chairman of the house international relations committee introduced hr 3100 the east asia security act of 2005 to deter arms transfers by foreign countries to the prc among the measures the bill sought to require presidential reports on european or other foreign countries that export to china military or dualuse items on the wassenaar munitions list and those that have defense cooperative projects with the united states the bill also sought to add licensing requirements and to give the president discretionary authority to impose sanctions denial of security assistance us weapons research etc to countries reported to have engaged in defense exports to china during an extended floor vote on july 14 2005 representative donald manzullo led opposition to the bill so that an original count of 342 favorable votes changed to the final vote of 215203 less than twothirds support to defeat the bill107 then on july 19 2005 representative hyde introduced language for the east asia security act to amend hr 2601 the foreign relations authorization act for fys 2006 and 2007 the house agreed by voice vote to the amendment after representative hyde lamented that the failure of hr 3100 to pass was the wrong outcome for us national security and obtained the support of representative manzullo since changes were made to clarify that the legislation would apply to international transfers of weapons and related technology and not to civilian commercial trade manzullo said that the amendment makes sure that the chinese army does not receive sensitive information from our allies and at the same time it does not hinder the export of our valuable manufacturing108 the house passed hr 2601 on
