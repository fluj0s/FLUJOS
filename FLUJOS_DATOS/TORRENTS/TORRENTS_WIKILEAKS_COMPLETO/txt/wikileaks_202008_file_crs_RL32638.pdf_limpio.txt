of us trade representative robert b zoellick to fight terrorism by spreading the message of prosper ity and democracy throughout the world1 one way the bush administration chose to spread that ssage was through proposed middle east free trade agreement mefta the mefta initiative was proposed by pr esident bush on may 9 2003 and was slated for completion within decad ie by around 2013 more detail on the bush administrations plan was reveal ed on june 23 2003 at the world economic forum in jordan when us trade repr esentative zoellick spoke on the conceptual details ustr zoellick outlined

of world and us foreign direct investment respectively in various entities impetus for the initiative mefta captured an idea that was already being debated in washington using trade as tool to fight terrorism for example in february 2003 report by policy analyst edward gresser argued that the muslim world had been the blank spot on the us trade agenda fact that risked undermining rather than supporting the war on terrorism gresser pointed to an economic crisis affecting almost all of the western muslim states which have seen their share of world trade andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32638crs2

upon the united states the 911 commission report released on august 29 2004investment collapse since 1980 resultin g in stagnant growth and falling income with social consequences of unemployment political tension and rising appeal for religious extremists2 gresser argued that strategic initiative for the muslim3 world could end or at least ease the tilt gresser called for an initiative analogous to the programs now available for central america the andean nations and africa in order to possibly spark growth and creation and so reduce the attraction of radicalism and religious fundamentalism another article written by policy analyst brink lindsey of the cato institute argued for two concepts the first was an additional shorterterm program to include temporary dutyfree quotafree access to the us market for exports of selected muslim countries the shorter term program he declared would give tangible dramatic proof of us co mmitment to the region thereby providing an impetus for the longer arduous process of negotiating fr ee trade agreements the second concept lindsey called for was the expansion of th definition of middle east beyond the traditional geographic area to incl ude other countries with geopo litical significance4 more recently the 911 commission report affirmed these ideas it included recommendation which reads comprehens ive us strategy to counter terrorism should include economic policies that enc ourage development more open societies and opportunities for pe ople to improve the lives of their families and to enhance prospects for their childrens future5 major elements the bush administrations mefta plan in aiming to support economic development job creation and political and humanitarian changes reflects elements of the two
