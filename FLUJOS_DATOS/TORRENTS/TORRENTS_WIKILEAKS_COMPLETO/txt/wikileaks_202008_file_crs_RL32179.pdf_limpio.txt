particularly as it may aﬀect employment levels in their states or districts for two years after the economy emerged from relatively shallow recession in 2001 there was continuing loss in manufacturing jobs and even as the recovery progresses many fear that new nonmanufacturing jobs will not have the same relatively high levels of wages and beneﬁts traditionally associated with manufacturing by contrast despite the recession of 2001 the level of real inﬂationadjusted us manufacturing output as of mid2005 stood almost 30 higher than at similar point after the recession of 1991 with about 25 million fewer manufacturing employees this is more than three times real manufacturing output in 1960 when comparable number of people were employed in

issues summary although the us economy has emerged from relatively shallow recession in 2001 by mid2005 there was still recovery in the number of manufacturing jobs nevertheless real output in us manuf acturing in early 2005 stood more than 30 higher than at similar point after th recession of 1991 even with 25 million fewer manufacturing employees members of c ongress are increasingly concerned as to how these developments affect manufacturing employment in their states and districts this report revises crs re port released in early 2004 to provide baseline study for members of congress on longterm trends in manufacturing output productivity and employment including some extensions of timeseries data employment in manufacturin g has declined as share of overall employment since 1960 at about the same rate of d ecline as the currentdollar share of gdp accounted for by manufacturing output both measures have fallen from 30 to less than 15 only about 14 million people we re employed in manufacturing by mid 2005 the alltime peak was more th an 19 million in 1979 and each successive cyclical economic peak since then has seen fewer persons so employed but measured on real basis manufacturing output kept pace with total output in other sectors despite its shrinking share of em ployment the explanation seems to lie in rising labor productivity whic h grew 50 more quickly for manufacturing than for the total economy between 1960 and 2000 these overall trends in manufacturing mask highly divergent performances among individual industries output nd productivity among individual sectors do not tend to cluster around overall average levels of performance this report examines in more detail three specific manufacturing sectors information technology industries which have been highgrowth areas of the economy and internationally competitive the automotive sector which has been affected by high levels of import penetration and is divided between the big three usbased manufacturers and the us facilities of interna tionally based firms and tex tiles and appare l which are facing high level of import competition and have experienced large numbers of job losses globalization meaning the increased intern ationalization of markets inputs and investment has had major impact on u s manufacturing since 1980 the us trade balance in manufactured goods has g one from surplus to deficit of nearly 500 billion the deficit is concentrated in consumer and automotive products but even capital goods moved into deficit in 2003 while foreign outsourcing also known as offshore outsourcing or offshoring has become major issue the report notes evidence that nearly all major industr ial countries including china have lost manufacturing jobs since 1995 changes in the dollar exchange rate and us international trade agreements may also have affected domestic manufacturing the report concludes by examining va rious approaches to industrial and industrial

than at similar point after th recession of 1991 with about 25 million fewer manufacturing employees this is more than three times real manufacturing output in 1960 when comparable number of pe ople were employed in manufacturing2 employment trends in manufacturing figure 1 shows that as compiled by the depa rtment of labors bureau of labor statistics bls the number of manufactur ing employees in the united states in 2002 was about the same as it was in 1960 the total was about 15 million which is also about the same as in the early 1950s during the korean war boom but of course the us economy and population are now much larger so that far smaller share of the workforce is directly employed in manufacturing the level of manufacturing employment s tended to move up and down with the business cycle but with successively lower peaksafter the three recessionary periods of the 1980s and 1990s recessionary years defined here as real growth of 10 or less in gross domestic product are marked in the figure thus the secular trend in manufacturing employment has been down since 1979 when 194 million persons were so employed in the united states the number fell by 24 million over the next three years with the impact of the doubledip recession in 198082 nd recovered to its next cyclical peak of 18 million jobs in 1989 following the recession of 199091 the next peak employment year was 177

in november 2001 thus manufacturing accounted for all of the net total nonfarm job loss of 11 million in 200103 both the fall in manufacturing employ ment before the 2001 recession and the slowness of the recovery in both manuf acturing and total employment after recovery began in late 2001 also suggest that we may be experiencing structural changes in the economy possibly long term structural changes to increase output per hour of labor are overw helming the normal employment trends related to the business cycle3 research at the new york federal reserve bank found that even the jobless recovery after 1991 began to create jobs by 15 months after it began by contrast the us economy was still she dding jobs in mid2003 almost two years after economists decided that the recove ry had begun indeed the unprecedented slowness of the employment recovery in th is case caused long delay in the decision of national bureau of economic researc h the accepted arbiter for declaring when recessions begin and end to determine that novemb er 2001 marked the beginning of recovery the fed researchers also noted that layoffs are now increasingly permanent not temporary as in the past when

also stated that the slow and uncertain start of the present recovery discouraged employers from rushing too quickly to make permanent new hires it forecast that an employment recovery could start in late 2003 though it might not be robust until mid2004 when the growth cycle might be firmly ree stablished on the other hand even this optimistic analysis found that new jobs may not be coming back soon in the hardesthit corners of the economy some companies especially in manufacturing are still concentrating on costc utting rather than expansion the article cited recent large job cuts announced at paper appa rel and information technology equipment manufacturing companies however the ar ticle did also emphasize that productivity gains would also mean an increase in us jobs in the longer term not decrease5 it may be that as argued by federal reserve board chairman alan greenspan the us economy has been gradually moving toward an economy based on conceptual assets such as ideas protected as intellectual property and away from physical assets such as pl ants and production machinery6 nevertheless there is an increasing perception that manufacturin g employment and the manufacturing role in the economy are under pressure and that th is may adversely affect us standards of living for example the washington post editorialized about the lost factory job while the greensboro news record in the heart of the hardhit textile manufacturing belt headlined an editorial saving factory jobs critical to the economy7 in more sweeping fashion louis uchitelle chief economics correspondent of the new york times wrote manufacturing is slowly disappearing in the united states the essence of great world power is its edge in producing not services but manufacturing pr oducts that other people want

that th us manufacturing sector continues to make positive and beneficial contributions to the us economy in part through manufacturing productivity gains historica lly higher than those of any other economic sector over the past two cades manufacturing averaged twice the annual productivity gains of the rest of the private sector these gains enabled americans to do more with less increa our ability to compete and facilitate higher wages for all employees10 this ability to do more with less sign of strength in manufacturing paradoxically means that fewer manufactur ing employees may be needed if overall demand for us manufactured goods domesti cally and abroad is not rising fast enough thenpresident of nam jerry jasinowski reflected on this paradox he is resigned to the fact that many of the factory jobs cut will not reappear but he is also proud of the fact that productivity growth in manufacturing has consistently outstripped that of the rest of the us economy yielding great benefits to the nation overall11 the nam study further emphasized that the manufacturing sector has stronger multiplier effect than any other major sect or of the economy it cited commerce department calculations re leased at the end of 2002 which showed that each additional dollar in us final demand for manufactur ed products required 143 in intermediate goods and servi ces with associated employ ment for natural resources products each additional dolla r of demand required 122 in intermediate goods and services for the output of all other sectors each 1 of final demand required less than 100 of intermediate goods and servi ces this ranges from transportation at about 90 to financial and business services which generate only 50 in intermediate goods and services12 manufacturing output and the us economy does the decline in manufacturing employment indicate general decline in manufacturings relative role in the econom manufacturings share of employment and of current dollar gross

in the relatively mild rece ssion of 2001 however that study found that the manufacturing sector was not only hit harder than the overall economy but was affected by particularly slow recovery it ascribes this combination of effects to four causes significant retrenchment in business technology following surge in such investment in the 1990s the impact on us high technology especially informa

in the 2001 recession than it was in the 19901991 recession uncertainty caused by the ev ents of september 11 2002 which depressed inves tment and demand the extent to which slower growth at home was compounded by the effects of slower growth abro ad particularly the dramatic drop in us manufacturing exports to our principal export markets18 the details and impact of slow manufactured export growth arediscussed in later sec tion of the present report productivity and manufacturing output real output in manufacturin g kept pace with the real gains of the economy as whole despite continually declining share of total employment because of superior labor productivity gains as measur ed by the bls series on output per person per hour over the entire period 19602000 the average annual increase in productivity was 50 greater for manufact uring than for total nonfarm business activity 30 against 20 manufacturing labor productivity imp rovement in the 197090 period was also higher than tota l nonfarm business produc tivity and in the 1990s it increased to double the overall business average presenting these data for the same periods as in figure 3 there was little difference between the two measures in the 1960s as both improved at an annual average of 29 in the 1970s and 1980s both rate s of labor productivity improvement slowed although manufact uring productivity performed better manufacturing productivity increased by an annual average of 24 in the 1970s and 28 in the 1980s by contrast the pr oductivity performance of total nonfarm business

2002 was also about 35 times the 1960 leve l despite dip in 2001 these data suggest long term trend growth in real manufacturing output driven by improved productivity and that the decline in output in 2000 2 was only cyclical in nature thus far the analysis has dealt with us manufacturing as single undifferentiated sector but of course wide range of products and processes are covered by the term however it may be defined the ne xt sections of the report examine divergences of performance with in the manufacturing sector and look in more detail at selected specific industries before examining these divergent trends the report will look briefly at one more topic that affects manufacturing across the board unionization manufacturing has traditionally been one of the most high ly unionized organized in labor union terms sectors of the us economy the decline of the share of workers in manufacturing jobs has thus contributed to the widely noted decline of union membership within the total workforce by 2004 125 of all wage and salary workers in the united states were union members the lowest percentage since this statistical series was begun by bls on its current basis in 1983 when the level was 201 within manufacturing however uni on membership rate s have fallen even more precipitously it was 278 when the series began in 1983 and declined to 143 in 2002 barely more than half the earlier level and only one point higher than the overall average of the total workforce manufacturing remains one of the more highly unionized sectors in the priv ate sector economy with only construction and transportation and pub lic utilities ranking higher though both have also registered large declines over the past 20 years by contrast government employees have maintained relativel high and stable level of union representation at just under 40 throughout the period21 performance varies widely by industry22 while analysis of the overall manufactur ing sector in relation to the economy as whole is instructive examination of trends of individual industries within the sector can provide further insight di fferent industries experienced considerable variations in output growth productivity gains employment ups and downs and patterns of change over time moreover instances of similar growth rates or patterns may be due to different causes this section describes and analyzes th increases andor decreases over two discrete periods in output labor productivity and employme nt observed for the two digit industries that comprise the manufact uring sector under the standard industrialhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32179crs10 23 although longer used for data collection and compiling the sic system is used here because output productivity and employment data developed by the bureau of labor statistics on the new north american industrial classification system are not yet available for years preceding 1987 see the appendix to this report for further discussion of the change to the new system 24 crs believes that an annual rather than monthly criterion for determining business cycle peaks is the appropriate one for this repor t inasmuch as the analysis uses annual dataclassification system sic23 the twodigit level is the first level of disaggregation below that of manufacturing as whole containing diversity of subindustries in many cases it is used in this report because bls does not have output and productivity data for years prior to 1987 at more disaggregated level the analysis is based upon indexes of r eal output and output per hour developed by bls and the blss employment by i ndustry data the periods covered are 1960 to 1990 and 1990 to 2000 the earlier period be gins sufficiently later than the end of world war ii so as not to be significantly affected by that war and is long enough to capture secular trends the latter period includes the unusually strong economic years of the second half of the 1990s fo r reasons of comparability the analysis is on peaktopeak basis 1960 1990 and 2000 are each final year of an economic expansion as measured by annual totals of real gdp24 this section of the report does not attempt to analyze trends in every individual industry this is partly b ecause trends at the twodigit level are composite of developments in the subindustries which would necessitate analysis of each of the subindustries trends in information technology industries in motor vehicle manufacturing and in textile and apparel manufacturing are examined in greater detail later in this report under selected major industries output trends perhaps the most striking findings of this analysis are the degrees of divergences among rates of output growth by indi vidual industries and between those of individual industries and that for manufact uring as whole one of the notable aspects of this is the lack of concentr ation around an average rate of output growth for all manufacturing the disparities that will be described reflect industr ies producti on methods places in the chain of production access to material inputs product mix distance from markets growth of market technolog level rate of innovation and degree of exposure to foreign competition and these aspects affect and are affected by the evolution of the economy toward sma ller proportion of g oods production being accounted for by basic material s because the twodigit level is fairly aggregated analysis with respect to these factors can be clouded by differences in production processes product ty pe and product technol ogy level among parts of an industry as indicated in the first part of this report real output by the manufacturing sector increased at an av erage annual rate of 31 per year between 1960 and 1990 however only six of the 18 twodigit ma nufacturing industries for which bls hashttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32179crs11 25 given the 19601990 average annual output in crease of 31 for total manufacturing an industry would be within 20 if its averag increase was between 24 08 x 31 and 37 12 x 31 26 computers and computer equipment were cl assified in this twodigit industry under the sic computer components were classi fied under electronic and other electrical equipment and componentsdeveloped indexes of output had rates of growth during this period within 20 of that for manufacturing as w hole five had growth rates 40 or more below that of manufacturing as whole and four had gr owth rates 40 or more above that of manufacturing for the 19902000 period onl three industries had growth rates within 20 of that of manufacturing as whole ten had growth rates 40 or more below that for total manufacturing and two had growth rates two and half to four times as fast as that for manufacturing as whole25 these two industries are the very large machinery manufacturing groups which notably include information technology and electronic products s ee table 1 for the data underlying this paragraph and most of th rest of this section 1960 to 1990 in view of the factors listed above it is not surprising that output by the primary metals industry grew very slowly between 1960 and 1990 as us metal ore reserves became depleted and world production of primary materials using energyintensive proce sses tended to shift overseas partly attracted by lower energy costs abroad output by stone clay and glass manufacturers increased much faster than that by primary metals pr oducers even though they too produce basic materials using energyintensive processes losses by us producers of stone clay and glass manufactures to overseas producers probably were limited partly due to the low average unit value of some products comb ined with the difficulty of transporting many others and the availability of these common materials close to their markets this raises the cost of transportation relative to production cost and limits the geographic size of the market both indus tries output grew much slower than the allmanufacturing average industries with very rapid output gr owth between 1960 and 1990 include rubber and plastic products chemicals and llied products industr ial and commercial machinery including computers26 electronic and other electrical equipment and instruments and related produc ts these industries are ad ept at innovation entire or large parts of these industries employ high level of technology andor employ material inputs that are eas ily modified andor combin ed to develop new products and in many cases their products substitute easily for higher value materials over the 30year period these industries output rose at average annual rates between 40 and 58 industries with growth of about the sa rate as total manufacturing in the 19601990 period include lumber and wood pr oducts furniture and fixtures paper and allied products nd printing and publishing the markets for goods that these industries produce are predominantly linked to general economic and income growth while part of the paper industry performs ergyintensive basic material processing most of the value added in the twodigit industry is accounted for by the entities that convert through coating cutting formin g etc raw paper and paperboard intohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32179crs12 the wide variety of paper and paper board products used by businesses and households in the case of lumber and wood products big pa rt of demand growth stemmed from rising incomes that spurred marked increase in the size of new homes constructed rather than by an increase in the number of homes built 1990 to 2000 between 1990 and 2000 output developments for most individual industries were ma rkedly different than th eir 19601990 experience one aspect is that divergences in production growth rates among individual industries when compared with the average for manufact uring as whole were even greater in the 19902000 period than between 1960 and 1990 in the later period only three of the 18 twodigit manufacturing i ndustries had rates of growth within 20 of that for manufacturing as whole compared with six in the earlier period second aspect is the difference between the growth rates of the individual industries in the two periods production increases for the two fastest growing industr ies industrial and commercial equipment electronic and other electrical equipment accelerated from their already rapid increases as computerization and telecommunication usage by businesses and households mushroomed helped by continuing product innovation these industr ies average annual output growth rates jumped from 51 and 58 to 90 and 143 respectively output by the sub industry making computers and computer equipment rose at an average annual rate of 29 between 1990 and 2000 the slowestgrowing industry in rms of output in 19601990 experienced faster growth in 19902000 although not up to the allmanufacturing average primary metals benefitted from modernizati on of the integrated mill porti on of the steel industry accelerated in crease in market share produced by steel minimills and computerization of the machine tools us ed by the fabricated metals industry among industries that saw output gr owth slow in the 19902000 period were paper and allied pr oducts chemicals and allied products and printing and publishing all three had been growing as fast as or faster than the allmanufacturing average the first two decelerated partly because imports started to make noticeable inroads into domestic markets in contrast with the earlier period the third suffered from the widespread penetration of in house computerenabled printing the 19902000 period also was characterized by the fact that twice as many individual industries experienced slower output growth compared with 19601990 than industries that had faster output growth compared with 19601990 that total manufacturing production rose faster between 1990 and 2000 than between 1960 and 1990 is because the industries with faster output growth were large enough and their output increases were rapid enough to more than offset the slow production growth of the other industries productivity trends trends in labor productivity among manufacturing industries in the two periods covered in this report were at least as complex and diverse as the output trends although there was somewhat more concen tration of rates of gain in the 19601990 period divergences in rates of gain in output per hour in the 19601990 periodhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32179crs13 among individual industries were less extensive than those for output described earlier nine of the 18 twodigit manufact uring industries had rates of increase in output per hour within 20 of the annua l average for manufacturing as whole 27 per year four had growth rate s 40 or more higher than that of manufacturing as whole and two d growth rates 40 below that of manufacturing but the disparities we re greater in the 19902000 period during which only three industries had growth ra tes within 20 of the all manufacturing average 38 per year eight had growth rates 40 or more below that for total manufacturing

hours and earnings serieshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32179crs15 27 the same comment holds for analyses of production increases 28 such groupings have evolved from industrial classification concepts of several decades ago when the nature and range of products and production processes were considerably different 29 suggestion of connection does not imply 100 predictability the fairly high level of aggregation at the twodigit level combined with considerable heterogeneity in some cases makes the challenge of explaining rates of gain in productivity and changes in thos rates over time particularly great for industries such as transportation equipmen t electronic and othe r electric equipment and rubber and miscella neous plastic products27 for example in addition to motor vehicles products of the transportation quipment industry include guided missiles and space vehicles travel trailers and campers and motorcycles and bicycles among others and among the products of the electronic and other electric equipment industry are electric di stribution equipment such as transformers and switch gear household refrigerators and freezers and electronic components and accessories such as semiconductors and pr inted circuit boards28 1960 to 1990 probably indicating c onnection between productivity improvement and commercial success29 the industries with the highest rates of increase in output per hour between 1960 nd 1990 by and large are those with the fastest output growth these industrie s included chemicals and allied products industrial and commercial mach inery electronic and other electrical equi pment and instruments and related products with av erage annual rates of gain in productivity of 31 39 47 and 40 respectivel manufacturing as whole had an average annual gain of 27 one of the attr ibutes of rapid output growth is that the need for additional production capacity presents more opportunities for the introduction of stateof the art produc tion facilities and new production processes than in the case of less rapidly growing indus tries at least parts of the industries cited above are characterized by rapid t echnological i nnovati on which tends to create new products faster and ge nerates increased demand correspondingly if the above assu mption about connection between productivity improvement and commercial succe ss is valid it is not surprising that four out of the five industries with the slowest gains in productivity furniture and fixtures stone clay and glass primary metals and fabricated metal products had slower than average rates of incr ease in output during the 19601990 period industries with average rates of increas in both output per hour and production in the 19601990 period were lumber and wood products paper and allied products and transportation equipment demand for the products of these seven slow or average growing industries tends to be related to general econo mic growth andor population growth less rapid output increase affo rds fewer opportunities for the introduction of stateoftheart produc tion facilities nd processes 1990 to 2000 between 1990 and 2000 productivity developments for most individual industries were markedly di fferent than thei r 1960 1990 experience similar to the changes in output as noted above divergences in output per hour increase among industries were even gr eater in the 19902000 period than betweenhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32179crs16 30 petroleum refining accounts for about 90 of the output of this twodigit industry1960 and 1990 also productivity growth rate s of the individual industries differed markedly in the two periods in the 19902000 period the rise in output per hour of the two fastest growing industries industrial and commercial machinery elect ronic and other electrical equipment accelerated sharply from th eir already rapid 19601990 increases from 39 and 47 to 89 and 140 respectively productiv ity of the subindustry making computers and computer equipment rose at an average annual rate of 32 between 1990 and 2000 the extraordinary ga ins of the abovementioned twodigit industries and marked improvement by severa l others offset the slower than average productivity gains by ne other industries the several others were apparel furniture petroleum and coal products30 rubber and miscellaneous plas tic products and transporta tion equipment eight of the nine industries with slower gains in output per hour in the19902000 period than in 19601990 had average annual increases of 25 or less these were food and kindred products lumber nd wood products paper and llied products printing and publishing stoneclayglass primary metals fabri cated metal products and miscellaneous manufacturing employment trends as discussed in the section on the manufacturing sector as whole the trend though not the level in employment in an industry to great extent is an outcome of changes in the industrys production level combined with changes in labor productivity in the industry given the dive rsity of trends in production and in labor productivity among the twodigit industries it is not unexpected that trends in employment among the industries were diverse as well during the two periods examined only four of the 18 twodi git manufacturing indus tries had percentage changes in employment between 1960 and 1990 within 10 percentage points of the increase for manufacturing as whol 146 whereas 11 industries had employment percentage changes 20 points or more higher or lower than the percentage change for manufacturing as whole taking into account that 1990 to 2000 was one third as long as 1960 to 1990 the disparities appear greater in the 19902000 period only tw industrie s had percentage changes within three percentage points of the ll manufacturing average 25 and ten had changes 20 percentage points or more higher or lowe r than the percentage change for total manufacturing 1960 to 1990 employment in the manufacturing sector as whole increased by about 3¼ million people between 1960 and 1990 but as can be concluded from the data on divergences in the previous paragraph the gain in overall sector employment is the net result of many increases and decreases in absolute numbers among the individual industries not surp risingly the largest absolute increases tended to occur in large rapidly growin g industries thus the industrial and commercial machinery electronic and ot her electrical equi pment rubber and miscellaneous plastic products and instruments and re lated industries experiencedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32179crs17 31 the employment decrease and increase figu res in this discussion of employment trends are based upon unrounded numbers for the beginning and ending years of the two periodsgains in employment of 600000 450000 475000 and 470000 respectively but two not particularly fastgrowing i ndustries printing and publishing and transportation equipment registered employment increases of about 640000 and 320000 respectively offsetting part of these large increases plus several smaller ones were declines in employment of varying magnitudes in seven other industries between 1960 and 1990 these include 430000 decrease in primary metals and 130000 decrease in food and kindred products in additi on to employment decreases totaling 430000 in the textile mill and the appare l industries discussed later 1990 to 2000 given the fact that the 19601990 period was much longer than the 19902000 period the amounts of employ ment decreases and increases in individual industries in the ter period would be expected to be smaller this was the case the largest decrease was that of 400000 in apparel manufacturing where very rapid productivity incr eases averaging 66 per year and import competition probably were factors drops of 160000 we re experienced both by textile mills and by the instruments industry and ther was 135000 employment decrease in the transportation equipment industry the ot herwise fastgrowing instruments industry was hit by sharp decrease in defense sp ending on search and navigation equipment as for transportation equipment employment losses in aircraft and parts more than offset gains in motor vehicles and equipment which will be discussed in later section the total of the deceases in these industries was about 8 50000 miscellaneous others saw employment drop combined 280000 increases of 120000 120000 and 100000 in employment in th rubber and plastics fabricated metals and lumber and w ood products industries resp ectively plus number of small increases in employment among othe r industries offset some of the total decreases to yield an employment d ecline of about 430000 in the manufacturing sector as whole31 from examination of trends in output labor productivity and employment of individual manufacturing i ndustries it appears that notwithstanding their commonalities they differ sufficiently in many characteristics and in the markets they serve therefore they experience vastly different outcomes over the course of time performance of selected major industrial sectors having noted wide divergence of perfo rmance among different sectors of the us manufacturing economy th is report will now investigat three important sectors in more detail the three specific sectors

recession of the early 1990s the annual value of private business investment in computers and peripherals more than doubled from 44 billion to 101 billion between 1992 and 2000 communications equipment purchases by business increased at an even faster pace from 46 billion to 124 billion together with software these items accounted for about 50 of the entire increase in us business equipment investment in the 1990s if we refer to the inflationcorrected values reported by the commerce department bureau of economic analysis bea informationprocessing equipment and software

terms of dollar valu of products sold by us companies us companies had lost their initial preeminence in the global market to japanese companies by the mid1980s when us industry threaten ed massive antidum ping case against japanese producers the reagan administration negotiated the usjapan semiconductor agreement of 1986 the japa nese industry and government agreed to accept as target minimum penetration level of 30 of its market from all foreignowned companies along with monitoring mechanism35 second initiative was establishment of privatepublic consortium between the federal government and usbased semiconductor and manuf acturing industry producers known as sematech for semiconductor manufact uring technology in addition macroeconomic factors favored us producers the fall in the dollar exchange rate as noted elsewhere in this report helped usbased producers regain their market competitiveness while slow domestic gr owth in japan in the 1990s held down demand in japanese pr oducers home market subsequently us companies rec overed overall dominance of the world semiconductor industry in 198889 japanese manufacturers held more than 50 of the global semiconductor market the only time they have done so at that point japans companies controlle d 88 of their domestic market about 35 of the market elsewhere in asia and the pacific and more than quarter of the us domestic market because of the opening of japans own market prodded by careful monitoring of the semiconductor agreement in the early 1990s japanese companies share of their domestic market declined to consistent level of about 70 in the late 1990s us companies share increased from 13 to 23 of the japanese market over the same period36 meanwhile by 2001 the japanese share of the us market declined by half to 11 while the us companies share was greater than 70 japanese producers share of the asiapacific market outside japan fell by half to less than 19 while us companies held more than 50 of that market in europehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32179crs21 37 it is possible that some of this marketshare gain in the asiapacific region was due to increased outsourcing by us companies of printed circuit board assembly operations relative to similar activities by japanese compan ies but the sizes of overall gains of us companies against japanese companies in all ma rkets make it unlikely that this is solely an aspect of us outsourcing 38 see crs report 98376 the information technology agreement ita background on proposal to expand the scope of the multilateral trade agreement by glennon j

components including computers telecommunications equipment and semiconductors but not consum er electronics there we re originally 43 signatory countries which accounted for more than 90 of all trade in it products the total value of trade covered in the original ag reement was more than 650 billion for the united states and japan signature of th ita in principle involved relatively little change since neither country had tariff on semic onductors and most other electronics tariffs were minimal the european union eliminated its substantial tariffs on semiconductors and other electr onic products while china and india both joined the agreement after negotiating transitional staging periods38 the major trading countries not included in the ita bloc are the nations of latin america notably brazil argentina and mexico t hough us chip exporters have free access to mexico through nafta mexico still pplies tariffs to chips imported from non freetrade partner countries with rapid economic growth renewed us industry competitiveness and more open global trade environment both us exports and imports of most it products grew rapidly in the 1990s as shown in table 2 but domestic growth was stronger than foreign growth leading to us imports increasing at higher rate than exports this was especially the case for computer peripherals which the united states has always tended to import also the table shows that us computer exports increased only marginally in the 1990s an indication th at the us comparative advantage is in semiconductors the memory and logic of it products but the comparative advantage in semiconductors has been so str ong that even with increased global two way sourcing the us trade surplus in these products grew along with increased domestic growth and trade and at least partially offset the deficit in peripherals as exports grew from 16 billion to 60 billion between 1992 and 2000 the us trade position in semiconductors changed from bala nced

to aggressive efforts of its companies to sell into china is projected to move into second place41 one aspect of chinas rapid integrati on into the world economy is that chinese production may create permanent downward pressure on prices because of its virtually inexhaustible supply of lowco st labor this phe nomenon may especially affect pricing for those ectronics products and comp onents such

and as major input to apparel can be exported to serve as inputs to foreign made apparel that then is exported to the united states the us textile manufacturing industry also has been helped by

firms rose only from 26 of their total employment in 1982 to 275 in 1993 to 293 by 2000 however this number does not include overseas outsourcing by contract manufacturers such firms as solectron and

but whether the location of new manuf acturing jobs is driven by lower production costs or the need to be close to th customer base it is clear that the recent us experience is not unique manufactur

international competition resu lting in largescale job losses according to report by alliance capital economist joseph g carson manufacturing employment in china between 1995 and 2002 fell from 98

usbased companies the commerce report notes for example that in the 1960s 6070 of global research and development activities occurred in the united states and were largely funded by the federal

internati onal trade in the us economy and third the end of the cold war and important po licy changes in many major countries have led to an emergence of new participants in the international economy notably china as indicated just above and countries formerly comprisi ng the soviet union and its bloc in eastern europe participants which are also international competitors in such an environment the commerce department argues competition is increasingly not horizontal competition between individual companies but rather competition between different vertically integrated supply chains87 the dollar exchange rate and us manufacturing88 with the slowdown in us manufacturing growth at the end of the 1990s the impact of relatively high value of the dollar in foreign exchange again became major concern for many this section of the paper examines the case for causal linkage between exchange rates and manufact uring employment while in principle exchange rate variations could affect bot h nations imports and exports and hence employment the empirical case is mixed first neither in the short or the long term are exchange rates the singular influen ce on manufacturing employment swings in the business cycle account for significant s hort term employment variation while in the long term the effects of productivity growth exert an important influence second data from 1980 to 2005 show periods where the variation manufacturing employment is consistently predicted by changes in the exchange rate but also periods where the two move in an incons istent manner finally expert opinion reflects the mixed state of empirical evidence for example while some observers believe an upward revaluati on of the chinese yuan would provide significant boost to manufacturing employment in the us by increasing the competitiveness of our exports and reducing our impor ts others believe the effect would be minimal merely increasing our imports from countries other than china with little effect on employment or our aggregate trade balance marketbased exchange rate systems since the early 1970s the value of the us dollar in terms of other curre ncies has been determined through system of flexible exchange rates in this system governments typically do not control the value of their currencies as matter of policy but let the market forces of supply and demand determine the value in principle the value of nations currency is directly related to the balance of trade as well as flows of international capital into and out of the country by affecting relative cost s and hence sales of both imported and exported goods the exchange rate may so affect both sectoral and general macroeconomic activity as result macroeconomic variables such as employment inflation and the rate of economic growth may all be influenced by the exchange rate89httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32179crs41 90 michael w klein scott schuh and robert k triest job creation job destruction and the real exchange rate journal of international economics lix2 march 2003 pp 245 248the degree to which exchange rate varia tions affect sectors of the economy like manufacturing or even the overall econom depends on how open that sector or economy is to world markets the ope nness of an economy pends on the level of tariffs capital controls and the degree to which competitive products are produced in other nations researchers measure the degree of openness by adding an industrys exports and imports and expressing the sum as pr oporti on of the industrys domestic sales exports and imports by this measure the openness of the us manufacturing sector has grown sharply since the early 1970s the growth rate of openness in us manufacturing has averaged over 5 per year from 1972 to 2003 the growth has not been uniform however industries that were the most open to the world economy in 1972 have shown the highest growth of openness this heterogeneous pattern implies that some sectors of the manufactur ing industry are experiencing substantial international competition wh ile other sectors might re main relatively isolated90 on bilateral basis internationally traded currencies bear symmetrical relationship to one another when one curre ncy is appreciating this is equivalent to saying the other currency is weakening and vice versa for example if the dollar is being compared to the euro declining value of the dollar is equivalent to an increasing value of the euro exchange rates can only be expressed relative to another currency however for many purposes it is more useful to express the value of currency relative to the value of ba sket of currencies of the nations important trading partners in this case the value of particular currency rises or falls against the weighted average of the nations trading partners with the same symmetrical value relationship holding when the value of currency is market determined the event that initiates change in the exchange rate is usually change in the demand andor supply of assetsthe internati onal capital market or change in the demand andor supply of goods and services in international trade as nations currency is rising in value or appreciating the nation will typically move toward trade deficit as imports become cheaper and exports more expensive as well as experiencing net inflow of foreign capital when the nations currency is falling in value or depreciating the nation will typically move toward trade surplus and experience net outflow of capital is it then better for nation to have currency whose value is rising or falling high or low the answer depends on wh ere you stand in the economic system high or appreciating dollar is good for us buyers of imported goods many of which seem cheap in comparison to domestic goods the resulting inflow of lower price imported goods also keeps domestic inflation low the same high or appreciating dollar is bad if you are the owne r of or worker in firm that is in an import

economists also use real exchange rate inde xes that control for the relative differential inflation rates in trading nations the federal reserve real index of the dollar exchange rate against major

1992 large increasing deficits characterized 199395 reaching 174 billion in 1995 goods exports increased by more than 160 over the period but goods imports rose by 121 fro m an initial base of imports which were more than 50 larger than exports in 1985 although the timeframes are different for the 198085 period of dollar appreciation and the 198595 do llar depreciation the magnit udes of dollar variation are similar also similar is the fact that manufacturing employment declined in both circumstances albeit more slowly in the period of the falling dollar on the basis of this evidence it would be hard to make the case that the exchange rate had the theoretically predicted ffect on manufacturing exports production and employment over these periods although it is possible that falling dollar exchange rate and higher exports contributed to the modest increase in manufacturing employment in the early 1990s it is also possible that the effects of rising productivity shifting demand patterns and international capital mobility more than cancelled the effects of exchange rate changes during the 1990s the dollar again appreciated from apr il 1995 until it peaked in february of 2002

dollar depreciation which made th importation of components from europe too expensive reflecting the point made earlier about the effect of deprecia ting dollar on imported production imports93 while the exchange rate may be an important factor in determining the competitiveness of us manufacturing it is hardly the only factor ec onomic recession changes in productivity changes in technology as well as structural changes in domestic and international business all play role comparing figures 1 and 10 shows that there are periods when the linkage between exchange rates and employment appears consistent with exchange rate theory for example the decline of the dollar after the peak attained in march 1985 is followed by period in which manufacturing employment stabilized and in creased however the most recent data seem at this point inconsistent with the theory the decline in the dollar since february 2002 has been accompanied by sharp decline in manufacturing employment consistent with the domestic economic slowdown moreover the data on manufacturing employment as share of total employment shown in figure 2 suggest that manufacturings share of all employment has declined both in periods when the dollar was appreciating and when it was depreciating although the speed of the decline in employment might be affected by the exchange rate its overall trend has been downward since the 1960s several research efforts have examined the forces influencing manufacturing employment and have reached mixed conc lusions john tatom of the federal reserve bank of st louis found little rela tionship between the exchange rate and manufacturing employment in fact he found that in the 1980s manufacturing output expanded more during periods of strengthening dollar than during periods when the dollar was weakening for tatom the principal factors in the decline in manufacturing employment are productivity improvements and the sensitivity of demand for manufactured goods during d eclines in overall economic activity productivity improvement s tend to reduce the relative price of manufactured goods and require fewer workers for any given level of output th enhanced productivity of workers suggests that firms should expand employment while the decreasing relative price of manufactured goods sugge sts that firms shoul d reduce employment fall in the relative price of manufactured goods raises the cost of manufacturing labor relative to its productiv ity any given wage is t against lower revenue due to decreased price in eff ect decline in the relative price of manufactured goods is equivalent to an increase in the ma nufacturing wage rate relative to non manufacturing labor which reduces the incen tive to hire labor as per the next paragraph the falling price of manufactur ed goods relative to other goods and services stimulates demand for manufactured goods but this increase must overcome the wageproductivity effect fo r more workers to be hired for the productivity effect to offset the price effect the demand for manufactured goods should expand more than proportionately to given fall in pricehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32179crs45 94 john tatom why

eness elasticity of manufactured goods demand is low94 michael klein scott schuh and robert tr iest of the federal reserve bank of boston examined the relationship between job creation job destruction and the real exchange rate in the manufacturing i ndustries they found using econometric analysis applied to data set from 19731993 number of impor tant relationships between the exchange rate and manufacturin g employment first the authors found that the sensitivity of job destruction to the exchange rate depends on the openness of that particular industry to trade either in exports or in import competition this result is expected second they found that while job destruction is related to the exchange rate job creation is significantly less related this asymmetric relationship implies that when the dollar appreciates the rate of job loss is accelerated but when the dollar depreciates jobs are not necessarily created the rate of manufacturing job destruction merely returns to its historic trend this relationship appears to be continuing in more recent data where it consistently appears that higher values of the dollar may contribute to job losses but decline in the dollar rarely reverses the situation95 if the klein schuh and triest results ar an accurate description of the forces facing the manufacturing industry policy ba sed on realigning exchange rates can be expected to have only limited effectiveness from this perspective an appreciation of the chinese yuan or the other asian cu rrencies against the dollar might slow the rate of job loss in american manufacturing but would be unlikely to cause net job creation different perspectiv is provided by c fred bergsten of the institute for international economics he feels that an appreciation of the chinese yuan on the order of 2025 would also encourage number of other east asian countries to allow their currencies to appreciate such regional currency appreciation could lead to the creation of as many as 500000 us manufacturing jobs in bergstens view96 asian economies and the dollar considerable concern has been expressed that many asian c ountries have been deliberat ely keeping their currencies undervalued against the us dollar in order to promote their exports this view has been emphasized by the coalition for sound dollar an advocacy group made up of more than 80 trade associations who believe the strong dollar is still damaging american manufacturing97 they feel that the real problem lies mainly with four nations china japan korea and taiwan who the coalition

easons for the policy shift98 for taiwan and korea similar interventions are described with these nations buying 60 billion to weaken their currencies against the dollar but other observers do not attribute such currency actions to desire to manipulate exchange rates in order to increase exports they have characterized the japanese intervention and other measures merely as means to manage the

that the administration believes that bilateral financial diplomacy was the course of action most likely to result in movement toward the goal of market determined currency values106 however secretary snow obser ved in may 2005 that if china did not alter its policies they would likely m eet the statutory tec hnical requirement for designation as manipulating their currency to gain trade advantage chinas alteration of its exchange rate mechanism was likely influenced by pressure from both the bush administration and congress107 federal reserve board chairman alan greenspan pointed out in 2003 speech that if as most observers seem to agree the value of the chinese yuan is out of alignment with market valuation this might very well have adverse effects on world capital markets and at least indirectly aff ect us jobs and employment he did not however see revaluation of the yuan as having much effect on aggregate us employment he stated that if currenc realignment reduced imports from china they would tend to be replaced by imports from other nations that compete with china he further noted that rapid expos ure of the yuan to market forces would have uncertain consequences for chinas fra gile banking system as well as providing guarantee that the yuan would actually rise in value he also stated that the potential long term benefits to the world trading system of prosperous china are important enough that careful appro ach to currency valuation and market determined capital flow s should be followed108 the impact of us trade agreements109 the united states has been

states entered into trade negotiations with mexi co which later incl uded canada to form the north american free tr ade agreement effective in january 1994 nafta is the first major trade agreement the united states has had with developing country where per capita income is much lower than in the united states the difference in income levels raised concerns that mexicos lower wages would lead to large number of us jobs being relocated to mexi co as industries adjusted to the changes in trade and investment regulations while the integration of the us mexican and canadian economies was expected to ma ke the us economy more productive and globally competitive the adjustment costs were expected to be more concentrated in communities with large number of manufacturing jobs such as the automotive textile and appa rel industries the full effects of nafta on the u s economy are still unclear proponents of nafta claim that the agreement has increased us trade with mexico and canada and benefitted the us ec onomy they believe that nafta has had positive impact on us trade and investme nt with canada nd mexico and that nafta has increased us expor ts to canada and mexico112 critics of nafta argue that hundreds of thousands of us jobs have been lost because of the agreement nafta critics generally base their arguments on the increasing trade deficit with mexico stating that increasing us imports from mexico have caused plant closures and job losses in the united states there are number of reasons why the overall effects of nafta are not easily measured first it is

investment such as economic growth and exchange rates both of which affect consumer spending and th demand for imports foreign investment employment leve ls and relative wages second some of the market opening measures in mexico that resulted from nafta were already taking place prior to the agreement and nafta may have only accelerated the process while trade expansion arguably has benefitte d the overall us economy in terms of improved production pro cesses and the increased ava ilability of goods and services for us consumers at lower cost there also have been job losses associated with nafta two of the us workforce sectors that have been most affected are the textiles and apparel industry and the automotive industry the overall effect of nafta on the u s economy has been relatively small primarily because twoway tr ade with mexico amounts to less than three percent of us gdp therefore any changes in trade patterns with mexico would not be significant in relation to the overall us economy in some sectors however trade related effects could be expected to be more significant especially in those industries that were more exposed to the removal of tariff and nontariff trade barriers such as the textile apparel nd automotive industries most of the traderelated effects of nafta may be attributed to changes in us trade and investment patterns with mexico at the time of nafta imple mentation the uscanada free trade agreement already had been in effect for five years and some industries in the united states and canada were alr eady highly integrated most tariffs on industrial products traded between the united states and canada were zero at the time of nafta implementation in contrast mexico had followed an ggressive importsubstitution policy for many years

textiles and apparel were the elimination of us tariffs and quotas for goods coming from mexico and elimination of mexican tariffs on us tex tile and apparel produc ts goods are required to meet the

in this report were eliminated in january 2005 and all exporters of such products to the us market as well as domestic producers are faced with intensified competition from china116 between 1993 and 2001 us trade in textiles and appa rel with mexico increased more rapidly than us trade with all countries suggesting that mexico may have begun supplying the us market with goods that would have otherwise been supplied by asian countries the shar of us trade with mexico in textiles and apparel increased from 8 of us wo rld trade in textiles and apparel in 1993 to 16 percent in 2001 in comparison the share of us trade with asia in textiles and apparel decreased from 55 in 1993 to 45 in 2001 the trade deficit with mexico in textiles and apparel also increased more rapidly than the total us deficit in these products from 760 million in 1993 to 42 billion in 2001 while the large increase in us imports from mexico may have di splaced us workers in the textiles and apparel industries so studies have suggested that nafta may have helped the us textile industry by sh ifting production from asian c ountries to north america for example one study reported that u s imports from nafta countries tend to have higher us content than imports from outside the region such as china hong kong and taiwan117 nafta automotive provisions include the phased elimination of tariffs

goods were phased out by 2003 in addition mexico agreed to lower or entirely remove investment restrictions in the automotive sector which provided an incentive to increase us i nvestment in mexico the united states eliminated the 25 tariff on motor vehicles manufactured in mexico and phased out the 25 tariff on mexican light trucks th united states also phased out tariffs on most mexican auto parts mexicos impor tance to the us motor vehicle industry has increased as result us motor vehicle exports to mexico increased from almost nothing in 1990 to 41 billion in 2004 but imports from

later date the united states and other importing countries retained right to apply special safeguard mechanisms exclusively to china for specified periods if warranted by import rges as noted above in

manufacturing of chinas accession to the wto is still uncertain us trade barriers are generally low reforms in chinas trade and investment regulations which are usually more restrictiv may have contributed to increased us exports chinas entry into the wto requires significant reforms to its trade regime including reduction in foreign investment re strictions which have resulted in significant new opportunities for us exporters and for us investment in china the liberalization of foreign i nvestment regulations in china could provide an incentive for us manufacturing firms to relocate production facilities to china as discussed earlier many us producers have complained that trade with china has become progressively more unbalanced as result of chinas maintaining an undervalued currency exchange rate122 some analysts argue that chinas try to the wto will accelerate the rising trade deficit with china and severely affect employment in manufacturing the sector most likely to be adversely affected by trade123 while economists generally believe that trade deficits in the united states ve not hampered the ove rall creation of jobs they do influence the types of jobs that are created because of the traderelated changes in composition of us output124 the united states has had rising trade deficit with china since the late 1980s long before chinas entry to the

barriers were part of china s industrial policy to achieve economic development of specific industry sectors the itc study found that because the number of nontariff ba rriers overlapped acro ss

from the following changes in chinas nontariff trade regulations new official rules and mechanisms for technology transfer and the protection of intellectual property rights elimination of chinas export performance requirements and the removal of domes tic content requirements125 the textile and apparel i ndustries may be among th manufacturing industries most likely to be affected the itc study examined the impact of chinas participation in the atc nd estimated that the overall effect on the us economy would be positive but that us apparel pr oducers would experience the more adverse effects the study estimated that the ited states would ex perience economywide welfare gains of 26 billion in 2006 and gdp increase of about 19 billion this was projected to occur from efficiency gains from factor reallocation in the us economy and from lowerpriced goods importe d into the united states the results of the study predicted that chinas participation in the atc would likely have small impact on us imports of textiles and larger effect on us imports of apparel the study suggested that the increase in chinas exports of textiles and apparel would likely come at the expense of other suppliers to the us market but that the us textile and apparel industries c ould also be affected this study predicted that the most serious adverse effects would likely be experienced after december 31 2004 the end of the phaseout period but as noted earlier the bush administration has already initiated certain safeguard actions on imports of chinese textile and pparel products126 these findings on textiles and apparel if applied more broadly to the full range of consumer goods reinforce the view expressed to congress in 2003 testimony by gregory mankiw then chairman of the council of economic advisers cea he noted that 60 of us imports from chin consisted of consumer goods and only 28 of capital goods while 47 of us exports to china were capital goods mankiw argued that this is compatible with the comparative advantage of each country with china specializing in items that are relatively intensive in the use of lessskilled labor while us manufactured exports t end to be goods that are made by relatively highskilled workers ma nkiw further noted that while imports from china increased as percentage of total u s imports the percentage of imports from other pacific rim count

study by john tatom referred to earlier in this report 143 mankiw house ways and means committee testimony p 7elasticity of demand for manufactured goods is responsible for significant share of the secular decline in manufacturing employment142 the huge advantage china holds in terms of access to low cost labor for example is unlikely to be reversed by policies that enhance the produc tivity of us workers in cases where low foreign wage costs are the key factor in location decisions the required increases in productivity would have to be large enough to overcome the differences in us wages and benefits in citing the five industries that have contributed most significantly to us manufacturing job losses since 2000 former cea chairman mankiw noted that the leading industry as source of job losse s was computer and electronic equipment 16 of total losses and semiconductors and co mponents ranked fifth 75 these two industries are in hightechnology fiel ds have high rates of manufacturing productivity growth and have benefitted from direct nd indirect federal rd support by contrast the other three l eading industries contributing just under 11 of total manufacturing job losses each were more trad itional industries machinery fabricated metal products nd transportation equipment143 this comparison would seem to attenuate connec tion between programs to target industry rd support and job creation and preser vation although such polic ies may well have other benefits to commend themhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32179crs61 144 new directions in industrial policy oecd policy brief no31997 available at httpwww1oecdorgpublicationspol_brie f19979703_polhtm viewed on september 29 2003 145 ibid pp 27 146 this section was written by stephen cooneyindustrial competitiveness policy the organization for economic coopera tion and development oecd issued policy brief in 1997 which addressed the issue of i ndustrial policy among member nations144 the oecd determined that while many members had pursued targeted industrial policy based on either geographic or sectoral targets by the late 1990s the focus had shifted to maki ng the economy as whole more conducive to market transactions the oecd report identifie s several reasons for this change in philosophy the globalization of the world economy and the opportunities available as result changed the strategic focus of enterprises companies increasingly view the market for inputs labor and capital as well as outputs on global scale depending less on the national market liberalization of world trade and capital flows made international markets far more open to competiti on the development of knowledgebased economy suppor ted by high technology inputs made the sectoral industrial policy goals of s upporting traditional aging i ndustries appear increasingly costly modern industrial competitiveness polic focuses on the economy as whole initiatives designed to improve nations business environment streamlining or eliminating some forms of regulation reducing impediment s to trade and investment flows and encouraging research and development have replaced targeted policies to the extent that subsidies are provided they tend to encourage investment in new markets rather than investing to shore up declining industries145 other key parts of industrial competitiveness policy include the reform of corporate structure and practices and co rporate governance these are important elements in encouraging transparency in markets capital is less likely to flow through markets where the perception exists that results are rigged or the data provided about firms financia ls are not accurate in todays market the inability to access capital is significant lia bility to economic performance conclusion and outlook146 the first part of this report showed th at in terms of productivity and output us manufacturing remained strong and competitive between 1991 and 2000 its real output has tripled over the pa st generation and grew by 30 in the latter period which represents peaktopeak comp arison while there have been major divergences among different industry sectors such dive rgences may be regarded as part of the process of transition and indus trial transformation in the economy the economic downturn after 2000 may be regarded as essentially cyclical event inhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32179crs62 which recovery was impeded by some unique events such as the 911 attacks and the uncertainties of the iraq war and during which there also were present some elements of structural change among the industries studied in detail in this report tex tiles and apparel have demonstrated the most negative performance in terms of job loss and the termination of the remaining textile import quotas has placed even stronger international competitive pressure on the industry the information technology products manufacturing industry especi ally semiconductors was by contrast able to regain and maintain its overall globa l leadership position though it did shed jobs after the dotcom bust and will face future ch allenges the automotive industry has remained strong in the united states though the domestic industry has changed dramatically in structure and the us trade balance in automotive products has continued to worsen the traditional big three domestic manufacturers and one of the big three is now controlled by foreignbased company have been challenged by the growth of foreignow ned transplant production especially in passenger cars now toyota and nissan are also making inroads into the light truck market the overall manufactures trade balan ce has moved sharply in negative direction at an alarming rate according to some analysts they note that it is the largest component in the deteriora tion in the overall us trade account manufactured imports exceeded 1 trillion nnually in recent years and are now 50 60 higher annually than the level of ex ports this development may be ascribed in some degree to the high exchange rate of the dollar between 1996 and 2002 problem which could be alleviated by r ecent moderating trends however while concern is often expressed bout the trade deficit and f oreign outsourcing of us manufacturing jobs it is not often noted th at manufacturing employment is declining in virtually all major indus trial countries as well as many developing countries especially china thus decline in manufacturing employ ment is not uniquely american or mature industrial country phenom enon it may be considered as part of the process of global adjustment to new patterns of production trade and the international division of labor encouraged by dramatic realtime industrial management changes made possible by information technolog advances and trade liberalization this is not encouraging to us manufact uring workers who have lost their jobs to the communities where they live and in many cases to their former employers who have not been able to adapt to the new globally competitive environment since 1950 manufacturing employment has declined from 30 of all nonfarm jobs to less than 15 unionization levels have dec lined by similar levels since 1982 and have fallen in all fields except government em ployment by 2004 there were fewer than 15 million manufacturing workers in the united states almost five million fewer than the alltime peak in 1979 and fewer th an in 1950 and measured as share of currentdollar us gdp manufacturing output has declined from about 30 to about 15 since 1960 while this last statistic reflects the efficiency and productivity of usbased manufacturing constant competitive pre ssures may be encouraging manufacturinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32179crs63 147 secretary of commerce don evans remarks to the detroit economic club sept 15 2003 148 the roundtables were held between april and september 2003 and are listed with names of participants in the appendix to manufacturing in america 149 in addition to the commerce department report detailed analysis of the impact of such issues prepared for the manufacturers allia nce and the manufacturing

the roundtables is summarize d on pp 3334 with details elaborated in pp 3458 of manufacturing in america employers to cut their workforces or to move production to other locations the conclusion from this perspective is that manufacturing employment like agriculture before it is declining relatively and absolutely in the united states and more rapidly in the last three years the view of the bush administration as outlined in september 2003 speech by thensecretary of commerce don evans is that the present marketbased system with minimal government intervention in the economy can be adjusted and reinforced at certain points to provide an adequate response to actual or prospective losses of us competitiveness147 as part of its investigation into the condition of us manufacturing the commerce partment conducte d total of 23 roundtables with groups representing manuf acturing sectors or specific topics of interest148 manufacturing in america summarized in its second chapter what the commerce department reports as those policy areas that manufacturers themselves believe require immediate attention to ensure the competitiveness of us manufacturing the report says that manufacturers want first greater focus within government on manufacturing and competitiveness that said they reportedly also asked for stronger policies to promote growth both at home and abroad as part of the more concentrated focus the manufacturers were also said to ask for more assistance from government in controlling costs that are coincidental to manufacturing such as taxes health care costs the costs of regulatory compliance especially with respect to environmental issues and the costs of various liabilities faced by manufacturers149 the manufacturers were also reported as urging greater government commitment to encourage private sector research and development as well as in bringing innovations to market more broadly th report continued manufacturers seek renewed emphasis from ll levels of government to i nvest in education and training institutions finally the report emphasized that manufacturers seek international trade and monetary policies that create free fair and open competitive environment this means with respect both to opening foreign markets and to eliminating unfair competition from foreign producers abroad and in the domestic us market150 the last part of manufacturing in america laid out recommendations for addressing the challenges raised by us manufacturers these included making recently approved tax relief measures permanent and making permanent

concrete was greater commerce department coordination with the established manufacturing extensi on partnership mep152 these initiatives included review of existing federal programs that invest in manufacturing rd to establish priorities designed to improve us manufacturing technology the report also emphasized the opening of international markets through future trade agreements as well as tougher enforcement of us trade laws153 the report specifically proposes reor ganization and strengthening of the commerce departments international functi ons to strengthen both export promotion and enforcement policy against unfairly traded imports154 it proposed creation of the position of assistant secretary for ma nufacturing and services who would be the principal point of contact with the manufacturing sector and would assist the secretary of commerce in his role as the federal governments chief advocate for the manufacturing sector155 the position was subsequen tly established with

workers fact sheet by paul j graney 158 joseph stiglitz economics of the public sector new york ww norton co 1986 pp 8395 the quotations are from p 91 159 congress has frequently considered countercyclical programs to create jobs during recessions but has enacted such major programs since 1983 see crs report rl31138 countercyclical job creation program s of the postworld war ii era by linda levine 160 the appendix was written by bernard gelbof 2002 pl 107210 which expanded and nhanced assistance through the trade adjustment assistance program to workers dislocated by import competition157 us manufacturing may however be affected by more than cyclical problems or the types of international and domestic issues addressed in the commerce department recommendations and related legislative measures the secular decline in manufacturing employment the inab ility of the economy to generate new manufacturing jobs in the early stages of the last two us domestic economic recoveries and the growth of huge nd possibly permanent manufactures trade deficit could be caused by many factors these coul d include mismatch between the skills abilities and education of worker s leaving one industry and those required by another there may also be reluctance of workers to move from one geographical region to another or to emba rk on an entirely new career at an older age the economist joseph stiglitz has desc ribed unemployment and underutilization of industrial capacity as perhaps the most widely recognized symptoms of market failure as stiglitz then continues socalled market failure may occur for variety of reasons the fact that mark ets have failed to produce full employment does not in itself imply that there is role for the government to play one must be able to show in addition that there ar policies through which the government can improve the functioning of the economy158 this may be considered by some to justify more active government role in the economy than contemplated by the bush administration159 for example proposals have included more farreaching efforts to improve worker skills to promote manufacturing innovation through increased privatepublic sector partnerships to restore and develop public infrastructure and to encourage domestic manufacturing activities considered strategic for reasons of national security or national economic development but proposals of this type also imply other costs both in terms of direct expenditures and the indirect rea llocation of resources such efforts can support manufacturing but possibly at the expense of the overall economy appendix change in industrial classification system160 the standard industrial classification s ic system provided the structure for categorizing

1994economy on logical and systematic basi s since before world war ii and until recently it was replaced by the north american industrial classification system naics effective october 1 2000 the development of naics grew out of realization that the sic had become outdated and b negotiations for the north american free trade agreement161 when it was found that comparable i ndustry classification systems would be necessary for the three sign atory countries canada xico and the united states under the sic establishments were cl assified according to the primary product or group of products they produce or handle or the primary service they provide in addition many industries now prominen t such as computer and software production of course ither did not exist or constituted an insignificant part of the economy the naics classifies according to the activity that an establishment is primarily engaged in establishments using similar raw materials capital equipment and labor are classified together in ddition the naics reorganizes the structure of the sic to reflect the current struct ure of the us economy including the introduction of new industry or sector categ ories such as computer and software manufacture and information which in cludes publishing motion picture and sound recording broadcasting telecommuni cations information services and data processing october 1 2000 was the first date that da ta began to be collected according to the naics structure unavoidably the switch is resulting in breaks in comparability some substantial in time series between the sic and the naics periods most federal government da ta collecting andor publishing agencies have begun to revise their sicbased series in order to produce complete comparable series at this writing this large undertaking is far from complete in most cases and thus necessitates the use of the sicbased series when an analyst wishes to examine trends of number of years ago
