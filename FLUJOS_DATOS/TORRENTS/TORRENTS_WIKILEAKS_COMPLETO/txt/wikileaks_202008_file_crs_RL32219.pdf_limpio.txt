for health care services for certain lowincome individuals since the programs inception in 1965 medicai d has played vital role in providing longterm care services to individuals with disability or longterm illness long term care services refer to wide rang of supportive and health services for individuals with disability or chronic illn ess medicaid primarily finances long term care services and supports in institu tions but has increasingly supported care in home and communitybased settings under an optional program benefit states have been developing options for medicaid beneficiaries with disability consumers to manage and direct th eir home and communitybased services including hiring their own providers as an alternative to traditional model of using agencybased providers these options fo r consumer directi on have most often included personal care services and ot her home and communitybased services authorized under section 1915c of the soci security act the premise underlying consumerdirection is that the individual receiving the service is able to determine what he or she requires and can use good j udgment in purchasing those services and overseeing their delivery the recently enacted deficit reducti on act of 2005 pl 109171 added provision to medicaid law that gives states the option of covering consumerdirected personal care services other than room nd board services must be based on written plan of care and the states program must meet certain other criteria such as notification assessment and counseling of beneficiaries this provision becomes effective january 1 2007 as states pursue options for consume rdirection important questions remain what beneficiary protections need to be built into these programs how does one ensure the quality of consumerdirected services and what types of services are most compatible with consumerdirected service options this report discusses options for cons umerdirected serv ices under medicaid factors

functioning because of disability or ch ronic condition since its inception in 1965 medicaid has played vital role in providing longterm care services especially nursing facility care which all states must cover for individuals over age 21 other examples of longterm care services which may be av ailable under medicaid include range of home care services including personal care services or ongoing nursing care1 personal care services include assisting an individual who has limitations in activities of daily living adls such as bathing eating dr essing and cooking medicaid longterm care services

respite services provide temporary services to an individual with disability to give the normal caregiver break from providing care home modifications refer to items such as ramp to home or bars

pay for the room and board of that individual states also have the option of re questing permission from the federal government to provide additional home and communitybased services for individuals who would otherwise be in an institution these other services may be offered as supplement to or instead of those optional services available through the state plan this option is referred to as home and communitybased hcbs waiver which is authorized under secti on 1915c of the social security act unlike most services offered as part of the medicaid state plan the hcbs waiver allows states to

disability or chronic illness 9 may also be referred to as personal care attendant attendant or aideservices provided in home and communitybased settings longterm care spending represents 37 of total dicaid service expenditures7 many medicaid beneficiaries consumers receive their longterm care services from agencybased providers that are certified to provide medicaid services8 in some cases there may also be case manager who plays role in coordinating and overseeing the consumers l ongterm care services pending upon the structure of the states program the case manager or the agencybased provider may consult with the consumer assess the consumers needs decide what services are needed and monitor the care provided the agencybased provider is required to have an agreement with the state medicaid agency and in the case of personal care services workers are referred to as direct care workers9 depending upon the states ru and the specific provider the consumer may have varying degrees of ability to determine who comes into the home to provide the service eg is this someone they know andor trust what time of day the care is received where that direct care worker can go with the individual eg school church work dical appointments how much the worker is paid and the process for getting backup worker when the regularly scheduled worker is unavailable many consumers have expressed an interest in increasing their ability to direct and manage some of these key elements of the assistance they receive state and federal policymakers have re sponded to this interest by developing opportunities for consumerdirection starting w ith nonmedicaid programs such as statefunded long term care programs and more recently in medicaid longterm care programs as described in this

communitybased services as an alternative to institutions such as nursing homes and developing options that respond to consumer preferences cost both federal and state governments face increasing medicaid longterm care costs these growing expenditures have created willingness by some policymakers to test alternative approaches which change how medicaid serv ices are delivered and provide better services at lower or qual cost to the medicaid program workforce shortage many states are facing critical shortages in the direct longterm care workforce some consumers do not receive the number of service hours they ar assessed to need because the provider agency cannot find staff to deliver the service this is particular challenge in rural areas consumerdirected models of delivering services may expand the labor pool by allowing consumer to select andor hire friend family member or neighbor to provide direct care services such persons may not have otherwise been employed by traditional home care agency19 changing perceptions many believe that providing care to persons with disability and to frail older persons should move from purely medical model of care to one that considers other factors ie social model of care such as the individuals involvement in the community or his or her interest in entering the workforce consumerdirected models can create flexible array of services that can be responsive to these other factors in addition to providing necessary medical and social services in the home consumerdirection is not one model of service delivery but variety of approaches with common goal of movi ng the decisionmaking authority for services closer to the consumer who receives those services20 consumerdirectedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32219crs8 20 continued

this description does not thoroug hly discuss each approach but provides general overview of how many consumerdirected programs have been structured individualized budget in an individualized budget the state establishes total dollar value for the services needed by the individual the state contracts with an organization such as medicaid provider to track the individuals budget and in some cases to employ the direct care workers who are selected by the consumers however within th amount of the individuals budget the consumer has discretion over what services he or she will receive generally within broad state guidelines who will provide those services and how much that direct care worker will be paid direct cash in the direct cash approach the state also establishes total dollar value for the services needed by the individual however the cash allotment is pr ovided directly to the consumer rather than the provider the c onsumer recruits hires and manages the direct care worker the direct care worker is employed by the consumer does not have to be certified medicaid provider and is not required to have written contract with the state the state oversees the program but takes on ve ry different role as described later in this report agencybased vs consumerdirected longterm care programs consumerdirected longterm care models differ significantly from an agency based approach

programs when there is case manager the duties often include assessing the need for services and locating managing coordinating and monitoring those servicesvariable depending on the type of program generally the consumer has more independence and responsibility and assumes many of the functions of the case manager the case manager sometimes referred to as service consultant may take on other functions such as education guidance and reviewing consumers expenditure plan and receipts for purchased goods and services supervision of direct care workeragency consumer or in some programs the consumer receives support from service consultant fiscal responsibilities agency variable may be handled by the county state contracted intermediary or the consumer degree of consumer choicevariable

is not consistent and there are many different program authorities there have been some attempts to get general information about the size and sc ope of consumerdirected programs recent inventory released in april 2006 reported that all states except mississippi had either operational or planned consumerdirected medicaid longterm care programs these programs vary in the size of the project ranging from pilot project to statewide program and in the specific disability group covered some focus only on individuals with developmental disabilities others serve all disability groups22 experience of different disability groups the consumerdirection principles are the same across types of disabilities however different groups of individuals with disability have developed different initiatives to fit their specific needs and th services they receive for individuals with physical disability and the elderly consumerdirected programs have generally focused on personal care services for individuals with developmental disability consumerdirection has been referred to as selfdetermination and has often included other longterm care services in addition to personal care services such as respite and adult day health for some individuals with developmental disability family members may also have role directing services for individuals with serious and persistent mental illness opportunities for cons umers to direct their own services have not been as prevalent there is significant and growing interest in consumerempowerment p eersupport services and p eer participation on

contract the managed care organization is responsible for selecting and paying the service providers and under some circumstances can use savings from th program to provide enhanced services to beneficiaries29 few states provide medicaid longterm care services to beneficiaries through managed care program the ability of the managed care organization to select and pay service providers and provide additional services from pr ogram savings crea tes opportunities for consumerdirection for example the ma naged care program could hire the direct care worker who is selected by the consumer and permit the consumer to manage and train that worker the managed care program could also use program savings to provide flexible bene fit to consumers for the purpose of increasing their independence for example one consum er could purchase an assistive device or piece of equipment while another could purchase transportation services survey of 45 medicaid managed care plans that in cluded longterm care services found that over half practiced some form of cons umerdirection and 32 of the programs surveyed allowed individuals to hire and fire their own workers30 it is also possible for medicaid managed care programs to provide cash benefit to beneficiaries to pay for services howeve r payments directly to beneficiaries may be counted as resources in determining eligibility for the supplemental security income ssi program unless they received waiver from the social security administration using the authority of sect ion 1110b of the social security act

implementing consumerdirected services as described earlier the traditiona l medicaid provider model for most beneficiaries receiving home and communitybased services is through an agency the provider must meet certain qualifications and have an agreement with the state medicaid agency the direct care worker is an employee of the provider agency and the consumer has varying degrees of di scretion over how services are provided although there is wide variation in consumerdirected longterm care programs most states implementing these programs must sh ift the focus or redesign some of their administrative structures or program policies if the state wants to move their agency provided service model to consumerdirected one this section outlines some of the administrative and policy considerations for state medicaid agencies in developing consumerdirected programs eligibility to participate in consumerdirected medicaid longterm care programs the individual must be medicaid ligible and demonstrate need for that type of service eg personal care this means meeting financial standards and having given level of impairmentdisability in some programs state may also require that the individual pass cognitive or competency test to determine whether or not he or she is capable of directing the service and ma naging the cash allotment many programs allow family member or legal guardian to direct the services on behalf of child or an individual who is unable to express his or her preferenceshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32219crs22 48 the term intermediary servi ce

program nd additional repor ting requirements several states implementing consumerdirected models have contracted with an organization usually referred to as fiscal intermediary to assist in the administration of the cash bene fit or individualized budget 48 the fiscal intermediary assists the consumer with variety of ta sks depending on the programs design and policies including collecting the direct care workers time sheets issuing the checks to the direct care workers or tracking the consumers expenditures other responsibilities for the fiscal inte rmediary may include conducting cr iminal background checks of the direct care workers filing tax reports or making sure that amounts are withheld from the workers ear nings for social security and medicare unemployment insurance and

consumerdirected programs have an individual available to provide consultation and support to the consumer the activities of the service consultant may include assisting the individual in developing his or her service plan or consulting with the consumer on any employeremployee issues eg recruiting firing the role of this individual differs from the more traditional role of case manager in which the case manager is re sponsible for assessing the individuals needs and coordinating and overseeing all of the services the consumer receives by provider agencies consumer education and training under consumerdirected program consumers take on new roles and responsib ilities including directing and managing workers working with fiscal intermediary to submit time sheets and veloping an

participating in consumer directed programs and developing written training materials for example consumerdirected program in new jersey has developed consumer guide for individuals not using fiscal intermediary the guide contains information on filing for tax status as an em ployer workers compensation and paying wages and overtime50 determining consumers cash allotment under the current medicaid system indi viduals are generally assessed to see how many hours of particular service ar required to meet their needs the consumer is then eligible to receive that number of hours of service unless the number of hours ex ceeds the states limits on the amount of services that can be provided andor if the cost of thos services exceeds amount permitted under section 1915c home and communitybased waiver under consumerdirected approach the state establishes total dollar value to cover the participants services th formula to calculate the amount of this allotment can be based on va riety of factors including the number of hours that would have been provided to the individual based on an assessment of need for receiving services through an agencybased model multiplied by the states rate for personal care services historical expenditures of partic ular individual or group eg the average amount over the last three years decrease in the amount to reflect the average number of service hours actually used versus the num ber of planned hours eg due to unplanned worker absences andor periodic opportunity to reassess the allotment if the consumers needs change who is the employer key consideration in implementing consumerdirected medicaid longterm care program is who will be the legal employer of the individuals providing the service eg the direct care worker th options for who serves as the employer include the following the consumer an organization that provides services to an individual fiscal intermediary provider agency that is participating in

responsibilities can be confusing and administr atively burdensome these requirements can include employer contributions to social security and medicare federal andor state unemployment taxes and workers compensation51 not surprisingly in cases when consumers have been the employers most states have contracted with fiscal intermediary to assist consumers with these obligations52 most consumers found this assistance to be very helpful53 service providers there are four primary issues for states to address in determining who can provide services under consume rdirected longterm care program provider qualifications medicaid law requires stat to have standards for determining which providers may participate in the medicaid program federal law provides explicit standards and certificati on processes for some providers such as home health agencies and nursing homes for other providers standards and procedures are generally governed by state laws regulations and licensure requirements for example the state may require that direct care workers complete criminal background check in genera l independent medicaid providers as discussed earlier must meet the same re quirements for training and certification as direct care workers who are employed by an agency for other types of consumer directed programs the state has flexibility in establishing the standards and requirements for who is allowed to provide personal care services provider rates under medicaid states ve considerable latitude in determining how much providers will be paid for particular service however the rates must be approve d by cms generally states establish single rate for particular category of provider under consumerdirected mode l some states have permitted consumers to establish the rate that would paid to

daily and often several times per day tracheostomy is continuedindividuals may be more co mfortable having someone th ey know provide this type of care in addition with direct care wo rker shortages in many states individuals may have an easier time finding someone they know to provide care in many cases hiring friends and nonlegally respons ible family member s is permitted under medicaid the friend or family member can either become an employee of medicaid provider agency or if permitted by the state be selfemployed as an independent provider which is described in the medicaid st ate plan section if the state wants to pay legally responsible relatives as direct care worker this is permitted under one of thr ee authorities 1 under section 1915c home and communitybased waiver these individuals can be paid for providing extraordinary care 2 under section 1115 waiver authority legally responsible re latives can be paid for providing services and 3 starting in january 2007 states using the selfdirected personal assistance option under secti on 1915j can pay legally responsible relatives54 paying legally responsible relatives to provide ca re has caused some debate about an individuals responsibilities to pr ovide care to family member opponents say that legally responsible relatives have an obligati on to provide care for family member and that we are using public funds to pay for care that would otherwise by provided for free informally propone nts note that the care required can be intensive and can affect parents or s pouses ability to hold other employment and that paying family members can help ease the shortage of direct care workers which many states are experiencing effect on current service providers finally some states implementing consumerdirected programs have enc ountered significant opposition from trad itional agencybased providers who believe that consumerdirected options will negatively affect their businesses by drawing away consumers the state may have to work with the provider community to overcome oppos ition to consumerdirected programs particularly those types of programs that provide cash directly to the consumer to select

the clarity with which the issue is addressed two specific vehicles used by states which are relevant for consumer direction include exemption and delegation an exemption provision describes in law or regulation who is not governed by the nurse practice act some nurse practice acts provide general exemption for i ndividuals who are providing personal care assistance to family member under delegation nurse can delegate certain activities to another individual but the nur has oversight responsibility for those services56 if the state allows for delegati on the consumerdirected program will need to have processes in place for nurse to delegate and ove rsee specific activities fraud and abuse commonly raised concern by policym akers in consumerdirected programs is the potential for fraud and abuse eith er by consumers who are given cash allotment to purchase their services or by others who may exploit the consumer according to kevin mahoney the na tional program director for the cash and counseling demonstration described later after three and half years the demonstration has found major instances of fraud and abuse57 many consumer directed programs include policies and procedures to minimize fraud and abuse and maintain accountability for public funds such as approving the consumers plan for using the funding tracking utilization of services and collecting receipts quality final consideration for states in implementing consumerdirected programs is how to assure the quality of services provided to consumer medicaid law and regulations prescribe quality of care standards in nursing homes that participate in medicaid and federal and state governments have substantial role in surveying and certifying nursing homes most communitybased longterm care services do

has not yet been fully explored however initial findings from research and demonstration activities have shown increased consumer satisfaction reduced unmet service need s and an overall increase in medicaid expenditures without consistent offsetting decreases in ot her services as congress looks at policy questions re lated to consumerdirected programs and evaluates the experience of existing federal and state programs it may want to consider the following policy questions should participation in consumerdirected programs be voluntary or mandatory most existing consumerdirected programs are voluntary depending upon the program and type of service there may be tasks that are timeconsuming or challenging such as managing the cash allotme nt finding and making informed decisions about qualified providers or supervising workers some consumers using longterm care services or other health care services may be unable or unwilling to assume these tasks or may be satisfied with the services they receive from traditional provider what types of services are most compatible with consumer directed model existing consumerd irection programs have generally included services that ar ongoing and predictable such as personal care other services that follow this pattern may be appropriate for consum erdirection eg home health services physical therapy and adult day car however current models of consumerdirection may be less viable for services that are less predictable eg inpatie nt hospital visit or for conditions that are subject to acute flareups how much financial risk should the consumer have for example should standards be established for determining an individuals cash allotment the existing consumerdirected models have minimal financial risk for the consumer the programs are voluntary the cash allotment is based on an assessment of needs the service utilization pattern is generally ongoing and predictable and the individuals functional limitations are periodically reassessedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32219crs29 to what extent does the consumer have access to and information about potential service providers many individuals who volunteered for the existing consumerdirected programs had pool of individuals willing to pr ovide direct care services in addition the work required min imal skills and the consumer generally knew the qualifications of the individual providing the services three considerations in consumerdirection for other services are 1 the potential pool of qualified providers 2 consumers access to those provide rs and 3 the availability of information to distinguish between the qualifications and services of different providers is the administrative infrastructure available to support consumerdirected model fiscal intermediaries have played significant role in implementing existing consumerdirected services however these types of organizations have generally maintained fairly specialized role in the marketplace if consumer direction were expanded the num ber of fiscal intermediaries available may need to expand and their activities may need to change depending on the type of service what role if any should th federal government have in assuring the quality of consumerdirected services designing system of quality in communitybased longterm care services that balances the consumers preferen ces the individuals safety and accountability to the public is an ongoing challenge for both state and federal policymakers some policymakers believe that the current monitoring and regulatory approach applied to institutions to assure quality is not appropriate for communitybased services and see an expanded role for consumerdirected approaches in improving quality they suggest that opportunities for consumers to direct and manage their services will incr ease quality because the consumers can define quality based on what is important to them choose providers who can meet those pr eferences and oversee the delivery of those services on the other hand others counter that consumers may be less likely to report or fire friend or family member who is not providing quality services it appears likely that if consumer directed services were expanded more broadly policymakers may need to develop more specific quality assurance mechanisms that would insure that consumers get the services they need
