states received approximately onethird of the grants and local governments received twothirds state governments were excluded from grs beginning in the 1981 fiscal year fy in 2003 policymakers suggested using the original grs program as model for new short term grs program the fy2004 budget resolution contained proposal hconres 95 sec 605 expressing sense of the senate that 30 bill ion should be set aside over the next 18 months for state fiscal relief congress ultimately approved 20 billion in aid to states 10 billion through medicaid and 10 billion distributed by population by comparison in 1972 the federal government authorized 83 billion 421 billion in 2008 dollars for the first 18 months of the original grs program more recently the recession that began in 2008 has prompted similar proposals the rationale behind grs in 1972 cannot be traced to single political or economic objective such as economic stimulus the turbulent economic and political environment that characterized the 1960s and 1970s led proponents and opponents of grs to modify their political and economic arguments as that environment changed generally grs could be implemented to 1 initiate intergovernmental fiscal reallocation 2 address state and local government liquidity crises and 3 synchronize federal and statelocal fiscal policy revised grs program intended to help close state budget deficits estimated to be 310 billion for the remainder of fy2009 and estimated to be 647 billion for fy2010 has been advocated based on the last two objectives the budget crisis facing state and local governments in 2009 has generated renewed concern at the state and local level grs program designed as countercyclical initiative would encounter two primary implementation issues fiscal policy time lags and variability in the state response to grs grants in addition as with all fiscal policy the overall size of the additional federal spending is critical to the impact of the fiscal stimulus this report provides general background and analysis and does not track current legislation it will not be updated

state and local governments that does not impose specific or categorical spending requirements on the recipient government the united states implemented grs program in 1972 that expired on september 30 1986 congress looked to the bygone grs program once before as an option designed to address the fiscal year 2003 fy2003 and fy2004 state budget shortfalls 215 billion and 722 billion respectively1 some observers have suggested that revenue sharing program that provided states with grants to forestall spending cuts and tax increases in 2009 may deter procyclical2 actions by states and produce national fiscal stimulus the budget gaps for is estimated to be 310 billion for the remainder of fy2009 and for fy2010 it is estimated to be 647 billion3 an examination of the grs program that existed from 1972 to 1986 could provide some historical perspective if policy makers were to consider revised grs program in 2009 the first section provides brief overview of grs as authorized by the state and local fiscal assistance act of 1972 pl 92512 the 1972 act and the three extensions4 the second section analyzes the economic rationale for grs the third section analyzes grs in the context of its possible use for stimulus of the nations economy in 2009 including estimated distribution to the states based on the original grs formula the appendix provides more detailed legislative history of the

income6 generally the greater the tax effort and population the larger the grant in contrast the higher the per capita personal income the smaller the grant more specifically section 106 of the grs legislation stipulates that under the threepart formula each state shall receive an amount which bears the same ratio to the amount appropriated under that section for that period as the amount

factor and st ist i st iperinctaxesgtef or state i general tax effort factor the two ratios in the formula the relative income factor rif and the general tax effort factor gtef were intended to adjust the state allocations based on the states abilitytopay and tax structure the rif for state is the pre capita income for the us divided by the per capita income of the state if the states rif is greater than one then it is considered relatively low income analogously rif less than one indicates state has relatively high income in the threepart grs formula the higher states rif the greater the share of revenue the gtef was considered important for grs because it created disincentive for states to reduce taxes and rely more on the federal government for revenue over time the gtef is total state tax collections as share of state personal income in the grs formula the larger the gtef component the greater the share of revenue under the original grs the first step in the allocation procedure was to calculate each states share based on the three variable formula after each states share was determined onethird of the total amount was allocated to the state government and twothirds to local general purpose governments within the state 7 the twothirds portion was then distributed to each geographically defined county parish area within the state using the same three variable formula used to determine the state share each government with in the county area then received an amount equal to the ratio of taxes it collected to total taxes collected by all general purpose governments in the county 8 the allocation formula was criticized for generatin g inequitable treatment of local governments generally the arguments arose from similar governments within state receiving different revenue sharing payments primarily because of their geographic location9 according to gao report these inequities are created primarily by tiering allocation procedures whereby revenue sharing funds are first allocated to county geographic areas 10 7 the automatic state grs allocation was discontinued after fy1980 8 all tax calculations were adjusted to exclude taxes collected exclusively for schools 9 more detail on this critique of the old allocation scheme can be found in the following us general accounting office changes in revenue sharing formul would

through eventual passage of the 1972 act and subsequent extensions general economic conditions and the political environment changed dramatically thus the proponents and opponents of grs modified their political and economic arguments depending on the current political and economic conditions because of this turbulence the rationale behind grs cannot be traced to single political or economic objective this section of the report summarizes three frequently mentioned economic rationales behind grs to initiate an intergovermental fiscal reallocation to address state and local government liquidity crises and to synchronize federal and statelocal fiscal policy httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31936g9g142g151g142g155g138g149g561g20g142g159g142g151g158g142g561g21g145g138g155g146g151g144

by the federal tax regime also the federal spending objectives are replaced in part by state and local spending priorities proponents of reallocation cite the more progressive and thus desirable structure of federal taxes11 however an assessment of the merits of more progressive tax structure require subjective claims of what is fair taxation even if there is agreement that more progressive structure is needed for fairness it is unclear that grs on the relatively small scale of the previously implemented program could achieve that objective grs would also shift government spending d ecisions for the grant amount from the federal government to state and local governments the rationale for such shift can be traced to the assertion that state and local governments are better able to understand and satisfy the preferences of their residents reallocation through grs could also address the assignment issue the assignment issue arises when the revenue productivity of government does not match the spending requirements for the public services assigned to that level of government although these observations may be true for some publicly provided goods and services it is not clear that nationally the net gain in spending efficiency alone would justify grs program and the small relative size of grs program relative to overall tax collections would limit any gains in government spending efficiency the arguments for and against fiscal reallocation are subjective because they rely on measuring fairness some would argue that more progressive tax system is patently unfair while others would argue that tax system that redistributes income is more equitable and desirable fiscal reallocation would change the structure of government fiscal relationships but analysis of the degree to which it does and the desirability of such shift are beyond the scope of this report

specifically local governments often face fiscal liquidity problems that arise from revenues that fluctuate more dramatically with the business cycle than do expenditures as the economy slows revenue falls more sharply than expenditures creating budget deficit governments without sufficient reserves are then compelled to reduce expenditures or raise taxes to balance their budgets state and local governme nts cannot use debt to close deficits because of state constitutional or statutory restrictions requiring balanced budget in contrast the federal government can issue more debt when expenditures exceed revenue countercyclical grs program could help alleviate these relatively shortterm liquidity problems for states opponents of federal assistance to state and cal governments during economic slowdowns suggest that poor statelocal fiscal management creates deficit problems state and local governments could save surplus revenue during economic expansions to then use when the economy contracts and revenue falls if the rise and fall of revenue is symmetric then the revenue 11 most research has found that state and local tax regimes are generally more regressive because they rely much more heavily on sales and property taxes than on income taxes the sales tax is viewed as very regressive tax whereas the property tax has been cast as mildly regressive however some research has found that with different set of assumptions the property tax could be mildly progressive

revenue shortfalls when the economy slows however research has shown that state government budgets are generally asymmetric over the business cycle12 state and local governments tend to save less during expansions for variety of reasons political pressure from voters to reduce taxes when large budget surpluses accrue is commonly cited reason

this objective is related to the liquidity objective discussed above however the rationale for longterm grs program designed for economic stab ilization is somewhat different than one time grant to remedy temporary fiscal imbalance the federal government will typically employ monetary and fiscal policy to help stabilize consumption patterns and the price level as the economy cycles between periods of growth and recession generally stimulative fiscal policy is implemented through tax reductions or increased government spending in theory tax reductions andor increased government spending stimulates the demand for goods and services the increased demand for goods and services then leads to economic expansion and recovery this fiscal policy counters the economic downturn and is thus termed countercyclical fiscal policy however state and local governments may mitigate countercyclical federal fiscal policy if they are forced to raise taxes and reduce expenditures during recessions such procyclical state and local government response could undermine any federal fiscal stimulus during economic downturns this rationale played more prominent role for proponents of general revenue sharing while debating the 1976 extension senator muskie offered the following rationale for grs we at the federal level are trying to speed up economic recovery by cutting taxes while state and local governments are being forced to raise their own taxes thus delaying the impact of the federal effort 13 the economic situation in the early to mid 1970s about the time of initial passage of grs may seem similar to todays economic situation however the 19731975 recession was much deeper and longer and coincided with sharp oil supply shock that the current downturn has not experienced 14

principal question is will the supposed procyclical state actions in the absence of federal assistance dampen the effect of federal fiscal policy from national economic perspective closing the remaining state fy2009 budget gaps with revenue sharing would likely have little if any effect on the national economy the national conference of state legislatures reported that the remaining fy2009 gap for 38 states of 310 billion as of november 2008 is approximately 022 of the us gdp of 144 trillion hardly enough to effectuate stimulative response 16 the same nga study however notes projected shortfalls of 647 billion for fy2010 the budget gaps for fy2009 are after closing 403 billion budget shortfall before enacting the fy2009 budget onetime grs type grant to states that closed the estimated fy2009 fiscal imbalance of 31 billion and forestalled anticipated state spending cuts and tax increases for fy2010 of 647 billion could provide significant fiscal stimulus this assumes other federal spending would not be reduced and the states spent the federal grants immediately the degree of stimulus would be tempered by the net spending response of the recipient government research has generally shown that for every 1 lump sum transfer only portion is translated into new spending17 for example assume state has planned spending of 100 to be paid with own source tax revenue of 100 under this leakage theory 10 transfer from the federal government would not lead to 110 of spending instead the state may lower ownsource tax revenue 5 and use half the federal grant to cover the tax reduction the result would be an increase in government spending of 5 not the full 10 transferred g11g150g153g149g142g150g142g151g157g138g157g146g152g151g561g11g156g156g158g142g156g561 the above discussion assumed that federal spending would flow seamlessly from the federal government through states to the designated spending program two factors may result in drag on this flow first state government administration may increase the lag time and second each state would use the grant for budget priorities of varying stimulative effect following is brief analysis of these two important

the objective of fiscal policy during recession is to boost aggregate demand and generate short term economic stimulus however if the stimulus comes too late the increased spending may occur when the economy has already begun to revive and is approaching full employment in that case the stimulus becomes procyclical and possib ly inflationary policy makers should therefore use fiscal stimulus with caution because of the potential for mistimed action grs grants may be subject to two time lags thus increasing the potential for mistimed fiscal policy the first occurs at the federal level where policy makers must identify the need for stimulus then agree upon the size of the stimulus once the need and size are determined congress must then agree upon grant allocation scheme that satisfies the competing goals of equity among jurisdictions and optimal stimulus for example suppose the grant allocation formula includes component that provides greater assistance to states with greater need 19 if so states that may have been more fiscally respon sible would receive less possibly violating the fairness criterion however from broader macroeconomic perspective aid that prevents more layoffs and state government budget cuts would seem to deliver greater shortterm stimulus determining the structure of the allocation scheme could generate considerable debate possibly delaying initial implementation efforts the second time lag occurs at the state level federal grants that arrive before june 30 2009 might avert some of the procyclical state actions eg budget cuts and tax increases for many states if the grants arrive too late for fy2009 state budget officials could simply add this revenue to the operating budget for fy2010 and perhaps avoid implementing tax increases and spending cuts that would otherwise begin on july 1 2009 g21g157g138g157g142g561g4g158g141g144g142g157g561g17g153g157g146g152g151g156g561 what could states do with unconditional revenue sharing grants generally states have four options for federal grants listed in order of stimulative response increase government spending reduce taxes or rescind past tax increases reduce debt or not issue more debt andor contribute to rainy day fund or not draw down rainy day fund g507g343g508g561g11g151g140g155g142g138g156g142g561g9g152g159g142g155g151g150g142g151g157g561g21g153g142g151g141g146g151g144g561 increased spending would be the most stimulative in the short run because the grant is immediately injected into the economy this option for the states would include retaining state 18 for more on the

would have been furloughed main taining current operations that would have been reduced and not scaling back social programs such as education and healthcare theoretically this fiscal stimulus works best when government spending is quickly multiplied through the economy20 this means that each dollar of the federal transfer payment stimulates the economy the most if the entire dollar is spent by the recipient and then spent again the degree of stimulative effect of avoided state actions such as not furloughing workers depends on this multiplier effect thus to achieve the greatest stimulus the most contractionary state actions should be the first avoided the national conference of state legislatures ncsl asked budget officials from all states to categorize their spending strategies to reduce or eliminate budget gaps remaining for fy2009 changes in taxes are difficult to implement in the middle of budget year and are not included table 3 below lists the strategies identified by ncsl and the number of states that proposed implementing those strategies for 2009 for fy2010 several state and local governments are likely going to increase taxes to help close budget gaps 21 the spending option for states that would produce the most relative stimulus for each dollar of spending would be to avoid net job losses eg layoffs furloughs and to degree early retirement and hiring freezes to see why this is true consider what would happen if net job losses occurred first layoffs reduce aggregate demand because when workers are laid off their income would fall steeply until they find new jobs causing their consumption to fall even though all of the federal spending is not entirely multiplied through the economy because of employment taxes and income taxes the stimulative action is relatively effective because the federal government is essentially paying the state employees second since government services are included in gdp measured economic activity would be directly reduced as long as resources workers lay idle in an environment of rising unemployment it is unlikely that all of these resources would quickly be put back to use through market adjustment if

early retirement 2 source national confere nce of state legislatures state budget update tables 8 9 10 nd 1 1 november 200 8 the saving behavior of potentially separated employees would likely enhance the stimulative effect of avoiding job losses however avoi ding induced early retirement may provide less stimulus than avoiding furloughs and layoffs if the employees are early in their careers andor are in low skill positionslikely candidates for furloughs or layoffsit is likely that their incomes are lower than the median for state em ployees research has shown that low income workers save smaller portion of their income than high income workers 22 thus preventing the employment separation of low income workers should provide more relative stimulus than the alternative of not offering early retirement acrosstheboard cuts would affect variety of spending programs that do not easily conform to one succinct appraisal the stimulative effect of avoiding acrosstheboard cuts would vary from state to state based on the states spending pattern aid to local governments also falls into an uncertain category because of differing intergovernmental transfers across states the stimulative effect of avoiding cuts in local aid would be positive though the magnitude is uncertain

stimulative than direct spending increases because individuals are likely to save some of their tax cut analogously rescinded or avoided tax increase would also be less stimulative than spending

reduction and contributing to rainy day fund would offer little stimulus because such action would be equivalent to an increase in public saving in the short run increased public saving does not stimulate the economy if the federal grants were used to avoid tapping into tobacco revenue the saving effect would be similar to contributing to rainy day fund the combined effect of the various potential responses of state and local governments to federal grants is difficult to quantify priori nevertheless one could confidently assert that 1 of federal grants would not lead to corresponding 1 increase in fiscal stimulus while some state and local governments may spend all the federal grants and not change pregrant taxing and spending priorities some portions of the grs grants would likely be used for nonstimulative purposes such as substituting for previously planned spending or tax increases 22 julieanne cronin us treasury distributional analysis methodology us department of

act were essentially unconditional trust fund was established and annual appropriations were dedicated to the trust fund even though the grants were identified at the time as general revenue sharing the legislation did include list of priority expenditures for which the shared revenue sent to local governments could be used the grants to states were unconditional grs grants could be used by local governments for the following acceptable operating expenditures 1 public safety 2 environmental protection 3 public transportation 4 health 5 recreation 6 libraries 7 social services for the poor or aged and 8 financial administration ordinary and necessary capital expenditures were also allowed 23 the grants could not be used for education note that the priority expenditure list was discontinued by the 1976 extension in addition to the priority expenditure list the 1972 act also disallowed the use of grs for matching federal grants that restriction was also dropped in the 1976 extension congress believed grs was necessary for variety of reasons the most prominent reason at the time was the perceived need for reallocation of government responsibilities arising from the changing citizen demands for government services fiscal reallocation as cited earlier the congressional sentiment behind the 1972 act that created general revenue sharing is summarized well in the following passage from the senate report accompanying the 1972 act today it is the states and even more especially the local governments which bear the brunt of our more difficult domestic problems the need for public services has increased manyfold and their costs are soaring at th same time state and local governments are having considerable difficulty in raising the revenue necessary to meet these costs 24 the nixon administration seemed to have similar perspective when president nixon signed the legislation the president remarked that the gr s program would place responsibility for local functions under local control and provide local go vernments with the authority and resources they need to serve their communities effectively25 23 section 103 of the state and local fiscal assistance act of 1972 state governments usually maintain an operating budget and capital budget generally debt cannot be issued for the operating budget 24 us congress senate conference report report to accompany hr

and provision of government services was not the only justification for grs observers at the time cited these additional reasons for implementing revenue sharing program26 to stabilize or reduce state and local taxes particularly the property tax to decentralize government to equalize fiscal conditions between rich and poor states and localities and to alter the nations overall tax system by placing greater reliance on income taxation predominantly federal as opposed to property and sales taxation counteracting cyclical economic problems such as state and local budget deficits induced by slowing economy was not explicitly mentioned as justification for grs in the 1972 act however when the debate began in 1974 on extending grs beyond 1976 the countercyclical potential of revenue sharing apparently became important to policymakers the counter cyclical arguments were likely initiated by the relatively severe recession that lasted from november 1973 through march 1975 27

senate report accompanying the legislation congress identified the following two reasons for the extension 1 rapidly rising services costs coupled with sluggish declining tax bases has meant that state and local governments have had to raise tax rates andor cut services and 2 chronic problem state and local governments face is that the demand for public services is more elastic than the availability of revenues to finance them 28 the senate report suggested that the extension of the grs program not only serves to help solve the fiscal problems of individual state and local governments but also serves to stabilize the economy the 1976 extension also eliminated the priority expenditure categories for local governments and the prohibition on states from using the grants for federal matching grants policymakers recognized the fungibility of local revenues which initiated the elimination of the spending restrictions although the fiscal stimulus features were mentioned during the debate surrounding extension the ultimate purpose of revenue sharing was characterized as longterm restructuring of the intergovernmental transfers the desire to use revenue sharing as countercyclical fiscal policy tool was not directly addressed in the 1976 extension however the reference to revenue sharings ability to stabilize 26 richard p nathan allen d manvel and susannah

may have arisen due in part to the countercyclical merits of grs as suggested during the debate leading up to the extension29 the total size of the extension 255 billion was approximately 25 of total

september 30 1983 but only for local governments 30 according to the house report accompanying act the state share was eliminated as means of helping to balance the federal budget the committee believes that state governments are better able to adjust to the discontinuance of revenue sharing allocations than local governments31 until the 1980 act approximately onethird of the grs grants had been allocated to the states the 1980 act reduced the grs grants by onethirdfrom 6850 billion to 4567 billionand only local governments received the grants see table 1 in addition to continuing grs for local governments the 1980 act also authorized the creation of countercyclical assistance program to be triggered by national economic downturns the purpose of the program was to provide assistance to state and local governments during recessions to achieve this the program authorized 1 billion for each of the fiscal years 1981 1982 and 1983 subject to the trigger mechanism described in the house report accompanying the legislation funding would be triggered when the national economy s experienced two consecutive quarterly declines in both real gross national product and real wages and salaries emphasis added that is corrected for inflation once recession has been confirmed by these declines funds would be provided for each recession quarter in relation to the severity of the recession the program would be funded at rate of 10 million for each onetenth percentage point decline in real wages and salaries measured from the prerecession basethe average of the real wages and salaries for the two quarters preceding the decline the amount of money allocated in any one quarter would be limited to 300 million after setting aside 1 of the funds for puerto rico guam american samoa and the virgin islands the remaining funds would then be split evenly between state governments and county 29 around the time the extension was passed congress did enact two relatively small countercyclical assistance programs pl 94369 included an authorized maximum amount of 1375 billion for countercyclical assistance over five quarters beginning july 1 1976 the funds would be released to state and local governments provided certain national economic thresholds were crossed pl 9530 contained an extension of the countercyclical aid program authorizing maximum of 1 billion for fy1977 and 225 billion for fy1978 federal funds were spent under either authorization 30 the 1980 legislation did provide for grs grants for states if the state reduced other categorical federal grantsinaid by an amount equal to the grs grant essentially states had the option of changing categorical aid into general assistance 31 us congress house government operations committee report to

based on qua rterly data from t he us department of commerce bure au of economic analysis and the us departme n t of labor burea u of bor statistics the 1980 act is significant because the act discontinued revenue sharing for the states and formally introduced the concept of providing co untercyclical fiscal assistance through federal grants to state and local governments as part of grs legislation ultimately the countercyclical assistance program was never funded and thus countercyclical fiscal assistance was provided local governments generated 5938 billion of ow n source revenue over the three fiscal years covered by the 1980 act grs provided 137 billion in grants to local governments approximately 23 of total ownsource revenue the grants to local governments probably had little effect on the national economy given they represented 014 of us gdp over the three year time frame the 1 billion for each of 1981 1982 and 1983 for countercyclical aid authorized but never

amendments of 1983 pl 98185 as with the 1980 act only local governments received grants the 1983 extension was intended to stabilize the fiscal condition of local governments the conference report accompanying the legislation stated that the tendency of state and local governments to rely on relatively inelastic revenue sources such as local property taxes has limited their flexibility in responding to fiscal problems to assist local governments in meeting the needs of their communities in time of fiscal stringency the committee amendment extends the general revenue sharing program for
