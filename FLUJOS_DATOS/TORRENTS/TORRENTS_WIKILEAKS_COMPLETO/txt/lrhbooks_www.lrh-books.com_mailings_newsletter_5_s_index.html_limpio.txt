bridge publications inc newsletter date dianetics and the nature of man dianetics can be contested it can be vilified its founder and practitioners can be publicly pilloried1 but dianetics cannot be ignored it could neither be drowned in praise nor burned in some purge to its total eradication for it is wonderfully observable fact that the one impulse in man which cannot be erased is his impulse toward freedom his impulse toward sanity toward higher levels of attainment in all of his endeavors this is mans one saving grace and because dianetics is such an impulse and because its basic purposes from the moment of its conception have been dedicated unswervably to the attainment of even greater freedom it cannot perisha fact which will become doubtlessly more annoying to the slave masters as the years roll on l ron hubbard this excerpt was taken from the book dianetics 55 by l ron hubbard 1 pilloried exposed to ridicule public contempt scorn or abuse the adventure of book one auditing the story of man who uncovers secret never disclosed to his friend as child view details on book one dianetics the modern science of mental health he suddenly erupted in bloodcurdling cry that sent jumping into the air and throwing my papers and notes everywhere in 1968 i had lot of free time on my hands i was in the us army and stationed in germany after work each day i needed to find something to help wile away the idle hours and normally i did this through reading books on the campus there was bookstore that only carried bestsellers and it was there i first saw dianetics the modern science of mental health i thought the title sounded interesting and because it was huge book it gave something to read for while so i started my journey into discovering and learning about the human mind after the first read through i thought this was really something and i already knew that just small fraction of this information would mean great deal for mankind i then began reading it over again this time with even more attention and curiosity soon the paperback book became worn from my intensive reading and slowly the book started falling apart however this was most fortunate for my roommate who began picking up the fallen pages and reading along with pretty soon he was just as curious as i was about the subject of dianetics the adventure begins one day bill my roommate suggested i try auditing the procedure on him i told him that i wasnt sure if i wanted to and didnt know what would happen he persisted and also pointed out that in the book it states you cant hurt anyone with the procedure and some auditing even if done badly was far better than nothing well he had on that one bill settled himself down on one of the bunks and with book on one knee and notepad on the other i began the auditing session i meticulously followed the commands and made notes as best i could for short while i didnt notice any changes and began to get nervous i kept following the procedure just as lrh wrote and then came across command where lrh said if nothing else works try this so i did the incident blood curdling cry erupted from bill and had jumping out of my chair falling on the floor and throwing the book and papers all over the room i was frightened half to death uneasily i climbed back up to my chair and arranged the papers and the book again to continue the process looking closely at bill i could see tear streaming down his face while his eyes were still closed what the heck had just happened the next step was to reduce the engram and i set out to do this following the procedure in the book exactly and in short time had bill back up to present time and longer in pain from the incident after the session bill commented boy i must have quite an imagination after all theres way this could be true i was one year old kid when this happened and my parents for sure would have told about this bill had uncovered previous unknown injury one that he had never been told about few days passed and he was still wondering about whether or not this was real incident or just his imagination so i suggested he write his mother and ask after all she would surely know about major injury that happened to him at this age the incident is confirmed three weeks later i entered our room after work and bill was sitting on his bed face white as sheet staring at letter in his hand i asked what was wrong and he handed the letter it was the answer from his mother she was interrogating him as to how he could have possibly found this out and asking questions like where did you hear this from have you been talking to aunt martha etc from this letter it was evident that this incident was real both of us were in complete shock we surmised from his mothers letter and the details of the incident that his family had covered this up and made pact never to tell him they were ashamed and embarrassed you see when he was only year old on christmas eve all his relatives were visiting and had been drinking little too much his father was holding him next to the christmas tree and they had real candles on the tree which were of course all lit he was fascinated by the flame and reached out with one finger to touch it but as he realized it was hot and it began to burn him he tried to withdraw but his father accidentally turned him into the flame and he was burned severely as he cried everyone was so drunk they did not realize what had happened and were just standing around laughing in fact one in the family noticed the burn marks until the next day and then they quickly took him to doctor the result my roommate had sudden realization that he had been afraid of candles his whole life and never knew why but best of all he was longer afraid of them as this incident had been reduced and was longer subconsciously affecting him needless to say i had found something that really worked and i was very impressed it was not matter of how smart or clever i was as person but just by following the simple procedure in the book i could produce incredible results over the next two years i audited over 1000 hours of book one and other processes from l ron hubbards books and materials in 1970 i visited saint hill and went clear but it didnt stop there since this time i have contributed as scientologist and staff member for over 30 years and never stopped disseminating or helping people with the tech i cant imagine living any other way further i now encourage and challenge other fellow scientologists to have similar wins and gains from applying the tech in lrh books and materials in helping others there is other feeling like it warren r schneringer ot iii communication the universal solvent listen to an excerpt from the communication freedom
