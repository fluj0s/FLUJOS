specialist in international trade and finance foreign affairs defense and trade division us foreign trade in services definition patterns and policy challenges summary the term services refers to broad and widening range of economic activities such as accounting and legal services banking transportation tourism and telecommunications services are significant sector of the us economy accounting for almost 70 of us gross domestic product gdp and for over 80 of us civilian employment services have become an important element of us foreign trade consistently generating surpluses the european union is by far the most important us trade partner in services accounting for more than 50 of us trade in services the increasing importance of services in domestic and global trade have placed them on the us agenda for bilateral and regional trade agreements and services trade occupies prominent place on the agenda of the united states and the other 152 members of the world trade organization wto in the doha development agenda round of multilateral negotiations furthermore disputes related to trade in services have arisen increasingly between the united states and the european union japan canada and other major trading partners the congress will have number of trade agreements to consider and services will be an important part of the deliberations an overview of barriers of the disputes in services trade and of the rapidly changing characteristics of the services sector suggest that the negotiations and the agreements they produce will become increasingly complex the united states presses its trading partners to liberalize their services sector as much as possible because us services providers are very competitive in world markets however to accomplish its objectives the united states is pressed by its partners to make concessions that might adversely affect importsensitive industries in the united states us negotiators and ultimately congress will have to judge whether the agreements strike an appropriate balance for us interests this report will be updated as events warrant contents services and the us economy 2 us trade in services 3 the four modes of

services definition patterns and policy challenges the term services refers to broad and widening range of economic activities such as accounting and legal services banking transportation tourism and telecommunications services are significant sector of the us economy accounting for almost 70 of us gross domestic product gdp and for over 80 of us civilian employment services are becoming an important element of us foreign trade and of global trade in general although their intangibility and other characteristics along with other barriers have limited foreign trade in services because services are fundamentally different from goods trade in services generates unique set of trade policy issues in addition advances in technology continue to broaden the range of available services and the means to deliver services making the policy challenges very dynamic the increasing importance of services in us and global trade has placed them on the us agenda for bilateral and regional trade agreements and services trade occupies prominent place on the agenda of the united states and the other 152 members of the world trade organization wto in the doha development agenda round of multilateral negotiations us suppliers of services are among the most competitive in the world the united states has taken the lead in encouraging foreign trade partners to reduce barriers to trade in services through bilateral regional and multilateral negotiations congress has significant role to play in these efforts in fulfilling its responsibilities for oversight of us trade policymaking and implementation the congress monitors trade negotiations and the implementation of any agreements reached as result of the negotiations more directly the congress must pass any agreements requiring changes in us law before they can go into effect free trade agreements that include provisions on services are pending congressional consideration while negotiations in the wto continue this report provides background information and analysis on us foreign trade in services it includes an examination of definitions and examples of services to indicate their nature and scope review of the importance of services to the us economy including us foreign trade and an analysis of the policy challenges that confront the united states especially the challenge of negotiating set of international rules on trade in services and the challenge of resolving disputes over trade in services with trading partners this report will be updated as events warrant crs2 services and the us economy services encompass very broad and widening range of economic activities according to one definition services are diverse group of economic activities not directly associated with the manufacture of goods mining or agriculture they typically involve the provision of human valueadded in the form of labor advice managerial skill entertainment training intermediation and the like1 services differ from manufactured goods primarily in that they are intangible so they cannot be stored and must be consumed at the point of production trips to the doctor enjoying meal at the restaurant however rapid changes in technology are reducing even these restrictions on services computer software that can be stored online on disks tape etc2 illustrative examples of services include wholesale and retail trade transportation and warehousing information finance and insurance professional scientific and technical services education arts and entertainment health care and social assistance food and accommodation services construction communication and public administration3 services are an increasingly significant sector of the us economy in 1976 they accounted for 55 of us gdp in 2006 they accounted for 68 of us gdp4 in 2007 workers in the services sector accounted for 84 of the total civilian workforce5 the significance of services to national economy and to the global economy go beyond what can be measured by data many services not only have intrinsic value but are also critical to running other parts of large economies for example financial services banking investment insurance are the means by which capital flows throughout an economy from those who have it savers investors to those who need it borrowers financial services are often called the lifeblood of an economy there is symbiotic relationship between many services providers and manufacturers demand for one creates demand for the other many manufacturers are dependent on transportation communication and distribution services networks to ensure that inputs are available for the production of goods and to deliver final goods to consumers for example car manufacturers depend on transportation services trucking rail etc to make sure that component parts are available for assembly and that completed cars are delivered to dealers at the same time demand for services creates demand for manufactures for example the production of communication services leads to demand for telephones radios computers and other communications apparatuses 1 oecd science technology industry

president february 2008 washington table b12 p 241 5 ibid table b46 p 280 crs3 us trade in services us trade in services as narrowly measured plays an important role in overall us trade albeit much smaller role than domestic services play in the overall us economy and the relative importance of trade in services has remained quite constant between 1986 and 2001 for example the share of services in overall us exports in goods and services remained at around 28 although it increased to 30 by 2003 where it has remained from 1986 to 2007 the share of us imports of goods and services accounted for by services has been 1618 these data are presented in table 1 these shares are substantially lower than one might expect from sector that dominates the domestic economy6 table 1 also shows that the united states continually realizes surpluses in services trade which have partially offset large trade deficits in goods trade in the us current account these figures only measure trade in services that take place across borders as presented in the us official balance of payments data table 1 us trade in goods and services 19862007 billions of dollars exports imports balances year goods

direct contact between supplier and consumer many service providers prefer to establish or must establish presence in the country of the consumer for example hotel and restaurant services by their very nature require presence in the country of the consumer providers of legal accounting and construction services prefer direct presence because they need access to expert knowledge of the laws and regulations of the country in which they are doing business and they require proximity to clients thus crossborder services trade data do not capture all of the trade in services 6 us department of commerce bureau of economic analysis us international accounts data july 1 2008 crs4 data on sales of services by foreign affiliates of usowned companies and by us affiliates of foreignowned firms help to provide more accurate albeit still incomplete measurement of trade in services in 2005 the latest year for which published data are available us firms sold 529 billion in services to foreigners through their majorityowned foreign affiliates in 2005 foreign firms sold to us residents 389 billion in services through their majorityowned foreign affiliates located in the united states7 the data for crossborder trade and for sales by majorityowned affiliates are not directly compatible therefore it is difficult to derive an accurate overall measure of services trade even these two sets of figures do not capture the total value of trade in services two other modes of services delivery are through the temporary movement of consumers to the location of the provider and the temporary movement of the provider to the location of the consumer us data on the sales of services via these two modes of delivery are not readily available see text box 7 bureau of economic analysis us department of commerce sales of services to foreign and us markets through crossborder trade and through affiliates httpwwwbeagov crs5 the four modes of delivery for trade in services international agreements on trade in services including the general agreement on trade in services gats which is administered by the world trade organization wto identifies four modes of supply of services8 mode 1 crossborder supply the service is supplied from one country to another the supplier and consumer remain in their respective countries while the service crosses the border example us architectural firm is hired by client in mexico to design building the us firm does the design in its home country and sends the blueprints to its client in mexico mode 2 consumption abroad the consumer physically travels to another country to obtain the service example mexican client travels to the united states to obtain the services of us architectural firm mode 3 commercial presence the supply of service by firm in one country via its branch agency or whollyowned subsidiary located in another country example us architectural firm establishes subsidiary in mexico to sell services to local clients mode 4 presence of natural persons individual suppliers travel temporarily to another country to supply services example us architect travels to mexico to provide design services to her mexican client identifying the various modes of delivery of services is important for measuring the volume of services trade that takes place each mode requires different method of measurement and the data derived from these measurements are not likely to be compatible across the four modes that is one cannot combine the data on services traded via mode 1 with data derived from services traded via mode 3 in order to obtain total identifying the modes is also important for policy purposes because issues raised by trade in mode1can be different from issues raised by trade in another mode for example the trade barriers faced by providers in mode 1 are not necessarily the same as those faced by providers in mode 4 therefore knowing the different modes helps to frame policy issues and solutions source the description and examples of modes of delivery are based on and adapted from the description contained in oecd gats the case for open services markets paris 2002 p 60 8 the

were to the european union and figure 2 indicates that more than one third of us imports of services were from the european union in contrast canada accounted for 10 and 8 of us services exports and

us service providers strive to increase foreign trade us policymakers are faced with number of challenges in constructing an international environment that is conducive to increased trade in services one challenge is identifying the foreign government laws regulations and policies that impede trade flows and prevent the international system of trade in services from operating efficiently while some of these barriers are similar to those that exist in goods trade many are different and more complex and therefore sometimes difficult to identify second challenge derives from the first working with trading partners to build and administer rules of the road to facilitate trade in services the current rules the general agreement on trade in services gats are recent phenomenon and are at an early stage of development third challenge is managing disputes that arise when trading partners do not agree on how trade in services should be conducted barriers to trade in services because of the fundamental differences between goods and services the barriers that foreign service providers face are different from those faced by goods suppliers many barriers in goods trade tariffs and quotas for example are at the border restrictions on services trade occur largely within the borders of the importing country and are in the form of government regulations the right of governments to regulate some services industries is widely recognized as prudent and necessary to protect consumers from dangerous or unqualified providers for example doctors and other medical personnel must be licensed by government appointed boards lawyers financial services providers and many other professional service providers must be also certified in some manner governments regulate to protect the economy from sudden and potentially harmful shocks for example controls on foreign currency transactions are designed to protect the economy from panic capital flight and to maintain stable exchange rates the question in foreign trade is whether these regulations are applied in discriminating and unnecessarily restrictive manner because services transactions more often require direct contact between consumer and provider than is the case with goods trade many of the trade barriers that foreign companies face pertain to the establishment of commercial presence in the consumers country in the form of direct investment or to the temporary movement of people mode 4 sellers and consumers across borders general trade barriers some trade barriers are evident across services industries in most cases the restrictions are ostensibly legitimate but may have unintentional adverse affects on foreign services trade examples of such barriers include restrictions on international payments including repatriation of profits mandatory currency conversions and restrictions on current account transactions crs11 restrictions on the movement of personnel including visa work permit and immigration restrictions requirements that foreign professionals pass certification exams or obtain extra training that is not required by local nationals permission for entry and provision of services contingent on local labor supply requirements restrictions on information transfer imposed to protect data and maintain privacy buy national requirements in government procurement lack of national treatment in taxation policy or protection from double taxation governmentowned monopoly service providers and requirements by foreign service providers to use monopolys network access or communications connection provider government subsidization of domestic service suppliers limitations on foreign direct investment such as equity ceilings local employment and sourcing requirements restrictions on the form of investment that is branch subsidiary joint venture etc net national benefit requirements quotas imposed on number of foreign service suppliers requirements that the chief executive officer or other high level company officials be local nationals or that certain proportion of companys directors be local nationals and licensing requirements to market and sell services9 industryspecific barriers in most cases service industry confronts barriers that are largely specific to that industry the following examples of major service industries and the barriers they confront are illustrative construction and related services this category includes firms that are involved in the construction of both residential and commercial buildings firms that are involved in the construction of transportation infrastructures such as roads bridges airports tunnels and similar structures firms that install prefabricated structures and firms that provide finishing work to structures it is category of services in which us firms have proved highly competitive in the global market construction and related engineering services is very labor intensive work combining low and highly specializedskilled labor firms that provide services in foreign markets usually require presence in the country either temporarily or 9 world trade organization guide to the gats kluwer law international boston 2001 oecd working party of the trade committee assessing barriers to trade in services revised consolidated list of crosssectoral barriers paris february 28 2001 crs12 through foreign direct investment often in the form of partnership with local firm that has knowledge of local laws and other requirements because these firms compete by offering specialized skills they frequently must be able to move highly skilled workers across borders in most countries the construction and related services industry is tightly regulated for quality control and safety reasons governments require construction firms to meet technical standards and may also require developers to adhere to land use and environmental controls some restrictions might be applied ostensibly on nondiscriminatory basis but may be greater burden to foreign suppliers eg requirement that certain percentage of labor be locally sourced in number of countries local or regional trade associations have the authority to rule on applications of construction firms for required permits thereby creating conflict of interest as association members would have an interest in limiting competition some countries employ buy national policies that favor domestic construction firms in bidding on government projects in addition some governments tolerate private company collusive practices for example in japan local construction companies have practiced bidrigging called dango under this practice small group of japanese construction firms agree which of them would submit the lowest bid and therefore get the contract they rotate the winning bidder among them from project to project the practice would guarantee work among the participants but would keep foreign and other domestic competitors out travel and tourism travel and tourism is multifaceted industry it encompasses lodging and restaurants including catering travel agencies and tour operators and tourist guide services it ranks among the top five service industries in more than 75 of the countries and is among the top sectors in us crossborder services trade for many smaller countries it is the primary means of earning foreign exchange travel and tourism is laborintensive industry that is highly dependent on other service sectors transportation construction to insure that sufficient and appropriate lodging and other facilities are available to tourists advertising telecommunications and distribution services among others it is an industry that is undergoing major changes as the use of the internet and the introduction of other technologies change how tourism and travel services are delivered the industry faces few direct trade barriers but is indirectly affected by regulations pertaining to the movement of people immigration visas transportation for example the distribution of slots to foreign airlines at major airports movement of money for example foreign exchange requirements and construction standards for example the quality of hotels and other tourist necessities banking and financial services banking and financial services cover wide range of economic activities maintaining deposits lending money brokering of securities stocks and bonds brokering of many types of insurance health life auto home and specialized insurance managing pension funds and other assets financial planning and more it is also an industry in which american firms have proved to be highly competitive and have growing global presence in addition crs13 among the industries that comprise the services sector it is perhaps the most complex not only because of its scope of activities but also because of its importance viable financial sector is critical to an economy it functions primarily to protect the financial assets of residents and to facilitate the flow of capital from savers and investors to borrowers the sector has undergone rapid changes recently technology especially the emergence of the internet has facilitated sales of insurance the transmission of deposits and the purchase and sale of securities across international borders furthermore many countries have liberalized regulation of financial industries allowing for increased foreign ownership and the reduction of firewalls between financial industries at the same time because of their importance to the maintenance of economic stability financial services are heavily regulated sector many regulations are applied to protect investors and depositors and to ensure the viability of the sector these regulations such as deposit insurance reserve requirements capitalization requirements and the like are considered prudent to maintaining healthy financial system however fine line exists at times between prudent requirements and requirements that are used to protect the domestic industry from foreign competition for example governments often require insurance brokers and other financial agents to be licensed to protect customers from unqualified or otherwise questionable providers but licensing can also be used to restrict competition and protect favored companies foreign banks frequently face restrictions on the type of direct investment they can make in country the types of services they can provide or the number of facilities they can establish in the country or in region of the country foreignowned insurance companies may confront restrictions on the type of insurance they can sell for example some countries prohibit foreign companies from selling life insurance or auto insurance10 establishing rules on trade in services the united states is working with trading partners to develop and implement rules on trade in services on several fronts the broadest and most challenging are the multilateral rules contained in the general agreement on tariffs and trade gats that is administered by the world trade organization wto rules on trade in services are also part of the north american free trade agreement nafta and other regional and bilateral free trade agreements furthermore they will likely be an aspect of free trade agreements ftas now under negotiation or discussion the wto and gats the seeds for multilateral negotiations in services trade were planted more than quarter century ago in the trade act of 1974 the congress instructed the administration to push for an agreement on trade in services under the general agreement on tariffs and trade gatt during the tokyo round negotiations while the tokyo round concluded in 1979 without services 10 world trade organization pp 331352 for more information on us foreign trade in financial services see archived crs report rl31110 us trade in financial services an overview by patricia wertman and william h cooper crs14 agreement the industrialized countries led by the united states continued to press for its inclusion in later negotiations developing countries whose service sectors are less advanced than those of the industrialized countries were reluctant to have services included eventually services were included as part of the uruguay round negotiations launched in 198611 at the end of the round countries agreed to new set of rules for services the gats and new agency the wto to administer the gats and other agreements reached the gats the gats provides the first and only multilateral framework of principles and rules for government policies and regulations affecting trade in services among more than 100 countries representing many levels of economic development the gats remains work in progress and its expansion is part of the new round of wto negotiations launched in november 2001 in doha qatar the gats agreement most of which was completed by december 1993 is divided into six parts12 part i article i defines the scope of the gats it provides that the gats applies to all services except those supplied in the routine exercise of government authority to all government barriers to trade in services at all levels of government national regional and local and to all four modes of delivery of services part ii articles iixv presents the principles and obligations some of which mirror those for trade in goods while others are specific to services these principles and obligations include unconditional mostfavorednation mfn nondiscriminatory treatment that is services imported from one member country cannot be treated any less favorably than the services imported from another member country 13 transparency that is governments must publish rules and regulations 11 feketekuty geza international trade in services an overview and blueprint for negotiations american enterprise institute ballinger publishers 1988 p 194 12 this description of the gats is based on wto secretariat trade in services division an introduction to the gats october 1999 httpwwwwtoorg not all services issues were resolved when the uruguay round was completed in 1993 negotiations on financial services and telecommunications services continued until agreements were reached in 1997 13 the gats differs from the gatt in that it has allowed members to take temporary exemptions to mfn treatment the exemptions are listed in special annex to the gats the gats allows only these onetime exemptions the gats as is the case of the gatt also allows mfn exemptions in the cases of regional agreements crs15 reasonable impartial and objective administration of government rules and regulations that apply to covered services monopoly suppliers must act consistently with obligations under the gats in covered services member incurring balance of payments difficulties may temporarily restrict trade in services covered by the agreement and member may circumvent gats obligations for national security purposes part iii articles xvixviii of the gats establishes market access and national treatment obligations for members the gats binds each member to its commitments once it has made them that is member country may not impose less favorable treatment than what it has committed to prohibits membercountry governments from placing limits on suppliers of services from other member countries regarding the number of foreign service suppliers the total value of service transactions or assets the number of transactions or value of output the type of legal entity or joint venture through which services may be supplied and the share of foreign capital or total value of foreign direct investment requires that member governments accord service suppliers from other member countries national treatment that is foreign service or service provider may not be treated any less favorably than domestic provider of the service and allows members to negotiate further reductions in barriers to trade in services importantly unlike mfn treatment and the other principles listed in part ii which apply to all service providers more or less unconditionally the obligations under part iii are restricted they apply only to those services and modes of delivery listed in each members schedule of commitments thus unless member country has specifically committed to open up its market to service suppliers in particular service that is provided via one or more of the four modes of delivery the national treatment and market access obligations do not apply this is often referred to as the positive list approach to trade commitments each member countrys schedule of commitments is contained in an annex to the gats14 the schedules of commitments are in essence the core of the gats 14 archived crs report 951051 services trade and the uruguay round by arlene wilson p 17 crs16 parts ivvi articles xixxxix are technical but important elements of the agreement among other things they include the requirement that later than 2000 the gats members start new negotiations which they have done to expand coverage of the agreement and establish the requirement that conflicts between members involving implementation of the gats be handled in the wtos dispute settlement mechanism the gats also includes eight annexes including one on mfn exemptions another annex provides prudential carve out that is recognition that governments take prudent actions to protect investors or otherwise maintain the integrity of the national financial system these prudent actions are allowed even if they conflict with obligations under the gats evaluations of the gats in its first seven years range from those who view the glass as half empty to those who see the glass as half full the more pessimistic school argues that not much has been accomplished in gats that at best members committed themselves to maintain the status quo before the gats went into effect these critics argue that some countries actually made commitments that were more restrictive than their current practices furthermore critics question the value of the socalled positive list approach to members commitments which can lead to slower and more tedious trade liberalization negotiations the more optimistic school considers the mere establishment of the gats to be an important accomplishment considering that many countries strongly resisted even negotiating on services at the beginning of the uruguay round in addition even though the initial commitments may have only locked members in at the status quo they are bound by those commitments from sliding back into more protectionism and may actually open up their services sectors as negotiations proceed continuing negotiations article xix of the gats required wto members to begin new set of negotiations on services in 2000 as part of the so called wto builtin agenda in so doing it guaranteed that wto members will pursue negotiations on services even if they are not able to begin new full round article xix stipulates that participants work to resolve some conceptual and procedural issues for example how to give negotiating credit to governments that had unilaterally liberalized their services sectors since the conclusion of the first set of negotiations and whether to provide special treatment to least developed countries the new set of gats negotiations began in february 2000 and during the remainder of that year the members reviewed the status of commitments already made and developed set of guidelines in addition to the issues mandated by article xix the guidelines stipulate that negotiators will continue to use the servicespecific modespecific positive list approach wto members successfully launched the doha development agenda dda round in november 2001 the ministerial declaration that announced the mandates for the round folded the services negotiation into the agenda of the dda round by most accounts the participants in the dda services negotiations have made little progress at the december 2005 biennial ministerial meeting in hong kong wto negotiators were supposed to have good indication of what final agreements crs17 will look like if the doha round is to be completed by the end of 2006 participants have expressed widespread disappointment with the offers that have been made the prospects of the negotiations were set back even further when wto directorgeneral pascal lamy suspended the dda including the services negotiations on july 24 2006 after meeting of the g6 wto members consisting of the united states the european union japan australia brazil and india failed to agree on the basic conditions or modalities for conducting the agriculture and nama negotiations although the negotiations resumed in 2007 progress on the services negotiations remains stagnant at best several possible reasons can be cited for the lack of progress one is the division between developed countries that have advanced services sectors employing highlyskilled labor and the developing countries with lessdeveloped services industries the former group seeks market opportunities for its services providers and is more willing to open its markets to competition the latter group is more protective of its domestic services providers the halting progress in the agriculture and nonagriculture market access nama negotiations in the dda has also affected the services negotiations some developing countries have asserted that they will not improve their offers until the united states and the european union commit to reduce their agriculture subsidies third reason could be the complexity of the agenda of the services negotiations and the number of players involved services includes broad range of economic activities many with few characteristics in common except that they are not goods the trade barriers exporters face differ across services sectors making the formulation of trade rules significant challenge furthermore services negotiations include many participants in addition to trade ministers they include representatives of regulatory agencies many of whom do not consider trade liberalization primary part of their mission the prospects for the negotiations are difficult to evaluate at this point it is not unusual for negotiations to lag as participants wait to place their best negotiating positions on the table until just before crucial deadlines are reached several factors will determine if and when the services negotiations will be completed one factor is the political will the wto members can muster to overcome the obstacles that plague the negotiations another factor is the extent to which the various participants are willing to compromise on goals to reach agreements and third factor is how quickly the issues in agriculture and non agriculture market access are resolved the sooner they are resolved the sooner negotiators can devote their full attention to the services negotiations in september 2007 the chairman of the trade in services negotiations began process to develop draft text of an agreement and called on membercountry negotiators to submit contributions however by the end of 2007 it was clear that the countries were still sharply divided on basic objectives developed countries including the united states have argued for membercountries at minimum to commit to binding their current practices on trade in services developing countries crs18 including argentina argued against such benchmarks and resisted making additional commitments until developed countries commit to greater reductions of subsidies for agriculture15 the role of services in us regional and bilateral free trade agreements the united states has in place several bilateral and regional free trade agreements and is conducting negotiations on others this section provides brief overview of the treatment of services in these agreements and negotiations the north american free trade agreement nafta nafta which went into effect on january 1 1994 is the largest free trade agreement in which the united states participates naftas coverage of services trade is very broad reflecting the comprehensive integration of the three participating economies chapter 12 contains naftas coverage of most crossborderservices trade defined as all services trade except that requires commercial presence the exceptions are financial services which are covered in chapter 14 services purchased by state enterprises or governments which are covered in chapter 10 and international air transportation and related services which are not covered at all services trade related to the commercial presence of the provider in the country of the consumer is covered in chapter 11 on foreign direct investment chapter 12 of nafta requires canada the united states and mexico to provide national treatment and mostfavorednation treatment to one anothers services and service providers and prohibits the participating governments from requiring services providers to establish local presence in order to sell their services the three
