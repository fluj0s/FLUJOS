research service the library of congress climate change legislation in the 108th congress summary climate change and greenhouse gas ghg emissions were an issue in the 108th congress as they were over the preceding decade bills directly addressing climate change issues ranged from those focused primarily on climate change research hr 1578 and s 1164 to comprehensive emissions cap and trading programs for all six greenhouse gases s 139 and hr 4067 additional bills focused on ghg reporting and registries hr 6 senatepassed hr 1245 s 17 and s 194 or on power plant emissions of carbon dioxide hr 2042 s 139 s 366 and s 843 these climate change bills differed within and across categories among the climate change research bills there were common and divergent research focuses for example few bills including s 139 and s 1164 would have directed research on historical instances of climate change to develop climate change models additional bills focused on research to examine vulnerabilities to climate change in the united states particularly with respect to human health environmental and economic outcomes furthermore some bills would have promoted research on political and technological options to reduce ghg emissions among the six bills with ghg reporting and registry requirements there were also differences the primary difference between reporting bills was how each determined which entities must report hr 6 senate version hr 1245 hr 4067 and s 139 would have established ghg emission thresholds usually around 10000 metric tons of carbon dioxide or equivalent per year above which an entity must submit records of its ghg emissions however hr 6 and hr 1245 excluded farms from the reporting requirement the remaining bills s 17 and s 194 would have tasked the administrator of the environmental protection agency epa with establishing the threshold requirement there were also similarities and differences between cap and trade bills specifically hr 2024 s 366 and s 843 would have focused on fossil fuelfired electric generating facilities while s 139 and hr 4067 would have covered broader array of sources furthermore hr 2024 s 366 and s 843 would have capped one ghg carbon dioxide while s 139 and hr 4067 would have capped all six ghgs this report briefly discusses basic concepts on which these bills were based and compares major provisions of the bills in each of the following categories climate change research ghg reporting and registries and cap and trade programs this report will not be updated contents climate change research bills 1 ghg reporting and

the 108th congress 15 climate change legislation in the 108th congress since 1992 when the united states ratified the united nations framework convention on climate change unfccc number of voluntary and regulatory actions have been proposed or undertaken in the united states to decrease greenhouse gas emissions most of these policies have been established primarily to achieve energy or environmental goals while also having the effect of reducing ghg emissions1 in the 108th congress numerous bills were introduced that directly or indirectly addressed climate change most bills focused on energy efficiency energy conservation or nonfossil fuels however the focus of this report is on bills that directly addressed climate change not on bills that would have had indirect or ancillary impacts on greenhouse gas emissions this report describes and compares climaterelated bills which fall into three major categories 1 those that would have established climate change research programs to further examine the origins and effects of climate change hr 62 hr 1578 hr 4067 s 17 s 139 and s 1164 2 those that would have established ghg monitoring systems as basis for research or for any future reduction program hr 6 hr 1245 hr 4067 s 17 s 139 and s 194 and 3 those that would have established marketbased programs to directly limit emissions of co2 the primary greenhouse gas hr 2024 s 139 hr 4067 s 366 and s 843 the major provisions of these bills are categorized in appendix 1 and summarized in appendix 2 while the body of this report describes what each bill would have done none of these bills became law in the 108th congress if members wish to enact similar legislation in the 109th congress or later new bills must be introduced climate change research bills global climate change is complex issue while most scientists agree that the climate is changing in response to greenhouse gas emissions uncertainties concerning the causes and the effects of climate change remain and are the subject 1 under the united nations framework convention on climate change unfccc greenhouse gases include carbon dioxide co2 the most ubiquitous and primary greenhouse gas methane ch4 nitrous oxide n2o hydrofluorocarbons hfcs perfluorocarbons pfcs and sulfur hexaflurane sf6 some other greenhouse gases are controlled under the montreal protocol on substances that deplete the ozone layer 2 for the purposes of this report hr 6 always refers to the senatepassed bill the conference report on hr 6 hrept 108375 did not contain provisions on climate change the conference report was approved by the house on november 18 2003 on november 21 cloture motion on the conference report failed in the senate crs2 of scientific research3 federally much of this research is conducted through the us global change research program4 research bills two bills in the 108th congress s 1164 collins and hr 1578 m udall focused primarily on climate change research5 as shown in table 1 these bills would have established research programs with different focuses s 1164 called for the development and testing of climate change models based on historic climatic changes hr 1578 focused on using historic trends to assess the nations vulnerabilities to climatic change and to assess climate change policy while s 1164 did not have any substantial nonresearch provisions hr 1578 would also have established an interagency committee to develop vulnerability assessments facilitate interagency cooperation and provide representation to international meetings this committee would have facilitated the establishment of the united states global change research plan the plan would have established goals and priorities and would have identified options to achieve those aims research provisions in broader bills in addition to the research bills hr 1578 and s 1164 four bills hr 6 hr 4067 s 17 and s 139 included climate change research provisions as part of broader climate change bill specifically research in hr 6 would have focused on climate change mitigation technology climate change adaptation and resolving scientific and economic uncertainty the research provisions in s 17 focused on national assessment of climate change impacts and review of methods to address climate change research under s 139 would have focused on technology transfer barriers the impact of the kyoto protocol on the united states climate change impacts and possible methods to reduce ghg emissions the research provisions of hr 4067 were similar to those under s 139 except that hr 4067 did not address technology transfer or the impacts to the kyoto protocol and added section on agricultural research 3 for more information on the science and policy of global climate change see crs issue

authorized crs6 ghg reporting and registry bills under the unfccc the united states annually reports on its ghg emissions6 the united states environmental protection agency epa does this reporting using various techniques eg fuel analysis for co2 the three dominant sources of ghg emissions are electricity generation 331 transportation 269 and industry 197 at the national level electric utilities must report their ghg emissions pursuant to the 1990 clean air act but there is overall national ghg reporting requirement however some states also gather data through voluntary or mandatory ghg emissions reporting mechanisms8 four bills title 10 of hr 6 senatepassed version9 hr 1245 olver s 17 daschle and s 194 corzine focused primarily on expanding emissions reporting to broad array of sources see table 2 while s 17 and s 194 directed the epa to determine who must report emissions information hr 6 established category of covered sources furthermore these bills would have established national registry to collect annual lists submitted by entities on their ghg emissions and sources and would have established national ghg registry to collect voluntarily reported information on ghg emissions reductions s 17 and s 194 would also have required the epa administrator and the secretaries of commerce agriculture and energy to develop tools for quantifying verifying reporting and accounting for ghg emissions and would have required the epa administrator to publish an annual national ghg emissions inventory while these bills established reporting requirements as the basis for future regulations two other bills s 139 and hr 4067 would have established monitoring program as the basis for ghg cap and trade program specifically these bills would have included requirement that the administrator of the epa establish national ghg database and develop methods and standards to measure and verify ghg emissions in addition to their different ghg reporting strategies these bills had other major components for example s 17 set goal for the president to reduce the federal governments net ghg emissions to 1990 levels by 2013 hr 6 would have established the office of national climate change policy to develop national climate change strategy with the longterm goal of stabilization of greenhouse gas concentrations s 17 would also have authorized 2 billion per year in grants to state and local governments to reduce ghg emissions 6 see crs report 98235 enr global climate change us greenhouse gas emissions status trends and projections 7 us environmental protection agency

federal ghg reduction requirements though proposals to require such reductions have been made these proposals have included command and control regulations on emissions ghg emission taxes and market based techniques to limit emissions the last marketbased programs typically take as their model the clean air act acid rain program10 in the 108th congress bills were introduced that would have established market based ghg reductions see table 3 one pair of bills s 139 and hr 4067 would have capped the emissions of the six greenhouse gases specified in the united nations framework convention on climate change11 three other bills hr 2042 s 366 and s 843 would have focused on reducing carbon dioxide from electric utilities each of these bills would have used marketbased trading mechanisms to limit ghg emissions cap and trade programs set strict limits on specific emissions from particular group of sources allowing individual sources to trade reductions this flexibility in who makes reductions leads to lower costs one method is to allocate emissions allowances to each source allowances can be bought or sold in wellfunctioning market entities that face relatively low emissionreduction costs would achieve extra emission reductions then these entities would sell their unused allowances to entities that face higher emissionreduction costs an entity facing higher costs could then purchase allowances to exceed its initial emissions cap12 carbon dioxide reduction bills as shown in table 3 hr 2042 waxman s 36613 jeffords and s 843 carper focused on electric utility emissions14 these bills would have limited emissions of carbon dioxide along with other air pollutants15 see table 3 the first round of emissions reductions would have gone into effect in the year 2009 s 843 would also have included second phase of emissions reductions beginning in 2012 comprehensive ghg emissions reductions unlike other bills proposed in the 108th congress the climate stewardship act s 139 and hr 4067 focused on achieving marketdriven reductions in all six greenhouse gases see table 3 the legislation applied to entities in the electricity transportation industry and 10 the acid rain program caps emissions from each source but allows sources to exceed their caps if they purchase credits from sources that achieve extra emissions reductions 11 the six greenhouse gases are carbon dioxide methane nitrous oxide hydrofluorocarbons perfluorocarbons and sulfur hexaluoride 12 for more information on market mechanisms see crs report ib97057 global climate change marketbased strategies to reduce greenhouse gases 13 s 366 was similar to s 566 from the 107th congress 14 s 485 inhofe the clear skies act of 2003 also established cap and trade program for nitrogen oxides from utilities however s 485 is not included in table 3 because it did not address carbon dioxide the primary greenhouse gas 15 this report does not discuss bills that would have reduced other pollutants without including co2 such bills included hr 203 hr 999 and s 485 crs10 commercial sectors that emit over 11023 tons of greenhouse gases per year starting in 2010 the bills would have capped total ghg emissions at 65 billion tons co2 equivalent emissions reduced by the amount of co2 equivalent emissions from noncovered entities in the year 2000 after 2015 s 139 would have further restricted emissions to 565 billion tons reduced by the amount of emissions from noncovered entities in 1990 both bills would also have established formula for allocating ghg emissions allowances and would have established climate change credit corporation to manage allowance trading in addition to establishing caps on all six greenhouse gases the bills would have supported climate change research and established ghg emissions inventory the bills also included requirement that the administrator of the epa establish national ghg database and develop methods and standards to measure and verify ghg emissions see table 1 and table 2 crs11 table 3 ghg cap and trade bills hr 4067 gilchrest s 139 lieberman hr 2042 waxman s 366 jeffords s 843 carper covered any electric power any electric power
