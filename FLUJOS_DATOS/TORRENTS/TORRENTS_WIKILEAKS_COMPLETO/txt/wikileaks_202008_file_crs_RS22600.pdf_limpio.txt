responsibilities for regulating the safety of the us food supply which many experts say is among the safest in the world nevertheless critics view this system as lacking the organization and resources

various types of fresh produce and to meat and poultry products numer ous bills addressing various aspects of food safety were introduced into the 110 th congress including proposals to reorganize

than 1 trillion on food each year nearly half of it in restaurants schools and other places outside the home2 federal laws give food manufacturers distributors and retailers the basic responsibility for assuring that foods are wholesome safe and handled under sanitary conditions number of federal agencies cooperating with state local and international entities play major role in regulating food quality and safety under these laws the combined efforts of the food industry and the regulatory agencies often are credited with making the us food supply among the safest in the world nonetheless public health officials estimate that each year 76 million people become sick 325000 are hospitalized and 5000 die from foodborne illnesses caused by contamination from any one of number of microbial pathogens3 at issue is whether the current system has the resources and structural organization to protect consumers from these dangers also at issue is whether federal food safety laws first enacted in the early 1900s have kept pace with the significant changes that have occurred in the food production processing and marketing sectors since then

administering at least 30 laws related to food safety the food and drug administration fda which is part of the us department of health and human services hhs and the food safety and inspection service fsis which is part of the us department of agriculture usda together comprise the majority of both the total funding and the total staffing of the governments food regulatory system 4 fsiss fy2008 budget was approximately 930 million in appropriated funds plus another estimated 140 million in industrypaid user fees fdas budget for foods was 577 million in fy2008 virtually all of it

900 in the washington dc area fda regulates food manufacturers safety practices by relying on companies selfinterest in producing safe products and by working with the industry to improve production practices about 57000 food manufacturers are subject to periodic fda inspection for regulatory compliance according to gao unannounced compliance inspections of individual establishments by fda officials occur roughly once every five years fda relies on notifications from within the in dustry or from other federal or state inspection personnel as well as other sources to alert it to situations calling for increased inspection in the washington dc area two fda offices are the focal point for food safetyrelated activities the center for food safety and applied nutrition cfsan is

hazards when used in foodproducing animals the fda also cooperates with over 400 state agencies across the nation that carry out wide range of food safety regulatory activities however the state agencies are primarily responsible for actual inspection fda works with the stat to set the safety standards for food establishments and commodities and evaluates the states performance in upholding

the production line or to inspect every item instead inspectors are on site daily to monitor the plants adherence to the standards for sanitary conditions ingredient levels and packaging and to conduct statistical sampling and testing of products because all plants are visited daily processing inspection also is considered to be continuous fsis also is responsible for certifying that foreign

inspection programs fsis is statutorily responsible for ensuring that the states programs are at least equal to the federal program plants processing meat and poultry under state inspection can market their products only within the state although the 2008 farm bill will permit interstate shipment in some cases if state chooses to discontinue its own inspection program or if fsis determines that it does not meet the agencys equivalency standards fsis must assume the responsibility for inspection if the formerly stateinspected plants are to remain in operation fsis also has cooperative agreements with more than two dozen states under which state inspection personnel are authorized to carry out federal inspection in meat andor poultry plants products from these plants may travel in interstate

congressional scrutiny of the issue as number of developments in recent years have illustrated for example more than 200 confirmed illnesses and three deaths were linked in fall 2006 to the consumption of bagged fresh spinach grown in california that was found to carry coli o157h7 the incident raised public concern about the safety of all fresh leafy produce and stimulated number of industry and government initiatives to limit future contamination in february 2007 fda announced nationwide recall of peanut butter due to salmonella contamination after hundreds of illnesses dating back to august 2006 were linked to the bacterium 7 in apriljuly 2008 more than 1300 persons in 43 states the district of columbia and canada were found to be infected with the same unusual strain of bacteria salmonella saintpaul officials first suspected fresh tomatoes as the vehicle but later genetic tests confirmed the pathogen on samples of serrano pepper and irrigation water from farm in mexico throughout 2007 and 2008 usda announced numerous recalls totaling many million pounds of ground beef products due to concerns about coli o157h7 contamination attention also had shifted to the safety of food imports in early 2007 when adulterated pet food ingredients imported from china sickened or killed numerous dogs and cats and subsequently were found in some hog chicken and fish feed 8 in june 2007 fda announced that it was detaining imports of certain types of farmraised seafood from china specifically shrimp catfish basa dace and eel until their shippers could confirm that they are free of unapproved drug residues in late 2008 fda announced that all chinese dairy products and dairy ingredients were to be detained until importers could prove they were free of melamine the same adulterant found earlier in the pet food ingredients the toxic chemical was being added to milk in china to boost protein readings as result six infants reportedly were killed and nearly 300000 sickened there after consuming tainted infant formula during the 110 th congress series of congressional and administration reports were issued which cited significant gaps in the federal food safety
