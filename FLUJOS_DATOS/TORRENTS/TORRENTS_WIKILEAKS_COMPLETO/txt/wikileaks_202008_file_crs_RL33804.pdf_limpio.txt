provides funds to small rural leas an enrollment of less than 600 and relatively poor rural leas child poverty rate of at least 20 approximately 4000 leas receive funds under the small rural schools achievement program srsa and an additional 1200 leas receive rural lowincome school rlis grantshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33804 order code rl33804 rural education and the rural education achievement

ral education achievement program reap overview and policy issues summary advocates for rural local educational ag encies leas maintain that these school districts have many advantages for example that rural schools are more likely to be closely connected to the community parents and students than is the case in larger urban and suburban leas at the same time rural schools face variety of challenges both in general such as lack of access to cultural and educational resources and more specifically regarding cu rrent federal requireme nts related to the child left behind act or nclba such as special problems meeting the requirement for highly qualif ied teachers under nclba there are many ways to define rura l school the definition of rural school can be based on location eg distance from metropolitan areas by size or by population density targeting can also be based on how poor rural school district is depending on the definition used th number of rural leas can vary from 11 to more than 60 of all leas and can be said to serve as few as 2 of all public school students to as many as onequarter of all students rural school district s differ in important ways from their urban and suburban counterparts rural district s tend to have fewer minority students while large and midsize cities often have majority minority student populations rural school districts tend to be predominantly white rural districts tend to have smaller schools for example high schools in rural areas ve an average enrollment of about 200 students while urban nd suburban high schools average between 800 and 1200 students similarly rural schools have fewer teachers fo r example 20 teachers for the average rural high school and nearly 60 teachers for the average urban high school finally rural districts are less lik ely to have special schools and programs for example nearly 10 of urban schools are charter schools while less than 2 of rural schools are charters one way that congress has aimed to ai d rural schools is through the rural education achievement program reap which provides funds to small rural leas an enrollment of less than 600 and relatively poor rural leas child poverty rate of at least 20 approximately 4000 as receive funds under the small rural schools achievement program srsa and an additiona l 1200 leas receive rural lowincome school rlis grants the reap program is part of the ementary and secondary education act esea which the 110th congress is expected to cons ider for reauthorization one possible policy question involves potential ch ange in how rural leas are identified under the program the statut specifies the use of local codes to determine which leas are located in rural areas the us department of education ed has proposed changes to the determination of locale codes if adopted the new locale code system could eliminate some leas from eligibility for reap funds perhaps as many as 400 from the srsa program nd add newly eligible leas perhaps 35 this report will not be updatedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33804contents introduction 1 what is rural school district 3 l c t i n 3 m t r c n t r i c l c l c d s 3 u r b n c n t r i c l c

have many advantages for example the wisconsin rural policy netw ork forum listed number of advantages including the following rural teachers are key members of the community and tend to know the students and their families rural schools have flatter orga nizational structure with fewer layers than nonrural school systems and are able to adjust or adapt relatively quickly to change students in rural schools tend to support one anothe r with activities such as peer mentoring the schools within rural communitie s are very visible and strongly connected with the community2 rural school advocates also admit that rural schools face challenges these include the following rural schools face extreme fiscal limitations which result in various problems such as limited range of curricular options and lack of advanced placement course offe rings as well as difficulties providing competitive salaries to attract and retain highly qualified teachers rural schools tend to have declining enrollment many rural schools are in sparsely populated areas which results in several problems such as high transportation costs and limited access to cultural and educational resources3 in addition to these general challenges rural local educational agencies leas may face particular problems meeting requirements of th elementary and secondaryhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33804crs2 4 see for example

school districts may be mo re likely than other districts to face problems in complying with nclba requirements gao findings include those listed below achieving nclba goals for large enrollments of economically disadvantaged students present more challenges for rural leas than for nonrural leas some rural districts lack the community resources such as librariesand museums which may suppor t improved academic performance compared with nonrural leas rural leas are more likely to experience problems recruiting t eachers because of difficulties offering competitive salaries small rural districts are more likely to report that factors related toschool size and geographic isol ation such as limited personnel make it difficult to release teachers and administrators for attending conferences and training impeding their ability to implement nclba requirements some rural districts indicated limited numbers of staff createddifficulties completing nclba requirements such as reporting on school progress 5 both the us department of educati on ed and the congress have sought to address concerns of rural sc hool districts in response to the gao report ed pointed out that it has attempted to provide additional flexibility to rural leas for example ed allows teachers in rural leas extr time up to 3 years to meet teacher qualification requirements and permits states to use single state test for teachers to demonstrate subject matter compet ency for core academic subjects6 congress has enacted and funded the rural educati on achievement program reap to help address challenges that rural leas facehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33804crs3 7 task force minutes p 5 8 gao effective strategies p 2 9 the general rubric is that an lea is assigned the locale code of the schools enrolling 50 or more of the leas students if sing code accounts for 50 or more of an leas students the lea is assigned the code of schools accounting for the highest percentage of its students 10 source nces website at httpncesedgovccdrural_localesasp 11 ibidwhat is rural school district despite the interest and concern of congress and others about rural school districts determining which leas are rural is complex and sometimes controversial complexity and controversy can result becau different defin itions of rural can result in significant changes in the number of such leas and on the targeting of any program aimed at assisting them estimates of the number of rural district s vary widely for example according to the secretary of educations task for ce on rural education forty three percent of the nations public schools are in rural ar eas and nearly onethird of americas schoolaged children attend pub lic schools in these commun ities7 presumably using more stringent definition the gao found that in the 200102 school year rural districts comprised 25 percent of all school districts in the country8 among possible characteristics that might be used to identify rural leas are location size population density and poverty l evel table 1 shows numbers and characteristics of leas identified as rural based on these characteristics location rural lea might be defined as one located in rural area but what is rural area eds national center for education statistics nces in cooperation with the census bureau has devised typology to classify the location of leas and individual schools nces uses these locale codes to classify each school in an lea based on its geographic location nc than categorizes each lea based on the code or codes assigned to each school9 since the 1980s nces has used the so called metrocentric locale codes which have 8 classificati ons as discussed below nces and the census bureau have recently changed codes to an urban centric system with 12 classifications metrocentric locale codes metrocentric locale codes are based on the physical location represented by an addre ss that is matched against geographic database maintained by the census bur eau this database is the topographically integrated and geographically encode d referencing system or tiger10 metro centric locale codes are used to classify schools and leas according to the following typology11httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33804crs4 12 according to the census bureau website httpwwwcensusgovpopulationwww estimatesaboutmetrohtml the united states office of mana gement and budget omb defines metropolitan urban core area with population of 50000 or more and micropolitan urban core area with population between 10000 and 50000 statistical areas according to published standards that are applied to census bureau data the general concept of metropolitan or micropolitan statistical area is that of core area containing substantial population nucleus together with adjacent communities having high degree of economic and social integration with that core the term core based statistical area cbsa became effective in 2000 and refers collectively to metropolitan and micropolitan statistical areas1 large city central city of core based statistical area cmsa or metropolitan statistical area msa12 with the city having population greater than or equal to 250000 2 midsize city central city of cmsa or msa with the city having population less than 250000 3 urban fringe of large city any territory within cmsa or msa of large city and defined as ur ban by the census bureau 4 urban fringe of midsize city any territory within cmsa or msa of midsize city and defined as urban by the census bureau 5 large town an incorporated place or ce nsusdesignate d place with population greater than or equal to 25000 and located out side cmsa or msa 6 small town an incorporated place or censusdesignated place with population less than 25000 and greater than or equal to 2500 and located outside cmsa or msa 7 rural outside msa any territory designated as rural by the census bureau that is outside cmsa or msa of large or midsize city 8 rural inside msa any territory designated as rural by the census bureau that is within cmsa or msa of large or midsize city as table 1 shows leas categorized by nces as rural locale codes of 7 and 8 account for over 50 of all school dist ricts and nearly 18 of all students including leas categorized as locale 6 small towns accounts for over 60 of all school districts and 25 of all students as noted above footnote 8 nces classifies lea st atus based on the code of majority or plurality of its schools more stringent definition is to classify an lea as rural only if all of its schools are classified as rural table 1 shows that this definition makes significant difference reducing the number of leas defined as rural from 8200 to 7200 and cutting the numbe r of students served by rural leas by 4 million reductions are also seen when this more stringent definition is applied to the 6 7 and 8 classificationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33804crs5 13 according to nces the metrocentric code s are based on metropolitan statistical areas and are coterminous with counties the urba ncentric codes rely on urbanized areas which are densely settled geographic cores with densely settled areas surrounding them meeting

last two years nces has worked with the census bureau to revise locati on classifications for schools and leas to differentiate this new system from the old locale codes these are termed urban centric locale codes13 nces provides two reasons for these changes first improvement in geocoding permits precise location of most schools based on longitude and latitude the second reas on is changes made by the office ofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33804crs6 14 see httpncesedgovccdrural_localesaspmanagement and budget omb in the definition of metropolitan and non metropolitan areas nces maintains that improved geocodi ng technology makes the new codes more accurate in addition the new code s overcome some shortcomings of the metrocentric locale codes such as the lack of classifi cation for suburbs significant undercounting of school dist ricts in towns and imprecision in distinguishing rural schools in remote is olated areas from thos nearer to urban cores14 the new urbancentric locale codes are as follows 11 large city territory inside an urbanized ar ea and inside principal city with population of 250000 or more 12 midsize city territory inside an urbanized ar ea and inside principal city with population less than 250000 and great er than or equal to 100000 13 small city territory inside an urbanized ar ea and inside principal city with population less than 100000 21 large suburb territory outside principal c ity and inside an urbanized area with population of 250000 or more 22 midsize suburb territory outside principal c ity and inside an urbanized area with population less than 250000 and greater than or equal to 100000 23 small suburb territory outside principal c ity and inside an urbanized area with population less than 100000 31 fringe town territory inside an urban cluster that is less than or equal to 10 miles from an urbanized area 32 distant town territory inside an urban cluster that is more than 10 miles and less than or equal to 35 miles from an urbanized area 33 remote town territory inside an urban cluster that is more than 35 miles from an urbanized area 41 fringe rural censusdefined rural territory that is less than or equal to 5 miles from an

more than 25 miles from an urbanized area and is also more than 10 miles from an urban cluster httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33804crs7 15 the current ccd data provide urbancentric codes for individual schools but not for leas 16 percentages are based on leas reporting some enrollment in school year 20032004 approximately 16000 leastable 2 shows comparable codes under the 2 classification systems

nces website httpncesedgovccdrural_localesasp table 1 shows that the new codes result in significantly fewer leas classified as rural assuming that the stri cter all schools rule is used15 comparison of leas with all schools classified as rural under the metrocentric system 7 and 8 with those with all rural schools classified as rural under the urbancentric system 41 42 and 43 shows reduction of more than 1200 leas classified as rural and reduction in the number of students served in rural leas of over 1 million size another criterion for identifying rural school districts is enrollment size there are many small leas in the united states the median lea size ie the enrollment encompassing 50 of all leas is 880 students16 ten percent of all leas have 100 students or fewer as disc ussed below congress has defined small lea as one having fewer than 600 students as table 1 shows approximately 6500 leas or more than 40 of leas repor ting some enrollment in 20032004 fit this criterion and these leas enroll about 16 million students about 34 of all public school students in 20032004 on average these leas have 1 or 2 schools and about 20 teachers many of these small leas are in midwest and southwestern states as well as in california for example texas alone has over 500 leas with fewer than 600 students about 45 of all its leas and nearly 9 of the total of such districts in the nation on the other hand veral states such as south carolina west virginia florida alabama and delaware have onl handful of leas that meet the 600 student criterionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33804crs8 17 presumably many of these are charter sc hools classified as leas the ccd lea data base does not provide information on whether an lea is charter school 18 for example the website for lake count illinois lists 44 school districts see httpwwwepodunkcomcgibinlocallist phplocal6328loctgroupschool_ districtsdirection downsec0qty44 19 not all leas classified as rural are in sp arsely populated counties for example nearly onefourth of rural leas within metropolitan areas locale code 8 are in counties with 600 people or more per square milenot all small school districts are located in rural areas of the 6579 leas with fewer than 600 students 4700 have locale code s of 7 or 8 at the same time nearly 900 have locale codes of 1 ie are cla ssified as within an msa or cmsa17 population density population density is anothe r way to define rural school districts one measure of population density is to tal population divided by tota l land area in square miles to produce data on persons per square mile unfortunately these data are readily available only by county since many states have multiple leas per county18 as well as leas that are located in multiple coun ties merging lea data with county data on people per square mile gives only rough approximation of how densely or sparsely populated leas are these countylevel data suggest that ther are many leas in relatively sparsely populated areas for example 50 of all leas are in counties with fewer than 90 persons per square mile 25 are in counties with fewer than 30 persons per square mile and 10 are in counties with fewer than 10 persons per square mile which is the criterion used in the srsa program as discussed below as one would expect many rural leas are in sparsely populated counties ninety pe rcent of rural leas outside metropolitan areas cale code 7 are in countie s with fewer than 90 people per square mile nearly 25 of these rura l leas are in counties with less than 10 persons per square mile19 table 1 shows that leas in counties with less than 10 persons per square mile account for about 10 of all leas and about 2 of all students as one would expect most of the leas in lowdensity counties are in western states for example nearly 90 of alas kas leas are in counties with fewer than 10 people per square mile this is tr ue for 85 of wyomings leas and for twothirds of north dakota s and nevadas leas on the other hand most states east of the mississippi river have less than 2 of their leas in counties that are this sparsely populated and 19 states have leas in counties with population density less than 10 persons per square mile poverty although measures of poverty are not indi cators of whether an lea is rural as we shall see congress has used measure of child poverty as means of targeting funds to some rural leas the only sour ce of data on schoolage poverty ages 5 tohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33804crs9 20 see httpwwwcensusgovhheswwwsaipeindexhtml these estimates for income year 2003 have been merged into the ccd lea data set there are about 14000 leas that are in both data bases 21 poverty rate is calculated by dividing timated number of children 5 to 17 years old in poverty by total number of children 5 to 17 years old 22 the average poverty rate for leas in countie s with fewer than 10 persons per square mile is 173 the average poverty rate for leas with fewer than 600 students is 15317 for leas is the small area income and poverty estimates saipe from the census bureau20 the average poverty rate21 is 142 for all leas in the ccd that are also included in the saipe data base about 25 of all as have poverty rates of 20 or more the standard congress used to target funds to leas with relatively high poverty rates this finding that about 25 of leas have poverty rates of at least 20 holds for most categoriza tions of rural leas discussed above and included in table 1 see last column the exceptions are leas in sparsely populated counties which tend to have higher poverty ra tes 313 are at or above this criterion and small as which tend to have wer poverty rates 195 are at or above the 20 poverty level22 figure 1 shows how poverty rates vary by locale code large city school districts tend to have the highest poverty rate s leas in midsize cities towns and rural areas outside urban areas have similar rates leas in fringe cities and in rural areas within urban areas tend to have lower rates source crs analysis of ed data there are of course regional differences in poverty rates schools in the south and west tend to have high er rates than leas in new england and midatlantic states for example the overall poverty ra among leas in new england states is 84 and the average rate for rural leas outside urban areas in new england is0510152025 1 large city2 mid size city3 fringe large city4 fringe midc ity5 large tow n6 small tow n7 rural outside urban areas8 rural

nces uses decision rule based on the plurality of schools locale codes to assign locale codes to leas tabulation of enrollm ents from the ccd school data base for the same school year 20032004 results in higher rural school enrollments about 10 million or about 21 of the 48 million public school ch ildren much of the redistribution comes from schools and leas with the locale code of 8 rural within an urban area presumably number of leas have individual schools locate d in these rural areas but the plurality of these schools receive nonrural code the point to remember as discussed earlier in this report is that analyses may differ significantly depending on how one defines rural leas103 overall school poverty in southern st ates is 210 and the average rate for southern rural leas outsi urban areas in 225 characteristics of rural school districts this section compares selected characteristics of rural leas to leas in other categories based on one defin ition of rural and nonrural status leas metrocentric locale codes codes 7 and 8 for rural leas as noted above and as shown in figure 2 rural school districts as determined based on locale codes enrolled about 85 million children in sc hool year 20032004 this represents about 18 of the 48 million public school children in that school year at the same time nearly 75 of all public school children ttend schools in large mid size

leas tend to be majorityminority for example in school year 2003 2004 whites made up only about 20 of the enro llment in large city districts and less than 50 of enrollment in midsize school districts on the other hand whites made up large proportions of the enrollment in small towns about 70 and in rural school districts about 80 source crs analysis of ed data another view of ethnic makeup of school districts is to ask where children from various groups go to school see figure 4 whites tend to be enrolled in suburban and rural school districts 45 and 27 black hispanic and asianamerican students are much more likely to be enro lled in cities and subur bs and less likely to be enrolled in rural leas 11 of black s 8 of hispanics and 5 of asian americans are enrolled in rural school

leas is small size for example many have fewer than 600 students as figure 5 shows not only are many leas small but their schools are also rela tively small for example while high schools in large and midsize cities aver age more than 1000 students rural high schools outside urban areas locale code 7 average about 200 students similarly urban and suburban middle schools and pr imary schools tend to

smaller tend to have few teachers for exam ple high schools in rural school districts outside urban areas average about 20 teachers at least some of these differences in numbers of teachers and similarities in class size probably reflect school funding formulas based to some degree on enrollments source crs analysis of ed data special programs in rural leas in recent years congress has supported number of reforms aimed at increasing flexibility and improving education the ccd schools data base provides information on three of these reforms by identifying which schools are charter schools which are schoolwide projects unde r the esea title ia program and which are magnet schools ccd data indicat that all 3 of these reforms tend to be concentrated in urban nd suburban school districts public charter schools are public elementary or secondary schools that are exempted from certain rules and regulations otherwise applicable to public schools in exchange for commitment toward atta ining positive re sults in meeting state content and performance standards in acco rdance with the terms and conditions of charter granted by an authorized public chartering agency24

eligibility grant determination and use of funds eligibility as noted above rural leas can be defined in various ways and congress has chosen combinations of rural definitions to determine lea eligibility which differ for the two programs an lea is eligible for the srsa program if all schools served by the lea have trocentric locale code of 7 or 828 and either its average daily attendance ada is less than 600 or the county or counties in which the lea is located has population density of fewer than 10 people per square mile an lea is eligible for the rlis program if all its schools have locale codes of 6 7 or 829 and at least 20 of the children the lea serves are from families below the poverty line finally an lea that recei ves grant under the srsa program is not eligible for rlis funding table 4 shows how these criteria interact to produce estimates of leas eligible for the srsa and rlis programs as the table illustrates compared with determination by locale alone combining eligibility criteria significantly reduces the number of leas that are eligible for assistance in the case of the srsa program as noted below actual grants for eligible leas can be reduced or even eliminated depending on f unds eligible leas receive under off setting esea formula grant programshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33804crs19 table 4 estimating numbers of leas eligible for reap

amounts that leas recei ve and aggregate state amounts are determined differently under the two programs under the srsa program an initial amount is calculated for each eligible lea as follows to base grant of 20000 an additional amount is dded based on the numbe r of students over 50 times 100 however initial amount may exceed 60000 the following are some examples of initial amount calculations leas with 50 students or fe wer have initial amounts of 20000 an lea with 51 students has an initial amount of 20100 20000 plus 100 times 5150 an lea with 449 students has an initial amount of 5990020000 plus 100 times 44950 leas with 450 to 599 students have initial grants of 60000 forexample the calculation based on 451 students would be 20000 plus 100 times 4515060100 which exceeds the maximum so the initial amount is 60000 as noted above the srsa program aims to supplement esea grant programs as result an leas final grant is base d on adjusting its initial amount by the total amount it received from the following esea gr ant programs in the prior fiscal year lea subgrants under the teacher and principal training and recruiting fund subpart 2 of title ii lea technology grants section 2412a2a of title ii lea grants under the safe and drugfree schools and communities program section 4114 and innovative programs under the promo ting informed parental choice and innovative programs part of title vhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33804crs20 30 approximately 200 srsaeligible leas r eceive srsa funding because the amount of funding they receive from the offsetting ea programs equals or exceeds their initial grant amounts however as noted below th leas are eligible for some flexibility in using funds under these 4 offsetting programs see the discussion of uses of funds below 31 the statute does generally provide for the situation in which funds are initially insufficient and subsequently additional funds become available 20 usc 7345ab3 32 the outlying areas receiving rlis grants are american samoa guam the northern mariana islands and the virgin islands 33 state may use formula based on the propor tion of students in average daily attendance ada in eligible leas or an alternative formula as approved by the secretary that results in serving equal or greater concentrations of children from families with incomes below the poverty line relative to the concentrations that would be served if the ada formula were used 6221b2cas result of this offset provision an lea receiving total of 60000 or more from these 4 esea programs would not r eceive any additional funds under the srsa program30 state amounts for the srsa prog ram are the sum of amounts allocated to leas see the first column of grants in table 5 the current srsa statutor formula does not provide mechanism under which all currently appropr iated funds could be allocated for example in fy2004 the formula alone with the 20000 minimum and 60000 maximum together with the offset provision would have allotted bout 67 million while the appropriation for that fiscal year was about 83 million for the srsa program the statute does not provide details on how to deal with this situation ie how to ratably increase grants31 ed does allocate all f unds appropriated and has implemented procedure to do this which among other things appears to maintain the minimum and maximum formula amounts for example ed does not ratably increase an initial grant above 60000 unlike the srsa program grants are first made to states under the rlis program also unlike the srsa program the statute instructs the secretary to reserve funds from the total rlis appropriation for bureau of indian affairs bia schools ½ and for outlying areas ½32 the remainder is allotted to states based on each states share of students attending schools in eligible leas thus for example state with 1 of students attendi ng schools in eligible leas in that state would receive 1 of funds remaining af ter reserving bia and outlying area funds see the second column of grants in table 5 for fy2008 estimated state amounts states then award grants to eligible leas either competitively or based on formula33

due to rounding table 5 shows number of patterns in the distribution of grants under the two reap programs in number of cases states receive funds under one program but not under the other for example abama receives srsa funding but does receive rlis grants this is because practically none of alabamas 130 leas have enrollments less than 600 this is also true for other southeaste rn states which tend to have larger consolidated or countywide leas and few or small leas on the other hand alabama has about 60 leas fo r which all schools have metrocentric locale codes of 6 7 or 8 nd poverty rates of at least 20 thus alabama receives substantial grant under the rlis progra m as do other southeastern states on the other hand some states receive little if any rlis funding one reason is that some states have very few high poverty leas for example iowa which receives rlis funding has only 2 leas with poverty rates of 20 or more another reason is that some states have many leas that are eligible for both programs but can only be eligible for srsa grants as required under the statute for example south dakota wh ich received more than 10 times the funding under the srsa than under rlis has nearly 85 of its leas that are eligible for both programs and thus can receive grants onl under the srsa program finally there are several states that r eceive little or funds from ither program in fy2008httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33804crs23 34 this was also the case for the district of columbia all schools in an urban area 35 the gao study which selected the most rural states for its study based

state and the nearest metropolitan statistical area as measure of geographic isolation gao effective strategies p 3 vermont met these criteria and was included in gaos study 36 in its guidance on reap ed refers to lternative use of funds as reapflex and differentiates this flexibility from other esea flexibility as follows reapflex does not involve transfer of funds from one program to another rather reapflex gives an lea broader authority in spending applicable funding for alternative uses under selected federal programs on the other hand when an lea transfers funds from one program to another under the transferability authority in section 6123 the transferred funds increase the allocation of the receiving program and are subject to all of the rules and requirements of the receiving program ed reap guidance section iib1 37 ed reap guidance section iib5hawaii maryland and vermont receive reap funding34 hawaii is single statewide lea marylands leas do not appear to meet eligibility criteria for either program vermont leas may not apply for the srsa program because grants are considered too small35 use of funds recipients of srsa grants may use funds for activities authorized by

student re medial services to prepare them for annual assessments40 distribution of certain esea grants to rural leas as noted above two purposes of the re ap program are to compensate rural school districts because they are at disadvantage in obtaining competitive grants from the department of education and ed fo rmula grants are often too small to have an impact certainly conventional wisdom would support these contentions with respect to competitive grants rural school s especially small rural schools tend to have fewer administrative staff who ar generally thought to be key to writing grant proposals and obtaining competitive gr ants regarding formula grants sincehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33804crs25 41 62022 42 lea grants are not available at the national level for the rlis programs because funds are allocated to states by formula and na tional data are available on states distribution of rlis grants to leasmany grants are distributed to states nd to leas based on f actors related to size eg schoolage population nd schoolage poverty smalle r leas receive smaller grants the grant application proce ss and the subsequent federal reporting requirements can reduce or eliminate the value of formula grants for some smaller leas data on formula and competitive gran ts do not completely support these conventional notions however does reap compensate small rural leas for small formula grant amounts as noted above the reap aims to co mpensate rural school districts because they often receive formula grants that are too small to be effective in meeting the intended goals of the formula grant programs41 table 6 examines this proposition for leas eligible for the srsa program42 the table presents median grants for the four esea programs that offset the fi nal srsa grants see discussion above on srsa grant determination clearly srsatargeted leas tend to receive smaller grants than do other leas for example the median grants for esea title iia teacher and principal training and r ecruiting fund and nhancing education through technology for srsaeligible leas is less than 50 of the median grant for other leas 14300 vs 30600 similarly the median total of all four grants for srsaeligible leas is 19700 compared with 42300 for other leas at the same time srsaeligible grants are somewhat larger on per student basis for example the combined median

analysis of ed budget service data note median table 6 shows that the median srsa grant for fy2004 was 19000 for the nearly 4000 leas that received grants43 the median perpupil grant was 92 in part because of the srsa offsetting requi rement srsa grant totals and perpupil amounts can vary widely maximum gr ants were of course 60000 however grants ranged as low as 39 per student grants also ranged widely from less than 100 per student to 19000 per student pe rpupil amounts for some western leas were substantial because these leas qualified for the minimum grant of 20000 and are very small in few cases havi ng less than 10 students finally table 6 shows that the srsa program does indeed compen sate small rural school districts for relatively small esea grants the median combination of the four esea grants and the srsa grant was 42400 roughly the same as the median combined esea grants for other leas on perpupil basis sr sa grantees fared better 181 vs 60 in addition the srsa flexibi lity provision permits small rural leas to concentrate funds from the offsetting programs and th srsa grant on one or few activities authorized by these programs whereas othe r leas

eligibility as noted above eligibility for the two re ap programs is based in part on the locale codes of leas schools in additi on to other requirement s all schools in an lea must have metrocentric locale codes of 7 or 8 for the lea to be eligible for the srsa program and 6 7 or 8 for an lea to be eligible for the rlis program as discussed above nces and the census bu reau have devised new set of urban centric codes which are said to more accurately depict schools geographic location currently both sets of locale code s are available and will be available for perhaps two years thereafter nces will only make available th more recent urban centric locale codes46 therefore the congress may wish to consider how the use of the new codes might impact reap eligibility and funds distribution table 8 compares the number of schools cl assified according to metrocentric locale codes as located in cities urban fringes towns and rural areas with those classified according to urbancentric locale codes as located in these areas clearly there is great deal of overlap for exam ple nearly 92 of all schools classified as rural under the metrocentric system are so classified as rural under the urban centric system at the same time some schools are classified differently under the two systems for example about 8 of schools classified as rural under the metro centric system would not be

because it is uncertain which urbancentric code or codes should be used to substitute for metrocentric code 6 48 this approach may underestimate the impact of the new codes because it does not allow for leas that were not eligible based on the budget service data to be deemed eligible it only permits estimating numbers that would longer be eligible and resulting reallocation in some cases states gain in the estimated number of leas receiving grants this is because there are additional funds to allocate because some leas are longer eligible as result some leas now receive funding when they would not under the implementation of current law 49 the amount allocated to leas for fy2004 was 835 million this total is slightly higher than the amount allocated in table 9 because complete data were not available for 15 leas that received fy2004 grants 50 larger estimated percentage changes occu r for wyoming more than 100 increase in the state total and for delaware 100 loss although these changes are from very small original totals 51 the remainder are leas that were eligible b ecause of state alternative rural definitions these leas perhaps would remain eligible if their alternative definitions were accepted by edwhat impact would change to the ur bancentric locale codes have on the distribution of reap funds table 9 shows estimated srsa state totals and estimated numbers of lea grant recipients based on metrocentric and urbancentric locale codes47 all other formula factors eg enrollment and county density were the same for both sets of estimates all formula factors except for the urbancentric codes which came from the ccd database came from an ed budget service data base used to determine lea srsa grants48 the total allocated under both scenarios 832 million is the

estimated to lose grants based on the urbancentric c odes and 35 leas that would receive grants if the urbancentric codes were used virtually all of the leas estimated to lose funding are classified as trocentric code 7 reduction of 186 leas or 6 in this category or metrocentric code 8 reduction of 208 leas or 23 in this category51 recall that the latter code designated rural leas within metropolitan areas the urbancentric locale coding systems which takes into account distance from metropolitan areas apparently does not classify some of these leas as

of alternative formulas in the legislative process they are not intended to predict specific amounts states will receivehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33804crs34 52 ratably increasing grants means increasing grants in proportion to the relationship between each leas initial grant and the total excess funds to be distributedpossible policy issues shift in locale codes one policy issue is the possible shift to the urban centric locale codes in deter mining eligibility for reap gr ants as discussed above replacing metrocentric codes with the newer arguably more accurate urbancentric codes will remove some leas from eligibility and add others as result some leas and states will lose funding others will gain unless there are significant increases in reap funding unlikely give n current budget constraints any formula change will be controversial because there will be winners and losers this in turn means that there are easy policy alternatives one possible option would be to mandate the continued use of the metrocentric codes this approach has the obvious dvantage of ensuring that leas are not eliminated from the program and that funds are not shifted from state to state it has the disadvantage of continuing the use of rural definitions that may be inferior to other available definitions and as resu lt allocating funds to leas that may not need as much assistance as truly rural as that are in greater need of assistance another possible option would be to hold harmless those eliminated leas for period of time perhaps at decreasing percentage of their prior year grants so they can adjust to the funding loss although softening the blow to these leas it would result in lower grants assuming level or nearlevel funding to other remaining leas as funds are distributed among th 2 groups already served and the newly eligible leas allocating excess funds as discussed above the current srsa formula does not permit all currently ppropriated funds to be allocat ed to leas in part this is because srsa grants are capped at 60000 the act does not specify how to deal with this situation as result ed has had to make policy on how these excess funds should be distributed apparently to adhere to the statute the ed ratable increase52 procedure maintains both th 60000 cap and 20000 floor for the srsa grants and ratably increases grants falling between these two requirements the statute could be amended to reflect eds current pro cedures this would ensure that ed continues to follow this procedure in the future alternatively the statute could be amended to provide differe nt policy for dealing with additional appropriations for example the statute could specify ratable increase procedure under which the minimum and maximum gran ts could be ratably increased along with all other grants presumably this approach would slightly reduce leas grants that fall between the minimum and maximum grants increase benefits to small poor leas as discussed above leas that are eligible for the srsa program base d in part on enrollment below 600 are not eligible for grants under the rlis program which targets rural leas with relatively high poverty rates since it can be argued that these leas are triply disadvantaged being rural small and poor possible chan ge in the statute could recognize this by allowing small poor rural leas to bene fit from both programs this would addhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33804crs35 53 according the ccd data 5 states arizona maine minnesota montana and nebraska report at least one lea with one student 54 this is standard used in the esea title ia program which has an eligibility threshold of 10 children living in poor families in order for leas to receive title ia fundsabout 1000 leas to the rlis eligibility list and redistribute rlis state grants by increasing grants to states with large numbers of small poor leas and reducing grants to states with few small leas mostly states in the southeast if further targeting were desired higher poverty thre shold could be set for small poor leas for example poverty rate of 30 or gr eater would add less than 200 leas to the rliseligibility pool adjust srsa formula to reduce anomalies the srsa formula has resulted in some quirks which might be addressed by formula modifications for example the minimum grant of 20000 results in some very large perpupil grants while the median perpupil grant is about 90 few leas receive perpupil grants as high as 19000 this results because they have only one or few students53 one approach for reducing this result would be to limit lea participation to leas with minimum total enrollment if minimum enrollment were set at 1054 about 100 leas would be eliminated another seeming anomaly occurs when leas have offsetting program am ounts that are just few dollars less than their final srsa grant for example some leas receive grants as low as 39 solution to this problem would be to eliminate final grants that are deemed to be below size to be effective alternatively grants deemed too small on perpupil basis could be eliminated presumably some leas take this into account by not applying for gr ants after year in which they receive minimal amount for example about 350 as have perpupil grants of less than 30 nearly 200 leas have perpupil grants fo r less than 20 nd about 75 leas have perpupil grants of less than 10 these funds could then be distributed to other leas to enhance their grants another problem occurs when leas elig ible for the srsa program have off setting grants larger than their initial grant while these leas can still use the reap flex provision they receive additional reap funds one alternative to this situation would be to calculate the sr sa initial grants without the minimum and maximum grants of 20000 nd 60 000 subtract the offse tting grant amounts then apply the minimum and maximum grant amount s this would reduce the number of leas that are eligible but receive f unding about 200 leas currently experience this final concern that some states have is that unlike the rlis program states receive state administration funding unde r the srsa program despite having to provide ed with much of the data used to allocate funds such as offsetting program grant amounts this could be addressed by reserving 2 or some other percent of the appropriation for the srsa program for state administration these funds could be distributed to states based on thei r proportion of students enrolled in srsa eligible leas for the prior year of cour this would reduce funds going to small rural leas by the percentage reserved for state administrationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33804crs36 55 see httpwwwedgovfunddataawardgrntawdhtml 56 see

state educational agencies sea are mainly responsibility for providing ccd data on schools and school districts to nces two ccd data f iles were used in this report the public school universe and the

united states and the district of columbia were included the ccd includes other schools and school districts which are not eligible for reap funding such as department of defense schools the public school universe file was used to determine locale code eligibility for school districts although the local ducational agency universe file classified school districts by locale code the algorith m nces used to attribute codes differed from the requirement in the reap progra m reap requires that all schools have certain locale codes 7 or 8 or 6 7 or 8 this file was also used to determine ethnic and racial characteristics of rural and nonrural schools in addition the public school universe file was used to deter mine which schools had special characteristics for example how many charter schools and magnet schools are in rural areas the local educational agency universe file was used to determine the number of school districts that would be considered as rural under various definitions to do this this file was merged with other databases for example it was merged with the saipe database to determine lea poverty rates which ar necessary to determine eligibility for the rlis program the lea universe file was merged with data on ed grants to analyze how many rural and nonrural school districts received ed competitive grants the file was also merged with census bureau data on county level population density httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33804crs37 58 excel spreadsheet obtained from the ed budget service march 2005ed budget service data the requirements of re ap
