industry divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32026market dynamics and public policy issues in the video programming industry summary in the past 15 years the successful introduction of new t echnologies coupled with changes in government rules has cr eated strong market forces for fundamental structural change in the video progra mming industry about 80 percent of us households subscribe to cable or satellite systems offering multiple channels of programming these alternatives to broadcast television now attract more than half the total viewing audience although broad cast television still ttracts majority of viewers during primetime when popular broadcast network fare is aired similarly movie producers today receive more than twice as much revenue from the rental and sale of video cassette s and dvds as they do from movie theaters at the same time there has been widespread vertical and horizontal integration in the video programming industry the industry is increasingly dominated by small number of firms that finance the development of new programming through wide variety of arrangements with conten t providers including joint ventures and direct ownership own extensive libraries of existing programming own variety of distribution channels for bringing c ontent to the public and also own retail pipelines such as local broadcast stati ons and video store chains and currently proposed direct broa dcast satellite system these fundamental changes in the mark et structure affect the public policy issues that congress faces today there are more pipelines into the home and more distribution networks than ever before but limited number of big media players control large portion of both programming and distribution this has engendered debate on how well the existing fcc ow nership rules address the impact of consolidated ownership of programming and distribution on the public interest goals of diversity competition and localism and whether new ru that reregulate the industry could or should be formulated that would better serve those goals the purposes of this report are to explain how and why underlying market forces have created strong pressure for vertical integration across segments and horizontal mergers within segments to explain how that market consolid ation could be us ed to benefit or to harm consumers and to identify public policy issues that may arise as result of the vertical and horizont consolidation see crs report rl32027 for background nd detail on the structure of the video programming

industry and the interrelationships among the functional segments and technological alterna tives are discussed in detail in crs report rl32027market dynamics and public policy issues in the video programming industry introduction over the past 15 years technologydr iven market forces and changes in government rules have led to widespread vertical and horizontal integration1 in the video programming industry some of thes integrated firms are very large with extensive holdings that cross both func tional segments ie content production distribution and packaging and pipelines to end user customers and technologies broadcast cable direct broadcas t satellite dbs vcrs and dvds2 this has raised concerns in some quarters that th firms could use th eir market positions to harm competition and that media concentration reduces the diversity of independent voices and lessens sensitivity to local needs interests and standards other policymakers have found benef it to consumers from efficiency gains made possible by such consolidation and have pointed to some empirical evidence that media consolidation has increased the amount and quality of local news programming the purpose of this report is to descri be the market dynamics driving vertical and horizontal consolidation in the vi deo programming industry to show the potential benefits and harm to consumers from such cons olidation and to identify potential public policy issues that may be raised by the consolidation market dynamics viewers tend to value new viewing options the emergence of new technologies

percent continuedthe cost of producing scripted television ries for prime time has increased by about 30 since the early 1990s and that the co sts of production have increased from the 11 14 million range to the 14 16 million range for one hour drama and from the 400000 900000 range to the 550000 12 million range for half hour situation comedy20 it is important to understand however that production costs vary from these average levels in significant ways on one hand successful existing network programs that have demonstrated the ability to generate larger audiences than the average program hit programs such as friends or certain sports events become more expensive to produce precisely because they are successful costs increase as the talent associated with those programs athletes actors directors producers are able to renegotiate contracts to command larger portion of the revenues they generate popular programmin g that attracts large audi ence or perhaps attracts somewhat smaller audience that has high intensity of demand typically generates large revenues either from advertisers or from direct subscriber charges these higher than average revenues are shared by the owners of the programming in the form of profits and by the ta lent actors directors athletes in the form of high renegotiated salaries that include what economists call economic rents these economic rents become part of the cost of the programming the costs associated with each episode of successful network program at the peak of that programs popularity therefor could be many times the average costs identified above for example the licen fee per episode in the 20012002 season was 82 million for er 56 million for frasier and 55 million for friends and at least seven other programs has license fees per episode exceeding 2 million21 these license fees often do not cover the full costs of production because the owners of the programming can generate additional revenues from syndication of reruns and from international markets sometimes such costs can be built into production before new pilot series has demonstrated audience appeal talent with proven track record sometimes can command high salaries in advance espn recently announced rate increase of 20 percent the fifth consecutive year it has had an increase of that size22 portion of that increase goes to the

thus indirectly to the athl etes more generally james m gleason chairman of the american cable associati on an association of small cable operators claims that programming costs for 14 t op cable networks have risen 666 over the past five years an increase of more than 5 times the consumer price index23 presumably these networks have subs tantial proportion of programming that have successfully found audiences and these ch arges include the economic rents accruing to the talent that produced the programming from the perspective of the viewing pub lic the extremely high economic rents to talent that drive up these costs which ultimately are passed on to consumers through higher cable charges or higher advertising charges that raise the prices for advertised goods and services are be neficial if they generate additional programming of the sort that the public pref ers if these windfalls are ploughed back into the production of equally popular programming or innovative programming that might not otherwise be produced the public benefits but to the extent most talent athletes writers dir ectors producers etc would continue to perform at the same level even if they could not command such high prices for their services the public does not benefit from system that fosters extremely high economic rents at the same time there is lot of or iginal programming being produced at much lower cost directly for basic cable networ ks such as discovery and ae with much smaller expected udiences and revenues24 these independent producers are providing hundreds of programs for dozen s of series on budgets of less than 100000 per hour of programming25httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32026crs9 26 for an excellent discussion of the econom ic forces underlying windowing see bruce m owen and steven s wildman video economics harvard university press cambridge massachusetts 1992 27 for detailed discussion of repurposing see eg michael freeman forging model for profitability electronic media vol 21 issue 4 1282002 28 in the case of repurposing the delays between pipelines may be quite short in several continuedrising costs and fr agmented audiences may increase risk that could be mitigated by consolidation despite these cost differences mo st program producers face similar underlying cost situation they have s ubstantial upfront production costs and they do not have any prior guarantee that thei r programming will ever reach an audience less capture such large audience that they will be able to renegotiate larger portion of the revenues generated as re sult producers face very high upfront risk and it is generally in their interest to attempt to reduce that risk there are two general ways to accomplish this 1 to produ ce many different programs so that the fate of the company does not depend on the success of individual programming projects but rather on the ove rall success rate of the full tfolio of projects and 2 to negotiate joint venture with progra m distributor or reta il provider of video programs in which the latter makes an upfr ont investment in the production in return for share of the profits or lower price for programming as result of audience fragmentation and generally increasing programming costs in most situations single retail channel eg broadcas t television or movie box office reaches enough viewers to allo w the producer to fully recoup the costs of producing the programming solely through that channel at the same time advertisers seeking to reach wide audience longer can reach their full target audience through advertise rsupported programming on sing channel thus the old system of producing pr ogramming primarily for one retail channel is in most situations longer financially viable these market forces are affecting market behavior and structure in several ways first the pressure on program producers to expand and diversify their programming or to enter into joint ventures with di stributors or retailers has encouraged both horizontal mergers among producers and ve rtical mergers with distributors and retailers to the extent re ducing overall risk fosters th production of more programs or the undertaking of higherrisk projects such consolidation w ill benefit consumers second audience fragmentation is forcin g producers to market their products through multiple retail channels this is known as windowing26 when it involves motion picture programming and repurposing27 when it involves television programming for example producer may schedule new product to first be released through first run movie theaters then after some delay to be released on pay perview cable or video channe ls then after additional delay to be made available for rental or sale at video stor finally after yet additiona l delay to be shown on nonpay cable dbs or broadcas t television channels28httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32026crs10 28 continued recent repurposing deals between broadcast networks and cable networks the programs have been rerun on the cable network within about we ek of its initial broadcast apparently this has not hurt ratings for the programs though there is some concern that such initial saturation will lower the value of the programming for later syndication see eg michael freeman special report the new economics of tv forging model for profitability electronic media january 28 2002 29 it is interesting to note that major st rategy that the networks have used to contain programming costs the creation of reality television programming does not lend itself to windowing since the programs lose thei r appeal once viewer s know who won the competition thus although these programs re duce upfront production costs they lack backend revenue stream similarly most sports programs do not lend themselves to windowing and where they are expensive to produce this typically results in very high charges to the retail channels that carry the sports programming since there will be little or backend revenue stream recent price increases in sports programming have been source of controversy particularly where pr oducers and distributors ve not allowed cable systems to place those sports programs on premium channelsthe reason for doing this is to take advant age of the fact that different customers have different intensities of demand for video programming those with the highest intensity pay the most to see the video in movie format at first run theater as soon as it is released those with somewhat lower intensity accept delay and pay somewhat less to watch the video as movie on payperview those willing to wait longer and pay still less wait until the video is available for rent or purchase at video store finally those with the lowest intensity wait to view the programming when it is on nonpay cable sa tellite or broadcast channels these options allow the viewing public to select their preferred mode of obtaining video programming based on their sensitivity to price and to time delay in turn by not having single price for video programming that would be lower than some viewers would be willing to pay and higher than others would be willing to pay this viewer selection allows producers to maximize the revenues generated by their programs29 windowing allows more programming to be profitable than would otherwise be the case and therefore more programming is produced for viewers however it is not easy to negotiate the many pricing and timing variables across the production distribution and retail segments of the industry as well as across multiple retail channels especially when those channels compete with one another for audiences and in some cases for adver tisers one way to simplify this process and perform windowing efficiently is to vertically integrate across the production distribution and retail segments and to consolidate across channels within segment third in their efforts to gain viewers among the fragmented audience program distributors and retailers have the incentiv to take fullest possible advantage of whatever successes they have with their existing programs one way to do that is to create brand identity for network and extend that identity to affiliated networks for example the discovery channel once successful spawned number of affiliated programming networks disc overy civilization discove ry español discovery health discovery home leis ure discovery kids etc these in turn provide the opportunity for crossmarketing of progra ms among the cobranded networks thishttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32026crs11 30 the efficiency advantages from combining into networks or in other ways is not new broadcast networks for many decades have put together weekly program schedules that are intended to maximize viewership by carefu lly analyzing the optimal order in which programs are presented in order to hold ont audiences once they have tuned into particular network to watch particular prog ram it would be much more difficult for individual stations to perform the market re search needed to optimize program schedules 31 the ten largest multisystem operators serve

hard to stake digital claim without corporate ties multichannel news 692003 operators are seeking st eep ownership stakes in new programming services in return for carriagesame formula has been followed by many programming networks including fox hbo bet espn and mtv30 independent networks cannot perform such cross marketing as effectively these branding and crossmarketing activities need not be limited to single industry segment and in fact can be facilitated by vertical integration many of the most successful examples involve branding and cross marketing that goes beyond the video i ndustry into books magazines comic books newspapers musical recordings and amus ement parks that all build off single recognizable character or concept branding and crossmarketing frequently can be most efficiently and effectively accomplis hed within single corporate family fourth given the consolidation that s occurred in cable system ownership31 with just handful of multisystem ope rators msos controlling access to the majority of cable viewers individual content providers n eed to take whatever steps are necessary to create leverage in their dealings with msos and an obvious choice is to join forces with programming c onglomerates or with the large msos themselves although most local cable and satellite systems now have capacity to carry 80 or more networks with more than 300 existing cable networks it is becoming increasingly difficult for new networ ks to get onto systems as startups in business with high upfront production co sts they face even more directly than existing networks the need to get onto as many local cable systems as possible as quickly as possible one strategy that ne w networks have used is to offer their programming to msos and local cable syst ems without charging any per subscriber license fee or even paying the cable systems to carry their programming this limits the cable networks revenues to advertising revenues and unless they are carried by many local systems they cannot command very much in terms of advertising rates as result startup networks have increasingly been forced to follow one of two strategies some new cab networks have agreed to give the major msos especially comcast and aol time warner substantial equity interests in their networks in exchange for being carried on their systems32 alternatively some new cable networks have agreed to give megaprogrammers such as viacom discovery networks or disney substantial equity interests in their networks in exchange for becoming part of those companies line of cable

network financial statistics 2002 july 2002 at p 5data on cable network levision household penetr ation from 1994 through 200133 show that the only new networks able to gain rapid and high levels of household penetration during that period were owned in whole or in part by one of the major program distributors or msos all four of these factors are at play currently in the market for cable programming kagan world media which follows the cable industry very closely and publishes number of annua l cable reference books has described this situation in several recent publications the environment for launching cable network has changed dramatically over the last decade with cashforcarriage fees and periods with license fee now common daunting economic equation has developed for cable network start ups thats why the majority of new networks launched have been owned by major media companies and even wellheeled international players like the bbc and national geographic have chosen joint ventures rather than go it alone its simply too expensive and risky for many companies to join the long list of nets seeking carriage and the odds for success get better if partner with leverage can team up with powerful backer such as discovery34 for independents there are number of challenges first they dont have the builtinadsales and affiliaterelations infrastructure giants like discovery networks and mtv networks that enable them to launch new channels at low cost the media giants are also at an advantage in the programmingcost department they use recycled pr ogramming already aired on their core networks which results in low incrementa l costs thats why number of the networks listed among upcomingpendingpast launches have fallen by the wayside they just havent been able to raise the capital to make it through the long haul35 network launching from scratch without big infrastructure in place for administration and sales could easily burn through more than 100 mil to get to breakeven versus less than 25 mil for discovery spinoff additionally an independently owned network would have hard time getting the attention of cable and satellite operators as it wouldnt have the brandname panache of discovery or mtv networksthe econom ics is so different between analog and digital networks and between inde pendent networks and those owned by media conglomerates36 it is noteworthy that this consolidation results in economies of scale and scope that lower costs which benefit consumers to the extent those reductions are passed through as lower consumer rates but at least partially at the expense of programhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32026crs13 37 for example in his testimony before the senate judiciary committee antitrust subcommittee scott cleland ceo of the pr ecursor group identified one motivation for news corps proposed merger with dire ctv to be unleveraged to leveraged distribution newscorp understa nds that negotiating leverage increases dramatically with other programmers if you ar also major distributordiversity as major source of costs saving s for discovery and its counterparts is to recycle old programming on their new cable channels one observer has raised another market driven dynamic to bypass existing bottlenecks to technological advancement that may at least be motivating the proposed news corpdirectv merger in his testimony at the june 18 2003 senate judiciary committee hearing scott cleland ceo of precursor group stated that the combination of news corps content w ith directvs dbs distribution platform would allow news corp to become fully digital distributor legally bypassing the snailpace snakebit allcostlittlegain migration of overthea ir broadcast analog businesses to hdtv he also stated the merger would allow more of foxs programming to be transmitted over the more secure and controlled dbs distribution platform and less over the overtheair br oadcast platform which is increasingly vulnerable to piracy from napsterlike files haring and to pricin g pressure from ad zapping via tivolike technology consolidation also could be used for strategic purposes that harm consumers in addition to these incentives to consolidate to exploit production and marketing economies and efficiencies th at may benefit consumers individual companies may have incentives to expand vertically or horizontally to extend market power in fashion that does not benefit and indeed may harm consumers these opportunities typically arise when compan has some market power that conveys to it the ability to dictate the terms conditi ons andor rates at which it either buys or sells or refuses to buy or sell its servi ces or products because it enjoys superior market position37 one potential source of market power is control over highly sought after programming another potential source of market power is control over scarce spectrum such as broadcast spectrum when company possesses market power that yields superior negotiating position that does not by itself mean that consumers will be harmed for example company with popular programming might ect to follow strategy of making its programming available at low price in order to garner as wide an audience as possible and using the strength from its programming to enforce low retail rates one might imagine for example the producer of childrens movies setting and enforcing such low rates for video cassettes there are situations however where company has both the incentive and the ability to use its market power in monopolis tic fashion that harms consumers for example if company has the ability to increase short term or long term profits by tying the sales of its highlydemanded programming to purchases of its lightly demanded programming and in so doing consumers do not get their preferredhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32026crs14 38 the cable television consumer protec tion and competition act of 1992 pub l 102385 106 stat 1460 codified at 47 usc 521 et seq programming or are forced to pay excessi vely for programming then there will be consumer harm there have been number of allegations that some of the large integrated media companies are doing this for example in his testimony at the may 6 2003 senate commerce committee hearing james m gleason chairman of the american cable ssociation stated obviously some of our customers want espn or fox sports but abcdisney and foxnews corp will not let us buy espn or fox sports oftentimes in order to get the local abc or fox affiliate disney and fox will force us through retransmission consent to take and pay for other channels we know our customers dont want this abuse of re transmission consent goes further in order to get consent to carry local broadcast station in one market our members are forced to carry disney or foxs satellite programming in other markets where disney or fox do not even own the broadcast station for example is it really in the public interest for all of my customers to pay for recycled soap operas programming for which most of them have absolutely interest just so some of my customers can be permitted to watch the abc affiliate adding to the absurdity of the situation thes conditions for carriage often outlive the terms of the retransmission consent period for the local broadcast station by many years as result these mandated conditions clog cable systems channel capacity while denying that capacity to independent programmers the end result is increasedd costs and decreased choice for consumers it gets worse one solution might be to offe r the expensive services in tiers or carte this would allow consumers to choos whether or not they wish to pay for the expensive services but all of the integrated programming companies force their programming onto the lowest basic levels of service making our companies and customers pay for all of their programming whether they want it or not this reference to the retransmission c onsent requirements provides an example of how consolidation can affect the impact of existing rules on firms negotiating positions and acquisition decisions in th early 1990s in response to the general concerns of all local broadcast stations that they should be able to control how their programming is used by other parties and to the specific concerns of the smaller broadcast stations that they would be pl aced at competitive disadvantage if the local cable monopoly did not carry their signal s congress enacted copyright and cable statutes allowing each broadcast stati on to choose between allowing local cable systems within its service area to carry its signal with compensation under must carry obligation and negotiating with the local cable systems compensation for carrying its signal under retransmission consent agreement38 if agreement is reached the cable system is not allowed to carry the broadcasters signal the retransmission consent requirement subsequently was extended to direct broadcast satellite companies the law nies the fcc the ability to regulate the terms conditions and agreements of those retransmission consent agreements beyond good faith negotiati ons standard and prohibition on providing any pipeline exclusive retransmission consent thus th ere are restrictions against vertically integrated company with broadcast stations and cable networks requiring local cablehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32026crs15 companies that seek to retransmit the companys local broadcast signals also to carry the companys cable networks subsequent vertical integration has rewarded local broadcast station owners with the ability to tie retransmission consent to carriage of multiple cable channels owned by their parent company result that probably had not been contemplated when the rules were established there is another powerful market dynamic driving consolida tion mergers often upset existing equilibrium among market participants and therefore foster additional mergers thus for example in his tes timony at the june 18 2003 senate judiciary committee hearing robert miron chai rman and ceo of advancenewhouse communications stated that the relative equilibrium between the large programming conglomerates and the large msos would be broken if ne ws corp were to acquire directv since it would give news cor p unique access to multichannel pipeline to end users that it could use as leverage when negotiating with msos that is it could take very tough stance when nego tiating the terms conditions and rates at which it would make its popul ar cable or broadcast ne twork programming available to msos knowing that it could always pr ovide the programming to end users over its satellite system according to mr ron this market advantage likely would trigger an attempt by another large programming conglomerate to purchase the only other dbs system echostar in order to obtain the same market leverage more generically mergers create the need for ot her companies to respond in kind in order to protect their negotiating leverage it is therefore possible that the effect of an individual merger on consumer s in isolation may be pos itive or neutral but that merger could start chain reaction of mergers that would in aggregate harm consumers firm wants to be party to the merger that breaks the camels back and elicits government rejection however and therefore each firm w ill have the incentive to respond quickly to other mergers some fundamental questions remain unanswered although there has been lot of heat ed debate over the impact of media consolidation many f undamental factual and analytical questions about the dynamics in the video programming i ndustry remain unanswered most observers acknowledge that the high profits from successful programs are needed to fund other programs since much programming does not gene rate enough revenues to cover all costs systematic analysis has been performed however to determine whether consolidated market stru cture is required to generate the cash flow needed to produce additional popular and innovative programming similarly systematic analysis has been performed to determine the extent that the extremely high economic rents that currently accrue to key talent behind popular programming fosters the production of additional popul ar and innovative programming or whether consolidated market structure fosters those high economic rentshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32026crs16 39 according to the fccs report on cabl industry prices released july 8 2003 the average monthly rate for cable service incr eased by 82 over the 12month period ending july 1 2002 during that same period the consumer price index increased just 15 40 for example at the may 13 2003 senate commerce committee hearing on media ownership mel karmazin president and chief operating officer of viacom inc and jim goodmon president and chief executive office r of capitol broadcasting company agreed that local television stations are highly prof itable with profits in the range of 30 to 50 percent they did not specify however whet her local television stations in small markets are profitableprices for basic cable service continue to increase at significantly faster rate than inflation39 but to date systematic analysis has been conducted to determine the extent to which those price increases are attributable to heavy infrastructure investment and real increases in programming costs that have been attenuated by efficiencies gained from consolidation vs the extent they are attributable to vertically integr ated cable networks with successful programming and large multisystem operators of local cable system monopolies using their market power to maintain abovecost rates in the debate about whether to llow broadcast networks to own and operate local television stations whose signals reach more than 35 percent of total us televisi on households one still unanswered underlying economic question of inte rest to policy makers is why ownership of these additional local stations would be more valuable to the acquiring broadcast network than they are to the current owner if they werent more valu able to the network sale would take place one possibility is th at the network would be able to exploit scale or scope economies that would not be available to the current owner and these economies would be passed through to end users perhaps by providing additi onal cash for the network to use to bid successfully on sports program ming highly valued by viewers another possibility is that unlike the current owner the broadcast network also own cable netw orks and when negotiating retransmission consent agreement with local cable system it could not only demand certain price for retransmission of its local broadcast signal but also could insist that the local cable system carry all of its cable networks and that the parent mso carry all of its cable networks in markets wher it did not have local broadcast station if the programming on th tied cable networks are less highly demanded by the msos subscribers than the programming that would otherwise be carried th broadcasters acquisition of the independent broadcast sta tion would harm consumers both the broadcast networks that sought to increase the 35 percent cap and the local television stati ons owners who opposed lifting the cap agreed that local television stations are highly profitable40 viacom president mel karmazin argued that broadcast networks arenot as profitable as stations and

were positive for every market size in 2000 and were especially robust for stations in large markets this is consistent with the testimony of mel karmazin president and ceo of viacom inc and jim goodmon president and ceo of capital broadcasting company inc at the may 13 2003 senate commerce co mmittee hearing that local stations in medium and large markets enjoy profits in the range of 20 to 50 percent 43 see for example john m higgins big four look small in the margin column broadcasting cable june 20 2003 at pp 1 3own additional local stations that ge nerate profits in order to be able to bid successfully against cable networks for sports events without the additional funding fro m profitable owne d and operated stations he claimed that sports ev ents would end up going by default to cable networks and thus not be available to households that cannot afford to pay for their television programming the local affiliates and their broadcast networks share the need for good network programming and the desire for the network to be able to bid successfully yet the affilia tes oppose allowing the network to acquire additional local stations that might help the broadcast networks accomplish this an alternate way for the broadcast networks to obtain the funds needed to compete for sports programming is to reduce the compensation they currently pay to their affiliates or in the extreme to require the affiliates to pay compensation to them affiliates oppose this as well given that affiliates do have options available to them albeit distasteful ones some observers have

scarce and that those entities that control it especially in large markets enjoy market power even as t echnological alternatives now exist that provide consumers with many new options at the same time there are strong market dynamics pushing toward conso lidation both vertical and horizontal integration some of those forces involve drives toward efficiency that shouldhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32026crs18 44 the national television ownership rule has ve rtical element to it in that its intent is to limit entities ownership of local broadcast stations in order to limit the leverage of broadcast television network when negotiating with nonowned affiliate stationsbenefit consumers some i nvolve drives toward maximu m exploitation of pockets of market power that would harm consumers given these market forces and the relative absence of vertical ownership restrictions or ownership re strictions across the old broadcast and new cable and satellite technologies few big media players have come to control significant percentage of both progra mming and distribution question now facing policy makers is could or should ne w rules be formulated that would better safeguard the goals of diversity of voices localism and competition consolidation in the video programmin g industry unquestiona bly has generated one type of diversity in the scope of proposals for g overnment action or inaction in the video programming market the debate focused initially on structural rules because those dominate under th current regulatory scheme and have been the focus of scrutiny in the fccs biennial review but number of par ties have proposed the imposition of conduct rules and some parties propose leav ing things entirely to the market station ownership rules ownership rules can cover range of parameters depending on the policy goal they are intended to foster if the focus is on diversity of voices ownership rules are most likely to focus on maintaining the number of independent stations or voices if the focus is on competition ownership rules are most likely to focus on some measure of the market share or market power of entities if the focus is on localism ownership rules are most likely to focus on some measure of ownership ties to the local community of course the number of stations owned by an entity also will affect competition and an entity that capture s the largest share of the market will in effect have the loudest voice in the ma rket the existing fcc rules sometimes incorporate two or more parameters in single rule for example the local television multiple ownership rules restrict the total number of television stations an entity can own in market and allows only one of the stations to be among the top four in ratings at time of purchase the existing local television owners hip local radio ownership and cross ownership rules addre ss horizontal markets44 because they i nvolve mechanical counting of television stations radio stations or newspapers except for the only one in the top four requirement in the levision ownership rule they do not give weight to the size of the firm under scru tiny or to any market power it may have in that market or in upstream or downstream markets during the most recent fcc biennial review process chairman michael powell stated that he wanted to develop diver sity index in some way analogous to the herfindahlhirschmann index employed at the department of justice and federal trade commission to make preliminary judg ments about whether proposed mergershttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32026crs19 45 see bill mcconnell the cap as hot potato broadcasting cable march 10 2003 at p 1required additional antitrust scrutiny that could be applied to individual media mergers45 although there wa s public articula tion of the diversity index it was suggested that the diversity index would ta ke into account for example whether the acquiring entity were an independent company or vertically integrated media giant with cable network and other programming in terests critics of such an approach claimed that any measure of diversity wa s inherently subjectiv and application of diversity index analysis to proposed mergers would increase uncertainty and discourage mergers that might be beneficial ultimately the fcc chose only to use diversity index for setting the restrictions in the rules and explicitly refused to apply its diversity index to individual mergers moreover its diversity index did not take into account the market share or ma rket power of individual media outlets but rather gave the same weight to each levision station the same weight to each newspaper etc the only fcc rule designed at least in part to address the issue of concentrated ownership of both video programming and distribution is the national television ownership rule but that rule only addr esses broadcast tele vision not cable or satellite television programming ownership rules although there are more pipelines into the home and more distribution networks today than in the past few big medi players control large portion of both programming and distribution this has rais ed concerns in some quarters that such vertical consolidation could threaten the diversity of voices localism or competition the coalition for program diversity an umbrella organization that includes wolf films sony carseywernermandalbach the directors guild of america the screen actors guild and aftra has proposed that the fcc adopt rule that would require the four major broadcast levision networks to purchas 25 percent of their prime time programming from indepe ndent producers which would include any studio or production company not affiliate d with major network the intent of the proposed rule which is derivative of the fccs old financial interest rule is to increase program diversity the coalition members representing wr iters producers and other creative talent claim that with c onsolidation decisions about airing programs are made by single organization or person and once decision is made not to include show in the network schedule there is sign ificantly lessened ability to shop the show around to other networks or pipelines they allege that this has reduced the amount of innovative programming aired nd fostered copycat programming programming ownership rules do not directly address the three us telecommunications policy goals of diversity of voices localism and competition diversity of voices has trad itionally referred to news nd informational voices rather than entertainment voices television broad casters networks nd stations alike have always produced their own news programming for the most part that functionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32026crs20 46 in its application for approval to merg with directv news corp which is large programmer with many cable networks agreed to abide by these rules even continuedhas not been left to independent producer s the networks do not produce local news or entertainment programs and thus network vs independent ownership of production studios does not affect localism although repeal of the finsyn rules opened up the gates for significant vertical integration and the loss of many independent program producers to the exte nt consolidation was driven by market forces to reduce risk and gain marketing efficiencies consumers have arguably benefitted the majority of complaints about abuse of market power as opposed to complaints about relative negotiating power involve tieins made possible by consolidation that crosses technologies fro m broadcast to cable or satellite or vice versa by contrast the programming owne rship rules proposed to date all are limited to broadcast programming from public policy perspective an examination of programming ownership rules might hinge on whether it can be monstrated that vertical integration somehow gives the consolidated entity the ability to command higher profits from its successful programming but does not fo ster the production of more or more innovative and hence risky programming for consumers and whether it also can be demonstrated that such additional programming would be forthcoming with programming ownership restrictions neither the fcc nor any other party has performed such analysis nor has anybody performed analysis to determine how consolidation across the broadcast cable and satellite technolog ies will effect the relationship between high profits and economic rents for successful programming and the supply and diversity of programming nondiscriminatory access to programming most of the programming provided by the large vertically integrated cable networks is distributed to cable system s via satellite this programming is known as satellite cable pr ogramming or if the original programming is from distant broadcast station such as the turner superstation s atellite broadcast programming the fcc has adopted prog ram access rules designed to increase access to video programming for all provi ders of multichanne l video programming by prohibiting unfair or discriminatory pr actices in the sale of satellite cable programming and satellite broadcast programming distributed by cable network programmer cable network that is vertically integrated with cable system the rules prohibit unfair and discriminatory prac tices in the sale of satellite cable and satellite broadcast programming and prohi bit or limit the types of exclusive programming contracts that may be entered into between cable operators and verticallyintegrated programming vendors the fcc program access rules do not cover all situations for example they do not cover cable or broadcast programming that is distributed over terrestrial wireline landline facilities rather than satellite also they do not apply to cable networks that are vertically integrated but where that integration is with satellite system serving end users rather than cable system serving end users46 nor do theyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32026crs21 46 continued though they formally apply only to cable ne tworks affiliated with cable systems not those affiliated with satellite systems 47 see eg william p rogerson an economic analysis of the competitive effects of the takeover of directv by news corp filed in

licenses held by hughes electronic corpora tion to the news corporation ltd apply to local broadcast signals which are subject to the retransmission consent rules where program access rules are in effect they eliminate one potential harmful impact of vertical integration vertically integrated company with must have programming refusing to make that programming available to companies that compete with its multichannel program di stribution cable or satellite unit or making that programming available in discriminatory fashion at inferior terms conditions or rates but program access rules do not protect against the vertically integrated company making its must have programming available at very high rates that raise the costs to both its own satellite or cable system and also to all other satellite and cable systems these high rates are wash to the vertically integrated company the higher costs to its satellite or cable system are matched dollar for dollar by the higher revenues for its cable ne twork but the higher rates represent real costs for the competitive satellite or cable system this can raise rivals costs in an anticompetitive fashion47 equally important for consumer welf are program access requirements do not restrict vertically integrated cable networks with market power from raising rates to all cable and satellite systems thereby forcing them to raise rates to consumers to the extent consolidation strengthens firms market power and ability to raise prices program access rules do not protect against those higher rates but any harm to consumers will be ameliorated to the extent these higher rates generate revenues that are used by the integrated entities to produce more and more innovative programming retransmission consent the bulk of the complaints raised by small competitors against large vertically integrated video companies have been about the ab ility of the latter to tie the purchase of must have programming to the purchase of less desirable programming as discussed above one frequently cited mode for accomplishing this has been the practice of integrated companies with local broadcast stations and cable networks tying retransmission consent for the broadcast signal to carriage of an entire suite of cable networks it has been alleged that these tieins sometimes extend beyond carriage on the local cable system to requiring multisystem operators to carry the suite of cable networks on all their cable systems andor for time periods that extend far beyond the period covered by the retransmission consent such tie ins canhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32026crs22 48 for most consumers the local cable system is owned by one of the large multisystem operators msos and the packaging decision is made at the mso level not at the local levelresult in cable system operators providing programming their customers do not prefer or passing through high programming charges to customers the current law does not authorize the fcc to regulate the terms conditions and agreements of those retransmission consent agreements beyond imposing good faith negotiations standard and prohibition on providing any pipeline exclusive retransmission consent if congress chooses to restrict the ab ility of vertically integrated local broadcast television licensees from tying retransmission consent to carriage of nonbroadcast programming it would have to change current law carte most cable television networks especially those supported in part by advertising revenues are available to subscribers only as part of large packages of networks proposals have been put forward to requi re local cable systems to make cable networks available to subscribers on an carte basis that allows customers to choose and pay for individual cable networks these proposals have been controversial as discu ssed below there could be both benefits and harms to consumers if an car option were mandatory when large media companies with multiple cable networks require local cable system operators to purchase packages of their cable networks andor local cable system operators require subscribers to pur chase packages of cable networks without an option for the purchase of individual cable networks some purchasers will be forced to buy more programming than they want and perhaps at an outlay that is greater than they would make if llowed to purchase individual networks48 thus some purchasers are worse off when forced to purchase packages than they would be if they could purchase individual channels at both the senate commerce committ ee hearing on june 4 2003 and the senate judiciary committee hearing on june 18 2003 senators asked panelists their opinions about rule that would require large media companies that own multiple cable networks to make their networks available to local cable systems and satellite systems on an carte basis and that would require the local cable systems and satellite systems to make those cable networks available to consumers on an carte basis the large media companies and cal cable system operators could continue to offer packages of cable networks but would have to make the carte option available the purpose of such rule would be twofold to allow cable and satellite systems to carry the programming that th ey think their customers prefer without being forced to carry less preferred programming and to allow end user customers to choose the programming that they pr efer and not have to pay for other programming proponents of such rule ve expressed concern that absent such rule the large media companies could use their ma rket power from control over must havehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32026crs23 49 of course local cable system operators would select an carte option from the large media companies and subscribers would select an carte option from their local cable system operators only if the price of the carte option relative to the price of the enhanced basic service package option was favora ble for example if the per network carte price were 1000 per month and the price for an 80channel enhanced basic service package were 3500 then only those customers with very narrow video tastes that are satisfied by three networks woul d select the carte optionprogramming to force cable and satellite systems to ca rry less popular affiliated programming at the expense of both consumer preferences and independent programmers they also have expressed c oncern that absent such rule consumers especially low income consumers are forced to pay much higher prices for basic cable service because the basic service package includes highcost sports programming that they do not care to recei ve an carte requirement could restrict large media companies from imposing tiein arrangements on cable and satellite systems by not allowing the media companies to condition access to one cable network on the carriage of other cab networks and also might allow end users to select only the programming they prefer49 an carte rule also might constrain the rents that athletes performers and producers earn and that raise the costs and prices of such programming if substantial numbers of subscribers with low intensities of demand for the sports or entertainment programming choose carte options that do not include the high cost programming as described earlier sports programming is highly valued by small portion of cable subscribers but cu rrently such progra mming often is funded by imposing higher rates on all subscriber s to enhanced basic service if that programming had to be supporte d only by subscribers with high intensity of demand either those subscribers would have to pay more or the talent producing that programming would have to accept lower rents but an carte requirement also c ould have some effects that would harm consumers packaged service offerings make it less risky for cable or satellite system to introduce new cable network with package the new cable network does not sink or swim based on its immediate audience reception rather the system owner can allow the new cable network to acquire an audience by having viewers accidentally tune in to the network by contrast under car viewers must make the upfront decision to pay for new cable network perhaps wit hout having had the opportunity to see any of its programming in advance similarly with packaged offering the local cable system operator can efficiently market new networks by adve rtising the new networks on their existing networks this marketing strategy is less efficient if as in an carte environment many of the viewers receiving the marketing messages on the existing networks are not subscribed to the new network and ther efore cannot easily check out that network in response to the marketing message also the availability of large pack age of networks will increase overall audience size because at any particular time viewers who pay carte may not have any programming they choose to view on the channels they have paid for and therefore might turn off the television altogether but if they had access to the

media research national people meter sample aug 2026 2001 viewed on july 15 2003enhanced service package they might find programming they enjoy when surfing all the channels offered in the package as result of these lost efficiencies it is possible that the sum of the individual prices for each network that typical hous ehold subscribes to in an carte environment could be higher than the single price for basic package at the same time the choices available to consumers c ould be reduced both because they would only have available to them the networks they paid for and because there are likely to be fewer new networks because of the higher risk associated with an network launch when many subscribers make carte network purchases the extent to which these potentially harmful effects of an carte requirement will actually occur will depend on the proporti on of subscribers that choose the carte option vs the enhanced basic service p ackage if the carte option is chosen only by very small portion of subscribers with narrow video tastes that can be met by limited number of networks it may only create very weak disincentive for new network launches but if the carte option is widely selected the disincentive could be substantial some nielsen media research data presented by the television bureau of advertising50 indirectly shed light on this nielsen asked the question as the number of channels available to tv hous ehold increases as it has in recent years what is the effect on the number of channels actually viewed it found that after reaching the 50channel level additional channels produ ce significant increase in the number of viewed channels the viewin g remains in the 15 to 19channel range even the 121 channel group averages only 179 viewed channels out of an average of 195 available channels th data are only for single week of viewing it is possible that over longer period of time subscribers view far more channels but the data suggest that many subscribers do not seek the great diversity of networks provided by enhanced basic service offering s and if carte pricing were not set in way that made the package preferab even when subscribers only sought handful of networks there could be subs tantial migration to carte purchasing which could discourage new network launches programming requirements at the june 4 2003 senate commerce committee hearing in freewheeling discussion of how to ensure localism and diversity of voices one approach mentioned in passing was to return to the old requirement dating from the 1970s for each station to provide some minimum am ount of local programming perhaps more narrowly couched as local news and informational programming this approach has the advantage of ensuring certain level and diversity of such programming it addresses concerns about th many broadcast television stations that are longerhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32026crs25 51 this concern was raised during the senate commerce committee

local but are not51 it is not clear what the impact of such rule would have in the marketplace on one hand in large and middlesized mark ets local broadcast television news programming tends to be very profitable and will be offered with or without the rule on the other hand in small markets where local stations may not have the financial wherewithal to produce local news programming such requirement could drive stations out of business or could foster further consolidation with newspaper or with larger television group which could have the consequen ce of lessening the diversity of voices fairness doctrine some observers also have suggested that the fairness doctrine be reimposed that requirement which was repealed in the mid1980s52 required broadcasters to cover issues of
