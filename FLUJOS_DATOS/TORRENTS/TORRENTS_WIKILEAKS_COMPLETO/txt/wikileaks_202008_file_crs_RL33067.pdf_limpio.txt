ballistic missiles in its strategic offensive nuclear forces for more than 40 years in the past few years some have proposed that the united states deploy conventional warheads on these missiles this would provide the united states with the ability to strike promptly anywhere in the world regardless of the presence of overseas bases or nearby naval forces the air force and navy have both studied the poss ible deployment of conventional warheads on their longrange ballistic missiles the air force has been pursuing with darpa research into number of technologies that might enhance the us longrange strike capability it is developing hypersonic glide vehicle known as the common aero vehicle ca v that could carry conventional munitions on modified minuteman ii or peacekeeper missiles or it could deploy these missiles with more familiar conventional warheads this effort is now known as the conventional strike missile csm and could be deployed as midterm option for the prompt global strike mission the fy2007 defense budget requested 127 million to pursue the deployment of conventional warheads on trident missiles which might be deployed in 24 years but the 109 th congress rejected most of this request the fy2008 budget requested 1754 million but the 100th congress did not approve this funding either instead transferring 100 million to combined fund to conduct research into broad range of prompt global strike technologies the bush administration objected to this outcome noting that the 110 million in the account would not be sufficient to continue research into the proposed air force and navy programs many have expressed concerns about the possibility that other nations such as russia or china might misinterpret the launch of conventionallyarmed ballistic missile and conclude that they are under attack with nuclear weapons the air force has outlined number of measures that might reduce this risk it plans to base these missiles along the us coast far from bases with nucleararmed ballistic missiles it also would use consultations notifications and inspections to inform others of the difference between conventional and nuclear ballistic missiles but although these measures could address some of the concerns they are not likely to eliminate the risks of misunderstandings particularly if the united states used these missiles on short notice in crisis the navy would not segregate its conventional ssiles but would deploy them on submarines that also carry nuclear warheads but it could still notify russia or other nations to mitigate the possibility of misunderstandings longrange ballistic missiles can bring unique capabilities to the pgs mission but these missiles are only uniquely capable if the united states must attack promptly or within hours of the start of an unanticipated conflict in any other circumstance the united states is likely to have the time to move its forces into the region hence congress may review whether the benefits brought by these systems outweigh the risks of misunderstandings arising from their use this report will be updated as needed

began to deploy longrange ballistic missiles in the late 1950s and early 1960s these missileslandbased intercontinental ballistic missiles icbms and seabased submarine launched ballistic missiles slbmshave served as the backbone of the us strategic nuclear deterrent for more than 40 years they provided the united states with the ability to threaten targets throughout the soviet union and if necessary in other nations from the united states or from submarines patrolling at sea when the cold war ended in the early 1990s these missiles carried more than 8000 nuclear warheads the united states has reduced its strategic forces during the past 15 years but it still has approximately 4816 warheads deployed on 982 icbms and slbms 1 all the missiles still carry nuclear warheads in recent years analysts both inside and outside the government have suggested that the united states consider deploying conventional warheads on its longrange ballistic missiles the bush administration in the 2001 nuclear posture revi ew called for the integration of precision conventional weapons with strategic nuclear forces in new category of offensive strike weapons2 ballistic missiles armed with conventional warheads are one possible option for new type of precision conventional weapon in addition the pentagon identified new missionprompt global strike pgsthat would allow the united states to strike targets anywhere on earth in matter of hours without relying on forward based forces many analysts believe that longrange ballistic missiles armed with conventional warheads would also be an ideal weapon for this mission both the navy and air force have studied concepts and technologies that might allow the deployment of conventional warheads on longrange ballistic missiles the administration has requested funding for these initiatives for the past few years these requests have thus far received mixed reception in congress in fy2007 and fy2008 the administration requested funding for both the air force and the navy in fy2008 congress did not approve the requested funding for the separate services but combined th funding in new category that would explore wider range of options for the prompt global strike mission this funding100 millionfalls well short of total of the separate amounts requested by the administration as result congress and the bush administration are likely to continue to debate the alternative programs and to discuss the best way for the united states to proceed if at all with the deployment of conventional warheads on longrange ballistic missiles this report provides an overview of the administ rations rationale for the possible deployment of conventional warheads on longrange ballistic missiles it then reviews the air force and navy efforts to develop these systems it summarizes congressional reaction to these proposals then provides more detailed account of the issues raised by these concepts and programs 1 us department of state start aggregate numbers of strategic offensive arms fact sheet bureau of arms control october 1 2007 these numbers reflect the counting rules outlined in the 1991 start treaty and include the warheads that could be carried on the deactivated peacekeeper missiles hence it overstates the actual number of deployed forces by about 50 missiles and 500 warheads 2 us congress senate committee on

the bush administrations nuclear posture revi ew npr released in early january 2002 calls for the deployment of new triad of capabilities that would contribute to deterrence and us national security in the coming years3 during the cold war the united states deployed triad of forces comprised of the three types of delivery vehicles for strategic nuclear weaponslandbased intercontinental ballistic missiles icbms submarine launched ballistic missiles slbms and longrange bombers in the new triad these nucleararmed delivery vehicles would combine with precisionguided conventional weapons and become known as offensive strike forces 4 in the administrations view offensive strike weapons with conventional warheads could address some missions now assigned to longrange nuclear forces while some critics claim that this concept would blur the distinction between conventional and nuclear weapons and increase the likelihood of us use of nuclear weapons the administration has argued that the availability of precision conventional weapons would possibly pr ovide the president with more options in crisis and therefore reduce the likelihood of the use of nuclear weapons in testimony before the senate armed services committee in april 2005 general james cartwright then the commander of stra tcom noted that the new triad concept will enable more precisely tailored global strike operations 5 furthermore some have argued that by replacing some nuclear weapons with conventional weapons in the us strategic war plan6 the united states might be able to further reduce its number of deployed strategic nuclear weapons7 general cartwright and others have asserted that the substitution of conventional warheads for nuclear warheads in the us war plan would require significant improvements in the accuracy of us longrange ballistic missiles if missiles can deliver their payloads more precisely to their targets then for some categories of targets they may not need the explosive yield of nuclear weapon to destroy the target general cartwright has sought study that will allow him to determine what proportion of the targets in the us war plan could be attacked with conventional weapons an industry analyst has estimated that his proportion could be between10 and 30 of 3 us department of defense special briefing on the nuclear posture review news transcript january 9 2002 4 the other two legs of the new triad are missile defenses which the administration has stated will contribute to deterrence by complicating an adversarys attack planning and undermining his confidence and responsive infrastructure which would allow the united states to ma intain and if necessary expand its nuclear arsenal in response to emerging threats these three legs are joined together by command and control intelligence and planning capabilities which according to the administration will prov ide the united states the ability to identify targets and plan nuclear or conventional attacks on short notice in response to unexpected threats see us congress senate committee on armed services statement of the honorable douglas j feith under secretary of defense for policy february 14 2002 5 us

military bases overseas so that it could position its troops to deter and if necessary respond promptly to an attack from the soviet union or its allies these forward bases were located for the most part in europe and asiaregions where conflict seemed most likely to occur these overseas bases and forces were believed to not only increase preparedness but also deter conflict by their very presence in unstable regions however with the demise of the soviet union and the end of the cold war analysts argue that the united states must now be prepared to fight wider range of potential adversaries in unexpected areas who may possess great variety of military capabilities and although the united states continues to deploy its military forces at bases around the world it can longer be certain that these bases will be located close to the theater of operations if conflict occurs as result the united states not only plans to restructure and in some cases reduce its forces based overseas it has also sought to improve its ability to move military forces into region quickly when and if conflict occurs at the same time many analysts and military officials have argued that the united states must maintain and enhance its longrange strike capability so that it can strike anywhere in the world with forces that are based in or near the united states 9 or with forces that have the range to reach targets across the globe from wherever they are deployed this would not only allow the united states to pursue an adversary without relying on forward bases it would also allow the united states to reach targets deep inside an enemys territory further some argue that the united states must be able to attack targets across the globe in matter of hours or less either at the start of conflict or during ongoing operations this is because as some have argued us adversaries could to adapt to the us precisionstrike capability by withholding targeting information with concealment techniques or mobility leaving the unit ed states with little time to attack after it identified relevant targets finally many have noted that adversaries could seek to protect their assets by deploying them in buried or hardened facilities leading to requirement for improvements in the us ability to defeat hardened and deeply buried targets the need for prompt longrange or global strike capabilities has been addressed both in more general defense policy studies such as the 2001 quadrennial defense review qdr which noted that the us defense strategy rests on the assumption that us forces have the ability to project power worldwide and also in more specific service reports on air force doctrine which have noted that rapid power projection based in the continental united states has become the predominant military strategy in may 2003 the air force issued formal mission need statement for the prompt global strike pgs mission this document was written by air force 8 grossman elaine m us

office of the secretary of defense and validated by the joint requirements oversight council jroc this statement indicates that the united states needs to be able to strike globally and rapidly with joint conventional forces against highpayoff targets the united states should be able to plan and execute these attacks in matter of minutes or hours as opposed to the days or weeks needed for planning and execution with existing forces and it should be able to execute these attacks even when it had permanent military presence in the region where the conflict would occur 10 the 2006 quadrennial defense review also highlighted the growing need for global strike capabilities

which was in charge of plans and operations for us strategic nuclear weapons merged with us space command spacecom which commanded military space operations information operations computer network operations and space campaign planning 11 this merger gave the new stra tcom the ability to project power around the globe through space and information warfare further in late 2002 and early 2003 the pentagon restructured the new stratcom so that it could take on new missions including the planning and execution of the prompt global strike mission12 this change in the command structure highlights growing emphasis on longrange strategic missions in conventional warfighting doctrine admiral james ellis the first commander of the new stra tcom stated that the new mission extends our longstanding and globallyfocused deterrent capabilities to the broader spectrum of conflict he further indicated that the incorporation of conventional nonkinetic13 and special operations capabilities into fullspectrum contingency arsenal will enable the command to deliberately and adaptively plan for and deliver rapid limitedduration extended range combat power anywhere in the world emphasis added this will provide wider range of options to the president in responding to timecritical global challenges he also stated that stra tcoms capabilities would provide the nation an immediate ability to engage select set of targets by moving rapidly from actionable intelligence through adaptive planning to national level decisionmaking and the delivery of effects across thousands of miles14 he stated that datagathering decisionmaking and execution must occur in minutes to support the pgs mission standard that is not yet possible with existing technology general james cartwright the second commander of

necessarily be nuclear and regional combatant commander could tailor it for his target and deliver it very quickly with very short time lines on the planning and delivery any place on the face of the earth general cartwright also emphasized that the global strike capability involved much more than just the delivery of weapon to target stating that it encompasses both the ability to plan rapidly to apply the precision to the intelligence and gather that intelligence in very rapid manner and then to apply that intelligence to the target and understand the effect we want to create 15 the us military is seeking to acquire the capabilities needed to meet this standard the intelligence requirements for the pgs mission are often overlooked and may prove to be so demanding as to affect the likelihood for success as general michael hayden the cia director noted in mid2007 the pgs mission will require very convincing intelligence before any attacks occur 16 he further stated that if you are going to strike suddenly it has to be based on very powerful very convincing intelligence furthe r the intelligence may need to be released to the public to demonstrate both the military need and time restraints that made the attack necessary

united states might need to strike several categories of targets promptly throughout the spectrum of conflict for example if an adversar deployed air defense or antisatellite weapons that could disrupt the us ability to sustain an attack the united states might choose to strike promptly at the start of conflict with weapons that could penetrate and destroy the defenses prompt strike against an adversarys ballistic ssiles or caches of weapons of mass destruction wmd might allow the united states to destroy these weapons early before an adversary could use them some targets could also appear quickly and remain vulnerable for short periods of time during conflict these might include leadership cells that could move during conflict or mobile military systems that the adversary had chosen to keep hidden prior too their use the united states might use number of different weapons systems in the near term in the pgs mission 17 these could include medium or longrange aircraft cruise missiles launched from bombers or submarines and ballistic missiles based at sea or on land in the united states18 but conventional aircraft even if they are based near the theater of operations could take several hours or more to reach their targets aircraft may also be vulnerable to enemy air defenses particularly if they tried to attack targets deep inside enemy territory similarly aircraft or

strike critical targets in timely manner officials in the air force at the pentagon and at stratcom along with some analysts outside government believe that the united states could achieve the prompt global strike mission with its longrange ballistic missiles icbms and slbms19 the pentagons defense science board dsb in study published in early 2004 asserted that landbased longrange ballistic missiles have unique timecritical characteristics that include responsiveness range speed precision lethality and freedom of maneuver 20 with these capabilities they could attack targets anywhere in the world within an hour of their launch without relying on forward bases or supporting military capabilities such as the tanker aircraft needed to support longrange flights by bombers they would not be at risk from air defenses and ther would be risk to flight crews further if the warheads could maneuver to slow their reentry and increase their angle of attack they might be effective against some types of hardened and deeply buried targets the dsb study asserted that these weapons could provide reliable lowcost force on continuous alert with high readiness rate and the capability to immediately react under strict control of the national command authority in other words the high levels of reliability readiness and command and control that were needed as part of the us strategic nuclear deterrent during the cold war are also valuable characteristics for longrange conventional strike system in the postcold war era however because us longrange ballistic missiles have always carried nuclear warheads potential adversaries might misunderstand us intentions if the united states employed ballistic missiles armed with conventional warheads possibly deciding if and when they detect launch that they are under nuclear attack from the united states accordingly the air force has sought to develop concept of operations for conventional ballistic missiles discussed later that addresses these concerns in an effort to mitigate the risks g18g149g138g151g156g561g138g151g141g561g18g155g152g144g155g138g150g156g561 both the navy and the air force have studied the possible deployment of conventional warheads on their longrange ballistic missiles in the past the air force briefly studied the penetration capabilities of conventional icbms in the mid1990s in august 1995 it launched an icbm armed with pointy front end and explosive warhead against granite slab that had characteristics similar to reinforced concrete press reports indicate that the warhead entered the target at 90 degree angle and penetrated to depth of 30 feet which is greater than the depth of penetration of any existing us weapon 21 the navy also sponsored studies in the 1990s that sought to develop nonnuclear penetrating warhead for the trident slbm these studies also focused on questions about whether reentry vehicle from ballistic missile could penetrate hardened target using only its speed and angle of reentry without nuclear explosion both the 19 see for example us department of defense of fice of the under secretary of defense for acquisition technology and logistics report of

reentry vehicle from ballistic missile would have to be far more accurate than those deployed in the 1990s and still deployed today to attack and destroy buried target g16g138g159g162g561g18g155g152g144g155g138g150g156g561 in fy2003 the navy requested funding for research on new type of reentry vehicle that could significantly improve the accuracy of the trident ii d5 missiles this program known as the enhanced effectiveness e2 initiative included an initial funding request of 30 million three year study and fullscale flight test in early 2007 22 congress rejected the initial funding request in fy2003 and fy2004 but lockheed martin corporation the contractor pursuing the study continued with low level of research into this system the e2 reentry vehicle would integrate the existing inertial measurement unit imu guidance system the system currently used to guide longrange ballistic missiles with global positioning system gps technologies so that the reentry vehicle could receive guidance updates during its flight23 standard mk4 reentry vehicle which is the reentry vehicle deployed on many trident slbms would be modified with flapbased steering system allowing it to maneuver when approaching its target to improve its accuracy and increase its angle of penetration this steering system which the navy has referred to as backpack extension would increase the size of the reentry vehicle making it comparable in size to the mk5 reentry vehicle that is also deployed on trident missiles the e2 warhead could possibly provide trident missiles with the accuracy to strike within 10 meters of their intended stationary targets this accuracy would not only improve the lethality of the nuclear warheads but it would also permit the missiles to destroy some types of targets with conventional warheads 24 lockheed martin has flown two reentry vehicles in test flights of trident missiles25 in test conducted in 2002 it demonstrated that the new reentry vehicle could steer towards target and strike with improved accuracy in test conducted in early 2005 modified version of its reentry vehicle demonstrated that it could not only stee r towards target with improved accuracy but also slow down and control the impact conditions capabilities that would be needed for the delivery of some types of conventional warheads to their targets lockheed estimated that if the program received funding from congress beginni ng in fy2006 its reentry vehicle could enter production in fy2010 and achieve an initial operational capability in 2011 the navy however did not seek funding for this program in fy2004 2005 or 2006 22 norris robert s and hans m kristensen us nuclear forces 2005 bulletin of the atomic scientists januaryfebruary 2005 pp 7375 23 according to the defense science board task force on future strategic strike forces the imu would guide the missile in its early phases but the reentry body would r eceive gps update during its exoatmospheric flight it would then use the imu and control flaps to steer the warhead with gpslike accuracy during atmospheric reentry see us department of defense report of the defense science board

deploy conventional warheads on trident submarinelaunched ballistic missiles and has been included in the navys budget request for fy2007 and fy2008 the navy began to speak publicly about its plans for the conventional trident modification ctm in early march 2006 in anticipation of congressional testimony by general cartwright the budget prepared for in fy2007 included total of 503 million over five years with 127 million for fy2007 225 million for fy2008 118 million for fy2009 and 33 million for fy2010 26 as is noted below congress denied the funding request in fy2007 the pentagon has again sought fu nding for the program requesting total of 1754 million for fy2008 but congress did not approve the specific funding again instead as is noted in more detail below it provided research and development funding for more general category of prompt global strike initiatives the budget request for fy2008 indicated that most of the work needed to design and develop the reentry vehicle for the conventional trident would be completed in fy2008 with an additional 20 million request planned for fy200927 the fy2008 funding would support among other things efforts to finalize the guidance and flap system on the maneuvering body extension of the reentry body design an interface between the new guidance system and the missile system flight controls begin development of conventional payload that could fit within the reentry body and initiate efforts to modify existing facilities so that they can test the ctm designs if it had received the requested funding in fy2008 and proceeded with the expected work plan the navy could have conducted system developm ent and demonstration activities in fy2008 and fy2009 and could have planned to begin production and deployment in fy2010 with this timeline the system would reach its full operational capability by the end of 2012 the navy is now likely to adjust this schedule however in response to congressional action for fy2008 such adjustments may be evident in the budget submission for fy2009 which is likely to be released in february 2008 press reports indicate that the ctm concept would plan for the navy to deploy each of its 12 trident submarines on patrol 2 would be in overha ul at any given time with 2 missiles equipped to carry 4 conventional warheads each the remaining 22 missiles on each submarine would continue to carry nuclear warheads and the submarines would continue to patrol in areas that would allow them to reach targets specified in the nuclear war plan although the patrol areas could be adjusted to accommodate targeting requirements for the ctm only four submarines would be within range of their targets with two in the pacific ocean and two in the atlantic ocean consequently only eight conventional missiles would be available for use at any time and only one or two of the submarines would likely be within range of the targets specified for attack with conventional ballistic missiles 28 the navy has considered two types of warheads for the ctm program in the nearterm one warhead would be designed to destroy or disable soft area targets using reentry vehicle loaded with tungsten rodsknown as flechettestha t would rain down on the target and destroy 26 grossman elaine pentagon wants early start on conventional missiles for subs insidedefensecom january 20 2006 see also

able to destroy hardened targets if it were accurate enough to strike very close to the target each would be deployed within the reentry body developed and tested under the e2 program the navy is also exploring for possible future deployment technologies that might be able to penetrate to destroy hardened buried targets if congress approved the program and the fundin g these warheads would provide the navy with the ability to contribute to the prompt global strike mission in the near term goal that was identified in the 2006 qdr the report indicated that the navy would seek to deploy an initial capability to deliver precisionguided conventional warheads using longrange trident missiles within two years29 although many expect it to take four years to field the full complement of 96 warheads the capability even when fully deployed would be limited by the small number of available warheads hence it seems likely that the pentagon would only plan to use these missiles in limited circumstances to meet specific goals g3g146g155g561g8g152g155g140g142g561g18g155g152g144g155g138g150g156g561 the air force is pursuing two initiatives related to the deployment of conventional warheads on longrange ballistic missiles the first of these is known as the conventional strike missile csm or conventional ballistic missile cbm and would serve as midterm followon to the conventional trident modification ctm program30 it would draw on existing missile technologies and reentry technologies developed under the falcon force application and launch from conus continental united states program joint air forcedarpa demonstration that is developing among other things both nearterm and farterm capabilities for the prompt global strike missions31 the second is an air force analysis of alternatives aoa study which began in 2006 that is reviewing technologies and programs that could meet the requirements of the prompt global strike mission although led by the air force reports indicate that the navy and air force are collaborating on the study personnel reportedly have been exchanging information on servicespecific platforms and are thinking broadly across service lines to consider range of alternative platforms for the longterm pgs option 32 for its midterm option the csm concept the air force has outlined notional architecture and concept of operations unlike the trident plan which would deploy nuclear and conventional warheads on the same submarines the air force plan would segregate the missiles armed with conventional warheads and deploy them far from bases with nuclear warheads the missiles could be deployed on mobile launchers or in semiburied silos or berms on each coast ready to launch on short notice33 the two potential bases include vandenberg air force base on the west coast and cape canaveral on the east coast 29 us department of defense quadrennial defense review report february 6 2006 p 50 30 grossman elaine m conventional

although it could build new missile in the future the air force has indicated that it could modify both minuteman ii missiles and peacekeeper mx missiles to carry conventional warheads in the near term the minuteman ii missile was first deployed in 1965 and was retired in the early 1990s the air force deployed 450 of these missiles each carried single nuclear warhead and had range of over 7000 miles the air force has already modified some of these missiles using five as target vehicles in tests of missile defense technologies and few in spacelaunch configuration the peacekeeper missile was first deployed in 1986 the air force began to deactivate these missiles in october 2002 and is to complete the process by the end of fy2005 the air force deployed 50 of these missiles each carried 10 warheads and had range greater than 6000 miles the air force has designated these modified missiles as the minotaur ii and minotaur iii missiles it has stated that the modifications can be made at relatively low cost and low level of technical risk they would use the missiles existing rocket motors the avionics and guidance systems could rely primarily on existing technologies with some modifications to allow the upper stages of the missiles and their reentry vehicles to maneuver for improved accuracy the air force has noted that it could deploy its ballistic missiles with conventional warheads as midterm solution between 2013 and 2015 for the pgs mission the air force has indicated that this option using modified peacekeeper missile would be able to carry much larger payloads than the trident missile 34 g25g138g155g145g142g138g141g561g17g153g157g146g152g151g156g561 the modified minuteman ii missiles might each be able to carry single warhead that weighed between 500 and 1000 pounds modified peacekeeper could possibly carry between 6000 and 8000 pounds of payload which would allow for multiple warheads or reentry vehicles 35 according to some estimates these missiles could even destroy some targets without an explosive warhead using the sheer force of impact of reentry vehicle moving at 14000 feet per second36 they could also carry single conventional warhead with reentry body that had been modified to improve accuracy by allowing for the maneuverability of the warhead like the maneuvering warhead the navy has considered for the trident modification reports indicate that the air force is also considering deploying some of these missiles with specialized warheads that could be designed to destroy selected categories of targets one of the leading options for reentry package and central focus of the falcon study noted above is the proposed common aero vehicle ca v 37 the ca v would be an unpowered maneuverable hypersonic glide vehicle capable of carrying approximately 1000 pounds in munitions or other payload according to the air force these payloads might include fuzed penetrator warhead that would hit its targets with impact speeds of approximately 4000 feet per second with this high impact speed the ca v should be able to attack and destroy some types of hardened or buried targets the ca v could also carry several small smart bombs to destroy 34 sirak michael air force envisions midterm prompt global strike missile defense daily july 7 2006 35 report of the defense science board task force on future strategic

able to travel at 5 times the speed of sound mach 5 so that it can deliver substantial payload from the continental united st ates to anywhere in on earth in less than two hours38 the study has identified number of objectives for the ca v system in addition to the possible range of munitions loadings that would allow it to achieve these goals for example to meet the prompt needs of the mission the ca v and its delivery vehicle should achieve alert status which would make it ready to launch in under 24 hours further it should then be able to launch from this alert status in less than 2 hours once it has received an execution order it should then be able to reach its target within one hour of its launch 39 these characteristics would provide it with the capabilities needed to attack timesensitive targets40 to meet the global portion of the pgs mission the ca v should not only have the range to strike throughout the depth of an adversarys territory it should also have crossrange capability of 3000 nautical miles the cross range measures the ability of the ca v to maneuver and vary from standard ballistic trajectory after its release from its launch vehicle this ability to maneuver would allow the ca v to adjust to new information so that it could attack mobile targets if timely and accurate information became available and were communicated to the ca v during its flight further it would provide the ca v with high degree of accuracy allowing it to deliver its weapons within planned 3 meters of the intended target the ca v would also have to be linked to complete timely intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance information consequently the ability of missile armed with ca v or one armed with single conventional warhead to deliver its weapons to targets across the globe within hours of decision to launch an attack presumes several interrelated capabilities the united states would need the intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance isr capability th at would allow it to identify target precisely and quickly it would also need the command and control capability to review the targets plan the attack target the ca v vehicles and order the launch within short amount of time finally it would need the continuing reconnaissance capability to verify that the intended target remained available and that the ca v reached and destroyed that target the requirements would exist for both landbased and seabased missiles 38 darpa falcon force application and launch from conus technology demonstration program fact sheet november 2003 see also

as was noted above the navy requested 30 million for its e2 program in fy2003 and fy2004 in each case this was to be the initial year of funding in threeyear study congress refused the navys request in both years the navy has not requested additional funds for research and development on conventional warheads for slbms in subsequent years the bush administration requested 122 million in research and development funding for the ca v program in fy2004 the house in its ve rsion of hr 1588 the fy2004 national defense authorization bill nearly doubled the authorized funding to 242 million the senate provided the requested amount and the conference committee split the difference authorizing 17025 million although congress supported the administrations request for funding the house had shown concerns about the possibility that us launches of ballistic missiles armed with conventional warheads could be misinterpreted as nonconventional launches by nations who might monitor us military activity concern particularly to russia and china hence the house required that the air force submit report on the concept of operations for the ca v that would address questions about the potential for misinterpretation of the launches this reporting requirement remained in the final version of the national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2004 pl 108136 the national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2004 pl 108136 sec 1032 also contains requirement for an annual report scribing an integrated plan for developing deploying and sustaining prompt global strike capability congress mandated that the plan should include information on among other things the types of targets for longrange strike assets the capabilities desired for these assets an assessment of the command and control intelligence and surveillance capabilities necessary to support the pgs mission integration with tactical missions and cost and schedule for achieving the mission in the conference report hrpt108354 congress noted that its interest in these issues derived from the nuclear posture review and its focus on integrating nuclear and conventional strike capabilities to reduce reliance on nuclear weapons it indicated that it saw need for further analysis of future system requirements along with comprehensive effort to link planning and programs in pgs roadmap to achieve coherent force structure hence although the air force considers the npr objective of integrating nuclear and conventional strike forces as separate mission and separate concept from pgs congress initially at least blended both into the request for new report the air force submitted its report on the ca v concept of operations to congress in february 2004 this report offered several suggestions for measures the united states could take to reduce the possibility of misinterpretation if the united states were to deploy and employ ballistic missiles with conventional warheads many

the fy2005 defense appropriations act hr 4613 pl 108287 congre ss repeated its concerns about the potential for misinterpretation in the report on the defense appropriations bill congress questioned whether there were safeguards in place to guarantee that other nuclear weapons states did not misinterpret the intent or use of ballistic missiles armed with ca v in response to these concerns the report states that funds provided for ca v could only be used for nonweapons related research on hypersonic technologies including studies into microsatellites or other satellite launch requirements congress specified that the funds could not be used to develop integrate or test ca v variant that includes any nuclear or conventional weapons congress also indicated that the funds could not be used to develop integrate or test ca v for launch on any icbm or slbm congress would consider expanding the scope of this program in future years if safeguards negotiated among international partners were put into place 41 g8g27g344g342g342g348g561g138g151g141g561g8g27g344g342g342g349g561 the bush administration requested 272 million for ca v in fy2006 in response to the restrictions in the fy2005 defense appropriations act it restructured the program and redesignated the ca v as the hypersonic techno logy vehicle this new program excludes any development of weapons capabilities for the ca v congress approved the requested funding in the fy2006 defense appropriations act and di d not impose any new restrictions the bush administration requested and congress appropriated an additional 334 million for ca v in its fy2007 budget congress also appropriated 12 million for the air force to conventional ballistic missile cbm program which is exploring the possible use of modified minuteman missile as midterm option for the pgs mission the budget projections in the fy2006 budget request demonstrate how costs could increase if the air force continues to pursue the ca v program the budget requests were projected to be between 31 and 39 million each year for the next three years but they were then projected to rise to 92 million in fy2010 and 94 million in fy2011 this sharp increase reflects an expected change in the program from research and development to production and deployment at the end of the decade this change would require that the air force address and resolve congressional concerns about the potential for misunderstandings with the launch of ballistic missiles armed with conventional warheads but it also indicates that the ca v would not provide nearterm solution to the pgs mission needs as might the navys ctm program as was noted above the navys fy2007 budget included 127 million for the conventional trident modification the request separated into three categories the budget included 38 million for the ctm within the much larger 9576m budget for trident ii missile modifications 12 million for strategic missile systems equipment to support the

of th report it authorized the use of 20 million for the preparation of the report and 32 million for research and development on technologies that would support the trident modification it specified that the money could not be used on the ctm program itself the full senate accepted the committees position the house armed services committee eliminated the 38 million for ctm in the trident ii

conference committee in its report hrept 109702 sec 219 adopted the reporting requirements included in the senate bill but instead of fencing the funding pending completion of the report accepted the houses reduction in ctm funding therefore as was the case in the house bill the conference report includes only 30 million for research and development into an advanced strike capability that would support the ctm concept the house and senate appropriations bills also rejected the administrations request for funding for the ctm program following the hasc the defense appropriations subcommittee in the house eliminated all but 30 million in research and development funding it also raised questions about the feasibility of the proposed schedule for the program and questioned whether the decision to move forward immediately woul d prejudge the outcome of the pgs aoa study in the senate the defense appropriations subcommittee eliminated all funding for the ctm program and provided 5 million for the national academy of sciences to analyze the mission requirement and recommend alternatives the conference report on the defense appropriations act hrept 109676 retained the senate

was set at 100 million for fy2008 less than half of the requested funding for all the programs that were combined in the new account the pentagon has objected to this transfer noting that the elimination of the specific line items and the overall reduction in funding would lead to the termination of the falcon program and the cancellation of several planned flight test for the ca v

trident ii missiles to carry conventional warheads congress had denied all funding for this purpose in fy2007 it also included 13 million in strategic systems missile equipment which would be used to begin modifying trident submarines to carry the conventional missile congress had also denied this funding in fy2007 finally the budget included 1264 million to develop advanced strike capabilities under the hard and deeply buried target defeat system program area this funding is allocated to continue research and development into reentry vehicle technologies for the conventional trident

authorization bill hr 1585 hrept 110146 supported continued research development testing and evaluation of the conventional trident concept but prevented funds from being obligated or expended for the operational deployment of the system specifically it approved the request for 1264 million for continued research and development on the reentry vehicle and authorized 16 million for procurement but reduced the budget request by 33 million withholding all funds for longlead procurement the strategic forces subcommittee noted that it supported in general the pursuit of technologies for the prompt global strike mission but also noted that questions remained about the concept of operations and the possibility for misunderstandings hence it sought to slow the program until the national academy of sciences completed its report the senate armed services committee in its version of the fy2008 defense authorization bill s 1457 srept 11077 recommended that funding be provided specifically for the

potential options for the pgs mission and that research funded through this program element could support in coordinated fashion technologies that could be common to several of these concepts the committee also indicated that it believed any resulting pgs capability should be clearly and unambiguously nonnuclear the conference committee adopted the senates approach to combining the funding in single account but as the appropriations committee had done limited the funding to 100 million hrept 110477 the conference report also re quired that the under secretary of defense for acquisition

programs congress has focused primarily on questions about the potential that misunderstandings might arise if the united states were to launch longrange missiles during crises or conflicts stepping back from the specific programs however congress has also reviewed the rationales offered by the npr and pgs mission to determine whether the threats and capabilities faced by the united states justify the pursuit of these programs it has also begun to question whether other military programs and capabilities can satisfy the emerging requirements without raising many of the questions about the potential for misunderstandings associated with the deployment of conventional warheads on ballistic missiles further congress could review the air force proposals for addressing the issues raised by the deployment of ca v or other conventional warheads on icbms and the more recent proposals to meet the pgs mission need with the nearterm deployment of conventional warheads on trident missiles

improvements in accuracy conventional warheads could substitute for nuclear warheads in attacking some sites now targeted by nuclear weapons the bush administration and some analysts have argued that this would provide the president with wider range of options during crisis and therefore reduce the likelihood that he would have to use nuclear weapon some have questioned however whether the president needs more options or flexibility nuclear weapons have always been reserved for the most extreme circumstances serving particularly as deterrent against nuclear attack from other nations with nuclear weapons in less extreme circumstances the president has never lacked for conventional options they say as is evidenced by the fact that the united states has not used nuclear weapons since 1945 many analysts have also argued that the bush administrations formula for integrating conventional and nuclear capabilities into an offensive strike force could actually increase the likelihood of nuclear war by blurring the distinction between nuclear and conventional weapons this new capability could allow the president to respond with conventional strikes against some types of targets but it is not clear that the adversary would know that the incoming weapons carried conventional warheads it is also not clea r that the united states would be able to control the adversarys reaction or the escalation of the conflict particularly if the adversary possessed nuclear weapons hence by making the start of the war easier the deployment of conventional warheads on ballistic missiles might in this view actually make the eventual use of nuclear weapons more likely g18g9g21g561 the pgs missions requirements are based on the assumption that future conflict would take place far from existing us bases overseas and possibly far from ocean areas where the us has deployed most of its seabased forces they also assume that future conflict could develop quickly allowing too little time for the united states to move its forces into the region either by acquiring basing rights on land or by moving seabased forces closer to the theater of conflict further the concern about hidden or relocatable targets reflects an assumption that targets could appear with little notice and remain vulnerable for short period of time factors that place premium on the ability to launch quickly and arrive on target quickly the requirements also assume that us forces are likely to face an antiaccess threat or air defense capabilities that would impede operations by us aircraft many of these characteristics were present in afghanistan in 2001 when the united states attacked qaeda training camps and the taliban government after the september 11 terrorist attacks the attacks on the united states came without warning and although the united states took several weeks to plan its response and acquire the needed intelligence information on target areas speed was of the essence if the united states hoped to trap and destroy leaders at the training camps in afghanistan the united states had military bases in the region and had to take the time to acquire basing rights in nearby nations and to move us naval forces into the region further the mountainous terrain offered the enemy areas deep within the country where it could conceal its leadership and hope to evade attack

longrange attacks support the view that the united states should deploy longrange ballistic missiles with conventional warheads for the pgs mission in this view other weapons systems cannot address all the characteristics at the same time bombers may be too slow to arrive and too vulnerable to air defense systems seabased or airlaunched cruise missiles may also be too slow too arrive and of too short range to reach remote targets and seabased systems with the exception of longrange ballistic missiles may also be too far away to reach high priority targets promptly at the sudden start of conflict however the presence of many of these characteristics in one recent conflict does not necessarily mean that they will all be present in most or even many future conflicts while each is certainly possible taken together these characteristics describe worstcase scenario that may occur rarely or not at all in its entirety this observation highlights several questions that congress could consider when reviewing the rationale for the pgs mission how likely is it that the united states would face sudden unanticipated conflict with time to build up its forces in the region and with the requirement to strike some targets within hours of the start of the conflict would delay of several hours or even days undermine the value of attacking these targets at the start of conflict could other weapons systems provide the united states with the ability to loiter near the theater of operations allowing prompt attack during the conflict if hidden or concealed targets are revealed 43 comparison of the likelihood of those scenarios that may provide the most stressing environments with the likelihood of less stressful scenarios may lead to the conclusion that other weapons systems

possess many of the operational strengths associated with nucleararmed ballistic missiles they would have extremely high rates of readiness and reliability allowing military planners to expect more than 90 of the missiles to be available for use at any given time they could to respond promptly after decision to launch and they have high degree of accuracy allowing for attacks across wide range of targets consequently these systems would free the us military from reliance on forward basing and enable it to react promptly and decisively to destabilizing or threatening actions by hostile

potential circumstances cited in requirements for the pgs mission but the resemblance to nucleararmed ballistic missiles would also raise questions and create concerns if the united states were to launch them during conflict nations with minimal launch notification systems such as china or degraded launch notification systems such as russia could conclude that they were under attack with nuclear missiles46 further because many possible targets lie south of russia and china and the united states has historically planned to launch its ballistic missiles over the north pole conventionallyarmed longrange ballistic missile would likely fly over these to nations to strike its targets for many minutes during their flight patterns these missiles might appear to be headed towards targets in these nations the potential for misunderstanding is compounded by the short time of flight of these missiles giving these nations little time to evaluate the event assess the threat and respond with their own forces there is precedent for the united states to deploy some types of delivery vehicles with both nuclear and conventional warheads for example us longrange bombers have always been able to carry conventional weapons and all three of the current types of nuclearcapable bombersb1 b2 and b52have delivered conventional weapons during recent conflicts in addition the conventional cruise missiles carried by the b52 bomber were initially deployed as nuclear airlaunched cruise missiles and were later during the early 1990s converted to carry conventional weapons unlike ballistic missiles however bombers can change their course and return to base if necessary further the tomahawk sealaunched cruise missiles slcms have always been deployed in both nuclear and conventional versions the united states has often launched the conventional slcms during conflicts and has never experienced misunderstandings about whether these missiles carried nuclear or conventional warheads 47 but these have never flown over russia in pursuit of their targets longrange ballistic missiles with conventional warheads could be viewed with far more concern than these other dualcapable systems because they were developed and deployed solely as part of the us strategic nuclear deterrent force even if the united states were to convince other nations that we had deployed some of these missiles with conventional warheads they could still question whether the missiles launched during conflict carried conventional warheads or whether the united states had converted them back to carry nuclear warheads the launch of landbased longrange ballistic missiles armed with conventional warheads could present another type of problem for the united states and canada if these missiles were launched from existing icbm bases in the northern and central united states they could drop their rocket motor stages over populated areas of the united states or canada this may have been considered small price to pay during global nuclear war with the soviet union but it may be far less acceptable within civilian populations under less trying and catastrophic circumstances 45 ibid 46 for description of ongoing problems with russias early warning system for ballistic missile attack see mosher david et beyond the nuclear shadow phased approach for improving nuclear safety and usrussian relations rand corporation 2003 p 5 47 on the other hand the soviet union and russia have sought to contain us cruise missile capabilities by suggesting arms control limits on nuclear slcms that could also capture slcms armed with conventional warheads soviet and russian analysts have viewed these weapons as threatening to soviet nuclear facilities regardless of their warhead because of their high accuracy and relatively short time of flight httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33067g5g152g151g159g142g151g157g146g152g151g138g149g561g25

retired minuteman and peacekeeper missiles as the minotaur ii and mino taur iii missiles if it deploys them with the conventional warheads or the proposed ca v system this would allow the united states to differentiate between the conventional and nucleararmed versions of its ballistic missiles in its operational plans and possibly help provide other nations with means to distinguish between the two the air force has also identified concept of operation for the minotaur missiles that includes number of mitigating measures that might ease concerns about the potential for misunderstandings and damage arising from their launch these factors fall into three general categories basing measures cooperative measures and operational measures g4g138g156g146g151g144g561g15g142g138g156g158g155g142g156g561 the air force has stated that it would deploy ballistic missiles armed with ca vs or other conventional warheads for pgs mission at bases far from missiles armed with nuclear warheads and far from bases with storage facilities for nuclear warheads 48 the two potential sites include vandenberg air force base in california and cape canaveral in florida according to the air force the new coastal basing sites would have nuclear capability or association49 as they would lack the facilities and equipment needed to handle or store nuclear weapons the coastal basing plan would also address concerns about debris from missile launches falling on populated areas in the united states or canada if the missiles were launched from the us coast rather than from bases in northern central states then the debris would likely fall over the oceans rather than over land the air force has also stated that it could deploy minotaur missiles on mobile launchers horizontally in earthen berms or above ground rather than in the hardened vertical silos used at nuclear icbm bases the united states could then declare to russia or other nations that these new modified launchers were equipped with conventionalonly delivery vehicles this declaration would further demonstrate that the missiles at the two coastal bases were different from nuclear icbms even though it would not preclude the possible covert deployment of nuclear warheads on the missiles 50 further their deployment with ca v reentry vehicle rather than standard postboost vehicle and warh ead present on nucleararmed missile would reinforce this designation51 g5g152g152g153g142g155g138g157g146g159g142g561g15g142g138g156g158g155g142g156g561 the air force has proposed that the united states institute number of cooperative measures with other nations to add confidence to the us declaration that the minotaur missiles deployed at coastal bases would carry conventional warheads these measures could include militarytomilitary contacts high level political consultations and ongoing discussions to keep russia and other nations informed about us plans for th missiles

missiles the air force has referred to this process as strategic dialogue that might over time answer questions and ease concerns about the plans for and capabilities of longrange ballistic missiles armed with conventional warheads52 the united states could also invite other nations to observe test launches of these missiles or to participate in exercises that include simulations with these missiles this might allow nations such as russia to become familiar with the operational procedures associated with ballistic missiles armed with conventional warheads and to distinguish between these procedures and those associated with nucleararmed missiles further the united states could allow russia to conduct shortnotice inspections at the minotaur bases similar to or even more intrusive than the inspections permitted at nuclear missile bases under the start treaty to confirm the absence of nuclear weapons either on the missiles or in the storage facilities 53 over time these measures would not only provide information about the missiles and their missions but might also build confidence and understanding between the parties the increased level of cooperation and possibly decreased level of suspicion might then reduce the likelihood of misinterpretation if the united states were to launch ballistic missiles with conventional warheads the united states could also provide russia wi th prior notification of planned launches of ballistic missiles with conventional warheads or the two nations could set up dedicated hot line for use after launch so the united states could inform russia of the launch and assure it that the missile did not carry nuclear warhead and was not headed for targets in russia further as has been discussed on many occasions over the years the united states and russia could share earlywarning data at joint facility so that russia would have the information it needed to distinguish between the launch of nucleararmed ballistic missile from northern base and the launch of conventionalarmed ballistic missile from coastal base

that it could alter the trajectory of ballistic missiles armed with conventional warheads so that they would not resemble the trajectories that would be followed by nucleararmed ballistic missiles on course for targets in russia or china 54 as was noted above ca v is have the capability to travel 3000 miles downrange and 3000 miles crossrange after release from its ballistic missile delivery system hence according to the air force the missile could travel on shaped trajectory or if launched from the east coast towards the middle east southern trajectory so that it would not fly over russia or china and make up for the added distance by using the flight range of the ca v the missile could also launch with depressed trajectory then use the aerodynamic lift of the ca v to achieve the range it would need to reach around the globe without flying over russia taken together these three types of measures might help reduce the risks of misunderstandings but the accumulation of information during peacetime and frequent communications during crises may not be sufficient address problems that could come up in an atmosphere of confusion and incomplete information during conflict specifically the argument in favor of using long 52 ibid p 7 53 report to congress on the concept of operations for the common aero vehicle submitted in response to congressional reporting

united states might have little warning before the start conflict and might need to launch its missiles promptly at that time this scenario would allow little time for the united states to consult with or even inform other nations about its intentions if other nations are caught by surprise and fear they might be under nuclear attack they might also decide to respond promptly before the united states had the opportunity to convince them that the missiles carried conventional warheads further routine data exchanges and onsite inspections can provide confidence in the absence of nuclear warheads on the missiles on daytoday basis in peacetime but they cannot provide assurances that the warheads could not be changed in relatively short period of time or that the warheads were not actually changed in the days or weeks since the last inspection in addition changing the basing patterns or launch patterns of missiles to draw sharper distinction between conventional and nucleararmed missiles assumes both that other nations can observe the differences and that they believe the different appearances indicate different warheads finally these measures would do nothing to alleviate concerns among nations that did not participate in the cooperative programs as result while the measures described above can reduce the possibility of misunderstandings they probably cannot eliminate them g21g158g139g150g138g155g146g151g142g556g14g138g158g151g140g145g142g141g561g4g138g149g149g146g156g157g146g140g561g15g146g156g156g146g149g142g156g561 as was noted above dod hopes to deploy conventional warheads on trident longrange ballistic missiles in the next 24 years although they would be based at sea these missiles would share many characteristics of landbased ballistic missiles that make them suited to the pgs mission as nuclear delivery vehicles they have been deployed with the command and control systems needed to allow for prompt decision making and prompt launch during crisis they have the range to reach targets around the world and they would have the accuracy particularly if the reentry vehicles can receive gps updates to attack wide range of targets on short notice congress has offered modest support for this effort in the past providing an additional 10 million in the fy2005 defense appropriations act for advanced conventional strike capability assessment and as was noted above the navy requested 127 million for this effort in the fy2007 budget with funding to total 503 million in the next six years but congress rejected this funding request providing only 30 million for research on the reentry vehicle it has requested 1624 million in fy2008 slbms armed with conventional warheads coul d raise many of the same questions about misunderstandings as landbased ballistic missiles particularly if these warheads are deployed on the same submarines that currently carry nuclear warheads the navy could not employ many of the techniques identified by the air force to convince potential adversaries that the missiles carried conventional warheads even if the united states did deploy slbms with conventional warheads on submarines that did not carry nuclear warheads it would be extremely difficult to demonstrate these differences and assure other nations of the segregated deployments in submarine that is intended to be hidden and invulnerable when at sea further according to some reports russias ability to monitor us slbm launches is even more degraded than its ability to monitor icbm launches so it might conclude that it is under nuclear attack if it observed an slbm launch from us ballistic missile submarine on the other hand because the submarines are mobile and the missiles are longrange the united states could alter the patrol areas for trident submarines so that if they were to launch their conventional missiles they could use trajectories that did not require them to fly over these nations on their way to their intended targets alternatively the submarines could move prior to httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33067g5g152g151g159g142g151g157g146g152g151g138g149g561g25

this presumes that the united states had the time to move its submarines to these new launch points prior to the start of the conflict possibility that is inconsistent with the pgs missions assumption that the united states could need to launch its missiles promptly at the start of an unexpected conflict the plan to deploy trident missiles with conventional warheads on the same submarines as missiles with nuclear warheads could also raise questions about the command and control of those missiles at the present time submarine commanders can not launch their missiles until they receive authorization from the national command authority essentially the president it is unclear whether the missiles with conventional warh eads would be subject to the same stringent command and control processes or whether someone within the military chain of command would be able to authorize their use without presidential approval

suited to the pgs mission because they could take hours or days to reach targets in remote areas and they would require tanker support to refuel during their missions the long flight time could contribute to crew fatigue and air defenses could deny the bombers access to some critical target areas conventional cruise missiles delivered by b52 bombers would allow the aircraft to stay out of the range of some airdefense systems but they could still take too long to reach their targets meet the objectives of the pgs mission on the other hand the long time of flight could give the united

the navy has the capability to attack targets at ranges of around 1500 nautical miles with seabased cruise missiles these tomahawk missiles have been employed often in the conflicts in the past 15 years providing the united states with the ability to reach targets without risking aircraft or their crews the navy is currently modifying four of its trident ballistic missile submarines so that they can carry cruise missiles these submarines are to be equipped to carry up to 7 tomahawk missiles each in up to 22 out of 24 of their trident launch tubes for total of 154 cruise missiles per submarine but these missiles may be limited in their ability to contribute to the pgs mission with maximum speed of about 550 miles per hour and range of 1500 nautical miles they can take 23 hours to reach their targets further their reach is limited even if the ships or submarines carrying the missiles are deployed in the region of the conflict consequently the navy has also explored alternatives

the navy is also studying the possible development and deployment of an intermediaterange missile that could be launched from its ballistic missile submarines it requested industry participation in the study in mid2003 and plans to conduct two static testfirings of prototype rocket engine in 200556 according to the defense science board task force this missile might deliver 2000 pound payload over 1500 mile range57 with an accuracy of less than 5 meters this would allow the missile to reach its target in less than 15 minutes58 reports indicate that this proposed missile could carry either nuclear or conventional warheads allowing it to contribute to the missions requiring prompt longrange strike capabilities59 these missiles could also be deployed on the modified trident submarines with two or three missiles each in up to 22 of the submarines launch tubes for total of 66 missiles per submarine the proposed submarinelaunched intermediate range ballistic missile would achieve many of the objectives necessary for the pgs mission it could attack targets quickly both at the start of conflict if the submarines were within range and during the conflict if new targets emerged its speed and angle of attack might also make it capable of attacking some types of hardened or buried targets it would also be able to penetrat an adversarys defenses without putting aircraft or crews at risk further by launching from submarines based close to the theater of conflict these missiles might avoid some of the overflight problems that would occur if ballistic missile launched from the continental united states it would not eliminate all possibilities of misunderstanding however because nations observing the launch might not be able to tell whether the missiles carried nuclear or conventional warheads and with the short timeofflight they might decide to assume the worst congress earmarked 10 million for the slirbm in fy2005 and 72 million in fy2006 in the house the defense

ballistic missiles at bases outside the continental united states for example it might be deployed in guam diego garcia or alaska this system would use twost age rocket motor with payload of up to 1000 pounds flight time to target of less than 25 minutes and an accuracy of less than 5 meters it could employ many of the same reentry vehi cle and warhead options as the ctm and csm systems because it would rely on existing rocket technologies it might be available for deployment by 2012 in roughly the same time frame as the csm system however because it would be launched from outside the continental united states its trajectory would not resemble that of landbased icbm hence some analysts argue that it would solve many of the questions about misunderstandings and misperceptions that plague the ctm and csm systems the defense subcommittee of the house appropriations committee included 4 million for this effort in the fy2007 defense appropriations bill but the conference committee reduced this amount to 18 million g3g155g150g156g561g5g152g151g157g155g152g149g561g11g156g156g158g142g156g561 g3g146g155g561g8g152g155g140g142g561g18g149g138g151g156g561 the air force has acknowledged that depending on system design longrange ballistic missiles armed with conventional warheads could be covered by the provisions in the 1991 start treaty 61 this assessment however assumes that the start treaty remains in force when the missiles are deployed start expires at the end of 2009 and at this time it seems possible that the bulk of the treaty will lapse even though the united states and russia may retain some of the monitoring and verification provisions start limits the united states to total of 4900 attributed warheads on its landbased and seabased longrange ballistic missiles icbms and slbms the number of warheads attributed to each type of missile is outlined in memorandum of understanding that accompanies the treaty the minuteman ii missile which would serve as the base for the minotaur ii missile is counted as carrying one warhead the peacekeepe r which could become the minotaur iii missile is counted as carrying 10 warheads the treaty specifies that all icbm launchers and submarine launch tubes that can hold ballistic missiles covered by the treaty will count against the treaty limits this would presumably include launchers for minotaur missiles however

it is unlikely that the united states would exceed the start limit of 4900 warheads this is because the united states plans to reduce its warheads to between 1700 and 2200 operationally deployed warheads as it is required to do under the 2002 moscow treaty between the united states and russia these deeper reductions warheads on nucleararmed ballistic missiles will mean that the united states has the room to deploy missiles with conventional warheads without exceeding start limits the united states would not have to count missiles with conventional warheads against the limits in the 2003 moscow treaty if it excludes these systems from its definition of operationally deployed warheads 62 the start treaty could nonetheless impinge on the air force plan to deploy ballistic missiles with conventional warheads at coastal bases the treaty indicates that new types of icbms or modified versions of existing icbms must be deployed at icbm bases in railmobile road mobile or silo launchers 63 the united states could declare vandenberg to be new icbm base but it would have to build new silos or use mobile launchers for the missiles the treaty does allow the parties to locate softsite launchers for icbms at test ranges or space launch facilities which would include vandenberg and cape canaveral64 but the treaty states that the parties cannot flight test icbms equipped with reentry vehicles from spacelaunch facilities which would seem to preclude deployment at cape canaveral65 the treaty further limits the aggregate number of icbms and slbms located at test faci lities which would include vandenberg to 25 and the aggregate number of test launchers to 2066 the united states has already declared that it has 15 test launchers at vandenberg leaving little room for the deployment of additional launchers for ballistic missiles armed with conventional warheads the start treaty also allows onsite inspections at bases housing delivery vehicles limited by the treaty notifications prior to the launch of missiles limited by the treaty and the provision of telemetry generated during test flights of missiles limited by the treaty these provisions could all apply to the new minotaur missiles even if they are deployed with conventional warheads far from bases that house nuclear warheads or nuclear delivery vehicles these provisions particularly those calling for prior notification of missile launches could help the united states inform russia or other nations of its intentions when it decides to use minotaur missile in conflict on the other hand these provisions could also complicate us efforts to launch these missiles promptly at the start of sudden unexpected conflict the united states could claim that because the minotaur missiles were deployed with conventional warheads they should not count under start or be subject to the deployment restrictions and data exchange provisions in the treaty however it is likely that the united states would have to meet with russia ukraine belarus and kazakhstan the four former soviet states that are parties to the treaty to work out how the provisions of the treaty are to apply to these missiles regardless the relationship between these missiles and us arms control obligations 62 the moscow treaty does not define operationally deployed warheads each nation can do so on its own and declare which systems it will count under the limit of 2200 operationally deployed warheads 63 treaty between the united states of america and the union of soviet socialist republics on the reduction and

apply or avoid these obligations for the new minotaur missiles deserves further analysis g16g138g159g162g561g18g149g138g151g156g561 the navy has not yet addressed publicly arms control questions that might arise from the deployment of conventional warheads on its trident missiles many of the issues discussed above for the air force stem from the plan to segregate missiles with conventional warheads from those with nuclear warheads and to have those with conventional warheads recognized as different missiles because the navy would deploy the missiles with conventional and nuclear warheads on the same submarines the navy would not have similar concerns it would in all likelihood simply accept that the conventional warheads on trident missiles count under the start treaty the warheads would count against the treaty limit of 4900 ballistic missile warheads and the missiles carrying the warheads would be subject to shortnotice inspections to confirm that they did not carry more than the agreed number of 8 warheads or 6 warheads if the missiles were declared to be downloaded because the dod plan appears to call for the missiles to be deployed with only 4 warheads each and beca use the navy would be under obligation to display the exact configuration of the missiles but only to demonstrate that they carried fewer than 8 warheads these requirements apparently would not impinge on the ctm program the moscow treaty provisions also probably would not constrain the ctm program that treaty limits the united states to 2200 operationally deployed nuclear warheads it does not define this term and it does not outline any counting rules that the nations must use when determining which warheads count under the limits the united states likely would not count the warheads on the ctm missiles under the limits and it would be under obligation to reveal this to russia it would simply have to inform russia of the total number of warheads it was counting under the treaty further the united states could deploy more warheads on its icbms or on other slbms to make up for the 96 conventional warheads on the conventional trident missiles an arithmetic method multiplying deployed missiles by the number of warheads carried by those missiles like the one used in start treaty might then put the united states over the 2200 warhead limit but the moscow treaty does not use such method to count deployed warheads russia may object to the ctm plan on arms control grounds insisting that the warheads on the conventional trident missiles should count against the treaty limits and that the united states should have to reduce the number of warheads on other systems to accommodate these missiles however this view is not consistent with the provisions or requirements of the moscow treaty consequently even if the missiles raised issues for bilateral discussions about arms control implementation it is unlikely that the united states would have to alter its plans to accommodate the moscow treaty g25g142g146g144g145g146g151g144g561g157g145g142g561g4g142g151g142g143g146g157g156g561g138g151g141g561g20g146g156g148g156g561 the air force and many analysts outside govern ment have argued that longrange landbased ballistic missiles armed with conventional warheads can provide lowcost nearterm solution to the meet the demands of the prompt global strike

these characteristics are invaluable for longrange conventional strike system in the postcold war era but these weapons might provide the united states with more capability than it needs under most circumstances while at the same time raising the possibility that their use might be misinterpreted as the launch of nuclear weapons for example as would be true for any weapon seeking to achieve this mission the ability to attack targets across the globe on short notice depends on the us ability to acquire precise information about the locations of potential targets and to translate that information into useful targ eting data if it takes longer for the united states to acquire and use that information than it would take for it to launch and deliver ballistic missile or as has often been the case if such precise information is unavailable then the united states may not be able to benefit from the unique characteristics of longrange ballistic missiles bombers would take longer to reach their targets but this added time might provide the united states with the opportunity to acquire the needed intelligence recent report by the government accountability office gao identified this partic ular problem noting that many of the ongoing studies into global strike and prompt global strike have not addressed the need for critical enabling capabilities along with the weapons systems that would be used in the attacks 67 in addition longrange ballistic missiles would have an advantage over seabased systems if the united states did not have naval forces near the conflict region or did not have time to move these forces to the area or if the target area were out of range for the seabased systems but the us navy deploys its force around the world and maintains capabilities near likely areas of conflict few targets may be out of range for these weapons but bombers armed with cruise missiles might be able to reach them landbased longrange ballistic missiles would only be needed in the rare circumstance where the united states had warning needed prompt attack and had to reach too far inland for seabased systems but even in these circumstances the benefits of the use of longrange ballistic missiles might not outweigh the risks most analysts recognized during the cold war that longrange landbased ballistic missiles could prove destabilizing in crisis when nations might have incomplete information about the nature of an attack and too little time to gather more information and plan an appropriate response faced with these circumstances nation who was not an intended target such as russia might choose to respond quickly rather than to wait for more information the same could be true for the adversaries who are the intended targets of us ballistic missiles if the united states hoped to destroy nations military forces or weapons of mass destruction at the start of conflict before they could be used against us troops the other nation might choose to use these weapons even more quickly during crisis before it lost them to the us attack some have argued that the possible crisis instabilities associated with longrange ballistic missiles should not eliminate them from consideration for the pgs mission because the united states can work with russia china and other nations to reduce the risks and because other weapons at least in the short term provide the united states with the ability to attack promptly anywhere on the globe at the start of an unexpected conflict yet the question of whether the united states should accept the risks associated with the potential for misunderstandings and crisis instabilities can be viewed with broader perspective how likely is the united states to face the need to 67 us government accountability office military transformation dod needs to strengthen implementation of its global strike concept and provide comprehensive invest ment approach for acquiring needed capabilities gao

conflict how much would the united states lose if it had to wait few hours or days to move its forces into the region or to await the intelligence reports and precise targeting data needed for an attack if the risks of waiting for bombers or seabased weapons to arrive in the theater are high then longrange ballistic missiles may be the preferred response even with the risk that other nations might misunderstand us intentions on the other hand if the risks of waiting for other forces to arrive in theater are deemed to be manageable and the risks of potential misunderstandings and crisis instabilities associated with the launch of longrange ballistic missiles are thought to be high then the united states can consider broader range of alternative weapons systems to meet the needs of
