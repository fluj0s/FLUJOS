domestic social policy division medicaid disproportionate share payments summary the medicaid statute requires that states make disproportionate share dsh adjustments to the payment rates of hospitals treating large numbers of lowincome and medicaid patients this provision is intended to recognize the disadvantaged situation of those hospitals although the requirement was established in 1981 dsh payments did not become significant part of the program until after 1989 when they grew from just under 1 billion to almost 17 billion by 1992 during that time states medicaid budgets were facing number of upward pressures while states were learning about financing techniques that made it easier to collect increased dsh payments from the federal government in 1991 congress intervened to control the growth of dsh payments by limiting the amounts available to each state and setting national limits the law was successful the rapid growth in dsh payments had been halted in 2005 the most recent year for which data were available total reported dsh payments were 17 billion1 today states dsh payments cannot exceed an allotment amount calculated based on statutory formula for that state states must define in their state medicaid plan hospitals qualifying as dsh hospitals and dsh payment formulas dsh hospitals must include at least all hospitals meeting minimum criteria and may not include hospitals that have medicaid utilization rate below 1 the dsh payment formula also must meet minimum criteria and dsh payments for any specific hospital cannot exceed hospitalspecific cap based on the unreimbursed costs of providing hospital services to medicaid and uninsured patients dsh payments for mental hospitals cannot exceed an aggregate cap based on percentage of such payments in 1995 however within these broad guidelines states also have great deal of discretion in designating dsh hospitals and calculating adjustments for them for this reason congress has required states to report the methods used to identify and pay dsh hospitals and the payments made to each of the identified hospitals annual state reporting however is not yet being routinely collected by the centers on medicare and medicaid services cms congress has intervened number of times to change various features of the dsh allotments sometimes to reduce payments below the levels provided for in the 1991 legislation and other times to provide additional allotment funds statutory changes are described in more detail below 1 2005 cms 64 data net reports contents background the medicaid program 1

assistance for specified groups of lowincome persons who are aged blind disabled or members of families with children within federal guidelines each state designs and administers its own program thus there is substantial variation among the states in terms of persons covered types of benefits provided and payment rates for covered services the federal government shares in the cost of medicaid services through variable matching formula after state pays for medicaidcovered service it makes claim for the federal share of the payment and is reimbursed at the federal matching rate for that state the federal matching rate known as the federal medical assistance percentage fmap is inversely related to states per capita income and may range from 50 to 83 in fy2007 11 states and all of the territories received the minimum of 50 federal matching on medicaid payments mississippi had the highest fmap in fy2007 75892 the federal share of most state administrative expenditures is 50 in all states higher matching is allowed for certain administrative activities overall the federal share of medicaid spending was approximately 57 in fy20053 when medicaid was enacted in 1965 it was targeted to persons receiving cash welfare aid to families with dependent children afdc or supplemental security income ssi for the aged blind and disabled over time the program has moved away from its explicit link to the cash assistance programs especially for lowincome families it now covers many pregnant women and children with ties to the welfare system it pays medicares costsharing and premiums for certain low income medicare beneficiaries and it is the major source of funding for nursing facilities nfs and other longterm care needed by the elderly and other disabled populations who are not literally poor in june of 2005 states reported covering total of 425 million people in medicaid at combined federal and state annual cost of almost 316 billion4 as 2 department of health and

share hospital dsh adjustment was established by congress in 1981 the dsh provision was included in package of provisions referred to as the boren amendment after its sponsor david boren who was democratic senator from oklahoma prior to 1981 state medicaid programs were required to follow medicare reimbursement principles in paying for inpatient hospital services medicare utilized reasonable cost system for paying for hospital services at that time as result every state used reasonable cost system to pay for medicaid services the boren amendment was intended to give states greater flexibility to use other payment methods and at the same time provide protections for hospitals specifically hospitals with large caseloads of lowincome and uninsured patients the protections included requirement that states make assurances to the secretary that payment rates were reasonable and adequate and that states take into account the situation of hospitals which serve disproportionate number of low income patients with special needs by raising payment rates dsh adjustments for those hospitals the requirement to make dsh adjustments implicitly recognized the disadvantaged situation of hospitals which treated large numbers of medicaid and other lowincome patients and which had to depend on the relatively low payment rates of most medicaid programs at the time in the years between 1986 and 1991 however dsh payments grew dramatically prompting congress to establish ceilings on each states dsh payments on the amounts that individual hospitals can receive and to establish other rules regarding dsh payments table 2 total federal and state medicaid disproportionate share payments and percentage change 19902005 by fiscal year in billions of dollars total medicaid dsh percentage

tabulations of percentage growth today the federal share of dsh payments are limited to levels that are calculated based on formula the formulabased ceilings referred to as dsh allotments are calculated by the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms and promulgated in the federal register state allotments state dsh allotments are the maximum amount of federal matching payments that each state is permitted to claim for dsh payments dsh allotments have both state and national limitations that are specified in title xix section 1923 of the social security act total dsh payments across all 50 states may be more than 12 of the total amount of medicaid medical assistance spending during the fiscal year as result of this rule cms must publish preliminary dsh allotments before the start of the fiscal year that are based on estimated total medicaid outlays only after the end of the fiscal year when actual expenditure data are available are final dsh allotments published statebystate dsh allotments were specified in statute for 19982002 after that each states dsh allotment was calculated based on the prior years amount and subjected to set of rules defining minimum and maximum amounts all of these rules have been modified number of times in subsequent legislation current laws and allotment amounts are discussed in this section for more complete information on legislative activity related to dsh see section below entitled legislative history each states allotment can be more than the greater of the prior years amount or 12 of total medical assistance payments for the prior year this ensures that states with dsh allotments above 12 of total medical assistance spending referred to as high dsh states receive allotments that do not grow until the dsh allotments are below 12 of medical assistance spending in each state this rule is vestige of the original dsh allotments established in 1991 which were set based on historical dsh spending the states that had been paying the largest dsh payments relative to other medicaid payments received higher allotments but those amounts did not increase over time states making the smallest historical payments received allotments that were to increase each year until they reached the 12 cap in general to arrive at each states dsh allotment for the years after 2002 the prior years amount is multiplied by an inflation factor which is estimated using the crs5 growth of the consumer price index for all urban consumers cpiu for the previous year special rules however have been enacted affecting the rates of growth applicable for different states and for different years special allotments for 2004 and rates of growth for calculating dsh allotments for all states for the years immediately subsequent to 2004 were enacted as part of the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of 2003 mma pl 108173 for years after 2004 if state would have had lower allotment by using the premma 2004 amounts then their allotment for that year will be equal to the 2004 mma amount otherwise the allotment is equal to the prior years amount increased by the cpiu states with low dsh allotments are subject to special rules for fy2003 through 2008 those states with dsh spending below 3 of medical assistance payments in fy2000 receive an allotment for each of years 2003 through 2008 equal to 16 more than the prior years amount after fy2008 allotments will increase based on the inflation rate of the cpiu as for all other states certain states have special statutory arrangements relating to their state allotments the district of columbia was allotted additional funds for fy2000 fy2002 raising its base for calculating subsequent dsh allotments other states with such adjustments in their dsh allotments for fy2000fy2002 have included minnesota new mexico and wyoming cms calculates annual allotments and publishes them in periodic notices in the federal register the last publication of dsh allotments was in federal register v 71 on october 3 2006 p 58400 this notice included final allotments for fy2004 and fy2005 and preliminary amounts for fy2006 and fy2007 the federal share of dsh allotments under current law are reflected in table 3 dsh allotments are different from dsh payments in that allotments reflect the maximum amount of federal share that are available for dsh payments

designating dsh hospitals and calculating dsh adjustments for designated hospitals states must provide dsh adjustments to at least those hospitals meeting certain minimum criteria most states expand on the minimum criteria to allow additional hospitals to be designated as dsh because of the flexibility there is great amount of variation across the states in the number and types of hospitals that are designated as dsh at minimum states must include all hospitals with 1 medicaid inpatient utilization rate in excess of one standard deviation above the mean rate for the state crs8 or 2 lowincome utilization rate of 256 to be included as dsh hospital the hospital must retain at least two obstetricians with staff privileges willing to serve medicaid patients7 hospital cannot be identified as dsh hospital if its medicaid utilization rate is below 18 minimum and maximum dsh payments to hospitals even more flexibility is available in terms of the formulas and methods states use to distribute dsh funds among hospitals the statute provides only the principles by which states should distribute the funds and sets minimum and maximum payment amounts but does not address the amount of funds the states pay to individual dsh hospitals from their capped allotment states must make minimum payments to dsh hospitals using either the medicare methodology or formula providing payments that increase as the hospitals medicaid inpatient utilization rate increases over the states average if state uses its own formula it may vary payments to different types of hospitals as long as all hospitals of each type are treated equally and adjustments are reasonably related to the hospitals medicaid or lowincome patient volume and the minimum payment requirement is met since obra 93 dsh payments to individual hospitals are subject to cap these hospitalspecific limits in general prohibit hospitals from receiving dsh payments that exceed the unreimbursed costs incurred of furnishing hospitals services to individuals who are eligible for medicaid and those who have health insurance for services providing during the period the hospitalspecific cap was phasedin for certain public hospitals and became effective for private hospitals in 1995 this cap when fully phased in may have been the force behind the large drop in total dsh payments in fy1996 there are however exceptions to this rule the hospital specific cap for certain public hospitals in california is equal to 175 of those unreimbursed costs for two state fiscal years beginning in 2003 all public hospitals were subject to hospitalspecific cap of 175 after those two years the ceiling reverted back to 100 disproportionate share payments today current law with respect to medicaid dsh adjustments can be summarized as follows 6 the standard deviation is statistical measure of the dispersion of hospitals utilization rates around the average the use of this measure identifies hospitals whose medicaid utilization is unusually high the lowincome utilization rate is the sum of two fractions medicaid payments plus state and local subsidies divided by total patient care revenues and inpatient charges attributable to charity care other than charity care subsidized by state or local government divided by total inpatient charges 7 there are exceptions to this rule for childrens hospitals hospitals that do not offer non emergency obstetric services and certain rural hospitals 8 the medicaid utilization rate is defined as the number of days of care furnished to medicaid beneficiaries during given period divided by the total number of days of care provided during the period crs9 states must pay dsh adjustments to hospitals serving disproportionate share of medicaid patients and patients with special needs states must define which hospitals qualify as dsh hospitals and provide for an adjustment in the payment rate for those hospitals in the states medicaid plan states have flexibility in establishing the designation of dsh hospitals but must include in their definition at least all hospitals meeting minimum criteria medicaid inpatient utilization rate in excess of one standard deviation above the mean rate for the state or b lowincome utilization rate of 25 states may not include hospitals with medicaid utilization rate that is below 1 states have flexibility in calculating dsh payment amounts to hospitals but must pay dsh hospitals at least 1 an amount calculated using the medicare dsh payment methodology or 2 an amount calculated using payment methodology that increases each hospitals adjustment as the hospitals medicaid inpatient utilization rate exceeds the statewide average dsh hospital payments cannot exceed the hospitalspecific cap set at 100 of the costs of providing inpatient and outpatient services to medicaid and uninsured patients less payments received from medicaid and uninsured patients for public hospitals for all states except california which is at 175 of those amounts states cannot obtain federal matching payments for dsh that exceed the states dsh allotment dsh payments when aggregated across all states cannot exceed 12 of total medicaid benefits payments in 2005 according to preliminary state reports dsh hospital adjustments totaled more than 17 billion the federal share of those payments was about 96 billion and represented 56 of total medicaid payments for benefits significant drop from the 1992 high of about 1539 regular medicaid payments for inpatient hospital services were about 42 billion10 the 2005 dsh hospital adjustments to inpatient hospitals totaled about 41 of regular medicaid payments for inpatient hospital services this percentage varied considerably among the states from zero dsh payments to inpatient general hospitals to several times more than regular hospital payments there were two states in 2005 in which dsh payments to regular inpatient hospitals exceeded regular payments for inpatient hospital services as reported to cms 9 prospective payment assessment commission propac p 12 10 this figure does not include payments made to hospitals under managed care arrangements where monthly capitation payments are made to the managed care organization for set of services including inpatient hospital services crs10 dsh payments are highly concentrated in few states five states new york california

dsh payments in excess of 12 of total medicaid payments this is down from the high in 1993 when 21 states were considered high dsh states legislative history the history of congressional action on dsh payments remains relevant today because dsh amendments are included in almost all major health bills ceilings and special rules are routinely moved about or debated further the financing arrangements that congress has repeatedly tried to address with dsh amendments continues to vex the administration and congress as evidenced by recent regulations limiting certain financing arrangements11 this section describes why and how dsh law was changed and shaped over time the requirement to make dsh payments was originally established in 1981 but by the late eighties members of congress became aware that many states were not making those payments several congressional actions followed including 1986 provision aimed at supporting state flexibility to make dsh payments and 1987 provisions requiring states to submit medicaid plan amendment describing their dsh policies and establishing certain minimum standards and payments12 omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1986 obra 86 pl 99509 obra 86 included provision clarifying that the health care financing administration now cms had authority to limit payments adjustments to dsh hospitals omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1987 obra 87 pl 100203 specifically congress required that each state describe the criteria used to designate hospitals as dsh hospitals and define the formulas used to calculate the increase in the payment rate the dsh adjustment for inpatient services provided by these hospitals obra 87 included minimum criteria for defining hospital as dsh hospital and minimum criteria for calculating dsh adjustments for purposes of designating hospitals as dsh obra 87 required that at least those hospitals with 11 see crs congressional distribution memorandum proposed medicaid regulation to establish cost limit for

hospitals obra 87 required states medicaid plans specify the increase in payment to be made to dsh hospitals and gave states two options for determining dsh payment amounts states were allowed to make minimum payments to dsh hospitals using either the medicare methodology13 or formula providing payments that increase as the hospitals medicaid inpatient utilization rate increases over the states average under the second option states formula could vary payments to different types of hospitals as long as all hospitals of each type were treated equally and adjustments were reasonably related to the hospitals medicaid or lowincome patient volume again upper payments limits were established following the passage of obra 87 and until 1990 total payments for dsh adjustments remained relatively low until combination of events occurred that resulted in rise in dsh adjustments from just under 1 billion in fy1990 to 174 billion two fiscal years later14 in the late 1980s states were experiencing number of upward pressures on their medicaid budgets general health care inflation was rising at unprecedented high rates national health spending estimated by the centers for medicare and medicaid

tax base from which states could fund increasing program costs in response to these pressures states turned to funds donated by health care providers or taxes paid by those providers to leverage federal matching payments these factors combined led to an enrollment increase of more than 24 or 6 million new people on the medicaid rolls between 1990 and 1992 and incited states to identify funding mechanisms to increase the flow of federal funds into their states 13 to qualify for medicare dsh hospital must have share of lowincome patients that equals or exceeds 15 the low income share is determined by summing the number of medicare inpatient days provided to ssi recipients divided by total medicare patient days and b the number of inpatient days provided to medicaid beneficiaries divided by total inpatient days payment adjustments are specified by statute as percentage increase to the hospital payment rate depending upon the hospitals size urbanrural location and status as

spread among the states to leverage additional federal medicaid funds the three approaches were collecting donations collecting providerspecific taxes and transferring funds from different levels of governments or governmental entities to the state government the funds collected through one or more of the three mechanisms were aggregated at the statelevel and used for the state share of medicaid spending often paying back the very providers who gave the state the money in the first place the medicaid spending at that time was usually claimed as dsh payments and would be matched with federal medicaid matching funds all or part of the additional federal money generated through these mechanisms would be returned to the states at the time few were aware of the potential for misuse and for escalating federal medicaid spending except for the health care financing administration hcfa now cms in 1988 hcfa indicated that it planned to issue regulations limiting the use of donations as the states share of medicaid the agency also provided instructions to state medicaid programs that attempted to distinguish between taxes of general applicability that would be allowable as state share of medicaid and providerspecific taxes for which federal matching medicaid payments would not be allowable the technical and miscellaneous revenue act of 1988 tamra pl 100647 before hcfa could issue final regulations defining its position congress intervened tamra included provision prohibiting the secretary from issuing final rules that would change the treatment of voluntary contributions or provider specific taxes before may 1 1989 the prohibition was twice extended by congress first in the omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1989 obra 89 pl 101239 through the end of 1990 and then later the omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1990 obra 90 pl 101508 extended it through the end of 1991 for voluntary contributions only obra 90 prohibited altogether regulation of providerspecific taxes although the law was not clear16 after obra 90 was enacted states use of donations and taxes continued to rise by july of 1991 the inspector general of hhs had issued three reports on the rise in the use of provider donations and taxes characterizing the programs as an uncontrollable virus and egregious17 the inspector general asserted that the 16 obra 90 included two provisions addressing provider specific taxes that were interpreted as conflicting the first provision stated that nothing in this title shall be construed as authorizing the secretary to deny or limit payments to state for expenditures attributable to taxes whether or not of general applicability imposed with respect to the provisions of such health care items or services second provision excluded providerspecific taxes from the cost base of provider for purposes of computing medicaid reimbursement to the provider congress focused on the first provision while the administration focused on the second fueling debate 17 us dept of health and human services memoranda dated july 25 1991 may 10 1991 october 11 1990 prepared by richard kusserow inspector general washington continued crs15 schemes were used by states to reduce the effective state share of the program forcing the federal government to pay more for medicaid dsh adjustments rose coinciding with the use of providerspecific taxes and donations dsh had become the most popular mechanism for returning targeted taxes or donations back to the hospitals since dsh adjustments were uncapped and did not need to be tied to particular beneficiaries or services some providers shared in the proceeds that states generated by the federal matching payments on the donation and tax programs states returned dsh payments to those donors in excess of their contribution or increased their payment rates18 medicaid voluntary contribution and providerspecific tax amendments of 1991 pl 102234 after intense negotiations between the white house the governors and the congress the medicaid voluntary contribution and providerspecific tax amendments of 1991 pl 102234 was passed in november of that year the law established the first upper bounds on dsh payments and prohibited the use of donated funds and health care related taxes that were not broadbased for the purpose of claiming federal matching payments it established cap on the portion of the state share of medicaid spending that could be raised through providerspecific taxes and established aggregate national and state limits on dsh payments the national limit on dsh adjustments was set at 12 of medicaid costs in any year and beginning in 1993 state dsh adjustments would be limited to published amounts above which federal matching payments would not be available under the law each state would be eligible to receive the dsh adjustment amount published in the federal register for that year and more than that amount the published amount for each fiscal year would be based on 1992 payments states with 1992 dsh adjustments exceeding 12 of their 1992 medicaid costs would continue to receive allotments at their 1992 level until those payments became 12 of total medicaid spending in that state these states were classified as high dsh states states with 1992 dsh payments below 12 could receive allotments increasing their dsh adjustments subject to formula up to limit of 12 the medicaid voluntary contribution and providerspecific tax amendments specifically protected intergovernmental transfers while restricting the use of the other two funding mechanisms the law prohibited the secretary of hhs from limiting the use as the nonfederal share of medicaid of funds derived from state or local taxes or funds transferred by units of government within the state despite the remaining intergovernmental transfer loophole the upper caps on dsh payments had significant impact on total dsh spending the rapid climb 17 continued hereafter cited as inspector general memorandum 18 inspector general memorandum data july 25 1991 crs16 in dsh payments had been stopped19 concerns then turned to the distribution of those payments among hospitals there were anecdotal reports that some hospitals were receiving large dsh payments even though they had few medicaid patients and that other hospitals were receiving dsh payments so large that the amount of their dsh payments exceeded the amount of uncompensated care provided by the hospital omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1993 pl 10366 in response to these concerns congress included in obra 1993 number of provisions intended to better target dsh hospital payments the policies in obra 1993 were different from earlier laws limiting dsh payments in that the earlier laws sought only to cap total dsh payments flowing to the states obra 1993 however set limits on the amounts of dsh payments that individual hospitals would be allowed to receive and limited states flexibility to designate hospitals as dsh hospitals it prohibited designation of hospital as dsh hospital for purposes of medicaid reimbursement unless the hospital has medicaid inpatient utilization rate of at least 120 it also limited dsh adjustments to more than the costs of providing inpatient and outpatient services to medicaid and uninsured patients less payments received from medicaid and uninsured patients the hospitalspecific dsh cap was phasedin for certain public hospitals and later became effective for private hospitals after obra93 was passed dsh payments to hospitals continued to be focus of congressional attention despite the laws success in stopping their rapid growth this was because dsh payments were both large and little information existed on what precisely those payments accomplished as result dsh again became the target of congressional budget cutters balanced budget act of 1997 bba 97 pl 10533 provisions were included in bba 97 to reduce dsh spending and to address other issues affecting dsh the formulabased dsh allotments set into law in 1991 were replaced with fixed dsh allotments for states for 1998 through 2002 the federal share of dsh payments were set at 103 billion in 1998 approximately 18 billion if matched by states at the 57 federal43 state matching rate and were to decline to 85 billion by 2002 approximately 15 billion if matched by state at the 5743 rate 19 more recently however intergovernmental transfers have increasingly been used to raise the federal share of medicaid instead of claiming dsh payments with the intergovernmental funds states have claimed inflated hospital charges for certain public hospitals see crs report rl31021 medicaid upper payment limits and intergovernmental transfers current issues and recent regulatory and legislative action by elicia j herz 20 medicaid inpatient utilization means the total number of medicaid inpatient days in cost reporting period divided by the total number of the hospitals inpatient days in the same period crs17 bba 97 also imposed hospitalspecific cap on dsh payments to mental health facilities beginning in 2003 dsh payments to institutions for mental diseases and other mental health facilities were limited to the lesser of 33 of the states total computable dsh allotment for the year or the states 1995 total imd and other mental health facility dsh expenditures attributable to the states ffy 1995 dsh allotment finally bba 97 required that states report annually on the method used to target dsh funds and to describe the payments made to each hospital states were required to submit to the secretary description of the methods used to identify and pay dsh hospitals including childrens hospitals on the basis of the proportion of lowincome and medicaid patients served by such hospitals payments made to each of the identified dsh hospitals were required to be reported annually the bill also clarified that dsh payments be made directly by the states to dsh hospitals and not be included in capitation rates to managed care entities finally bba 97 established provision temporarily allowing hospitals in the state of california hospital specific ceiling equal to 175 of the costs incurred of furnishing hospitals services to individuals who either are eligible for medicaid or who have health insurance the medicare medicaid and schip balanced budget refinement act of 1999 bbra 1999 bbra 1999 was included in the consolidated appropriations act for fy2000 pl 106113 by reference it increased dsh payments for the district of columbia minnesota new mexico and wyoming for fy2000 through 2002 it clarified that medicaid dsh payments are not to be matched at the enhanced federal matching rate used for the state childrens health insurance program bbra also permanently extended the increased hospitalspecific cap for hospitals in the state of california medicare medicaid and schip benefits improvement and protection act of 2000 bipa bipa was incorporated into the consolidated appropriations act of 2001 pl 106554 by reference bipa raised state allotments for 2001 and 2002 for 2003 the allotments returned to the bba 2002 amounts increased by percentage growth of the cpiu thereafter allotments were to increase annually by the percentage growth of the cpiu the result of reverting to the bba policy for 2003 was significant reduction in dsh allotments for most states for that year this drop in allotments was referred to as the dsh dip bipa established that for extremely low dsh states defined as states whose fy1999 total dsh payments are greater than zero but less than 1 of the states total medical assistance spending dsh allotments for 2001 were equal to 1 of the states total medical assistance during that fiscal year for subsequent years allotments are equal to their allotment for the previous year increased by the change in the cpiu for the previous year and subject to the 12 of medical assistance payments ceiling crs18 bipa clarified that certain managed care enrollees are to be included when calculating the medicaid inpatient utilization rates and the lowincome utilization rates used for computing dsh payments the bill also earmarked new dsh funds for certain public hospitals that are owned or operated by state or instrumentality or unit of government within state that are not receiving dsh payments in october of 2000 and that have lowincome utilization rate in excess of 65 those funds rise from 15 million in 2002 to 375 million for fy2006 and remain at that level for each year thereafter it also added requirement that the secretary implement accountability standards to ensure that dsh payments are used in accordance with statutory requirements finally bipa extended californias higher hospitalspecific cap 175 of hospitals uncompensated costs to public hospitals in the rest of the country for period of two years beginning with the state fiscal year that started after september 30 2002 the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of 2003 mma pl 108173 mma addressed the dsh dip or the dropping allotments for many states for 2003 it did so by exempting 2002 dsh allotment amounts from the 12 of medical assistance spending ceiling and establishing 16 increase in dsh allotments for states for fy2004 and raising allotments for certain subsequent fiscal years allotments for years after fy2004 were set to be equal to fy2004 amounts unless the secretary of hhs determines that the allotments as would have been calculated under law prior to mma are equal to or exceed the fy2004 amounts under mma for such fiscal years allotments will be equal to allotments for the prior fiscal year increased by the percentage change in the cpiu for the prior fiscal year mma discontinued the special arrangement for extremely low dsh states and instead raised dsh allotments for low dsh states defined as those states in which total dsh payments for fy2000 are less than 3 of the states total medicaid spending on benefits dsh allotments for such states were raised for fy2004 through fy2008 to an amount that is 16 above the prior years amount for fy2009 forward the allotment for low dsh states for each year will be equal to the prior year amount increased by the change in the cpiu as for all other states finally as condition of receiving federal medicaid payments for fy2004 and beyond states are required to submit to the secretary of hhs detailed annual report and an independent certified audit on their dsh payments to hospitals the deficit reduction act of 2005 dra pl 109171 dra raised dsh allotments for the district of columbia for fy2000 2001 and 2002 from 32 million to 49 million the higher allotments would be used to calculate dsh allotments beginning with fy2005 amounts the provision would take effect as if enacted on october 1 2005 and would apply to expenditures made on or after that date crs19 tax relief and health care act of 2006 trhca pl 109432 established an allotment for fy2007 for tennessee equal to the greater of the amount that the secretary determines is equal to its federal matching for dsh hospital payment for the demonstration year ending in 2006 or 280 million the provision however only allows for dsh payments of 30 of that amount in addition the provision would allow tennessee to submit state plan amendment describing its dsh methodologies the secretary is instructed to consider dsh payments under this provision as expenditures under the states tenncare demonstration project when determining budget neutrality of the project in addition trhca established dsh allotment for hawaii of 10 million uses of disproportionate share funds major reason for the perennial focus on dsh payments is that very little reporting information about the uses of dsh funds has in the past been required of states despite reporting provisions in the law since 1997 combined with the size of dsh payments the inability to precisely say what the funds are used for leads to concern that the program is either unnecessary or abused there has been some evidence that dsh payments may be only tenuously related to their original purpose hospitals have reported receiving only portion of reported dsh payments while an even smaller portion goes to hospitals that serve disproportionate share of medicaid and lowincome beneficiaries relative to other hospitals in 1994 the urban institute conducted survey of states on medicaid dsh practices they found that about half of the 1993 dsh payments were used to pay providers back for their contributions about onesixth of reported payments went to private and county providers and state hospitals while onethird was kept by the states to finance diverse expenditures including general health and welfare expenditures21 based on state reporting collected by cms for only few years and from only portion of the states mark merlis reported that states vary widely in the degree to which they have targeted payments to public hospitals and mental hospitals for fy1998fy2002 some states paid nearly all dsh payments to private general hospitals for others however nearly all payments went to public mental hospitals in addition some states distributed funds among large number of hospitals whereas others make dsh payments to only handful of facilities22 reporting requirements originally established in bba 97 were extended by mma proposed rule was promulgated in august of 2005 70 federal register 21 ku l and t coughlin medicaid disproportionate share and other special financing programs fiscal dilemma for states and the federal government urban institute 1994 22 see crs report rl32644 medicaid reimbursement policy by mark merlis crs20 50262 to implement the reporting and auditing requirements for dsh payments under the mma provisions as of the date of this publication the rule has not been finalized and detailed state reporting is still not being required for dsh payments how are medicaid disproportionate share adjustments different from medicare disproportionate share adjustments medicaid and medicare dsh hospital adjustments are similar in that the major basis for designating hospitals to receive payments is the proportion of services provided to lowincome patients for medicare designation though only hospitals meeting the medicare criteria qualify for payments medicare dsh hospital is one that has disproportionate patient percentage that exceeds certain levels depending upon the type of hospital hospitals disproportionate patient percentage is defined as the hospitals total number of inpatient days attributable to federal ssi medicare beneficiaries divided by the total number of medicare patients days plus the number of medicaid patient days divided by the total patient days for medicaid designation on the other hand states are not limited to the federal criteria as long as at least those hospitals meeting the minimum criteria are classified as dsh the state may establish more liberal methodology of designating dsh hospitals calculating payment adjustments for dsh hospitals can be different for medicaid and medicare dsh hospitals although states may use the medicare payment methodology to calculate medicaid dsh payments most states do not and many of those that do use the medicare methodology also use another methodology for different types of hospitals propac found in 1994 that there is striking disparity between medicare and medicaid dsh expenditures both in total amounts and as proportions of inpatient hospital spending then medicare dsh adjustments were 27 billion and only equal to just over 4 of medicare hospital spending compared to medicaid payments of well over 10 billion equal to about onethird of medicaid hospital payments23 more recently this disparity is even more striking medicare dsh adjustments were estimated to be 95 billion in 2006 or 69 of medicare hospital inpatient care24 2005 medicaid dsh payments were over 171 billion or more than 40 of the size of regular medicaid payments to hospitals for general inpatient services25 23 propac analysis of medicaid disproportionate share payment adjustments congressional report c9401 january 1 1994 p 26 24 cbo fact sheet march 2007 baseline medicare 25 total medicaid payments to inpatient hospitals were 420 billion excluding
