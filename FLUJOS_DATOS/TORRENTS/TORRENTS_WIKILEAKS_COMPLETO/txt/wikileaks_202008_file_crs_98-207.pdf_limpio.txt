issue between the administration and the congress with appropriations typically endin g up significantly higher than the amount requested for fy1998 for example th congress added 270 million 7 to the 363 billion requested by th administration the fy199 9 request of 322 billion is more than 800 million less than th amount appropriated last year most of that reduction is in the corps construction budget which was cut almost in half compared with fy1998 appropriations as result construction funding has been major issue in the corps appropriatio n legislation for fy1999 for example both the house and senate appropriation s committees described the adm inistrations request for limited construction budget as irresponsible hrept 105581 hr 4060 and srept 105206 s 2138 the housesenate conference agreement include d total of 386 billion for the corps for fy1999 638 million more than requested the conference committe recommendation was 106 million less than recommended by the house and 7 2httpwikileaksorgwikicrs98207crs4 million more than recommended by the senate the recommended constructio n budget was 143 billion nearly double what was requested by the administration the hou originally supported substantial decrease in funding for columbia river fish mitigation activities on the grounds that previous efforts have shown clear evidence of success the administration had requested 117 million fo r fy1999 the house recommended 78 million limiting expenditures to th completion of the john day drawdown study and the lower snake river feasibility study the senate recommended 95 million the conference committee s recommen ded 60 million for columbia river fish mitigation funds are to be used for phase i of the john day reservoir drawdown study and co ntinuation of the snake river feasibility study and ongoing construction the conference agreement also included 5 million for construction of n emergency outlet from devils lake north dakota however it deletes senat language describing the appropriati on as an emergency requirement the senate had recommended up to 8 million for the project the fy1999 omnibus appropriations act pl 105277 added funding to number of corps projects including an addition 35 million for columbia river fish mitigation it also added proh ibition on the use of any funds to study or implement plan to drain lake powell or

transfer of 258 million from the working capital fund the offic of management and budget and the congressional budget office disagree as to whether there is an offset for this fundhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98207crs6 background most of the large dams and water diversion s tructures in the west were built by or with the assistance of the bure au of reclamation bureau where the corps has built hundreds of flood control and navigation projects the bureaus mission was to develop water supplies and to reclaim arid lands in the west primarily for irrigation today the bureau manages more than 600 dams in 17 western states providin g water to approximately 10 million acres of farmland and 31 million people the bureau has undergone many changes in the last 15 years turning fro m largely dam construction agency to selfdescribed water resource managemen t agency the agency describes the intent of its programs and projects as follows to operate and maintain all facilities in safe eff icient economical and reliable manner to sustain the health and integrity of ecosystems while addressing the wate r demands of growing west and to assist states tribal governments and local communities in solvin g contemporary and future water and related resource problems in n environmentally socially and fiscally sound manner in practice however the age ncy is somewhat limited in how it can address new demands and new priorities because of numerous statutes compacts and existin g contrac ts which together govern the delivery of water to project users consequently any proposal to change bu reau water allocation or water management policies often becomes difficult to implement and extremely controversial key policy issues the administration requested an appropriation of 852 mill ion for fy1999 net current budget authority approx imately 13 million more than enacted for fy1998 the administration has again requested 1433 million for the california baydelta ecosystem restoration program calfed although funding for the calfe d program has been requested within the bureaus budget the appropriation will b allocated among veral federal agencies it is expected that the majority of funding will go to the bureau and the corps the fy1999 request included new money for the animasla plata project controversial water supply project in southw estern colorado rather the proposed budget would allocate 3 million in existing appropriations authority for ongoin g preconstruction work while changes to the projects construction authorization are under consideration the housesenate confere nce agreement included 7805 million in net current authority f or the bureau for fy1999 715 million less than requested and 587httpwikileaksorgwikicrs98207crs7 million less than enacted for fy1998 the senate had recom mended an appropriation of 8371 million the house had recommended an appropriation of 7628 million the conferees agreed upon 75 million for the calfed program which i s 683 million less than requested on related matter the conferees direct th department of the interior to provide as soon as possible an implementation plan for the anadromous fish restoration plan required under the central valley projec t improvement act cvpia pl 102575 title 34 the conference agreement included 3 million for resource management an d development for the animasla plata project the same amount as requested the senate appropriations committee report took issue w ith several other items within the bure aus budget including 1 recommending reduction of 35 million in fish and wildlife coordination mitigation and native species activities associate d with the central arizona project 2 directing the department of the interior to keep constant budget levels for the grand canyon monitoring and research center t avoid unauthorized expansion of the program 3 prohibiting the bureau from using funds for evaluations of current practices with an aim towards finding ways t manage competing demands for water and 4 directing the agency to explore ways to consolidate ecosystem restoration activities carried out under the cvpia the house appropriations committee report included language encouraging the bureau to better coordinate ecosystem activities carried out through the calfe d program and under cvpia the house committee also admonished the bureau for its declining focus on water resources infrastructure and transformation to water resources mana gement and protection agency however it also notes that the west has largely been reclaimed and that serious consideration is due the question of the bureaus role in this fully developed region httpwikileaksorgwikicrs98207crs8 title iii department of energy table 6 energy and water development

tha t amount the conferees directed that about 937 million should come from prior year funds th actions suggest strong congressional support for basic research energy resource rd for programs under this heading doe requested 175 increase for fy1999 co mpared to the fy1998 appropriation doe made this program key element in the administrations climate change technolog initiative ccti program during the appropriations process congress expressed concer n about whether support of the initiative implied commitment to the kyoto accord the senate approved 4153 million for this program including the 479 million funded under the basic energy sciences bes program an amendment approved on the senate floor adde d 698 million to the appropriations committee recommendation the appropriation was about 5 below the request but about 20 above fy1998 the house approved 3516 million including the 479 million funded by bes th committee expressed concern about the ccti chnology choices and urged doe to focus more on longterm basic research rather than trying to commercialize technologies not yet ready for th market the conf erence approved 3659 million including the 479 million funded by bes most of the funds added by senate floor amendment were not agreed to by the conferees the fy1999 omnibus appropriations act pl 105277 added 60 million to doe s renewable energy programs nuclear energy for nuclear energy programs including research and development closing of surplus facilities uranium programs and international nuclear reactor safety the conferenc report provides 284 million about 40 million below the doe reque st the conferees provided 19 million for new doe program to support in novative nuclear energy research projects the nuclear energy research initiative but nothing for proposed program to improve the economi c competitiveness of existing nuclear power plants nuclear energy plant optimization does nuclear energy request including the nuclear power initiatives had been approve d essentially intact by the senate however the house had cut the administration request by nearly 100 million including reduction of the nuclear energy research i nitiative to 5 million and rejection of the nuclear plant optimization program doe justified its efforts to encourage the continued operation of c ommercial us nuclear plants as an important element in meeting national goals for reducing carbo n dioxide emissions an argument strongly endorsed by the senate panel because nuclear plants directly emit carbon dioxide thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98207crs11 united states could reduce its annual emissions of carbon by up to 47 million metric tons if nuclear plants could be operated longer than currently anticipated acco rding to the doe budget justification opponents have criticized the nuclear energy research proposals as providing wasteful subsidies to failing industry similar nuclear research program proposed by doe last year was rejected by congress funding for electrometallurgical treatment of doe spent fuel has also drawn controversy the conferees provided 4 5 million for the technology in fy1999 in that treatment process metal fuel is melted and highly radioactive isotopes are electrically separated from uranium and plutonium doe contends that such treatment may be the best way to render certain types of spent fuel particularly from the closed experimental breeder reactor ii in idaho safe for longterm storage and disposal opponents contend that such treatment is unnecessary and that the process could be used for separating plutonium to make nuclear weapons they note that the process uses much of the same technology and equipment developed for the plutoniumfueled integral fast reactor or advanced liquid metal reactor which was canceled by congress in 1993 partly because of concerns abou t nuclear weapons proliferation the conferees provided 3 million from the fiss ile materials control and disposition program for joint usruss ian project to develop an advanced reactor technology the gasturbine modular helium reactor to destroy weapons plutonium russia would have to provide matching funds or equivalent inkind contributions science doe asked for an 111 increase for the basic research programs making up th science category the largest i ncrease 1676 million or 251 was for the basic energy sciences program most of that increase 130 million would be to begin construction of the spallatio n neutron source sns which is designed to provide neutrons for use in research ranging fro m genetics to advanced materials the facility is to cost 1 3 billion when completed in 2005 the high energy physics program requested 30 million increase to 65 million for the us contribution to the large hadron collider project at the center for european nuclear researc h cern overall the hep program asked for an 11 million increase the senate appropriated 267 billion for the doe for the science programs including the entire request for the sns project for fy1999 this mount includes the fusion energy sciences program account which the senate mo ved from the energy supply rd account to the science account it also includes 1585 cut imposed by the amendme nt to help offset increased funding for solar and renewable energy rd finally another amendment adopted by the senate added 7 million to the science total recommended by the senate appropriations committee the final appropriation was about 6 over the fy1998 appropriation the house appropriated 242 billion 28 below the request but 56 above fy1998 in making the recommendation the committee noted its strong support for doe basic researc h programs the house while supporting the sns cited b udget constraints in approving 100 million for fy1999 compared to the 157 million request the house also declined to fund the request for does portion of the next generation internet initiative the conference agreed to 270 b illion 25 below the request but 71 above fy1998 the large increase above the houseapproved amount was due primarily to the transfer of the fusio n energy science program from the energy supply rd programs to the science programs th ehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98207crs12 conferees approved 130 million for the sns 27 million below the request but above the house approved amount in the fusion budget the conferees included funds to complete rd on th international th ermonuclear reactor iter project but directed doe not to sign an extension of the iter agreemen t without written consent of congress the conferees also approved the house mark for the high energy and nuclear ph ysics programs which would provide small increase above the request the conferees did not provide any funds for does porti on of the administrations next generation internet initiative national security rd doe requested an 115 increase for stockpile stewardship and maintenanc ssm over fy1998 the stockpile stewardship program which is charged wit h developing the sc ientific basis for maintaining the safety reliability and performance of the existing nuclear weapons stockpile in the absence of nuclear testing requested 178 increase ove r fy1998 most of which would go to the accelerated strategic computing initiative asci an d continued construction of the national ignition facility nif the asci program is designed t develop computer facilities and codes that are capable of simulating nuclear weapon explosion s including changes in the explosion characteristics resulting from aging of the stockpile the senate approved reduction of 25 mil lion from the request for the stockpile stewardship program all of whic h would be in the asci account the senate expressed concern that the asci effort is growing faster than justified and that such growth may adversely affect other parts of th program the house sup ported reduction of 65 million for the stockpile stewardship program from the request the house committee expressed concern about the management of the program an d existence of extraneous activities the reduction it stated could be absorbed by greater efficiencies and management improvements the house also directed that 305 million of prior year carryover balances be used for the fy1998 appropriation the conferees agreed on 214 billion for the stockpile stew ardship program halfway between the house and senate marks the reduction below the request 40 million was directed at the asci program and construction of new facilities the conferees directed doe to undertake an independent cost assessment of the latter projects before expending any fy1999 funds on them enviro nmental management does environmental management program em i s responsible for cleaning up enviro nmental contamination and disposing of radioactive waste at doe nuclear sites the conferees voted to pr ovide 558 billion for em activities at defenserelated sites and 431 million for nondefense sites both about the same as the doe request the defenserelated funding includes 228 million for the privatization of doe waste management projects such as the solidifi cation of highlevel radioactive waste at hanford washington less than half the doe request the fy1999 em budget request was the first to reflect the programs new accelerated cleanup strategy which attempts to maximize the number of sites that can be completely cleaned up by 2006 doe managers contend th at substantial longterm savings can be gained by focusing on completing work at those site s allowing the earliest possible termination of infrastructure costs based on that strategy the budget request was divided into three major segments site closure under the conference agre ement this account provides 1 billion for cleanup of sites that can be complet ely closed by 2006 including rocky flats colorado fernald ohio and grand junction coloradohttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98207crs13 siteproject completion the 1 billion in this account was provided for individual cleanu p projects that can be completed by 2006 but are located at doe sites that will continu operating after 2006 post2006 completion despite the accelerated cleanup plan several large em projects are projected to continue well after 2006 as result th is is the largest em funding area totaling 274 billion many of the large waste management projects included in the separat privatization funding request would also continue operating after 2006 the accelerated cleanup plan has drawn opposition from some environmental groups because of concerns that its focus on 2006 might result in insufficient cleanups in the programs fy199 9 budget justification doe maintained that the requested funding would be sufficient to mee t environmental requirements at most sites although it added at some sites there is small ga p between compliance requirements and available funding em therefore is striving for additiona l efficiencies and other measures to close this gap twothirds of the em privatiza tion funding request would go for phase 1 of the hanford tank waste remediat ion system consisting of pilot vitrification plant that would turn liquid highlevel waste into radioactive glass logs for eventual disposal other major privatized projects include project to treat mixed radioactive and hazardous waste at the idaho national engineering an d environmental laboratory and waste treatment storage and disposal facilities at oak ridge tennessee the em privatization effort is intended to reduce costs by increasing competition for cleanup work and shifting portion of project risks from the federal government to contractors profits to contracto rs would depend on their success in meeting project schedules and holding down costs potentially profits could be substantially higher than under traditional doe contracting arrangements in typical nonprivatized doe project contractor would be hired to build and operate facility with government funds doe would approve and pay all the contractors costs and the n award the contractor profit based on performance under the privatization initiative contractor would be expected to raise almost all funding for necessary facilities and eq uipment for project the contractor would recover that investment and earn profit by charging previously negotiated fees to doe for providing services under the contract such as solidification of radioactive waste th contractor could earn higher profits by reducing co sts but the contractor could lose money if project costs were higher than expected or the required services were not delivered doe requested more than 1 billion last year for privatized projects but congress provided only 200 million the strong congressional resistance to the request stemmed largely from concern s about providing such large amount of upfront funding for contracts that had not yet been full negotiated in many cases the contracts are to spell out such crucial details as how much risk for project cost overruns and other problems that doe would continue to bear in response to such criticism doe promised in the fy1999 budget justification to submi t proposed privatization contracts to congress for review at least 30 days before they are signed contract information submitted for such reviews is to includ anticipated costs and fees performance specifications activities to be carried out project schedules goods or services to be delivered and estimated cost savings doe also promised to establish i ts own review teams to examine requests for proposal s and contracts for privatization projects to procure and disseminate independent cost httpwikileaksorgwikicrs98207crs14 savings estimat to increase training for doe oversight of privatized contracts and to assure that contract ors hire sufficiently experienced personnel nevertheless the conferees cut the do privatization request by more than half civilian nuclear waste disposal the conference report pr ovides 358 million in fy1999 for developing disposa l site for highly radioactive spent fuel from nuclear power plants and weapons related highlevel waste about the same as the fy1998 level the senate had voted to cut th request by 5 millio n while the house citing severe budget constraints held the program to level funding the fy1999 budget request was issued shortly after doe missed statutory deadline of january 31 1998 to begin taking waste from nuclea r plant sites the department currently expects to begin receiving waste at an underground disposal facility at yucca mountain nevada by 2010 if the site is found suitabl nuclear utilities and state utility regulators upset over does failure to meet the 1998 disposal deadline have won two federal co urt decisions upholding the departments obligation to meet the deadline and to compensate utilities for any resulting damages the house and senate passed similar bills last year s 104 hr 1270 to require doe to build an interim waste storage facility near yucca mountain that could begin operating within the next few years the clinton administration has threatened to veto the legislation contending that yucca mountain should not be selected for waste storage until the site has been determined to be acceptable for permanent disposal doe plans to complete viability assessment of the site in 1998 and if the site is found suitable submit license application to t he nuclear regulatory commission in 2002 passage of the nuclear waste legislation in the 105th congress was blocked by the senates rejection of cloture motion on hr 1270 on june 2 1998 doe cont ends that under current law it has authority to take waste for temporary storage so the fy1999 budget request did not include funding for nearterm waste acceptance activities despite the recent court rulin gs on the missed disposal deadline instead storage and transportation funds were reques ted only for longlead time activities that must precede removal of spent nuclear fuel snf from reactor sites once federal facility becomes available the conferees directed that 165 million of the nuclear waste programs funding come from the nuclear waste fund which holds fees assessed on nuclear power generation to pay for spent l disposa l another 189 million would be appropriated from general revenues under defens nuclear waste disposal to cover disposal costs for highlevel radioactive waste from nuclea r weapons production the remaining 4 million would come from general revenues to pay fo r research on treating highlevel radioactive waste with advan ced particle accelerators such treatment would be intended to transmute longlived radioactive waste into shorterlived isotopes the conference agreement rejected all but 250000 of does nearly 5 million request fo r funds for the state of nevada to monitor the yucca mountain project congress denied all suc h funding for fy1998 because of conc erns that the state was using it to fight the waste

agreement the us nrichment corporation usec buys the enriched russian uranium and gives back n equivalent amount of natural unenriched uranium which the russians can then sell however the russians have complained that the pr ice for natural uranium has been depressed by usecs plans to sell large amounts of natural uranium on the world market usec formerly governmen t corporation received that uranium from doe stockpiles as part of its recent privatization to keep the russians from backing out of heu agreement the new funding would allow doe to purchase the natural uranium associated with

encompassing the entirety of tennessee and portions of kentucky virginia north carolina georgia alabama an d mississippi the agencys electric power operations are entirely selfsupporting and receive n appropriation however tva is also re sponsible for certain nonpower functions that are intended to further the agencys mission to develop and conserve the regions natural resources these include flood control recreation navigation and an environmental resea rch center among these tva operates more than 50 dams and r eservoirs and 170000 acre recreational area in kentucky and tennessee land between the lakes the cong ressional appropriation for these programs was 106 million for fy1997 representing 2 of the agency budget in january 1997 tva chairman craven crowell proposed that tva prepare to become higherprofile player in deregulated market for electricity crowells proposal was that congress longer appropriate funds to tva for nonpower activities begi nning in fy1999 an internal tva task force would recommend which functions would be transferred to other agencies and whic h would be eliminated the administration pr oposed reprogramming of fy1997 funds appropriatedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98207crs17 to the corps of engineers to jointly study with tva how the agencys assets and functions should be reassigned to the corps and other appropriate agencies chairman crowel ls proposal not only stirred up considerable controversy it also exposed the existence of tva itself to challenge while representatives from the tennessee valley region ar averse to any risk to nonpower programs the chairmans proposal to shed nonpower programs tva opponents have argued would be an abrogation of tvas mission if the mission is longer appropriate the argument extends neither is the agency the unintended consequence of chairman crowells proposal was that the conferees on th fy1998 energy and water appropriations recommended an appropriation of 70 million fo r fy1998 but stipulated that tva would thereafter absorb the entire cost of these programs through internall generated revenues and savings despite the language in the conference report an d pending further consideration of the future of tva and its nonpower programs the administration requested 77 million for tva nonpower programs for fy1999 the senate funded tva t 70 million while the house bill provided funding the conferees adhered to the house position and in addition provided funding for land between the lakes additionally the conferees required that if in the absence of an appropriation tva deemed rate increase necessary to fund these programs report would have to be submitte d to congress assessing whether transferring stewardship of facilities along the tennessee river to the army corps f engineers wo uld alleviate or eliminate the need for rate increase the conferees further required that this report be submitted 6 months before the rate increase would go into effect the fy1999 omnibus appropriation act pl 105277 restored 50 million to tva non power programs in addition the act includes debtrefinancing plan that would enable tva t prepay its obligations to the federal financing bank without penalty estimated to save the agency 100 million in interest payments during each of the next 10 years the consequ ences of this turnaround for tva when the 106 congress considers electricit yth deregulation legislation are difficult to predict tvas critics may continue to urge that tva b extensively reorganized as part of any deregulation package on the other hand supporters suggest that if tva takes ful l advantage of the opportunity to reduce its debt and operates more efficiently the agency may come under less intense pressure in the next congress nuclear regulatory commission the conference agreement gives the nuclear regulatory commission nr c 470 million for fy 1999 about 20 million below the budget request major activities conducted by nrc include regulation of commercial nuclear reactors licensing of nuclear waste facilities and oversight f nuclear materials users the funding also includes about 5 million for the nrc inspector generals office the senate v oted to appropriate 466 million to nrc 2 million below the fy1998 level the senate energy and water development subcommittee would have reduced the funding by 90 million cutback that would have eliminated 700 of nrcs approximately 3000 employees over the next two years although the full committee reversed th at cut its report strongly criticized nrc for allegedly failing to overhaul its regulatory system in line with impro vements in nuclear industry safety the committee contended among other problems that nrcs regional offices w ere inconsistent

lower funding 463 million was supported by the house whose report containe d similar criticisms to those of the senate panel the house declared itself strongly supportive of the administrations plans for nrc to eventually take over safety regulation of major doe nuclea r facilities which currently are regulated by doe itself the conferees gave nrc 32 million fo r regulatory reviews of doe facilities both house and senate also provided 48 million for the nrc inspector generals office to ensure that nrcs budget would continue to be mostly offset by fees on nuclear powe r plants and other
