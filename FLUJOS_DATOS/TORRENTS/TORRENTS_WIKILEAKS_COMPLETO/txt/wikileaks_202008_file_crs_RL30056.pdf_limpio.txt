to pay for the added appropriations as enacted hr 432 8 designated all but 100 million of the 2076 billion supplemental as an emergenc and included 67 million in offsets major components of the

following agriculture several regions of the country had been experiencing low farm commodity prices primarily for wheat corn soybeans and cotton andor natura l disasters in 1998 particularly in the northern plains and the south this had th effect of significantly reducing farm income on october 6 1998 the senate cleared for the white house the conference agreement on the fy1999 agricultur appropriations bill hr 4101 containing separate titles that would provide 42 6 billion in direct payments to farmers to mitigate the effects of low crop prices an d natural disasters conferees included language which declared budget emergency for this expenditure which meant that if the full house and senate and th adminis tration concurred with the emergency designation budgetary offset s would be required for the new spending president clinton however vetoed hr 4101 on octo ber 7 stating that the relief for farmers was inadequate followin g further congressionaladministration negotiations 589 billion supplementa l agriculture package was added to the omnib us appropriations bill the compromise however did not include provision lifting the cap on loan rates for certai n commodities the amount provided in the agriculture appropriations conference agreement was based on proposal announced by house republican leadership on september 17 and included 15 billion in disaster payments to farmers who have incurre d significan t crop losses in 1998 due to natural disasters an additional 675 million in direct payments to producers who have experienced multiple years of disasters particularly those in the northe rn plains and upper midwest 165 billion increase in fy1999 market transit ion payments which translates into 29 increase in these payments for each

farmhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30056crs3 provision not included in the conference agreement but strongly supporte d by the administration and senate democratic leadership was temporary increase in the loan rate price guarantees for certain farm commodities in july the senate rejected an amendment to s 2159 that would have removed the current cap on the loan rate for wheat feed grains cotton and rice for the 1998 crop year anothe r attempt to remove the cap on loan rates was defeated on september 15 when th senate tabled similar amendment to the interior appropriations bill s 2237 i n september the administration threatened veto of the agriculture appropriations bill if it contained farm economic ass istance package that did not include provision to remove the cap on the loan rate s the estimated cost of uncapping the loan rates for year is approximately 5 billion the administration proposal also included more than 2 billion in disaster payments bringing the total cost of its recommendation to more than 7 billion the president an d congressional democrats contended that the 426 billion in the conference agreement on hr 4101 was not sufficient to address the financial

year 2000 computer conversion for over two years congress has helped to focus national attent ion on the year 2000 computer problem the inability of many computer systems to process dates correctly beyond january 1 2000 the problem arises because most computer systems store dates using only the last two digits for the year field eg 98 for 1998 with this format the year 2000 is indistinguishable from 1900 the ye ar datafield in computer programs can perform various functions such as calculating age sorting information by date and com paring dates when years beyond 1999 are entered in the twodigit format those functions will often fail t operate properly federal agencies maintain man computer systems that manage large databases conduct electronic monetary transactions and control numerous interactions wit h other computer systems these agencies face major challenge to convert thei r software and hard ware to handle dates beyond the year 2000 ombs cost estimate for federal agency year 2000 conversion increased steadily and is currently 5 4 billion omb has targeted march 31 1999 as the deadline for federal agencies t have completed the renovation validation and

members had bee n considering for some time whether to add emergency funding for military readiness either to the regular fy1999 defense appropriation s bill or to separate supplemental measure the funding was intended m ainly to bolster military recruitment purchases of spare pa rts maintenance of equipment and real property and training n emergency funding for this purpose was added to the regular defense bill hr 3616 and was widely expected that appropriators would therefore propose som emergency funding for military readiness in supplemental measure on october 5 omb sent letters to

million marine corps and army operating force support 348 million navy and air force depot maintenance 251 million and other items 49 million the entire amount would have been offset by funds becoming

operations measure the supplemental further adde d 50 million in emergency funds for usaid child survival programs an activity that has become one of the highest congressional foreign aid priorities in recent years combined with the 650 million appropriated in the regular foreign operation s appropriations congress approved nearly 100 million more for child survival and infectious disease programs than the administration proposed for fy1999 emergency designation and the debate over offsets the white house designated all but the defense readiness supplementals s emergency requirements the emergency designation allows congress to approve the additional funds without offsetting the amounts with rescissions in enacte d discretionary appropriations or finding cuts in mandatory spending programs i f congres s agrees with the president to define the supplementals as an emergency and not offset the amounts discretionary spending would rise above the budget capshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30056crs7 set in 1998 by congress and reduce t he size of the budget surplus for fy1999 over the past five years congress has usually enacted budget authority offsets fo r supplementals the question over whether to in clude corresponding reductions when approving additional spending became highly contentious earlier in 1998 durin g debate over another supplemental appropriations packa ge pl 105174 hr 3579 as enacted congress provided 26 billion to offset natural disaster supplementa l funding but did not offset 286 billion in additional defense spending lawmakers supporting the emergency designation believed that with th enactment of each new rescission package to offset supplementals the past few years most of the viable options for reductions had been exhausted that what choice s remained for further cuts had narrowed to very difficult set of alternatives moreover many said that defense spending reductio ns in recent years combined with the practice of paying for overseas missions by raiding other dod accounts d stretched military readiness capabilities to the limit protecting defense spending by finding offsets exclusively among domestic program s however presents the problem of breaking the soc alled firewalls between defense and domestic accounts in the past defense supplementals would be offset by cuts in the defense budget whil addition s for domestic programs would be paid for by reducing existing domesti c appropriations members critical of the emergency d esignation argued that congress and the president should adhere to the discretionary caps established for the next five years in the balanced budget act of 1997 and include offsets for the entir supplemental package exceeding the caps they believed would set dangerou s precedent for future spending requirements some member s challenged the use of the emergency designation for parts of the supplementals as one example group of house republicans propose d offsetting items that represented true emergencies with changes in fha and ginnie mae mortgage programs and medicaid administrative reforms that would generat more revenues under their plan other nonemergency elements would be paid for by an acrosstheboard cut in nondefense discretionary funds on march 1 1999 if the administration had not yet found other spending cuts livingston optimistic as funding deadline approaches national journals congress daily pm october 5 1998 even though the presidents official supplemental requests did not includ offsets reportedly on october 12
