other federal student aid summary the taxpayer relief act of 1997 pl 10534 authorized two new tax credits for family postsecondary education expenses the hope scholarship credit provides up to 1500 in annual tax relief to defray the cost of the first 2 years of undergraduate studies the lifetime learning credit provides up to 1000 in tax relief to defray the cost of any year of postsecondary study the hope and lifetime learning credits were enacted to help preserve and enhance access to postsecondary education for students from middleincome families there are national data that provide the comprehensive information needed to thoroughly analyze the distribution of the education tax credits and their interaction with traditiona l student aid awarded under the higher education act hea this report examines these issues by using two different modeling approaches to estimate the be nefits potentially offered by the credits to young adults who are currently outofschool and the eligibility of currently enrolled aided students for the tax benefits and how much they might receive modeling is also used to estimate changes in the targeting of federal obligationfree aid grants and tax credits and the distributional effects of changes to the credits the results from this analysis are legislatively relevant because the 107th congress is considering proposals to change the size and targeting of the education credits further the interaction of the credits and hea student aid will likely be of legislative interest during the 108th congress when the hea is up for reauthorization briefly the major findings from this analysis are as followsthe hope credit provides s ubstantial benefit to recipients and spreads these benefits relatively broa dly by design these credits target the bulk of their benefits to middle and upper middleincome students but these benefits also reach down the income scale and provide assistance to some lowincome students overlapping with the major source of federal grant aid pell grants the lifetime learning credit in contrast provides relatively little benefit students attending higher priced institutions are much more likely to maximize the amount of lifetime learning credit they receive the hope and lifetime learning credits have tended to shift the focus of federal postsecondary obligationfree aid ch aid is longer principally need based aid targeted to the lowest income st udents but is now available to the broad expanse of middle and uppe r middleincome students there is current congressiona l interest in modifying the distribution of the tax credit benefits the current patterns of distribution are function of often complex interaction among the credits award rules for instance to extend tax credit benefits to lowincome students at lower priced institutions concurrent changes to several of the award rules may be requiredhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31484contents introduction 1 n ly tic p p r c h s to xa min in

to traditi onal student aid by adam stoll and james stedman 2these offsets and limitations are considered in detail belowhigher education tax credits targeting value and interaction with other federal student aid introduction the taxpayer relief act of 1997 pl 10534 authorized two new tax credits for family postsecondary ducation expenses the hope scholarship credit provides up to 1500 in annual ta x relief to defray the cost of the first 2 years of undergraduate studies the lifetime learning credit provides up to 1000 in tax relief to defray the cost of an year of postsecondary study1 the hope and lifetime learning credits were enacted to help preserve and enhance access to postsecondary education for students from middleincome families since being introduced the tax credits have rapidly become major sources of assistance for postsecondary students nationwid they have also added considerable complexity to the student aid picture largely because it has been difficult to assemble precise information about the population of students receiving each credit and about how the credits interact with other forms of aid there are national data that provide the comprehensive information needed to address the issues of the distributi on of the education tax credits and their interaction with other forms of aid the tax credits operate out side of the systems used for packaging and awarding student financial aid conse quently information on the receipt of tax credits is not available in the largescale national surveys on aid received by students which are reliant on institutional reporting of aid packages awarded to students additionally av ailable data from the internal revenue service irs have serious limitations and are not well suited for use in examining the tax credit benefits received in particular academic years or for making comparisons between those bene fits and other financial aid adding to this challenge tax credit va lues cannot be easily inferred the actual value of the credits is often less than the maximum possible value due in large part to series of offsets and limitations built into the design of the credits2httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31484crs2 3the clinton administration first proposed the hope credits in 1997 in order to provide tax relief to middleincome families strugglin g to pay for college and to help make 14 years of education the standard for all americans letter dated march 20 1997 to speaker of the house newt gingrich from secretary of education richard w riley and secretary of the treasury robert rubindespite the growing importance of tax credits higher education analysts and policymakers have had difficult time assessing the value of the credits for varied groups of recipients and pinpointing how the credits interact with other forms of aid these are important issues to resolve because there currently are number of proposals under consideration in the 107th congress that would affect the size and targeting of the hope and lifetime learning credits additionally the interaction between tax credits and other forms of federal student aid will likely be of particular legislative interest during the 108th congress when the higher education act will next be up for reauthorization in an effort to add clarity to this situ ation this report pres ents newly generated estimates of the value of the credits available to varied eligible recipients in the absence of actual data modeling approaches that simulate tax credit values offer perhaps the most promising way to examine the targeting of the education tax credits two different modeling approaches are applied in the analysis presented in this report these models scribed later are used to provide the following the estimated benefits poten tially offered by the credits to young adults who are currently out of school estimated eligibility of currently enrolled aided students for the tax benefits estimates of changes in the targeting of federal obligationfree aid discussed later in this report and estimates of the effects of possible changes in the award rules of the creditson expanding the distribution of the benefits to lower income students thereby potentially increasing their impact on access the hope and lifetime learning credits are premised on the assumption that tax benefits reaching maximum of between 1000 and 1500 will enhance access to postsecondary education this analysis delineates how these benefits might be distributed to current and potential stude nt populations for whom access is likely to be an important issue ne vertheless it is beyond the sc ope of the present report to determine whether tax benefits of th amounts will in fact expand access to postsecondary education for these populations analytic approaches to examin ing the value of tax credits the hope and lifetime learning credits were intended to enhance or help preserve college access3 in keeping with the aims of the credits this examination will focus on the level of assistance they can provide to populations for whom access may be an issue populations being analyzed the first group is the broad population of collegeage individuals who although they have graduated from high school are nothttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31484crs3 4for additional information see the technical appendix to this report 5ibidcurrently participating in pos tsecondary education it is considered to be comprised of potential postsecondary education students the second group is the population of postsecondary students who are currently receiving federal fi nancial assistance to help support their studies this gr oup includes the preponderance of higher education students receiving needbased aid students enrolled in postsecondary education but not receiving financial ai d are not being studied since access is not dependent on federa l financial aid for this population analytical approach case simulation modeling4 the initial analysis focuses on the broad population of potential postsecondary students who are not currently enrolled in postsecondary ducation and uses case simulation model case simulations are used to explore how the following factors affect the tax credit levels income offsets family composition cost of education nd type of institution attended this examination explores what the tax credits might really be worth to different kinds of prospective students we explore these issues by first an alyzing current population survey cps data from the bureau of the census to construct set of cases that typify characteristics of the current potential pos tsecondary stude nt population these cases were then run through the model to determine the level of tax credit assistance likely to flow to them sufficient number of cases were run to map thresholds cutoff points gaps in coverage and to thoroug hly explore issues related to offsets analytical approach survey data modeling5 the second approach focuses on aided enrolled postsecondary student s this analysis utilizes the national postsecondary student aid study npsas data on students ta x liability income attendance status enrollment status grant aid and tuition and fee levels to construct estimated tax credit values for students r eceiving financial ai d npsas provides comprehensive nationally representative data on the financial aid packages received by students under this approach once estimated tax credit values are computed for students it is possible to examine the level of tax credit benefits potentially available to students possessing different characteris tics and how the tax credits complement other sources of aid in help ing students meet tuition costshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31484crs4 6these individuals may have never attended postsecondary education or may have some postsecondary enrollment without attaining gree higher than an associates degree 7the march cps is survey of approximately 50000 households collecting detailed data on labor force participation and income information on current educational activity is collected for individuals aged 16 to 24 the march 2000 survey was used to estimate the characteristics of the portion of this young population who were high school graduates not currently enrolled in college and had not ear ned ba if they had enrolled in college previously 8for federal student aid an individual is consid ered independent of hi s or her parents ie parental income and assets are not consider ed in determining the assistance if the individual is at least 24 years old by decembe r 31 of the award year is an orphan or ward of the state or was until age 18 is veteran of the armed forces is graduate or professional student is married has depende nts others than spouse or is deemed independent by financial aid officer for oth er unusual circumstances to distinguish the financial aid dependents from independents in the cps young outofschool population all of these factors were applied except whethe r the individual was or had been an orphan or ward of the state and whether financial ai d officer might make determination that the individual was financially independent 9according to cps data an estimated 20 million individuals are in the first group young outofschool married independents 65 of th individuals are high school graduates continuedwhat benefits do the credits offer prospective students this section of the report consider s the estimated distribution for 20012002 of the tax credit benefits as well as pell grant aid to outofschool young adults who have at least graduated from high school but who have not attained bachelors degree ba6 this is population which if it enrolled in postsecondary education could be eligible for the tax credits and pell grants the pell grant program is the largest federal grant program for postsec ondary undergraduates providing some 99 billion in grant aid for the 20012002 academic year and 107 billion for 20022003 as is delineated below pell grant aid has critical impact on the distribution of the education tax credits as noted earlier this portion of the report utilizes case simulation model which shows how the distribution of tax credit benefits and pell grant assistance changes as adjusted gross income agi chan ges the results generated by this case simulation model are linked to the oung outofschool population through an analysis of data gathered by the bu reau of the census cps for march 20007 analysis of cps data iden tified primary groups within the pool of young outof school prospective students the distributi on of aid to two of the primary groups of prospective students is considered thr oughout the remainder of this section young

analyzed but for whom results are not disp layed are dependent young individuals living with two parents there are approximately 660000 individuals in this group 32 are high school graduates only 68 have some college but less than ba the simulated distribution of pell grants and education tax credits to this third subgroup parallels to substantial degree the results for the young married independent population 10the agi quintile breaks shown in the figures in this section are point estimates based on cps survey data and are meant to be illustrative given sampling and nonsampling errors actual quintiles for the populations analyzed might differ from those shown here the march 2000 cps survey provides estimates of 1999 agi these were inflated to 2001 using the cpiu 63 increasequintile distributions of the agi of the ta rget subgroups of this young outofschool population are mapped to the case simulati on results to show what the potential benefits are for different income quintiles10 summary of findings briefly the findings presented in this section include the following the distribution of assistance reflects the basic design of the credits which by virtue of their nonrefundability and gran t aid offset these features are discussed below are targeted to students in the middle to upper middle income quintiles the credits will not affect access for the lowest income students because they provide benefit to such students nevertheless the tax benefits particul arly the hope credits may be received by some lowincome students who also receive pell grants this may boost federal aid to portion of the lowincome population under most circumstances the hope credit appears to offer much greater benefit than does the lifetime learning credit the size of lifetime learning credit is generally insignificant relative to the absolute benefit derived from pell grant or hope cred it or relative to tuition and fees or the cost of attendance for delineati on of tuition and fees and cost of attendance see footnote17 award rules the analysis of the distribution and value of the hope and lifetime learning credits in this and the following secti ons of the report depends in part on an understanding of how the credits are calcula ted for an individual this involves an explanation of the award rules for the credits as delineated below key rule concerns the interaction of the credits with other grant aid an individual might receive the primary source of federal gr ant aid to undergraduates is the pell grant program as consequence information on how pell grant aid is determined is also important for fuller understanding of the operation of the education credits thishttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31484crs6 11a students efc is based on c onsideration of his or her income and other financial resources as well as those of spouse if ma rried or of parents if considered dependent for need analysis the amount of students pell grant is the least of the following three calculations annual maximum pell grant minus ef c cost of attendance minus efc or the tuition sensitivity rule applicable only when tuiti on is very low as noted in the text for most students the first calculation determines the size of the pell grant 12according to the march 2000 cps data the medi an family size of the young outofschool independent with spouse was 3 as result the case simulations of pell grant and hope credits were based on this family sizeportion of the report provides an overview of the award rules for the pell grants and the education credits pell grants in general the amount of pell grant assistance an individual receives is the difference between the maximum pell grant being awarded in any particular year and the individual s expected family contribution efc11 for all simulated cases this is the award rule applied as the efc rises generally as the familys agi increases the pell grant shrinks among the key features of the pell grant calculation most relevant for this analysis are that the grant is not affected by the receipt of other student financial aid and that the poorest individuals those with zero efcs receive the maximum pe ll grant 3750 for award year 20012002 further the pell grant assistance can cove r all postsecondary education expenses as noted below the education tax credits cu rrently can only cover qualified tuition and fee expenses figure 1 below shows the estimated amount of pell grant assistance for award year 20012002 to which married independent student with child might be entitled based on agi and other characteristics12 in this case the student is high school graduate who has never previously enrolled in college candidate for receipt of hope credit the pell grant aid is represen ted by the

credits are nonrefundable tax credits meaning they are available only to the extent that the taxpayer has income tax liability further they are applied against qualified higher education expenses qualified expenses are tuition and fees required as condition for enrollment13 these expenses are reduced by the amount of nontaxable educational assistance received by the student which includes pell grants we call the reduction in qualified expenses the grant aid offset for individuals both credits begin to be phased out after agi exceeds 40000 and are completely phased out when income reaches 50000 for those who are married filing joint returns thes income thresholds are 80000 and 10000014 the credits differ in several key ways to be eligible for hope credit an individual must be enrolled

undergraduate education in contrast the lifetime learni ng credit is available for individuals enrolled in one or more courses of undergraduate or gra duate instruction to acquire or improve job skills and there is limit on the number of years for which the credit may be claimed perhaps most significantly the reimbursement rules for qualified expenses differ between the two credits for the 2001 tax year the hope credit is equal to 100 of the fi rst 1000 in qualified expenses and 50 of th second 1000 in qualified expenses capped at maximum credit of 150015 for that same year the lifetime

agi quintile 4th and 5th agi quintilesfigure 5 hope credit and pell grant for 1624 year old married independent high school graduate with child enrolling full time at 4year private college the key points that can be made about the distribution of benefits are the followinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31484crs11 18the pell grant does not fall below 1738 the tuition and fees being paid until agi reaches 30000 only at that juncture are ther remaining qualified expenses that can be covered by the hope credit 19the 17000 starting point of this income range is where this type of students efc first exceeds 0 there are substantial qualified expe nses remaining after the grant aid offset that can be covered by the hope credit at these institutions 20at some points in the 2nd agi income quintile the combination of hope credit and pell grant exceeds the maximum pell grant which students in the 1st income quintile receive this is clearer in the figure showing benefits at the 4year private college 21each of these percentages is calculated using the maximum credit that can be realized for each simulated case and the relevant averag tuition and fees delineated in footnote 17 22for these figures the xaxis adjusted gross income extends only from 0 to 50000 not 100000 as with the married independent student because that is the range of income across which the hope credit can be claimed by th is type of student who is ineligible to file joint return 23the early loss of pell grant assistance and the nonrefundability of the hope credit explain why there is difference between the distri bution for these students in 4year public college and in 4year private college as the pell grant is reduced more tuition and fees remain to be covered by the credit but at and beyond the lower agi where the pell grant phases out it is tax liability that dictates how much credit can be claimed tax liability does not differ across categories of institutions as result there is difference in the benefits realizedthe higher average tuition and fee levels of 4year institutions compared to those at community colleges allow th maximum hope credit of 1500 to be claimed for each institutional category there is range of income across which both pell grant aid and hope credit benefit may be received this income range is relatively narrow at the comm unity college level 31000 to 39000 because of its lower average tuition and fees18 in contrast the income range where the benefits overlap is significan tly wider at 4year institutions 17000 to 39000 primarily func tion of the higher average tuition and fees19 as result of these higher charges the hope credit reaches down into the 2nd agi quintile indeed for this income quintile the hope credit effectivelyreplaces pell grant assistance that was lost as agi rose 20 coverage of average tuition and fees by the maximum hope credit that canbe realized is highest at the co mmunity college level 79 and drops precipitously at the 4year public and 4 year private college levels 40 and 9 respectively 21 single independent student ac ross institutional categories the following figures show the distribution acr oss institutional categories of pell grant and hope credit benefits for single independent individual22 the 4year public college and 4year private college categories are displayed in single figure since the distribution of aid for this case is identical for these two categories of institution23httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31484crs12 24the dip in aggregate assistance at an inco of approximately 16000 is

and pell grant for 1624 year old single independent high school graduate enrolling fulltime at either 4year public college or 4year private college analysis of these figures reveals that the distribution of pell grant and hope credit benefits to single independent students diffe rs from that of married independent students among the impor tant differences are the following the maximum pell grant assistance is provided over much narrower range of agis and declines to zero much sooner at approx imately 16000 agi versus 40000 agi for the married indepe ndent student case this in turn permits the hope credit to be claimed lower down the income range because the rapid diminution of the pell grant aid frees up tuition and fees for potential coverage by the credit24httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31484crs13 24continued pell award rule not considered previously wh students calculated pell grant falls in the 200 to 400 range 400 grant is awarded this means there is sudden decline from 400 pell grant to 0 when the calculated pell grant is below 200 where this occurs for these independent students there is not sufficient tax liability for the hope credit to cover the marked increase in remaining tuition and fees 25under the pell grant program the award for halftime student is calculated based on ratable reduction of the fulltime award in contrast the hope credit was calculated by reducing the average tuition and fees for each category of institution by 50 at lower priced institutions such as community college s this reduces the allowable credit since initial tuition and fee levels are at or below the 2000 tuition level at which the maximum hope credit can be claimed given the credit s reimbursement rules at higher priced institutions tuition is sufficiently large that 50 reduction need not affect the maximum hope credit benefitthe income quintiles are more clustered at the lower end of the income scale than they are for the married indepe ndent student somewhat changing the relative balance of grant aid and credit benefit in the income quintiles the hope credit offers less assistance in the 2nd and 3rd quintiles to the single independent student than to th married independent student coverage of average tuition and fees by the maximum hope credit that can be realized is the same for this type of student as for married independent students see above halftime enrollment when either of these student cases is enrolled on halftime basis at 4year public or private college pell grant assistance can be markedly reduced while the hope credit remains relatively unchanged as consequence at these kinds of institutions the amount of benefit provided by this tax credit may be closer to the size of the pell grant benefit25 in contrast at community colleges the pell grant and hope credit are both likely to be reduced roughly proportionately who in the young outofschool population is potentially served by lifetime learning credits in general the lifetime learning credit delivers markedly less benefit than does the hope credit this is primarily f unction of the different reimbursement rules between the two credits the maximum hope credit is 50 larger than the maximum lifetime learning credit further when tuition and fee levels that can be covered by the credits are relatively low the lifetime learning credit can be substantially less than the hope credit for example if remaining tuition and fees are 2000 1500 hope credit might be cla imed given sufficient tax liability but the maximum lifetime learning credit at that tuition and fee level is only 200 married independent st udents with child across institutional categories the analysis below focuses on the distribution of pell grant and

lifetime learning credit and pell grant for 1624 year old married independent wit h child having some college enrolling fulltime at 4year private college several key points can be made about the simulate d distribution of these benefits the lifetime learning credit is maximiz ed when tuition levels are highest the credit offers little absolute assistance to student attending the community college or even the 4year public college it is only at the much higher tuition and fee levels at the 4year private college that the maximum lifetime learning credit can be claimed the lifetime learning credit reaches down into the 1st income quintile only at relatively high tuition levels at the 4year private college for this student the credit more than offsets the loss of pell grant aid for the upper reaches of the 1st income quintile the level of estimated life time learning credit assistance received by these students is significantly less than the hope credit benefits received by the other subset of married independent students those with only high school diploma the coverage of average tuition and fee charges by the maximum lifetime learning credit that can be realized is markedly less 20 at the community college compared to 79 by the hope credit for the other subset of students 20 at the 4year public co llege 40 by the hope credit for the other subset and 6 at the

institutional categories are shown immediately above because unlike th distribution of the hope credit the distributions at the 4year public college and 4year private college are different28 the key points to be made about the dist ribution of the lifetime learning credit for this student are the following the lifetime learning credit once again is maximized when tuition and fees are high in contrast to the distribution of lifetime learning aid to the marriedindependent student at point does it ffset the loss in pell grant assistance experienced by the single inde pendent student as agi grows the coverage of average tuition and fees across types of institution is the same as described bove for the married independent student halftime enrollment when either of these student cases is

the largest population of aided students for whom comprehensive background data are available with the introduction of higher educati on tax credits in 1997 as second major approach toward providing fede ral student aid considerable interest has arisen in the complementarity between title iv grant aid and tax credit assistance additionally as has been discussed throughout this repor t considerable interest exists in more accurately identifying the population of stude nts eligible to benefit from the tax credits the analysis presented below sheds light on the extent to which the students who have traditionally been the focus of fe deral financial aid those receiving title iv aid are also able to benefit from the tax credits additionally it explores the combined targeting of title iv grant aid and tax credit assistance to these students the analysis upon which this portion of the report is based utilizes npsas based tax credit estimation m odel this model utilizes comprehensive background information on title iv recipients eg information on tax liability adjusted gross income tuition and fee levels enrollment and attendance status which is available in npsas29 and simulates tax credit benefits available to such students in some instances only partial information on students characteristic is available in npsas consequently some assumptions have been built into the modeling approach the information presented below on the value and availability of tax credits should therefore be viewed as timates of what aided students are potentially eligible to receive in tax benefits and not as precise reflections of actual aid amounts readers are encouraged to re view the technical appendix which outlines the modeling approach and the assumptions embedded within it in greater detail it should be noted that tax credit values presented below are being estimated for national sample of title iv recipients30 in the analysis that follows these estimated tax credit

summary of findings the analyses presented in the remainder of this section focus on title iv recipients access to tax credits in ggregate hope credits lifetime learning credits and federal

is widely available to title iv recipients roughly 45 of title iv recipients are eligible to r eceive tax credits students in the lowest income quin tile earning less than 8176 who are much more likely to be affected by grant aid offsets and the credits nonrefundability are much less likely to qualify for tax credit assistance than are students in all other income quintiles31 the hope credit available to appr oximately 38 of those undergraduates receiving title iv assistance who are in their first 2 years of study carries median value of 1276 roughly 85 of the maximum potential value of hope credit nearly half of the title iv recipients attending 4year public 4year private and proprie tary schools are eligible for hope credits median hope credit values ar above 1300 for eligible recipients at each of these types of institutions the lifetime learning credit available to approximately one quarter of thecombined pool of undergraduate and gra duate title iv recipients carries median value of 556 roughly 56 of the maximum potential value of lifetime learning credit students attending 4year public and 4year private institutions are much more likely to be eligible for lifetime learning credit than are students attending other institutions however the median value of lifetime learning credit available to those attending 4year private institutions 907 is more than double the median value 411 of the credits available to those attending 4year public institutions who are much more likely to have qualified expenses below the maximum allowed under the credit federal

the distributi on of federal obligationfree assistance generally available federal obligationfree aid is disbursed in the form of grants and tax credits35 prior to the introduction of the hope and

ava ilable to these students is 10 in all other dependent and independent student income quintiles more than 80 of students are eligible to receive federal obligationfree aid and the median share of tuition and fees covered by such aid ranges from roughly 20 to more than 100 for dependent students grants are th dominant form of federal obligation free aid for those in the two lower income quintiles fairly even balance exists between available grant and tax credit assistance for those in the middle quintile 32812 50702 and tax credits are the dominant source of this kind of aid for those in the upper quintile s for independent students grants are the dominant source of this aid for each income quintile except the highest quintile earning 27661 and above for students in this

obligationfree aid prior to the introduction of tax credits the general prevailing philosophy in the federal student aid effort rooted in the basic tenets of the original hea of 1965 was to first awar d grants to cover the higher education costs of those with high levels of nee d and if necessary supplement grants with subsidized loans the aid approach for middleincome students centered on providing subsidized borrowing opportunities with the introduction of the hope nd lifetime learning credits two new sources of obligationfree aid became ava ilable that serve middle incomestudents this expansion of the role played by such aid within the federal student aid effort has sparked debate about how obligationfree ai d is currently targeted how the role of such aid has changed and about the role th is aid should play within the overarching federal aid effort the figures below have been produced to shed some light on how the targeting of obligationfree aid across income brackets has changed figures 18 to 23 illustrate the targeting of this ai d in 19951996 and 19992000 period immediately prior to the introduction of the tax credits and period shortly after the tax credits became available in 199836 the 19951996 data reflect the estimated distribution of pell and seog awards in the 19951996 academic year the 19992000 datahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31484crs29 37the

estimated hope and lifetime learning credit assistance made available37 shifts in the targeting of obligationfree aid displayed in figures 18 and 19 can be thought of as largely reflecting the effect s of the tax credits this is because few changes were enacted in federal grant ligibility requirements dur ing this time period shifts in the percent of tuition and fees covered by obligationfree aid depicted in figures 20 through 23 can be thought of as reflec ting both increases in pell awards and the introduction of tax assistance for those in lower income quintiles and as primarily reflecting the effects of tax credits for those in higher income quintiles the central themes emerging from the data presented in the figures below include the following when title iv recipients are examined by income quintile in academic years 19951996 and 19992000 it become s apparent that ta rgeting of federal obligationfree aid has changed drama tically students in the upper three income quintiles had far greater access to such aid in 19992000 than in 1995 1996 this trend is most strongly accentuated in the 4th and 5th income quintiles for dependent students the majority of dependent title iv recipients in these quintiles 84 and 54 respectively in 19992000 had access to federal obligationfree aid the incidence of title iv recipients having at least 10 of their tuition andfees covered by

687 and s 888why do the credits allot their benefits the way they do and how would proposed changes affect that allotment as shown by the preceding analyses of estimated distributions of the education tax credit benefits to poten tial students and aided underg raduates the credits are primarily available to middl eincome students alt hough under some circumstances they do reach down to lower income studen ts they are not available to the poorest students under any circumstances students maximize their benefits from the tax credits where tuition and fees are relatively high at such institutions this works to increase the amount of the benefit and exte nd the coverage of the benefit further down the income scale further across some income ranges students may receive grant aid such as pell grants as well as an education credit this may boost the aggregate amount of federal obligationfr ee aid that these students receive above what they would otherwise receive in the absence of the credits why do the credits allot their benefits in this manner as was discussed earlier the credits have several awar d rules that dictate eligibility and benefit amount these include the education costs that may be covered by the credits the grant aid offset the reimbursement rules with their caps on the maximum credit nonrefundability and phaseout rates it is useful to consider the award rule s to have an implicit order of application the order in which they are listed bove initially one mu st determine which postsecondary education expenses are eligible to be covere d by the credits if grant aid such as the pell grant fully offsets the covered costs there are eligible costs for which credit might be claimed where eligible costs exceed grant aid there are remaining costs to be covered by the credits at that juncture the reimbursement rules applied to those remaining costs dictate the potential maximum credit that can be claimed the nonrefundability rule determines what portion if any of that potential maximum credit can actually be claimed barring reduction due to the phaseout rates there is interest in the congress in changing the distribution of these education tax credit benefits and bills have been introduced that would modify some of these award rules38 each of these factors can exert some influence on who can claim credit and how much they claim but each is not likely to have an equal effect on different groups of potential cl aimants changes to certa in of the award rules are likely to benefit middleincome and higher income students changes to others hold out the promise of making the tax credit benefits available to more lowincomehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31484crs34 39of the award rules delineated above changes to the grant aid offset appear to be the most problematic from policy perspective given that such changes could raise the possibility of student receiving grant aid and tax benefit for the same postsecondary education expenditures as consequence although we identify where this award rule might affect students tax credit we do not si mulate its modification or removalstudents including the poorest students39 perhaps one of the most important features of the award rules for any consideration of changes in the distribution of the tax benefits is that they can interact this is inherent in the order of application just described the interaction among multiple award rules may particularly affect the benefits for lowincome students for t hose students especially in lower priced institutions changes to only one of the aw ard rules without conc urrent modification of others will not expand the benefits they may receive for upper middleincome and higher income students nonrefundability is not an issue since these students are likely to have sufficient tax liability to claim credit further the grant aid offset may be inc onsequential for the many who are unlikely to receive substantial amounts of grant aid expanding the credits to cover other costs such as room and board or books or indeed the entire cost of attendance while maintaining all other current rules would have an impact on such students only if they are attending relatively lowpriced institutions particularly community colleges for instance the average tuition and fees in the community college sector are not sufficiently high for the maximum hope credit to be claimed allowing the credits to cover all other expenses in addition to tuition and fees would boost the hope credit for such students to the maximum allowable raising the credit caps while making other changes would partic ularly benefit student s enrolled at 4year private institutions where as result of higher tuition and fee levels the caps limit the amount of tax benefit that can be cla imed for highincome students the phase out rates also directly limit benefits eg at agis above 100000 for those filing joint tax return benefit is available the primary limiting factor for middleincome students particularly those attending relatively high priced institutions appears to be the reimbursement rules and their caps as with higher income students expanding coverage of the credits beyond tuition and fees while maintaining the current reimbursement rules will do little to increase the tax benef its nonrefundability and the grant aid offset may affect some students at the lower end of this income group possibly more so than for any other income group lowincome students eligibility for the credits and the level of benefit they may claim are primarily function of an interaction among all of these award rules save for the phaseout rates this appears to be particularly true at lower priced institutions this interaction is explored more fully below interplay of coverage of co sts and nonrefunda bility for low income students in an effort to illustrate the complex interaction of the award rules for low income students and in particular the lowest income students the impact of thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31484crs35 40wolanin thomas r rhetoric and reality effects and consequences of the hope scholarship the institution for higher education policy working paper april 2001 41as noted above the precise interplay of the award rules will differ from case to case the single independent student at community colle ge was chosen for this analysis because this type of student at this institution appears to realize less hope credit benefit than other students considered in this report as result expanding tax credit assistance to such student may be an important objective for efforts to modify the education credits these figures have an expanded yaxis 0 to 5500 compared to earlier figures 0 to 4000 to accommodate the increased aggregate level of assistance that may be realizedinterplay of two rules nonr efundability and coverage of costs on the size of the hope credits at the community college level is explored here at these institutions which charge relatively low tuition third rule the grant aid offset works in tandem with the cost coverage rule to limit benefits this analysis provides context for considering whether and how the credits might be modified to extend the hope credit further down the income range possibly responding to concerns raised by some analysts that the hope credit will have limited impact on access becau it does not benefit the fa milies for whom financial barriers are the primary impediment to postsecondary enrollment40 the changes addressed here are intended primarily to extend to the lowest income students at the community college level the tax benefits received by their higher income colleagues not to increase significan tly the size of the benefits across the full income spectrum the importance of the order in which the award rules are applied for low income students at relatively lowpriced sc hools is that one change appears to be sufficient to extend the tax credit benefits down to the lowest income student given that at lowincome levels students and their families are unlikely to have much if any tax liability attention is often likely to be fo cused on nonrefundability as the barrier to receipt of tax credit benefits but as shown below that is not the case where the covered costs are relatively low the following figures based on the case simulation model show how two award rules the coverage of cost rule and nonr efundability rule aff ect the size of the hope credit independently and together for the single independent student considered earlier enrolled at community college41 the first figure below depicts the distribution under current law nonrefunda ble hope credit with the current cost coverage rule the next figures show respectively the impact of expanding the coverage of costs to the full cost of attendance while maintaining all other award rules making the credit refundable onl or making both of these

levels where there is tax liability alternatively making the credit ref undable while leaving the current cost coverage rule in effect s barely perceptible impact on the distribution of aidhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31484crs38 42the pattern in the distribution of benefits simu lated in these figures is similar to what the distribution of benefits would be for this type of student at 4year public institution at the average tuition and fees and costs of attendance at that kind of institution in contrast at 4year private college with substantially higher tuition and fee charges making the hope credit refundable with simultaneous change in the cost coverage rule would extend the tax credit benefit down to the lowest income studentbecause for the lowest income student the pell grant amount more than covers tuition and fee charges figure 26 the cost coverage rule coupled with the grant aid offset is curbing the amount of re maining tuition and fees for the credit to reimburse only when refundable hope credit is available and eligible costs are expanded to the full cost of attendance can the absolute maximum hope credit of 1500 be claimed throughout the agi range from 0 to 40000 figure 27 this combination of changes extends the hope credit all the way down the income spectrum to the lowestincome student and so slightly boosts the credit that higher income students are eligible to claim42 finally we would note that expanding federal aid to lowincome students to address access needs might be accomplishe d alternatively through changes to federal grant aid programs pa rticularly the pell grant program an exploration of such changes is beyond the scope of th is report but they would include such modifications as an increase in the minimum pell grant which would more fully focus pell grant funding on the poorest students by reducing higher income students eligibility for grantshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31484crs39 conclusions the hope and lifetime learning cred its are now major components of the federal effort to promote access to postsecondary education several significant findings emerge from the preceding analysis of the potential distribution of these tax benefits to outofschool young adults and to federally aided undergraduates the hope credit provides s ubstantial benefit to recipients and spreads these benefits relatively broadly by design the credit targets the bulk of its benefits to middle and upper middleincome students but it also reaches down the income scale and provides assistance to some low income students as result the hope credit overlaps with the other major source of federal obligationfree aid the pell grants in contrast the lifetime learning credit provides relatively little benefit even to the populations on which it is targeted w ith many of the same award rules as the hope credit it directs most of its be nefits to middle and upper middleincome students but given the lifetime learning credits reimbursement rule 20 of qualified expenses with 1000 benefit cap it is worth significantly less than the hope credit its reimbursement rule also means that student maximizes his or her lifetime learning credit by attending higher priced institutions the advent and growth of the hope and lifetime learning credits have dramatically shifted the focus of fe deral obligationfree aid for postsecondary education attendance previously such fe deral aid was principally needbased aid targeted to the lowest income students the education tax credits provide their benefits without regard to the traditional federal need an alysis system and financial aid packaging procedures on college cam puses as consequence federal obligationfree aid is now available not only to lowincome students but to the broad expanse of middle nd upper middleincome students efforts to change the targeting of the tax credits and their interaction with traditional federal student aid are complicated by the interaction of the various award rules of these financial res ources single changes to th award rules may benefit only some income groups and not others in par ticular expansion of these tax benefits to the lowest income students attending lower priced institutions appears to depend upon making changes to multiple award ruleshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31484crs40 technical appendix this appendix briefly descri bes some of the important technical features of the estimation models used in this analysis case simulation model the case simulation model used for the analysis of the potential distribution of tax benefits to the outofschool population consists of two models pell grant estimation model and federal income tax model pell grant estimation model for each case being simulated the pell grant estimation model calculated the appropriate efc and applied the pell grant award rules to determine the size of the pell grant for that case at any particular level of agi certain assumptions were made to facilitate the analysis as noted earlier it was assumed that the rule determining the size of the pell grant for every case was maximum appropriated pell grant minus efc further it was assumed for each case that assets did not exceed the appropriate assetrelated allowances specified for the efc calculation therefore contributi on was expected from assets for any case considered here assumpti ons about family size are lineated earlier in the text the efc allowances assessment rates nd other factors used in the pell grant estimation model applied to award year 20012002 when the ma ximum appropriated pell grant was 3750 for that award ear the efc calculation was based on 2000 calendar year income the agi levels cons idered by the federal income tax model were for 2001 as were the levels depicted in the various figures in this report for the outofschool population as result the agi levels used for the efc calculations were deflated from the 2001 levels using the change in the annual average cpiu from 2000 to 2001 of 28 federal income tax model the federal income tax model utilized for this analysis applied 2001 income tax rules to the cases being simulated maintaining all of the relevant characteristics utilized in estimating the pell grant further based on the estimated tax liability for each case the model determined th level of the hope or lifetime learning credits to facilitate these estima tes it was assumed that none of the cases simulated here claimed the foreign tax credit the credit for child and dependent care or the credit for car of the elderly or the disabled the income tax model calculated the education tax credit using the appropriate qualified tuition and fee expenses for that calculation it was necessary to make the analysis specific to partic ular academic year to that end it was assumed that the student paid for his or her 20012002 pos tsecondary education entirely during calendar year 2001 as consequence the estimated pell grant which is also for 20012002 can be used in the application of the grant aid offset rule for the education tax creditshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31484crs41 survey data model methodology the estimated hope and lifetime learning credits available to 19992000 title iv aid recipients shown in this report have b een generated though npsasbased tax credit estimation model this model utilizes comprehensive background information on title iv recipien ts which is available in npsas eg information on their tax liability adjusted gross income tuition and fee levels enrollment and attendance status and simulates tax credit benefits available to such students the estimates generated through this model are based on some assumptions the primary operating assumptions built into this hope and lifetime learning credit estimation model are discussed below time period assumptions reconc iling differences in benefit year and academic year the model assumes that the tax credits claimed in the 1999 calendar year tax will be cl aimed against tuition and fee expenses for the entire 1999 2000 academic year this is allowable under the benefit as long as payments are made in calender year 1999 ie we are assuming tuition for courses beginning in january is paid in december the credits are thus treat ed as aid received for academic year 19992000 tuition expenses and analyzed in relation to the rest of the aid package received in the 1999 2000 academic year the credits are also anal yzed in relation to tuition and fees paid in the 19992000 academic year assumptions related to tax liability information on tax liability used in the model is taken from the 1998 return as reported by the stude nt or parent on the free application for federal student aid fafsa for 19992000 these tax liability data have been in flation adjusted to 1999 dollars and then treated as 1999 tax liability figures in the model additionally an adjustment was made to address discrepancy in the tax liability figure provided on fafsa and the tax liability figure needed to calculate tax credits basically the figure provided on fafsa can appropriately be thought of as final tax liability figure ie total tax liability after the value of all tax credits even hope and lifetime learning credits have been subtracted whereas the tax liability figure needed to determine whether one has sufficient tax liability for hope and lifetime calculations is an almost final tax lia bility figure produced after some but not all tax credits are subtracted from ones available tax liability the effect of using the final as opposed to lmost final tax liability information in an estimation model could be to understate the value of the benefit some students are eligible to receive ie those student s with limited tax liability for the credit to offset for those cases deemed through analyses to be adversely affected by the missing informat ion tax liability values have b een restored using informationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31484crs42 43to address this we have added the fafsa worksheet b values to the fafsa tax liability figures fafsa worksheet b contains th aggregate value of education hope and lifetime credits claimed during the 1998 tax year by the tax filer and this adjustment is done to restore the tax liability levels against which the filer claimed 1998 education credits the median amount added through this adjustment was 1022 it should be noted though that workshee t b values reported on fafsa reflect more than just education credit values they also reflect child support payments being made for child living outside of ones household taxable earnings from federal work study or other needbased workstudy programs amer icorps awards and grant aid in excess of tuition and fees composite number reflecting all of these values is reported on fafsa because we add this composite value to rest ore tax liability values it can be assumed that we have inflated actual liability levels for some parents and students in such instances we may exaggerate the tax credit benefit available we took care in restoring values only for those with sufficient inco mes to qualify for creditsavailable elsewhere in the fafsa these adjustments have affected the estimated tax credit values of 32 of the population studied43 assumptions related to number of higher education credits claimed it is possible that family with more than one postsecondary student may claim more than one higher education tax credit if their tax liability is sufficient to capture at least some of the value of one credit but not sufficient to enable the filer to capture the value of multiple credits ssentially the value of each credit to the taxpayer is reduced we estimate that roughly 2 of the population studied are at risk of having some of the value of their credit reduced by the presence of another crediteligible family member tax credit estimates presented in this report make adjustments for this possible occurrence assumptions relate d to dependency in this model we assume that individuals who are independe nt for student aid purposes are independent tax filers and those who are dependent for student ai d purposes are treated as dependents for another filers presumably parents ta x form we have actual information about how closely tax filing dependency status mirrors st udent aid filing dependency status thus we cannot estimate the exte nt to which this assumption detracts from the precision of our modeling the likely effects of having made in accurate assumptions about the tax status of some dependent students is that we have probably overestimated their tax credit eligibility by relying on their parents tax liability in our estimates as opposed to the students tax liability the effect of having made inaccu rate assumptions about the tax status of some independe nt students is that we have probably underestimated their tax credit eligibility by relying on their own tax liability in our estimates as opposed to their parents tax liability
