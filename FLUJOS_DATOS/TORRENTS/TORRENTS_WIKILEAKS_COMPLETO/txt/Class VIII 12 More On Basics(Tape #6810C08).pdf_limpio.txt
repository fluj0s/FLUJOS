6810c08 class viii tape 12 more on basics the assessments supposed to catch little bit of doubt on it because you couldnt quite read what he thought about it and the other one was cs which was for the birds which wasnt actually germane to the auditing session and so it may be brutal it may be horrible but you are moving right up the line with greater speed than i have ever seen group move up before so i thank you thank you now you will find that when an individual has been trained and trained and trained and trained by various instructors instructors not supervisors but he has been instructed in academies and on the class vi course and accs or any other kind of course hes had hes had cycle that he goes through he begins he looks at his basics and he says yeah thats right ok ill do it and then somebody comes along and says well that isnt quite right and he gives him something else and steers him sideways and so he doesnt quite know whether that was right or not but he goes on and does it and he sort of gets away with it and hes not sure and then he goes along little bit further and he runs into contradictory datum or datum that somebody else says is contradictory ill give you an example somebody all of sudden said all the laws of assessment really apply to the laws of listing and nulling and at that moment why every auditor has had it and then somebody came along and said well assessment thats old hat we dont do that anymore you want to watch this we dont do that anymore and so this noosed up the laws of listing and nulling and then somebody says well the tape on that is lost or something we dont have that today but you just do it like an assessment and then its ssss it doesnt come out right and an auditor wonders what is going on but he somehow or other perseveres and he again doubts his own grip on basics so when we get to the level of class viii and we handle this and class viii is probably simpler course than an academy course probably simpler the data which is delivered including cs now is so straightforward and so simple that its almost unbelievable its incredible that somebody wouldnt have picked up this data along the track to begin with because it was all there actually this current activity is being taught against great deal of in tech out tech activities but we cant suppose that just because class viii has moved into view that in tech out tech contradictory tech you were not quite right even when you did standard tech will disappear forever from the planet but let assure you that as the organization gets bigger and it does consistently and continuously that you will get more and more areas and the very multiplicity of it the numbers of areas which exist give you that many more opportunities for things to go wrong and i have noticed consistently consistently that we seem to run the same time track the same things happen an org starts up in keokuk and there is town called keokuk i hope some day there is an org there and if there is why im sorry because it simply up to date has been used as hypothetical area an imaginary area anyway this org starts up in keokuk and its going to probably go through the same convulsions of the dianetic foundation go through the same errors of the fifties go through the same difficulties of the sixties probably get in fire fights with the local council you know this itll have undoubtedly somewhat similar time track to the subject as whole except it will have it in small bit youll get somebody an auditor went to keokuk and started up something audited quite few pcs and moved out and left them flat on their faces never finished up tour got to keokuk and it picked up the cases that were there but it generated some more interest and then some more pcs were audited and some of those fell on their faces but there was org there to really take care of it finally somebody puts franchise center into the area it goes squirrely somebody comes in and begins to give colonics at the same time their giving intensives and it folds up and then finally why good steady franchise man gets in there it builds up to an organizational status it begins to hold on it starts taking responsibility for the cases in the area but this is this planet and this is the planet teegeack and this planet had very sorry history and to get anything started at all on the planet is quite miraculous quite miraculous its great tribute to the tenacity and sticktoivity and carry forwardness of scientologists thats its going forward and it is right now theres some little tiny pipsqueak two bit town right at this moment that is trying to pass local ordinance or something against scientology saying it is so evil it is causing fantastic quantities of distress and the birds who are trying to pass the law of course kill four or five patients week in the local sanitarium by various methods of butchery and nobody pays any attention to that so the planet gives you many contradictions its an incredible its an incredible scene where you find the cowboy in the black hat is in charge and where the bishop has nothing but choir boys in mind and he is looked up to as pillar of the community and they wonder why they seem to be eaten all the time by termites theyre certainly carving into that pillar but he is his own termite man and these things happen you see we wouldnt be at work at all if the planet were in perfect condition now the hard way to start out straighten up of the old galactic confederation would be to start it on the planet teegeack and the people who went through that one could start it up anyplace because this was the one which was hit the hardest this was the place where they were brought so to get it going here is fantastic and that however doesnt excuse us for tolerating less than perfection of pushing forward of keeping it going and so on its lot of work and the vagaries and wobbles of auditors and the public and that sort of thing dont think theyre going to stop wobbling it wouldnt matter if we were in charge of the whole planet youd still find file clerk or mr bonkers someplace or another would have started up an i will arise which has as its sole goal slaughter of scientologists or something you know i mean its that kind of planet alright so it is tribute to scientologists that they carry on and they do get their job done but along the line of training you get into you get into areas where people are leaning on this training theyre reevaluating it theyre doing this with it theyre doing that with it and when you get to level eight when you get to level eight its instead of falling on your head and feeling that you are now guilty for practice of out tech from here there and every place you probably are making progress on the realization that you had your basics in the first place and that those basics were the basics and that they were right there and available and you now probably because youve been through it all probably couldnt be improperly trained against the results and precision which you are learning at class viii i can imagine one of you right this minute somebody rushes in and he says oh well we dont do that anymore i can imagine the lip curl he would get in response hed probably get examined very carefully but you see that subject goes as far as it works and it has been necessary to develop the technology to develop it along certain research line and to make sure that it worked here there and every place amongst the hottentots and the mohicans amongst the park avenue and mayfair as well as down along the london docks and it had to work and it had to work on each all and every and that meant that you had to have nothing but the common denominators so but there is this difference there are the common denominators to all persons and then there are lot of peculiarities that each person has which are peculiarly his the cs pays attention to the peculiarities the more attention he pays to peculiarities the less success hes going to have its q and its q and with difference the road out is one road the oddities that happen in cases are very often fascinating theres many good laugh along the line thats for sure we get laughs along technical examiner lines we got one the other day that just marvelous the pc the pc walked up to the examiner and says i feel great and the examiners report is i feel great rs laughs magnificent whole model must be contained in just that one little sheet and so you will find that what is out and what is being shoved out of line are basics theyre just basic things now theres certain basic data which have arisen since the beginning of the research line of course naturally because the search was for the common denominator of all cases this was pretty well wrapped up in 1966 and became very standardized about that time but the standardization of it wasnt too possible to one and all because there were certain people who insisted on being contradictive they you know he wrote that wrong well waaaa and they were either operating out of their own banks or against some unfortunate win there is this thing you know about the unfortunate win the auditor goes in and he takes look at the pc and he says whats the trouble with this pc he thinks he has head and hes so fixed on the idea that he has head so im going to run do you have head do you have head do you have head and this one case out of thousand this guy all of sudden goes feel touch mmmm my god i have head my god im in head wows and he blows off and becomes exterior now this poor auditor this poor auditor will go through years trying to find another person on whom that process works now unfortunately it is trait that he will do more selling than he will do research and applying and he will start selling the idea that this was great process that it is great process that it ought to be done that all other processes are wrong weve been through all of this in the fifties and it simply worked on one two three people and it didnt work on anybody else now there is such thing as some processes being so pistol hot that theyre hardly trustworthy r212 is one of these things you can overrun r212 with just while youre turning over the bulletin its its one of those things and people insist that it seems to produce great deal of result for very long period of time so we have somebody who ran r212 fifteen hundred hours oh wow and it did it practically ran him into the ground he actually probably went release on it in the first three or four minutes of auditing and that was practically that dont you see but the auditor who was green would be adjusting his emeter in those few minutes he would be trying to settle into the session so r212 becomes dangerous in the hands of relatively untrained auditor it becomes dangerous because he hasnt really got his session going yet and he hasnt got himself tuned in and the meter down and he hasnt got his paper you know and hes still sort of looking at the pc and hes still trying to straighten this out and the damn thing has gone release hes setting down and you you know settling down for long haul and it all happened already only he didnt notice it it was too quick do you follow now that is one of the dangers youre going to run into with class viii techniques trying to get somebody to do them now whats out with the individual is his basics it isnt any airyfairy nonsense any time you hear of this course being taught on the basis of it is all very airyfairy and you have to be in wawawawa cause it is old and really the basic theory that this is sort of feel you see class viii auditing is really an art it really takes certain type personality any any any variety of this why give the guy the bird would you please because what is inevitably and invariably out is basics now basics can go out on long trained auditor by being misunderstood or being contradicted and when he comes back to his basic data and looks at it again now he has choice but to get off his misunderstoods and the contradictions and he gets his data back now there are few data that he wont have heard of perhaps and the subject is an advancing subject and sometimes you have little breakthrough of some kind or another but that would inevitably just be put in bulletin form you discover all of sudden that the thereve been couple of them while ive been teaching this course discovery of the actual liabilities of one hand electrode and its liability because lot of solo auditors have thought oh my god my ta is out of sight i dont know what is wrong with my case and then they get into some weird one because they go down into session in reviews you see and review says your ta is 225 and they say what well i dont know something must have happened between here and there i wonder what that was their ta was 225 all the time now if the one hand electrode was constant you could throw the trim check knob of the emeter over so that the one hand electrode would read what the two hand electrode should read but unfortunately there werent any meters built at this time which you could trim check to that degree they dont trim check one and one half division of ta thats too wide trim check but there are solutions to this sort of thing you can even do it with one hand electrode providing you had two electrodes standing by and whenever you take your your ta grab the two cans and plug them in to find out what the one hand electrode is telling you wrong but the trouble with the one hand electrode is it usually misses float you see it isnt sweat that activates an emeter it isnt sweat that activates one its current and it is actually being activated by thetan and the thetan is not in ones palm so all youre doing is getting distant reaction from the thetan himself and its liable to miss and the number of floats which you get on one hand electrode and in fact i dont think ive ever seen one not real wide float and yet you swap over to two electrodes my god youre sitting there looking at dial wide float so something like this can come up or bug like this can show up but its usually mechanical bug now that right at this moment is in the process of solution as to what type of electrode is then usable and there are three or four of them been suggested and we well strap it up so this now that it was very big bug but it never really came forward as blocking the line the other thing is im teaching this course against the development of 7 and 8 7 is all done ot 7 is all finished it hasnt been written up at the time im giving these lectures there is nothing peculiar and i might as well make remark on this theres nothing peculiar in either 7 or 8 that violates standard auditing nothing in either one of them violates standard auditing not thing its the very standard tech youre using right this moment carries you right straight through 7 and 8 theres the difference being the targets of the auditing shift but theyre handled handled exactly the same way that you handle any other grade or level do you follow theres difference its just what different basic what different combination what different thing are you looking for its that easy you do perhaps another little assessment sheet do you see and then you get that and you run that the same processes same everything its different its different target area then you also get to more and more deal with the being and you are i will give you this word of caution it already exists in bulletin and it should be in your pack as an individual comes up the line he has more and more effect on meter so the further he comes up the line the more likely you are to get read on anything he says or anything he thinks so that you ask him do you have ptp and you get long read and then he says you say that reads he says i wa thats why you have to know false read because what he thought was i dont think so and that fact that he thought this thought of course act hes an electric eel you see anything he thinks causes an impulse and that is why particularly auditing people who are on the upper levels you have to know this definition of read and its precise definition read is what the meter says what it applies to must be established it may be reading on the auditors question which it usually fortunately is or it may be reading simply on reaction to the question which gets you into trouble rather consistently or it is some other influence has entered in to the scene so when meter reads you have to find out what read and if anything even faintly seems to be out about it then you have to find out what it is not to actually identify what the exact read is but you say to the fellow its very simple you say to the fellow do you have present time problem fall you say alright what was that its cautious question see oh he said did that read and you say yes that was read well i dont know i cant think of any read well were you thinking something about the question well yes bong your auditing an electric eel see he he can punch reads into this meter and the higher up the line he goes why the more obvious this becomes you dont have this trouble with wogs you dont have this trouble with grade fours you seldom get it on power you begin to get it in the area of r6ew and you sure as hell get it in the field of clears so you longer can take meter for granted you ask if theres ptp you get read you can even say do you have one he says i dont think i do you say good has anything been suppressed and you get another read and he says yeah well i dont think i have present time problem you see the same read you say good why bug him why bug him to death its obvious that hes reading on i dont have present time problem because every time he says this it reads the same way so there is the thing of establishing what is meter pattern of read now youre getting into pretty skilled area did you it consists of knowing the read you just got knowing what read you just got and then comparing the next read to it were straining at it here because it isnt really this important its just one of those things that goes by for instance an invalidate will get the same read as the item would get suppress will get the same read as an item that is suppressed youll say has anything been suppressed on this item see on this item has anything been suppressed and youll get read now if you the guy said yeah so and so now if you say the item youll get exactly the same read that you got when you said suppressed its almost curiosa itll be the same length and the same characteristic of read this is not very usable in things but its just that all the auditor knows is that the meter read and i impress upon you that youre not going to have this problem in academies you get it with can fiddles but anybody can see can fiddle youre not going to get this problem down in humanoid levels as you move on up the line your guy your pc that youre auditing in review you have to then have some idea of what grade or section of pc you are auditing and you expect this thing to really fly now you can get person who is in the upper sections in less trouble than you can get person who is in the lower grades person who is in the lower grades has to be if anything more precisely and delicately audited hes in more delicate condition but then the meter work is very is much more precise also so you fly the ruds good do you have present time problem see do you have present time problem woah yooo well youre very quick on the draw you know your metering very well and its do you have woah it read see it didnt give an instant end of the line read do you have present time woom good alright youre auditing somebody clear or above if he immediately tells you he has present time problem why good that was read on present time problem but if he starts saying well let see uhhh you say alright was that false read or what did that read on oh what did that read on as matter of fact i was watching that fly over on the window that cleans the read you say do you have present time problem its now null do you get the idea so that its just that little more complex youre auditing somebody more at cause and you can make somebody very unhappy if you start calling bunch of reads that didnt occur have you got it you must not vary on that and but this liability starts to occur from clear up particularly so i make that point now those are niceties of auditing theyre niceties the probability is youd work it out anyhow but youve got basic the basic datum on meter is is that the auditor knows the meter read the probability is that it read on his question the probability is that it read on his question you dont pay any attention to any oddity unless an oddity occurred now whats an oddity an oddity is hmm present time problem hmm and you say well what are you thinking about when i ask you the question very smooth way to approach it oh oh yes i think christ i wish wed get on with it yes you ask somebody do you have present time problem and you get this read and with it comes oh that again now well drilled auditor just flies right into the right into the old slot and he says anybody ever said that you had problem when you didnt have oh yes yes yes its wow wow wow itsa itsa itsa itsa itsa anybody else ever said that or has anybody ever said that to you before you get another read anything earlier oh yeah wow wow wow wow itsa itsa itsa itsa itsa itsa itsa see alright anybody else ever said you had problem when you didnt wow see alright anything earlier earlier similar incident similar time similar time oh yeah well hell its my mother aw its my mother shes always telling why do you have you have so many problems i didnt have any problems foom fn gis well very skilled auditor whos very well trained he goes into this drill just as zzzzzt see very smooth now if he had lot of patter this is the way itd sound do you have present time problem that reads pc i i dont i dont i dont i dont think i do have present time problem good is that false read good that was false read do you have present time problem that reads you get the idea you could get lot of stupid patter out of this so thats why some times when guys ask for patter you know i get little bit cross i say what the hells the matter with your own patter you can talk english the only time i get cross with somebody on patter is when he cant distinguish process from patter so he starts asking processing questions he isnt trying to clarify read or run anything similar he asks some dumb question which is process well was there anything incomplete about that present time problem oh oh now whats he done the pc inevitably is now going to come up with an arc break which is probably session arc break but in actual sober fact incomplete is one of the species of arc breaks an incomplete action brings about an arc break so he introduces this stupid question he should have said is there an earlier similar problem instead of that he says well is there hes trying to solve this problem the pcs on this problem and it isnt surrendering i dont know what he thinks hes running see is he running grade process or something and oh hes gotta solve this problem you know the pcs saying oh i yes i had this horrible problem i have this horrible problem nobody will give any candy sticks you know and so on and its terrible theyve done in and etcetera and so on and yup rok rok rok rok well instead of doing what he supposed to do is there an earlier similar incident see thats your itsa line he says is there anything incomplete about that problem oh my gods he instantly is into the zones and areas of liability immediately hes trying to run process second he tries to run process god knows where hell shoot the pc all over the track if he asks this question like is there anything incomplete about the problem he really doesnt understand that chain of incidents doesnt tear up until you approach its basic that principle he doesnt understand he doesnt understand the mechanics of erasure what are the mechanics of erasure he doesnt dig em so he asks some weird question you got it so that the lack of basic understanding brings him around into squirrely action which then gets him into mess he thinks its terribly important problem this kids standing there the kid is crying the kid has got present time problem so his i dont know his helpfulness or his something or other see just flips his control and he comes out with something stupid like was there any time anybody almost never gave you any candy well that he says lets see im supposed to find an earlier incident yeah that would be earlier yeah has candy been delivered to you incompletely think of problem of comparable candy i know im supposed to do something here christ let see what is it you get the idea he whats his basic there are only few of these its the mechanics of the chain its one of the wildest discoveries anybody ever made but you have to on resistive incidents you have to approach the basic on the chain in order to blow the chain its wild discovery man its first time counts now it works even that way in an engram you get the earliest point of the engram and the rest rolls up like tent very often what you think is resistive engram is simply because you didnt get to the beginning of the engram but itll blow up if you get the earlier on the chain so you can make the mistake but it is mistake he didnt get to the beginning of the incident do you see you try to run secondary there the guy is at the moment they burned down the house or whatever it is see and you try to run this and you try to run this and you try to run this and you try to run this and it apparently was erasable but it just kind of stuck up and its difficult to run now an auditor who doesnt know that its the earliest see he hasnt got this datum bang right there at his fingertips as senior datum its the earliest its the earlier its the earliest see works that way on secondary the earlier point in time the earlier incident he doesnt know that see so he just lets the pc grind his guts out youre trying to erase this thing yes well tell again well i went up and they were burning down the house and god let see i felt very griefy lets see i feel very griefy i felt i dont know uh um its getting very confused i dont know whether im there or here wohamjm and the auditor just sits there like bump on the log he doesnt either ask for an earlier part of the incident or ask for anything earlier on the chain well what the basic is out there is he doesnt realize why things erase and if an auditor and particularly class vii doesnt know the mechanics of erasure hes had it now he has to know the difference between release and an erasure now how is it youre actually scolded scolded scolded for going past fns you can get shot for going past an fn and then all of sudden you get process it is recall bumbershoots it goes to fn run an engram on bumbershoots oh you went past an fn on bumbershoots right now anybody whod be confused about that is gonna be confused about hell of lot of things we released bumbershoots so that we could take some charge off of bumbershoots because he couldnt get near bumbershoots unless we took charge off of bumbershoots so we disconnect bumbershoots he floats free oh great what was he running locks locks locks locks locks he discharges the locks dont you see now this is less charge in the incident on bumbershoots so bum bum bum plunge fn great three cheers youd be very mystified if you didnt know about this cause four days later hes all worried about bumbershoots youd say i released him on bumbershoots four days ago and here he is coming here and telling all about bumbershoots you get awfully mystified and you could say well gee this auditing i guess doesnt work or something it it it i did all this recall of bumbershoots and god damn here he is in here again yip yap yak yak about bumbershoots huh so you say well alright the process wasnt flat i get it it was an arc broke needle good well run it again recall bumbershoots recall bumbershoots recall bumbershoots ta starts up recall bumbershoots ta higher bumbershoots recall bumbershoots tas higher higher recall bumbershoots ta 425 now his next basic is out he doesnt know that overrun causes high ta he thinks high tas are caused by toe nails growing too fast or something so he doesnt knock it off he isnt immediately signalled overrun bong ta starts up zoooooom has this process been overrun yes it has booooom fn you get what i mean by knowing basic now thats big basic what is it that causes rising ta its terrific discovery you might at least have the courtesy to remember it and yet in two cases in just the last few days the auditor has just sat there as nice as you please and run the ta right up through the roof and it just never occurred to him for minute one auditor took cs he took cs he rehabbed sec checks and rehabbed all drugs and then for reasons best know to the man or beast didnt audit the pc again for two days picked up the cs didnt himself remember he had done it didnt review his former session didnt turn the folder into cs it didnt happen in this group and ran it all over again rehab sec checks and rehab drugs and the ta started up wooooo and he just kept at it he just kept at it man that sessions about half an inch thick he just kept at it he just kept at it trying to rehab the same thing trying to do the same thing and watching the ta go right up up up up up up up up up and didnt do damn thing about it didnt even occur to him oooh i finally belatedly got the folder and i blew my stack cause i couldnt find out what the hell i couldnt find out why is the ta going up on rehab and then i found the earlier session and then i managed to read through the squiggle squiggle writing and i managed to find out oh my god he did the same cs twice so he overran rehab of overruns oh and never for one split second woke up to the fact that he was overrunning something well where the hell were his basics damned important basic ta goes up because of overrun there is other reason ive seen somebody on power going by this datum which was extant at one time or another that they had to ask one command at least the thing blew up on just clearing the subject of prpr4 bong the meter blew up fn gis so forth and the auditor asked one command that is he started to clear the command not only cleared the command but he ran it for an hour and half and the ta was going up and up and up and up and up and he finally came to the conclusion about an hour later that there must be something wrong well the cs on it was elementary it was an unnecessary cs it was simply to tell the guy its been overrun and rehab it did it fwmp bong down it goes bang floating needle starts on 5 then theres trouble now what was missing there its grasp of data the datum being that high ta is caused by overrun now ill give you another one low ta and i wont use all the key buttons and association is caused by invalidation and low ta is inevitably and invariably caused by some species of invalidation that is not the button and that is not how you get about it but that is the close enough to it so as not to key everybody in in sight the guys been hit too hard hes been punched too hard and thats low ta and thats all low ta is and low ta isnt anything else i can show you session where guy was having rudiments put in and he runs arc breaks with three suppressives in row he was in somewhat suppressive area and as he clears the arc break the ta goes from 2 down to 17 and it fns at 2 again and on the next guy now hes fning at 2 now heres the next bird that hes taking up and he tries to he was taking this up on different process prep check you see and ta he gets onto the next suppressive and oooohhh ta down to 17 to cognite to fn at 2 with gis and then he gets on the next suppressive with another process and it goes aaahhh down to 17 and then he runs it out and pongo back up to 2 gis anybody who is running ta at 15 and getting an fn at 15 ought to have his little britches spanked because his auditing is suppressive in some fashion or another hes over whumping and running into the pc too hard all hed have to do to bring the thing up would just be to fish around is it subject that were trying to thats got you going or is it something that weve done in the session oh see he cant get it up the process hes running its trying to fn at 15 christ what do you do about this well it could be an arc broke needle it could be this it could be that the other thing its just something has run into him with truck thats all if you want to get the ta up why you could ask as crude question as what ran into you like truck what have you just been run into with you know or what did that guy bop you with or bop you with crude see you know your basic you know your basic see the tad come up whistle come up into normal range and then some sad sack who is just perpetually down low ta and feels sad about the whole thing all the time and he fns with bad indicators boy thats missed nomenclature if i ever heard one he fns with bad indicators thats horrible see you dont fn with bad indicators you go arc broke needle yeah but if you keep running the process that youre running the process itself is probably not solving what the guy should be run on or youve forced an item or process on him some action is being too forcefully done or hes being shoved into zone or area which doesnt have anything to do with his case dont you see and or he gets on some subject which makes him very sad indeed and then its not cleared up and the ta goes down youd get an fn at 15 now guy who is run this way gives very interesting aspect he now begins to believe after while that when an fn occurs he feels bad so therefore an fn is bad thing to have actually computes it out this way and the remedy of it is just to prep check floating needles of course you advise him of the fact that hes been low ta enough times to prep check floating needle and then all of sudden it reverts and something else happens but its standard remedy prep check floating needle so this this you can get anything out of the road by prep checking it if you dont know what else to do with it prep check it you dont want to run it on l1 forever you dont want to run l4a forever and after just so many green forms why youll have to rehab green forms someday and so youve got this situation here youve got this situation here that you have to handle something that you dont know how else to handle it prepcheck it prepcheck it fascinating you see well its the old old you say well thats not done anymore im sure that somebody has said within the last year or so before this lecture certainly im sure somebody has said we dont do that anymore about prepchecks in fact i ran into somebody the other day who didnt know what one was its the handiest jim dandiest little piece of stuff you ever had anything to do with if you dont know what the hell to do with it prepcheck it thats just the rule see now you can endlessly prep check theres two actions you can always do when you dont know what the hell else to do youve run into somebody whos weird off beat god help us nobody ever heard of it before some some auditor has audited this fellow in tub of hot water on the theory that the ta is too high when it is cold and therefore youre gonna run into all kinds of goofinesses dont you see and you say oh my god what do i do about this obviously to wrap pc around telegraph what are we going to do about this theres always something you can do about it you can prep check it on the incident of being run in the tub of water has anything been suppressed the other thing you can do you can always make up list and theres where your imagination can play around and the only rule about list is keep it dimly in the same subject area dont have list that has dental operations and roller skating on it dont write up disassociated list your items on the list must be associated and you get your clues for these lists by the way you dont have to pick them out of thin air you look back through folders and find the pcs comments about this that and the other thing and you all of sudden find out they always seem to have little nyik nyak nyak nyak nyak on the subject of of banks or something you all of sudden find this guy is clerk in bank and hes you look over this and you read some of the data out of the line and he seems to have ptps about being broke and so on and this guy just always seems to have this problem and as css you get tired of this problem theres something about he cant pay for anything and the reason he waaa you say to hell with this ill just give you wild example see when you write up list for assessment dont get the pc to list it because youre doing an s and d type thing and so forth the hell with that do an assessment and you you say to yourself banks banking bank managers bank bosses bank organizations money cash checks coin silver gold copper paper checks customers clients see and you make little list see thats as much as you want to embrace in the matter because all you have to do is get corner of it thats what you dont know about these lists see you only have to come in on the edge of the corner of it and the pcll take it the rest of the way and so you write this up as little list and you assess it perfectly bark bark bark bark bark bark bark bark and you get it down to that there it is its checks checks there it is alright and you just unwind that now order prep check on checks and the god damndest things happen you ever heard of you move in sideways on this thing dont you see actually it wasnt really checks its ledgers and hell eventually tell you that in the process without disputing checks actually hes been entering checks backwards into the ledgers so as to make them come out some other way and hes been balancing his books so that he wont get scolded not to not hes got this hellish withhold on money all the way up the line only you softened it up and youre getting rid of his withholds now the hard way to get withhold is have you ever shot your grandmother you know direct sec check question pow pow pow pow pow pow pow see pound pound pound easy way to get it is find the subject or area of the withhold and prep check it you get the withhold very nicely and smoothly thats just use use of an assessment list use of sec check this has infinite variability what are the basics then the basics is how do you dream up list how do you assess list and what do you use on the list now theres something else you could use on the same list but you wouldnt go past its fn by using this other thing too you do one thing or another see so youd say on l1 youd say on checks you know has withhold been missed you know you could run the l1 but i assure you that the case has to be in pretty good shape to run an l1 he has to be able to pinpoint things and on somebody whos muggyfuggy on something you are much better off prep checking it you got it it isnt its for lower level case its more generalized subject always requires prep check specific particular things the guy just went through saint hill something like that alright youve got particular little items that you can pick off do you follow lets get zone or area now saint hill doesnt go back several lifetimes you got it doesnt go back several lifetimes it just goes back for short period so therefore its l1 date but checks holy suffering christy lord knows where its gonna go do you see so the more generalized subject or the more generalized or lower grade the case also that isnt similar your prep checks best now you can add certain buttons to prepcheck eval inval now if you were to try to do joberg or pull missed withholds on somebody who had low ta i can assure you his tad go out the bottom because youre overwhelming him and you also would probably turn on an rs and then spend long time trying to pull this rs on some imagined crime an rs does mean crime or it can mean an invalidation it could mean one of two things also dangerously you can clean the rs off case and leave the crime sitting there and not now rsing there is two or three instances of this having actually occurred its very hard to find an actual live thief criminaltype crime dont you see you know somebody who actually took the loot and then you find out later he did take the loot and somebody had cleaned cleaned the rs off the case with invalidate but having cleaned the rs off the case with invalidate then the case this person went around and stole thousand where before theyd only stolen two hundred and the money is found on them both times so there wasnt much excuse you see you can clean it off with invalidate and find out it was crime too so somewhere on down the track to make an rs why there is some kind of crime it doesnt have to be against the subject or area that you think but nevertheless nevertheless if you start to heavily hammer somebody and heavily hammer somebody around you wouldnt be bit surprised if he had low ta now you as class viii should simply say low ta self invalidation low ta this case is being invalidated ta sank in the session pc was invalidated in the session got it ta was at 25 at he session beginning and sank to 12 shoot the auditor you dont need to know what anybody said you dont need to know thing session wound up at 12 what happened you see your basics your basics ta sinking is the guy being overwhumped see or left in the middle of an unfinished cycle of being overwhumded something like that dont you see which would also be an auditor crime but lets say they werent running anything very vital and they start out at the beginning of the session ta 225 you wind up the session ta 15 well you dont even have to think your cs on that you dont even have to think about it it is write it out prep check the last session give it to another auditor have the auditor retrained you dont even have to think boom the guy was either invalidated with bad trs or he was run halfway into something and not run through it the session is false report an arc break needle the idea of gis being in on it is preposterous the guy must have been at least propitiative this is the kind of grip youve got to have on data you see the needle going up see the ta going up needle goes up ta goes up needle goes up ta goes up needle goes up ta goes up did you ever notice that the needle goes up before the ta goes up in the opposite direction buuuup buuup buuuuup zuuup zuuun zuuup and the auditor keeps on doing this boy hang him he doesnt know this datum he wont believe it he thinks theres some other reason for it ta going up is overrun ta going down is invalidation got it make and break open and short simple succinct sweet there are differences there are variables to these things you can appear to have variable because you can run an incident which drives the ta down but the auditor would have had to have goofed like screaming crazy with his trs not to have let it run out and come back up to normal range so he had to find an incident where the ta was down where the ta would go down and then only partially handle this goof it up in some fashion or another and then falsify his report to leave the ta down see it had to be combination of things would happen but you say well alright because this excuse will be given to you oh i dont know yeah well yeah you see we were running an incident on his mother and whenever we mentioned his mother his ta goes down well that may be so would be response but why arent your trs adequate to run the incident all the way through instead of leaving it parked halfway through why didnt you ask for an earlier similar mother laughter in any event its hell of flunk end of session ta 185 pc laughing gis in its either false auditing report or the trs were madly out or the pcs anchor points were being pushed in two feet back of his head do you understand now when you get the next session you can do lot with the session you can put in the ruds in or during or before that session you can prepcheck that session you can do an l1 on that session you can do lot of things with it those are the principle things you would do just the ones i gave you and in the next session it will emerge what did happen you dont have to worry about what happened you just know something wild happened and now if youre interested if youre that interested in grooving in an auditor you can look at the next session which is run by another auditor and find out what the hell happened to that auditor and what should he have straightened out because he certainly needs something straightened out so that all nonstandard results are departures from basics all nonstandard results are the departures from basics and that is the moral of my little story now either the guy had his basics the auditor had his basics he studied his basics somebody moved in on him sideways contradicted the basic he found some other data and so forth now he at that moment got departure from standard results and that departure stemmed immediately from having been moved off his basics right so then all nonstandard results stem from contradiction or misunderstoods or messed up basics and it never never never stems from the individual not having been super airyfairy in the seventh gallery you see he really didnt have the talent for auditing you see his father was clergyman and his basic training was the challenge and that is why we have not been able to make an auditor out of him if i had academy d of t telling that i would take out little imaginary violin i carry in my pocket tuck it under my chin take the little bow and i would play the little song it may be so we do not know your story sounds so queer we hate like hell to doubt your word and finish it off yourself he isnt teaching his students basics he hasnt said to george aloicious gulch your tr 1 is just about the most stinking tr 1 i have ever seen and i want you to improve it hes told him you see the expression which you use is very important and when you are sitting down looking at the pc be very careful of your expression during tr 1 because the expression is very important that isnt whats important about tr 1 and tr 1 doesnt take anything in it about expression tr 1 says tr 1 doesnt it and thats all it says and thats all hes supposed to do and how he does it is his business you got the basic you got the basic of tr 1 you got the basic of tr 1 thats whats your supposed to do with tr 1 alright you can do tr1 or you cant do tr 1 period now somebody comes in sideways and says the color of your eyes have great deal to do i knew hypnotist one time that says i always handle my patients i bet they were too i always handle my patients on the basis of i say there is something you do not like about what is it can you imagine the fellows social approach going around in the neighborhood anybody he meets he looks at them shakes them by the hand and says there is something you dont like about what is it well you know sooner or later that might become tr 1 thats how far basic can go out do you see i one time the best trs i ever turned out in group of auditors was every time an auditor asked question about tr he was read the tr now that might have cut his comm and it might have arc broken him or it might have this or it might have that but you know they all wound up with terrific trs every time he said well now in tr 1 does one hold ones little pinky up or so forth and all the supervisor was permitted to do was to pick up the sheet of tr 1 and read it now he could also have said more delicately is there anything you dont understand about this bud something you dont dig about this what was it well yeah why do they have that date at the top you know something like that clear it up see but what is it he doesnt understand about it not clarifying evaluating on it do you understand its that level of simplicity the basic is out it isnt because this fellow doesnt know hundred and fifty thousand processes its because he hasnt got enough sense not to ask process when he should be letting the pc itsa the simplicity you are finding right at this line right at this time the simplicity is fantastic im sure that you are getting your hands on some of you still perhaps little nervous the finger shakes little bit the pencil i noticed quivers slightly on the page here and there but these are the things which have been out in this particular unit it isnt what would be out in another unit but theyd be things comparable to this these are the things which have been out there arent any airyfairy things your comprehension of this that and the other thing is great assessing you should have learned that in the academy youve got your cast iron nerves not knowing how to assess its em 24 of the emeter book it hasnt changed for years how to run an engram r3r wrapped up engram running for all time there hasnt been any shift of any kind in r3r engram running engram running by chains there hasnt been any shift in it change in it for years and years and years anybody whose been through dianetic course and has gotten himself piece of data that is cockeyed or upside down or somebody told him we dont do that anymore if somebody said we dont do that anymore he would fix it up so that you really couldnt shoot anybody up through ot8 thats for sure he would be stopped so guys got i dont know how the hell youd ever heal anybody how would you ever make anybody well if you couldnt run an engram by chains i dont know how you have alright so therefore i can tell you positively that not knowing this cold then this is whats happened youve cleaned up filches lumbosis on tuesday and hes had it back again on thursday and you have been damn puzzled well if you go on keying out this lumbosis its just key out lumbosis is just sitting there all youve done is shift his attention you have improved it to some degree it might never come back again it might come back again while hes walking to the examiner but all youve done with this lumbosis is to key it out so whats key out you have to know what that is any time you just key something out you pays your money and you takes your chance boy its liable to be back in the next minute its liable not to be back for hundred years but itll be back why because the basic impulse to manufacture the picture is still there and at the least whiff this guys gonna make the picture all over again because you havent hit it its something he wont confront he hasnt owned it he got rid of it and youre sort of parking dirty laundry over in the corner to be picked up some day and some day hes gonna run something and all the dirty laundry will disappear as he goes up through the ot chains see but nevertheless this guy comes in with lumbosis you say good who in your family had lumbosis well you see thats an interesting question who the hell did have it oh my god my uncle timothy do you remember time with your uncle timothy complaining about lumbosis yep oop what the hell my lumbosis disappeared you say good thats it but hold your breath boy if you were to say just one more sentence or send them to an examiner who is complete knuckleheaded idiot and the examiner knows the guys an idiot and he comes up and the examiner says to him how are you zilch how are you hows your lumbosis zilch god almighty jesus christ thats why youve got to shoot examiners who do anything but shell out piece of paper as matter of fact its probably the safest system is to have booth with nobody in it examiners can evaluate with look you know you again you know that sort of what the hell is wrong with you sort of look you know maybe the guys just got headache or something aaiuh guy says what the hell i must look like him you got it alright now thats very slippery straight wire wing bing wow wow technique that i just gave you there its as old as 1950 and it works like bomb on an awful lot of cases i have seen i have seen an entire scaled face completely scaled and scabbed go completely clean and clear in some two or three minutes its impossible yet it happens key out bong gone but when is it going to come back now we run engrams by chains rat tat tat ta bow ta boo bow dee actually if any guys chronically ill any engram chain you find or any really any secondary chain youll find on girl or something like that has got the illness on it you dont have to say lets see what engram chain would i find to find leg injury i think we had better run leg injury chain bull youre liable to get him into the wrong chain you just run the most available chain of engrams and of course he is stuck in the most available chain of engrams and if you know your basics the engram he is stuck in is the engram he is in which is the engram which is giving him the trouble hes having naturally so if you look any place for the engram than the available engram that hes in youre gonna run out something else and now hes got lumbosis and trumbosis and pneumonia into the bargain so its always the most available secondary the most available engram this guy has tough time in life youre gonna run secondaries this guy is angry lot of the time youre gonna run secondaries thats the most available thing but you just run the engram chain now he can walk up to the examiner what the hell happened he says it all disappeared it blew something pft it blew hey pain in my backs gone hey what do you know where the hells my arthritis yeah gone hey wowing see now he walks out to the examiner and the examiner says oh yeah joe had your lumbosis and so forth and he says hows yours and walks out now youve erased the impulse to make the chain of lumbosis by erasing the engram that the impulse was making and it aint never gonna come back more he can get sick from something else do you follow so i can tell you very definitely the pc whose mannerisms do not change has never had an engram chain run on him well his mannerisms come from the engram chain hes sitting in so i watch these pcs that always go ck ck ck and i see them four years later theyve been audited eighteen thousand hours in some place or another and they go ck ck ck and it made big mystery for i wondered what in the name of god is this all about and then i find out that people have been saying for some years oh engram by chains person who does that is sort of squirrely we dont do that anymore you get the difference between release release is hes not going to do it now its out but the basic guts of the thing is what you erase man and an erasure is an erasure somebody the other day in this unit obviously didnt know what the hell it is im talking about right now even though it was on an earlier lecture because he said after he erased the damndest series of engrams in the pc then he wrote on his report he sure looked keyed out oh thats pathetic you might not get the joke but if hed erased the engrams he couldnt be keyed out because there was nothing left to key out and theres nothing left to key in so why would you say he looked keyed out do you follow and of course the understanding of the mechanism of clearing and other such mechanisms must be very very poor the mechanism of clearing is simply that when youve erased the basic the guy realizes hes mocking it all up then he doesnt mock up any more of those things which he knew he was mocking up its horrible shock to him to find out little bit later that hes got some pieces of him parked over there that he didnt know and hed disowned and he didnt have anything to do with anymore he blows em awful fast but thats what you clean up as you go up from there now guy at clear he feels wonderful why does he key in hes still got body thetans hes still got this and that so you take it apart take it apart take it apart take it apart and just today in research i was punching around to find out exactly how you restore total recall on the total track and so forth which is one of the functions of 8 and found out how you did it on somebody who didnt know how to do it somebody who didnt have it what did you have for breakfast in 1325 bc whole track recall whole track recall the same reality level as you recall this lifetime well opened the door to that one anyway now the rest id like to tell you here is basics such as how to run an emeter people having emeter trouble what anybodys got nerve having emeter trouble not in this line of country but somebody must have moved it in sideways and invalidated metering pushed metering around got to worrying about metering whats metering this way and that way got to doing something wrong with meter and then didnt couldnt put it right again and there was some misunderstood about it something like that but of all things how to list and null that is killer absolute killer if you dont know that youd knock pc flatter n flounder if you dont know how to list and null exactly right its an exact precision drill you could make mistakes in assessments or from prepared list in prepchecks you can make all kinds of mistakes dont you ever dare make mistake in listing and nulling and therefore you dont often order them i look through few folders its pathetic s and d s and d s and d remedy b remedy b have an s and d an s and d and an s and d have w s and utype s and d ah bull its risky action and you only do it when youve really got it set up straight and right i was horrified the other day i had not i had ordered specifically itsa on the green form whole itsa on the green form only itsa similar itsa on the green form guy got to environment and did s and d he did remedy b rather he did an environmental remedy b if id wanted an environmental remedy b at that point i would have said so as cs pow and you know why i didnt say so it was because that damnea review folder was about half foot thick with them we didnt need any more lists on this case thank you so it was itsa earlier similar itsa i ought to give you drill some time its drill you can give somebody run this whole damn case with list 1 itsa similar itsa with subject run the whole case with list 1 itsa similar itsa earlier itsa with subject to fn this is an elementary drill thatd make citizen out of him now you want to know how to run green form how do you run green form how do you phrase the phrases of the preen form oh bull im not trying to make player piano out of you the green form contains whole lot of subject matter and you could do it all with itsa earlier similar itsa the whole green form your trs somebody had disturbed your trs one way or the other to point where you were contradicted and upset about them and so forth and how to really get in ruds that nobody had ever learned nor the consequences of auditing with ruds out and i find with horror that youve been doing solo auditing with your ruds out i dont know how the hell you ever made it and oddly enough what the mind consists of exactly what is in the mind what is this thing called the mind its such an elementary gimmick that not to understand it is something like explain to the sidewalk it s very elementary there isnt very much in the mind but guy is thinking about the mind with mind and as he can make many complexities on the subject and man has managed to for all the trillenia and the reason he has made these mistakes the whole trillenia is simply that mind is mind and people have made lot of business out of mucking up minds and it seems to be the one thing that you can muck up and they apparently could get further for their own purposes mucking up minds they thought until somebody got around to mucking up their mind theyre not good at straightening up minds and nobody ever issued anybody an instruction manual with the mind and nobody ever issued an instruction manual with body so that one is prone to make mistakes but these things were not understood and just to give you just little rundown of the various things how to run engrams and secondaries how to run an emeter how to do assessment how to list and null trs how to really get in the ruds and what the mind consists of those are the outnesses in this unit now there isnt single damned airyfairy anything anywhere there is there so you had to know that you had once known it and had to get it cleaned up and had to get your misunderstood and contradiction straightened out so that you could get it in and play it on the piano and you obviously are playing it on the piano and this lecture youll probably all be thumbs again the main trouble with csing so far has been csing from stuck opinions and wishing off ones own case on somebody else well i think this pc must have lot of trouble with train accidents you look back in the guys folder and he has trouble with train accidents not the pc now one thing i wish that you would get used to doing get used to doing is this is an administrative action which can be done by cs or it can be done by an auditor or it can be done in qual or in tech division but whoever does it it should be done and if it isnt done somebody damn well should do it and that is keep tally of all of the cs actions taken and executed in the beginning of folder over on the left hand sheet so that you know everything thats been done now this can get pretty damn corny cs is in order fly each rud to fn somebody did it the other day took break for supper and came back and flew his rud to fn and it shot the ta up to 425 so it can be forgotten within half an hour well think of what happens if its left for six months somebodys had valence shifter well it should be over there hes had that you try to give him another one and youve had it hes had his s and ds hes had an s and du hes had an s and d this you can look it over and you can see what s and d he hasnt had you could give him that one do you follow so its highly precise action if you dont want to overrun cases why you dont run things on them again that have been run so some kind of tally of what has been run on case should be placed in the folder very visible and should be kept up to date as fast as it is run shouldnt be left behind and that way itll keep him from making mistakes see there were two instances two cases smashed up not here but two cases were smashed up very badly because when the session was finished the auditor didnt note down anything on he completed those actions on review tallies and he came right back to session and did them again complete idiot wrecked the cases smashed em boy alright so the general point which ive been trying to drive home which i think anyone whose been at this any length of time at all is getting wise to is he doesnt have to know hundred thousand combinations of something he only has to know what he knows very well and the basic elements with which he is dealing must be tightly grasped and used and there arent whole bunch of variables that run in from the side there is this game has narrowed down to where you all of sudden dont get new rule for the game every time you try to play it youre playing cards the fellow says oh red cards theyre not valid now youve just gotten yourself fifteen red cards its not that kind of game youre playing these things are stable and if you dont believe they are stable why look around at the results you are getting look around at the results being gotten on your own case and on the cases of others and i think you will agree that standard tech is highly workable tech and it is as workable as it is standard and kept standard and that is the secret of it the standardness of its administration and so on and its getting there its going like bomb and im sure that you agree that it is thank you very much
