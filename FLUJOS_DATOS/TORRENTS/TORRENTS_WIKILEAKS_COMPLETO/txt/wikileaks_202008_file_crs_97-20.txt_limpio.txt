guide to current law 97949 f economic sanctions and the former yugoslavia current status and policy considerations summary in november and december 1996 hundreds of thousands of demonstrators in serbiamontenegro federal republic of yugoslaviafry rallied daily in the capital in protest of attempts by the serbian government under president slobodan milosevic to annul the electoral victories of the opposition in the municipal elections some international policymakers have threatened the serbian leadership with sanctions should it resort to violent means of quelling the protests in bosnia violations of lack of satisfactory compliance with aspects of the dayton peace agreement have periodically prompted calls for the reimposition of sanctions against the offending partyies in particular extremely limited progress has been evident in the return of refugees to their homes or the turning over of indicted war criminals to the international tribunal during the course of the bosnian war from 1992 to 1995 an extensive sanctions regime was constructed by the international community primarily against serbia montenegro for its role in the bosnian conflict the united states imposed several implementing measures in compliance with the sanctions after conclusion of the dayton peace agreement in november 1995 the security council suspended sanctions sanctions were terminated in october 1996 after bosnia held its first national elections since dayton the united states has maintained unilateral policy of upholding socalled outer wall of sanctions against serbiamontenegro that holds full diplomatic relations and us economic benefits as well as us support of fry membership in international organizations or of economic assistance from international financial institutions these limited sanctions are to remain until the fry demonstrates further progress in cooperation with the war crimes tribunal and with respect to the situation in kosovo in december 1996 in response to the political crisis in serbia the state department emphasized that this policy would remain in place until the serbian leadership reversed its antidemocratic practices at the end of 1996 the sanctions debate was focused on two related but distinguishable policy objectives to respond to and possibly affect the internal political crisis in serbiamontenegro and to press for greater compliance with aspects of the peace accord in bosnia for the first objective policymakers were able to consider various forms of sanctions in order to support democratic movements in serbiamontenegro and to condemn the repressive government under slobodan milosevic for the latter objective economic sanctions that had been in place would have been difficult to restore rather the international community or individual countries used international reconstruction aid as an economic lever to influence compliance with the peace process in bosnia contents overview 1 us economic sanctions 2 current status of sanctions 6 policy considerations 7 economic sanctions and the former yugoslavia current status and policy considerations overview sanctions are often viewed as useful policy tool where military response would not be feasible or appropriate since late 1995 the threat of sanctions has frequently been invoked by the international community as means to pressure the bosnian parties especially the bosnian serbs to comply with the terms of the bosnian peace agreement more recently attempts by the serbian leadership in belgrade to manipulate the electoral process at home have prompted some calls for sanctions to be reimposed against serbiamontenegro beginning in 1992 the security council imposed series of economic sanctions1 against the federal republic of yugoslavia fryserbiamontenegro s m and later against the bosnian serbs in the republika srpska for their respective roles in perpetrating the war in bosnia and herzegovina the total package of sanctions against the fryserbiamontenegro was virtually comprehensive once the sanctions were in place international policy on sanctions focussed on sanctions enforcement sanctions primarily targeted the fryserbiamontenegro which financially and materially supported the bosnian serb armed forces but which was not direct party in the conflict as the war continued the serbian leadership under slobodan milosevic sought to play peacemaking role in order to remove the burden of sanctions and the status of international pariah state as part of the usled peace process concluded in dayton ohio almost all sanctions against the fryserbiamontenegro were suspended in late 1995 and sanctions against the bosnian serbs were suspended in early 1996 after bosnia and herzegovina held national elections in midseptember 1996 the security council terminated the economic sanctions in october 1996 some observers contend that economic sanctions could continue to serve useful role for variety of purposes they argue that some form or threat of sanctions could foster greater compliance with aspects of the bosnian peace agreement such as cooperation with the international war crimes tribunal assurance of freedom of movement improved human rights practices and participation in joint political institutions among others the civilian consolidation plan for bosnia agreed to in paris in november 1996 referred to the possibility of renewed sanctions against any party that failed significantly to meet its obligations under the peace agreement 1 the arms embargo against all of the former yugoslavia that had been imposed in 1991 is not addressed in this report crs2 policymakers may also consider imposing sanctions in response to the civil unrest in serbiamontenegro us leaders have specified that limited sanctions against serbiamontenegro would remain in place until the serbian leadership respected the political and civil rights of its people some policymakers have also threatened unspecified sanctions as warning to the serbian leadership not to resort to violent means of ending the demonstrations however the international sanctions regime that had been built up since 1992 has for all intents and purposes been dismantled reimposition of the former sanctions would require passage of new security council resolution alternatively new sanctions framework might be considered by us policymakers for future policy us economic sanctions2 the united nations security council passed security council resolution 757 on may 30 1992 requiring its members to impose economic and diplomatic sanctions against yugoslavia3 in 1991 prior to action the administration prohibited new overseas private investment corporation opic loan guarantees to us business activities in yugoslavia and

meet for the president to renew mfn were based on political conditions in 1992 however and have been overtaken by events the administration maintains socalled outer wall of sanctions against the fry that withholds full diplomatic relations and us economic benefits as well as us support of fry membership in international organizations or of economic assistance from international financial institutions until further progress is demonstrated in fry cooperation with the war crimes tribunal and with respect to the situation in kosovo8 in kosovo serbian authorities have continued to repress the ethnic albanian majority population which seeks independence from serbia9 the outer wall constitutes more of unilateral us policy than an international sanctions regime formal or informal international organization has adopted the outer wall as part of multilateral strategy this lack of formality is particularly important in regard to international financial institutions where the united states without other voting members concurrence cannot block fry from participating or receiving economic assistance 8 as outlined by assistant secretary of state john shattuck at hearing on prospects for peace with justice in bosnia house committee on international relations 104th congress second session february 1 1996 9 for further background on the situation in kosovo see us library of congress congressional research service kosovo and us policy by steven woehrel crs report 96790f september 26 1996 crs6 current status of sanctions security council resolution 1022 november 22 1995 suspended all sanctions against the fry with the exception of frozen or impounded yugoslav assets the ownership of which is being disputed sanctions were to be finally terminated ten days after free and fair elections were held in bosnia sanctions against the bosnian serbs were not to be suspended until the bosnian serb forces had withdrawn behind the zones of separation established in the peace agreement nato secretarygeneral javier solana certified such withdrawal on february 26 1996 triggering the suspension the following day following the holding of reasonably democratic10 national and entity bosnian federation and republika srpska elections on september 14 1996 the security council terminated the sanctions on october 1 resolution 1074 correspondingly in december 1995 president clinton directed the secretary of the treasury to suspend the application of most us sanctions imposed on the fry and the bosnian serbs effective in january and may 1996 respectively to do this the president determined that waiving or modifying the sanctions codified by the national defense authorization act fy 199411 was necessary to achieve negotiated settlement of the conflict in bosniaherzegovina acceptable to all parties in may 1996 however president clinton gave notice of fourth years extension of the national emergency that had been declared in may 1992 and expanded in october 1994 he cited the still incomplete process of implementing the peace agreement and the unfulfilled terms of the suspension of sanctions to date president clinton has not yet taken action to formally terminate sanctions in conformity with resolution 1074 of october 1 1996 so that us sanctions remain in suspension only foreign assistance appropriations acts for fiscal years 1996 and 199712 reaffirmed the intent of the national defense authorization act fy 1994 requiring that the president certify to congress that certain conditions have been met before sanctions against fry sm cease to

kosova including access to the region for international observers and the ability of the elected government of kosova to meet and conduct business the president may waive the requirement however to meet emergency humanitarian needs or to achieve negotiated settlement of the conflict in bosnia and herzegovina policy considerations international policymakers have frequently invoked the threat of economic sanctions in order to advance certain policy objectives in the former yugoslavia during the war sanctions were imposed to bring pressure on serbian president milosevic to end the war and were in part the reason he took on the role of peacemaker in the current situation us and other western policymakers may maintain multiple policy objectives in the balkans that are distinct but mutually interactive international policy directed at affecting developments in serbia montenegro or croatia for example may affect developments in bosnia as well with regard to sanctions at least two separate policy objectives can be identified to respond to and possibly affect the recent internal political crisis in serbia montenegro and to press for greater compliance with aspects of the peace accord in bosnia political unrest in serbiamontenegro erupted after the serbian government partially overturned the results of the november 17 municipal elections during which the opposition claimed victory over the ruling socialists in numerous cities including belgrade in response tens of thousands of citizens took to the streets in daily protests the state department decried the belgrade governments anti democratic measures and specified that the united states would maintain its limited sanctions against serbiamontenegro and would reserve the right to consider re imposition of sanctions13 the state department also called for european countries to impose measures similar to the us outer wall of sanctions while the united states and other countries have demanded that the serbian government respect the results of the municipal elections the threat of restoring sanctions against belgrade appears to be directed primarily at forestalling any violent suppression of the protests at the london peace implementation conference in december fry foreign minister milan milutinovic pledged not to use force to end the rallies many analysts predict that the international community will not actively press for multilateral economic sanctions unless the situation on the streets turns violent they point to milosevics role as guarantor of the bosnian peace process his ability in the past to survive political challenges and the lack of international consensus as yet on sanctions nevertheless some individuals may call for some form of sanctions or other measures against belgrade that would convey support for the democratic movement in serbiamontenegro and condemnation of the serbian governments antidemocratic policies 13 us department of state daily press briefing december 34 1996 crs8 an ongoing policy objective of the united states has been to promote implementation of the bosnia peace agreement since the conclusion of the agreement one year ago the threat of sanctions has often been raised by the international community in response to violations to or lack of progress in peace implementation with the current situation regarding war criminals and refugee returns at stalemate one can expect that some individuals may again call for the imposition of sanctions in order to compel compliance by one or more of the balkan parties in particular many observers have called for sanctions to be imposed on any party that does not cooperate with the hague war crimes tribunal and facilitate the arrest and transfer of indicted war criminals in the first year after dayton the threat of restoring suspended sanctions in effect from november 1995 until october 1996 may have enhanced president milosevics interest in moving forward with peace implementation current circumstances however raise some doubts as to the feasibility and likely effectiveness of future sanctions the united nations could reimpose sanctions only by approving new security council resolution support among other security council member countries for restoring multilateral sanctions against serbia montenegro with regard to the bosnian peace process remains uncertain even if other european countries in the security council were eventually to support renewed economic sanctions russia would likely remain opposed it would be easier for the president to order or for the congress to legislate unilateral us sanctions but such measures would have lesser economic impact than multilateral sanctions whom to target for possible future sanctions related to the bosnian peace process is also problematic issue by most accounts all of the interested parties including neighboring serbiamontenegro and croatia remain out of compliance with one or another aspect of the peace agreement could sanctions feasibly be targeted on multiple parties even if sanctions were to be concentrated on the ostensibly worst offender the bosnian serbs the impact of such sanctions would be questionable given that the republika srpska remains substate entity that would be difficult to target within the greater bosnia and herzegovina rather than sanctions the international community appears to have settled on utilizing international reconstruction assistance as its primary economic lever the paris meeting of the bosnia presidency in november 1996 specified link between the availability of assistance from the international financial institutions and implementation by the bosnian parties of the peace agreement in december 1996 international leaders at the london conference emphasized that economic aid would be conditional on the political willingness of the bosnian parties to implement the peace14 individual donor countries conceivably may exercise the prerogative of withholding funds for reconstruction aid or conditioning economic assistance on certain political goals 14 the washington post december 5 1996 p a39 for other versions of this document see
