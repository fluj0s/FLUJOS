pending in congress have the potential to affect dispute between two groups within the cherokee nation the tribe the blood cherokee and the cherokee freedmen this dispute which is also the subject of litigation in both federal and tribal courts centers on whether the cherokee nations sovereign right to define its own membership has been diminished by treaty with the federal government1 specifically the freedmen who largely trace their descent from the former slaves of the cherokee nation have sought to prevent attempts by certain members of the tribe to expel them from the tribal membership although indian tribes have traditionally held the author ity to determine thei r own makeup congress holds near plenary authority over indian affairs and may circumscribe tribal sovereignty through legislation historical background origins of the dispute the cherokee freedmen in suit filed in federal district court claim to be direct descendants of former slaves of the cherokees or free blacks who intermarried with cherokees who were made citizens of the cherokee nation in the nineteenth century2 their claim for tribal membership is based on an 1866 treaty between

the suit should be dismissed24 the freedmen responded by filing an amended complaint naming the cherokee nation and several trib officers as defendants in preliminary ruling the district court held that both the thirteenth amendment to the us constitution and th 1866 treaty abrogated tribal sovereign immunity with respect to the suit filed by the freedmen thus the court granted the freedmens

cherokee nation was not abrogated by the thirteenth amendment or the 1866 treaty however the court also held that tribal sovereign immunity does not bar suit that seeks to enjoin the officers of the cherokee nation from violating the thirteenth amendment and 1866 treaty rights of the cherokee freedmen27 the court first reasoned that although cong ress has the power to abrogate tribal sovereign immunity neither the thirteen th amendment nor the 1866 treaty contains express and unequivocal langua ge which would indicate an intent to effect such an abrogation absent such language the cour t concluded that it could not infer that congress chose to exercise this power28 on the other hand the court noted that sovereign immunity does not necessarily shield the tribal officers from litigation ra ther the court extended the doctrine of ex parte young29 to tribal sovereign immunity this doctrine allows federal court to enjoin state officers from either violating the federal constitution directly or acting contrary to federal statute or regulation even when sovereign immunity prevents the state itself from being sued30 according to the courts reasoning if the tribal officers were attempting to violate rights ensured by either the th irteenth amendment or the 1866 treaty they would be acting outside their official capacities as representatives of the tribe31 since such actions would be considered to have been conducted in the officers individual capacities the officers would not be sheltered by the tribes sovereign immunity despite the fact that the tribe authorized these acts32 however even though the court ruled that the suit may commence against the officers the court remanded the case so that the district c ourt could determine wh ether the suit could continue

material breach of the treaty36 5 whether material breach would provide the tribe the option of rescission from its own treaty obligations and 6 assuming the treaty provisions are enforceable what remedies would be available for the cherokee freedmen if the membership rights were vindicated amendments to tribal constitution there are currently two amendments to the 1976 cherokee constitution that have been passed by referendum votes one passed on march 3 2007 would exclude the freedmen from tribal membership37 while the other passed on june 23 20 07 would remove the requirement for bia approval of constitutional amendments38 though the bia has approved the amendment removing federal ove rsight in doing so the bia has made clear that the approval should not be construed as an endorsement of any violation of federal law39 the bia has not approved the amendmen t excluding the cherokee freedmen from the tribe analysis this situation involves the ongoing friction that exists between tribal sovereignty and the federal plenary power over indian affairs specifically whether the cherokee nation can exercise its sovere ign right to define its own membership in the face of

power to determine their own membership45 however congress has the power to define membership differently from the tribe when necessary for administrative purposes46 furthermore various treaties contai n provisions which define tribes membership by establishing procedures to enroll certain categories of people within tribe regardless of actual ethnic origin47 such provision can be found in the 1866 treaty with the cherokee nation requiring membership for the ancestors of the freedmen much like the provisions in international treaties the provisions in treaties with indian tribes are the

nsive examination of the long subsequent history of us relations with the cherokee nation including later treaties laws and executive actions the subsequent history of other treaty provisions might have an impact on whether court would hold the cherokee nation to be presently bound by the membership provision potential enforcement of the 1866 treaty provisions enforcement of the membership requirements in the 1866 tr eaty might be problematic assuming that the membership provision remains viable because the treaty contains explicit mechanism for enforcement by federal officials or by aggrieved tribal members nonetheless despite the absence of an express enforcement mechanism there have been some examples of enforcement in th federal courts for example several cases challenging cherokee nation distributions of property in violation of treaty provision were brought under sp ecific statutes providing federal court jurisdiction over claims of the freedmen51 one case invalidated as contrary to article ix of the 1866 treaty cherokee nation council ac tion denying the freedmen pecuniary benefits owed to all cherokee nation members52 in another decision the us supreme court ruled that even though th cherokees have broad powers to deny membership rights they cannot deny indivi duals those rights which were secured by treaty53 one possible method of enforcement coul d be the ability of the bia to refuse to certify cherokee procedures for electing principal chief if the cherokee constitution is amended to disenfranchise the freedmen54 until august 2007 there was

the tenth circuit in similar case involving the cherokee freedmen60 in that case the tenth ci rcuit ruled that the 1866 treaty did not constitute waiver of tribal sove reign immunity and therefore the freedmen could not sue either the tribe or tribal officials in their fficial capacities under federal civil rights laws61 other possible enforcement mechanisms which might be used to compel the cherokee nation to preserve the freedme ns membership rights would require specific legislation congress may do so by calling upon its power over indian affairs which stems from various provisions of th us constitution including the treaty clause62 and the indian commerce clause63 this power which the supreme court has characterized as plenary64 but not absolute can provide congress with many
