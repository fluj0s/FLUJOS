dissolution of the cpa and handover of sovereignty to the interim government of iraq the security council adopted resolution 1546 reaffirming the authorization for the multinational force in resolution 1511 while noting that its presence in iraq is at the request of the incoming interim government of iraq the terms of the mandate for the mnf are expressed in paragraph 12 in which the security council decides further that the mandate for the multinational force shall be reviewed at the request of the government of iraq or twelve months from the date of this resolution and that this mandate shall expire upon the completion of the political process set out above and declares that it will terminate this mandate earlier if requested by the government of iraq resolution 1546 incorporated letters from us secretary of state colin powell and prime minister of the interim government of iraq dr ayad allawi secretary powell wrote in order to continue to contribute to security the mnf must continue to function under framework that affords the force and its perso nnel the status that they need to accomplish their mission and in which the contributing states have responsibility for exercising jurisdiction over their personnel and which will ensure arrangements for and use of assets by the mnf the existing framework governing these matters is sufficient for these purposes in addition the forces that make up the mnf are and will remain committed at all times to act consistently with their obligations under the law of armed conflict including the geneva conventions prior to the handover of sovereignty to the in terim government ambassador bremer issued cpa order 100 to revise existing cpa orders chiefly by substituting the mnfiraq for the cpa and

g348g561adopted in 2005 article 130 of the permanent constitution continues the validity of existing laws presumably including cpa orders that were not rescinded by the transitional government the security council extended the mandate for the multinational forces until december 31 200623 and again until december 31 200724 and finally until december 31 200825 iraqi prime minister almaliki requested the security council extend the mnf mandate one last time until the end of december 2008 provided that the extension is subject to commitment by the security council to end the mandate at an earlier date if the government of iraq so requests and that the mandate is subject to periodic review before june 2008 26 by its terms cpa order 17 remains in force for the duration of the mandate and terminates only after the departure of the final element of the mnf from iraq or at such time as it is rescinded or amended by duly enacted legislation having the force of law27 neither it nor cpa order 100 establishes timetable for the departure of all mnf elements from iraq after the mandate ends order 17 could be interpreted effectively to expire concomitantly with the mandate because it defines multinational force with reference to the resolutions28 however the order appears to have been designed to stay in force for time after the expiration of the mandate for long enough period at least to allow the departure of all mnf personnel if the security council or the iraqi government dopts timetable for the departure of the mnf it seems logical that cpa order 17 would continue in force until the deadline for departure passes on the other hand if the government of iraq invites the united states or any other coalition government to maintain troops in iraq after the mandate terminates it may be expedient for the iraqi government to continue to recognize cpa order 17 until new agreement establishing the role and status of such troops is reached it bears emphasis that the foregoing is subject to the sole interpretation of the iraqi government whether the immunity of coalition troops and other personnel will continue in force after the mandate expires depends on whether the iraqi government deems them to be part of elements of the mnf that have not yet departed or military forces that have overstayed their mandate it is not clear which branch of the iraqi government would make that determination even more significantly the iraqi legislature could decide to repeal amend or possibly extend the order at any time even before the mandate expires another question regarding the status and role of us forces in iraq postun mandate is whether the congressional authorization to use military force will also end hjres 114 does not contain explicit time requirements or call for the withdrawal of us troops by any specific date or set of criteria presumably continued force is authorized under the resolution only so long as iraq poses continuing threat to the united states and the us military presence is not inconsistent with relevant resolutions because the specific threats posed by iraq during saddam husseins regime that were emphasized in the preamble to hjres 114 longer exist with the 23 unsc res 1637 november 11 2005 24 unsc res 1723 november 28 2006 25 unsc res 1790 december 18 2007 26 letter from nuri kamel almaliki prime minister of the republic of

g349g561possible exception of the presence of qaeda in iraq it may be argued that iraq longer poses danger to the security of the united states at least not of the same kind that led congress to pass hjres 114 in the first place once the mandate for the multinational forces in iraq expires and assuming that the security council does not adopt new language supporting new us military role in iraq it is arguable that the us use of military force in iraq is not necessary or appropriate to enforce security council resolutions regarding iraq determination by the security council that th situation in iraq longer poses threat to international peace and security compelling the exer cise of its authority under chapter vii of the charter could also undermine the argument that iraq continues to pose threat to the united states such conclusions do not necessarily support view that us troops are automatically required to be withdrawn when the mandate expires 29 but suggest that new legislation may be necessary to support new role for us troops under possible agreement with iraq the administration has expressed its view that new congressional authorization will be necessary to support us combat operations in iraq after the mandate ends30

congressionalexecutive agreements in which congress has previously or retroactively authorized an international ag reement entered into by the executive 2 executive agreements made pursuant to an earlier treaty in which the agreement is authorized by ratified treaty and 3 sole executive agreements in which an agreement is made pursuant to the presidents constitutional authority without further

litvinov assignment under which the soviet ion assigned to the united states its claims against american nationals is an example of sole executive agreement if the president enters into an executive agreement pursuant to and dealing with an area where he has clear exclusive constitutional authoritysuch as an agreement to recognize particular state for diplomatic purposesthe agreement is legally permissible regardless of congresss opinion on the matter 58 if however the president enters into an agreement and his constitutional authority over the subject matter is unclear or if congress also has constitutional authority over the subject matter reviewing court may consider congresss position in determining whether the agreement is enforceable as us law59 if congress has given implicit approval to the president to enter into the agreement or is silent on the matter it is more likely that the agreement will be deemed valid when congress opposes the agreement and the presidents constitutional authority to enter the agreement is ambiguous it is unclear if or under what circumstances court would recognize such an agreement as controlling because sole executive agreements do not rely on treaty or congressional authority to support their legality they do not require congressional approval to become binding at least as matter of international law courts have recognized however that if sole executive agreement conflicts with preexisting federal law the earlier law will remain controlling in most circumstances60 continued authority of the united states shall be the

constitutional authority to regulate the matter covered by the agreement61 in the security context congress has clear constitutional authority to enact measures that would limit the effect of sole executive agreements involving military commitments article i 8 of the constitution accords congress the power to lay and collect taxes to pay the debts and provide for the common defenceto raise and support armies to provide and maintain navy to make rules for the government and regulation of the land and naval forces and to declare war grant letters of marque and reprisal and make rules

recurring concern for the executive and legislative branches is whether an international commitment should be entered into as treaty or an executive agreement the senate may prefer that significant international commitments be entered as treaties and fear that reliance on executive agreements will lead to an erosion of the treaty power the house may want an international compact to take the form of congre ssionalexecutive agreement so that it may play greater role in the consideration in cases where congressional action is necessary for an agreement to be implemented the executive may prefer to submit an international compact as congressionalexecutive agreement so that approval of the agreement and necessary implementing legislation may be accomplished in single step the executives preference as to whether an international compact takes the form of treaty or executive agreement may also be influenced by the agreements prospects for approval by twothirds majority of the senate or simple majority of both houses state department regulations prescribing the process for coordination and approval of international agreements commonly known as the circular 175 procedure 67 include criteria for determining whether an international agreemen t should take the form of treaty or an executive agreement congressional preference is one of several factors considered when determining the form that an international agreement should take according to state department regulations in determining question as to the procedure which should be followed for any particular international agreement due consideration is given to the following factors 1 the extent to which the agreement involves commitments or risks affecting the nation as whole 2 whether the agreement is intended to affect state laws 3 whether the agreement can be given effect without the enactment of subsequent legislation by the congress 4 past us practice as to similar agreements 5 the preference of the congress as to particular type of agreement 6 the degree of formality desired for an agreement 7 the proposed duration of the agreement the need for prompt conclusion of an agreement and the desirability of concluding routine or shortterm agreement and 8 the general international practice as to similar agreements in determining whether any international ag reement should be brought into

country though such agreements may supplement separate agreements or mandates that do for example although us basing agreements with germany japan and south korea do not expressly authorize the united states to use military force to defend those countries in case of attack they assist the united states in fulfilling security commitments owed to those countries under separate defense treaties

besides the categories of agreements described above the united states has on occasion entered into longterm agreements that grant the united st ates the legal right to intervene militarily within the territory of another party to defend it against internal or external threats unlike collective defense agreements these security agreements provide the united states with the right but not the duty to militarily intervene when the secu rity of the other country is threatened such agreements may also be distinguished from the authority to intervene recognized under the united nations charter whereas military intervention agreements discussed below provide the united states with the positive legal right to intervene in country the charter merely provides that its provisions do not impair the inherent right of individual or collective self defense if an armed attack occurs against member of the united nations until the security council has taken measures necessary to maintain international peace and security 92 in the early part of the 20th century the united states entered into legal agreements with several latin american countries under which the united states was granted the right to

war the united states concluded treaty with the newly independent republic of cuba under which the united states was expressly given the right to intervene for the preservation of cuban independence

countries was concluded that provided the united states with the right to intervene in haiti when the united states deemed it necessary95 in 1904 the united states ratified treaty with panama that

authorizing us military intervention when not concluded as treaties generally have not taken the form of legally binding permanent agreement101 instead in nontreaty arrangements authorizing us intervention the host country generally appears to retain full discretion as to the degree and duration of us presence within its territory in 1962 for instance us secretary of state dean rusk and thai foreign minister thanat khoman issued joint declaration in which secretary rusk expressed the firm intention of the united states to aid thailand its ally and historic friend in resisting communist aggression and subversion 102 the united states thereafter deployed armed forces to thailand to assist the government in combating communist forces the executives authority to enter such arrangements and more broadly to engage in military operations in other countries without congressional approval has been the subject of long standing dispute between the congress and the executive103 in 1969 the senate passed the national commitments resolution stating the sense of the senate that national commitment by the united states results only from affirmative action taken by the executive and legislative branches of the united states government by means of treaty or legislative enactment specifically providing for such commitment104 the resolution defined national commitment as including the use of the armed forces of the united states on foreign territory or promise to assist foreign country by the use of armed forces either immediately or upon the happening of certain events105 according to the committee report accompan ying the resolution the motivation for the resolution was concern over the growing development of constitutional imbalance in matters of foreign relations with presidents frequently making significant foreign commitments on behalf of the united states without congressional action among other things the report criticized practice it described as commitment by accretion by which sense of binding commitment arises out of series of executive declarations one of which in itself would be thought of as constituting binding obligation simply

an agreement requires action from one or both houses of congress to take effect notification is requisite before treaty may become binding us law the president must submit it to the senate for its advice and consent likewise the executive needs to inform congress when it seeks to co nclude an executive agreement that requires congressional authorization andor implementing legislation to become us law so that appropriate legislation may be enacted while constitutional considerations necessitate congressional notification in many circumstances it has historically been more difficult for congress to keep informed regarding international agreements or pledges made by the executive that did not require additional legislative action to take effectie sole executive agreements and executive agreements made pursuant to treaty additionally even in cases where congressional action is necessary for an agreement to take effect the executive has sometimes opted not to inform congress about an agreement until it has already been drafted and signed by the parties in response to these concerns congress has enacted legislation and the state department has implemented regulations to ensure that congress is informed of the conclusion and in some cases the negotiation of legally binding international agreements

act was enacted in 1972 in response to congressional concern that number of secret agreements had been entered by the executive imposing significant commitments upon the united states186 it is the primary statutory mechanism used to ensure that congress is informed of international agreements entered by the united states pursuant to the act all executive agreements are required to be transmitted to congress within 60 days of their entry into force 187 if the president deems the immediate public disclosure of an agreement to be prejudicial to national security the agreement may instead be transmitted to the house committee on foreign affairs and the senate committee on foreign relations the president is also required to annually submit report regarding international agreements that were transmitted after the expiration of the 60day period describing the reasons for the delay188 although the casezablocki act originally only imposed reporting requirements with respect to executive agreements that had entered into force the act was amended in 2004 to ensure that congress was regularly notified regarding the status of proposed agreements as well the secretary of state is required to annually report to congress list of executive agreements that have not yet entered into force which 1 have not been published in the united states treaties and other

agreements may provide means for congressional oversight as to the negotiation of security arrangement with iraq one of the stated objectives of the circular 175 procedure is to ensure that timely and appropriate consultation is had with congressional leaders and committees on treaties and other international agreements197 to that end state department regulations contemplate congressional consultation regarding the conduct of negotiations to secure significant international agreements 198 although these regulations do not define what constitutes significant agreement it seems reasonable to assume that the prospective usiraqi security arrangement would constitute such compact as the agreement would at least as envisioned in the usiraqi declaration of principles commit the united states to provide security assurances to iraq arm and train iraqi security forces and confront qaeda and other terrorist entities within iraqi territory 199 such an agreement appears to call for more significant commitment of us resources than is required under most international agreements to which the united states is party 194 50 usc 404ca 195 id at 404ccd 196 id 197 11 fam 7224 198 id

g345g344g561circular 175 procedures may also provide for congressional consultation concerning the form that legally binding international agreement should take when there is question as to whether an international agreement should be concluded as treaty or an executive agreement the matter is first brought to the attention of the state departments legal adviser for treaty affairs if the assistant legal adviser for treaty affairs believes the issue to be serious one that may warrant formal congressional consultation200 consultations are to be held with appropriate congressional leaders and committees state department regulations specify that every practicable effort will be made to identify such questions at the earliest possible date so that consultations may be completed in sufficient

consideration of treaties and congressionalexecutive agreements for treaty to become binding us law it must first be approved by twothirds majority in the senate the senate may in considering treaty condition its consent on certain reservations declarations and understandings concerning treaty application for example it may make its acceptance contingent upon the treaty being interpreted as requiring implementing legislation to take effect or condition approval on an amended version of the treaty being accepted by other treaty parties if accepted these reservations declarations and understandings may limit andor define us obligations under the treaty as previously discussed congressionalexecutive agreement requires congressional authorization via statute passed by both hous of congress here too approval may be conditional congress may opt to authorize only certain types of agreements or may choose to approve only some provisions of particular agreement in authorizing an agreement congress may impose additional statutory requirements upon the executive eg reporting requirements congress may also include statutory deadline for its authorization of an agreement to begin or expire because sole executive agreements do not require congressional authorization to take effect they need not be approved by congress to become binding at least as matter of international law nonetheless as discussed earlier congress may limit sole executive agreement through subsequent legislative enactment or through the c onditioning of appropriations necessary for the agreements commitment to be implemented 202 similar measures could also be taken to limit or condition us adherence to nonbinding security arrangement 200 11 fam 7244bc 201 id at 7244b 202 see supra at 1415 in

congress may exercise oversight of international agreements via legislation implementing the agreements requirements certain international treaties or executive agreements are considered selfexecuting meaning that they have the force of law without the need for subsequent congressional action203 however many other treaties and agreements are not considered self executing and are understood to require implementing legislation to take effect as enforcing us agencies otherwise lack authority to conduct the ac tions required to ensure compliance with the international agreement 204 treaties and executive agreements have in part or in whole been found to be nonselfexecuting for at least three reasons 1 implementing legisla tion is constitutionally required 2 the senate in giving consent to treaty or congress by resolution requires implementing legislation for the agreement to be given force 205 or 3 the agreement manifests an intention that it shall not become effective as domestic law without the enactment of implementing legislation206 until implementing legislation is enacted existing domestic law concerning matter covered by an international agreement that is not selfexecu ting remains unchanged and is controlling law in the united states however when treaty is ratified or an executive agreement is entered the united states acquires obligations under international law and may be in default of those obligations unless implementing legislation is enacted207 perhaps for this reason congress typically appropriates funds necessary to carry out us obligations under international agreements208 although it is unclear what form the usiraqi security agreement will take it is possible that at least some provisions will require implementing legislation the department of defense appropriations act fy2008 pl 110116 the consolidated appropriations act fy2008 pl 110161 and the national defense authorization act fy2008 pl 110181 for example barred funds from being used

g345g348g561the administration strongly opposes any legislation that would attempt to determine the legal effect or content of diplomatic agreements with iraq before they are negotiated in that regard the administration opposes any attempt to change longstanding legal traditions governing whether certain types of agreements may be concluded as executive agreements rather than as ratified treaties similarly the administration opposes any legislation that would establish statutory policy that status of forces agreement sofa between the us and iraq must include measures requiring the iraqi government to provide financial or other types of support for us armed forces stationed in iraq under the constitution the president has the discretion to initiate and conduct diplomatic negotiations congress cannot by statute establish the policy of the united states with regard to such negotiations in advance indeed in this case such policy would threaten the ability of the united states to engage in dynamic talks with the government of iraq and would risk the timely completion of the status of forces agreement prior to the anticipated expiration of united nations security council resolution 1790 213 accordingly legislation attempting to limit the scope or effect of usiraq security agreement could be subject to veto
