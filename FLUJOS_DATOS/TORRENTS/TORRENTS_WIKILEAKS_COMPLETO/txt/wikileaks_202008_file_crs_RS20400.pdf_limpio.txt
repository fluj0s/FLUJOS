library of congresscrs report for congressreceived through the crs weborder code rs20400 updated march 1 2000 the rising us trade deficit with japan overview and policy options dick k nanto specialist in industry and trade foreign affairs defense and trade division summary the us merchandise trade deficit with japan reached 739 billion in 1999 it is the largest bilateral deficit with any us trading partner in addition to the growing deficit in goods trade with almost all accounted for by trade in machinery and transportation equipment the bilateral deficit in investment income also has become unusually large so large that it outweighs the us surplus in services trade with japan as result the bilateral current account deficit 75 billion in 1998 exceeds the merchandise trade deficit with japan options for dealing with this deficit include letting market forces cope with it raising the value of the yen opening export markets in japan increasing us investments in japan and reducing us imports from japan this report will be updated periodically trade in goods the us trade deficit in goods merchand ise with japan rose to 739 billion in 1999 up from 640 billion in 1998 the trade deficit with japan is the largest that the united states incurs with any of its trading partners including the 687 billion deficit with china for 1999 the deficit was generated by us imports of goods from japan of 1314 billion and us exports to japan of 575 billion in short the united states buys more than twice as much in goods from japan as it sells there the trade deficit with japan accounts for about quarter of the overall us merchandise trade deficit of 3471 billion figure 1 shows us exports to imports from and the us trade balance in goods with japan over the past two decades as can be seen the deficit has fluctuated around 50 billion since the mid1980s and has been growing since the mid1990s changes in the level of the deficit appear to be caused by changes in the yendollar exchange rate in macroeconomic conditions in the two countries and in competitive conditions in certain industries in general strengthening of the yen making imports from japan more expensive has been followed by drop in the level of the deficit in ensuing years while weakening of the yen has had the opposite effect of increasing the deficit when thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20400crs2 source data

economy is growing faster than japans the bilateral deficit tends to grow and vice versa in recent years japans economy has been in recession while the us economy has been growing as shown in figure 2 virtually all the trade deficit with japan can be accounted for by trade in machinery and transportation equipment in 1999 the united states imported 994 billion while exporting 241 billion of such products to japan for sectoral deficit of 753 billion this included trade in motor vehicles aircraft and machine tools there also were deficits of 48 billion in miscellaneous manufactured articles and 49 billion in manufactured goods classified chiefly by material on the other hand the united states ran 148 billion surplus in trade with japan in food live animals beverages tobacco and inedible crude materials the us trade imbalance with japan arises primarily from trade in handful of products in which imports are exceptionally large as shown in table 1 the list of major us imports from japan is headed by motor vehicles office machines electronic components and communications equipment these four categories account for approximately half of all us imports from that country imports of motor vehicles and parts in particular have been running in excess of 9 billion per quarter and have been rising since early 1997 despite considerable investment by japanese automakers in production capacity in the united states at 395 billion in 1999 motor vehiclesparts remain the largest single product imported from japan they are followed by computers office machines electronic components and

commerce survey of current business various issues note data are on balanceofpayments basis the balance on current account is considered to be broader measure of the trading relationship between two countries it includes trade in goods and services as well as unilateral transfers eg remittances from immigrants and the balance on income from us assets abroad and foreign owned assets in the united states as shown in figure 3 the current account deficit with japan recently has grown larger than the deficit in goods trade the deficit on current account did decline from 628 billion in 1994 to 455 billion in 1996 but grew to 754 billion in 1998 the expanding negative balance in goods trade of course contributed to this increase but the burgeoning deficit in income from investments also has become significant this is resulting from the fact that the united states has become net debtor nation foreigners particularly japanese have invested more in the us economy than americans have invested abroad the net earnings flow from investments therefore has grown progressively larger in favor of japan prior to 1997 the us surplus in services outweighed the deficit in investmenthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20400crs5 2scholl russell b the international investment position of the united states at yearend 1998 survey of current business july 1999 p 45 3for discussion of

sustainability by dick k nantoincome and made the current account deficit smaller than the goods trade deficit since 1997 this has been reversed the us deficit in investment income now outweighs the us surplus in services trade with japan at the end of 1998 americans had holdings of 382 billion in direct investments where investors have controlling interest in the enterprise in japan while japanese had direct investments of 1326 billion in the united states in private holdings of stocks and bonds americans had investments of 1507 billion in japan while japanese had 1904 billion in the united states2 at the end of 1998 japanese government and private investors also held 2926 billion in us treasury securities policy options mainstream economic analysis of international trade flows pays little heed to imbalances with individual trading partners at any point in time trade with some countries will be in deficit while trade with others will be in surplus in the united states and other countries with relatively liberalized trade and capital flows moreover trade imbalances tend to be influenced mostly by macroeconomic factors such as capital flows resulting from differences in saving rates exchange rates and relative growth rates3 with japan however the bilateral trade deficit is unusually large chronic and has at times become flashpoint for trade friction the macroeconomic flows moreover are influenced greatly by the existing structure of trade this structure includes protection of certain industries such as rice farming in japan changing the trade structure would change specific trade flows which in turn could affect macroeconomic variables such as savings and investment if japan allowed more imports of rice for example the savings rate of japanese farmers would probably fall us trade policy also can affect specific trade flows in 199899 for example us antidumping duties on japanese steel cut such imports in half us exchange rate and monetary policies moreover affect the relative value of the yen as well as us growth rates which in turn affect trade balances the policy options dealing with the bilateral trade deficit with japan primarily would be to 1 let market forces prevail 2 raise the value of the yen 3 open markets in japan further 4 increase us investments in japan 5 reduce us imports from japan and 6 encourage japan to raise its economic growth rate the vast majority of the trading transactions between the united states and japan are governed by market forces the trade and capital flows are so large that any government intervention into the market of necessity would be at the margin still some policy options are available raising the value of the yen or not intervening to stop its appreciation is policy apparently being pursued by the united states the value of the yen has risen from 131 yen per dollar in 1998 to about 105 yen per dollar at the end of 1999 and around 109 yenhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20400crs6 4for summary of these trade negotiations see crs issue brief 97015 usjapan economic ties status and outlook by william h cooperper dollar in february 2000 part of this appreciation is being caused by capital flowing back into japan as it recovers from recession the japanese government has been actively intervening in foreign exchange markets to counter this appreciation its holdings of foreign exchange obtained by selling yen have risen from 185 billion at the end of 1995 to 215 billion at the end of 1998 and further to 293 million dollars billion at the end of january 2000 over the past year japan has been weakening the yen by purchasing dollars and other foreign currencies at the rate of about 5 billion per month yet it is stronger yen that is instrumental in reducing japans trade surplus how effective this intervention has been in weakening the yen is an open question but it indicates that the japanese government is taking fairly aggressive action to sustain its trade surplus opening markets in japan to us exports and investment has long been pursued by the united states4 although considerable progress has been made access in some sectors is still in dispute these include insurance glass photo film and several agricultural products japans banking crisis and recession has opened the way for more foreign participation in its financial markets but the combination of past investment barriers and the high cost of entering the market has worked to keep the level of foreign investment in japan relatively low this imbalance in investment relations contributes significantly to the deficit in investment income with japan under us trade law protection of specific us industries from import competition from japan is possible for three basic purposes 1 to act against dumping exporting product at lower price than in the home market 2 to counter the effects of government subsidies and 3 to take safeguard action in response to an injury or threatened injury to us industry caused by surge in imports as of december 1999 the united states had 34 antidumping duty orders in effect on products from japan these included hot rolled steel stainless steel sheet and wire rod vector supercomputers forklift trucks color picture tubes and drafting machines since the late 1970s the united states has imposed countervailing duties for subsidies on products from japan after the us automobile industry lost its case in the early 1980s safeguard action has been rarely used in trade with japan when the japanese economy grows faster it tends to draw in more imports including products from the united states throughout 1997 and 1998 the united states encouraged japan to pursue more aggressive fiscal and monetary policies and to ease government regulations in order to stimulate its economy in 1999 the japanese economy had begun to show signs of recovery but late in the year dropped into negative growth again much of the growth that did occur could be attributed to government spending
