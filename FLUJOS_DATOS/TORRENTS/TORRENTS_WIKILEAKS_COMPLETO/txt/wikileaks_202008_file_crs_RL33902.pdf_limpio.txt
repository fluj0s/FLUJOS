people seeking orga ns with one another and with the needs of potential organ donors while the major ity of organs are harvested from deceased donors an increasing number of donations are made by living donors each year as new types of programs are developed to help encourage the practice of living donation both legal and ethical issues may arise the primary federal law governing organ donation in the united states is the national organ transplantation act nota pl 98507 it permits living and deceased organ donation and prohibits the sa of organs specifically section 301 of nota prohibits the exchange of valuable consideration money or the equivalent for organs in december 2007 congress specified in the charlie w norw ood living organ donation act hr 710 s 487 pl 110144 that notas prohibition on the exchange of valuable consideration for organs does not extend to paired organ donation also known as paired donation or human organ paired donation paired organ donation arises when two or more willing living donors are incompatible with their intended recipients but compatible with one anothers recipients the donors give their organs to one anothers intended recipients so that each recipient receives compatible organ living organ donation genera lly and paired and othe r similar types of organ donation arrangements specifically raise or at least touch upon range of issues these include some related to evolving transplantation systems the directive that physicians do harm riskbenefit ratios informed consent type recipients resource allocation parity and the possibility of paying for organs prior to the passage of pl 110144 in the 110th congress several other measures were proposed during the 109th congress s 2306 w ould have clarified that for

the issue of living organ donation is impor tant to congress because it represents one important set of possibilities for balancing the needs of people seeking organs with one another and with the needs of potential organ donors on one side of the balance the drive to increase the supply of transplantable organs is fueled by people awaiting organ transplants they are in sense competing with one another on waiting lists for potentially lifesaving scarce resources on the other side of the balance the drive to ensure that the transplant system is ethical and equitable precludes some mechanisms that would incr ease the supply of transplantable organs some options that have been rejected to date in the united states include paying healthy persons to donate their organs nd mandating that transplantable organs be harvested from all cadavers to maintain the most ideal balance for the organ transplantation system congress may now wish to clarify whether certain new types of living organ donation should be adopted to increase the supply of transplantable organs or prohibited for ethical andor equitable reasons demand for transplantable organs the demand for transplantable organs is outpacing the supply at an increasing rate in the united states in 1988 ther were 16026 individuals on the waiting list for an organ transplant1 by 1995 the waiting list had increased almost 175 to 439372 since then it has more than doubl ed and as of april 22 2008 the waiting list holds 98915 individuals including 75524 people seeking kidneys3 each dayhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33902crs2 4 eric

hospitals to establish protocols requiring health professionals to make organ donor requests13 living donation in 2004 congress passed the organ dona tion and recovery improvement act14 the first federal law directly applicable in part to living donors ie living people who donate an organ they can survive without such as one of their two kidneys living donation is preferable for transplant recipients b ecause kidneys recovered from live donors typically outlast those from deceased donors15 the law amended the public health service act to authorize the hhs secretary to award grants to states transplant centers qualified organ procurement or ganizations or other public or private entities to reimburse travel subsistence and incidental nonmedical expenses incurred by individuals to ward making living organ donations16 the law also authorized the secretary to establish and maintain mechanisms to evaluate the longterm effects associated with livin g organ donations by individuals who have served as living donors for all types of donations the law created and authorized funding for donor awareness programs17 government oversight of the living donation process is limited and some opos have organized nontraditiona l programs for living donors18 typical living donor program allows individuals to receive tr ansplants from living spouses parents or friends who are willing to

have been raised about the entire process of living donation and the multitude of health financia l and social postoperative risks that the living donor faces for detailed discussion of these s ee the final section of this report in part to help answer some of these questi ons in 2007 congress passed the charlie w norwood living organ donation act hr 710 pl 110144 one provision of the law requires the hhs s ecretary to submit annually to the appropriate committees of congress report that details the progress made toward understanding the longterm health effects of living organ donation in addition as discussed in detail below this law clarified that human paired organ donation does not violate notas prohibition against the exchange of valuable consideration19 over time congress has considered range of legislation aimed at encouraging the practice of living organ donation for example hr 1993 109th would have amended the family and medical leave act of 1993 fmla to entitle employees covered by fmla to leave in order to provide living organ donation second bill hr 2472 109th would have amended the inte rnal revenue code to allow nonrefundable tax credit for donation of qualified lifesaving organ for transplantation by living donor and amended the public health service act to provide that any such tax credit not be deemed valuable consideration for purposes of the ban against organ purchases third hr 4753s 2283 109th would have directed the secretary of the treasury to design and strike bronze medal to be awarded to organ donors andor their families directed living donation and valuable consideration paired donation and other types of exchanges as described above in traditional living donation specific donor who is biologically compatible with his or her intended recipient donates an organ to that person to accommodate willing living donors who are not biologically compatible with their intended recipients some other types of directed exchanges in which donor specifies who is to receive his or her organ have emerged one is paired donation also known as paired organ donation or human paired organ donation in paired donation two or mo re donors whose kidneys are incompatible with their own intended recipients but compatible with each others trade donations each recipient receives compatible kidney from living donor pl 110144 clarified that notas prohi bition on the exchange of valuable consideration for organs does not extend to paired donation prior to the passage of this law the exchange element of paired donations triggered stions

desirable these factors include selecting an optimal transplant system list paired or combination for the size of the popul ation lowering the degree of compatibility required for transplant increasing donor w illingness to participat in list and paired donation programs and avoiding systemic re strictions used to achieve equitable outcomes among recipients the studies that have examined these factors are summarized below one study generated data about the type of transplant system that is optimal for given population size by comparing pair ed list and combination programs via computer model the authors estimate d that pool of 3584 donorrecipient pairs could generate 1871 successful transplant s 52 using combination pairedlist exchange program 1730 48 using paired program alone and 1330 37 using list program alone26 the same study found that for small populations of donorrecipient pairs less than 100 list donation would generate more potential transplants than paired donation because list donation uses the entire deceased donor pool while paired donation is limite d to the incompatible pool27 second study investigated factors that influence donors willingness to participate in paired and list exchange programs28 willingness to make paired or list donation appeared to be directly proportional to the likely magnitude of benefit to the intended recipient of 174 potential donors who had been found medically incompatible with their intended recipi ents 638 were willing to participate in paired donation in which the intended reci pient would receive kidney immediately from live donor and 379 were willing to participate in list donation in which the intended recipient would be moved up the list for kidney from deceased donor willingness to make list donation was greatest when the intended recipient would be moved to the top rather than the top 20 of the waiting list 379 vs 190 third study examined the possibility of maximizing paired donations by lowering the donorrecipient compatib ility requirements29 by doing so authors were able to increase the percentage of possi ble exchanges from 57 to 917 of patients in their database30 number of specialized centers report success with incompatible kidney transplantation using special techni ques to make the kidney more compatible with the intended recipient the results of these types of tran splants are reportedlyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33902crs10 31 for example see robert montgomery et clinical results from transplanting incompatible live kidney donorrecipien t pairs using kidney paired

labor intensive requires immunosuppr essives and adds an average of 28000 to the cost of the transplant32 fourth study estimated the impact that ethical restrictions to help ensure that people of all blood types be nefit equitably from list dona tions would have on the number of transplants performed33 the authors proposed certain restrictions on list donation and others have proposed avoiding list donation altogether because people with blood type may be disadvantaged by such system donors with blood type may give compatible kidneys to recipien ts with any blood type but recipients with blood type may only receive compatible kidneys from type donors for that reason type recipients who already have the longest mean wait time on the cadaver waiting list may have to wait an even longer time for cadaveric kidney in typical list donation program the ethical dimensions of this issue are discussed further in the ethical issu section of this report study results indicated that restrictions to benefit recipients with blood type would decrease annually the number of additional kidneys available from list exchanges by about onehalf from rang of 844 2155 additional kidneys to range of 414 1150 additional kidneys th study also indicated that unless the restrictions were used type recipient candidates in list exchange program would experience an increased waiting time that would translate into 1517 deaths per year among the group httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33902crs11 34 42 usc 274ea 35 301b of nota 42 usc 274eb 36 301c2 of nota 42 usc 274ec2 37 according to one author the

legal issues relating to valuable consideration and living donation arrangements statutory prohibition in nota as enacted the national organ tran splant act of 1984 nota 301a prohibited buying or selling human organs for valuable consideration for use in human transplantation34 the original statute also included criminal provision with fines of up to 50000 and imprisonm ent for up to five years or both35 while the statute did not define valuable consid eration it did state that the term does not include the reasonable payments associated with the removal transplantation implantation processing pres ervation quality control and storage of human organ or the expenses of travel housing and lost wages incurred by the donor of human organ in connection with the donation of the organ36 the legislative history of the 1984 nota did not discuss the meaning of the term valuable consideration37 it simply expressed congresss intent to criminalize the buying and selling of organs for profit for example the senate report accompanying s 2048 stated that it is the sense of the committee that individuals or organizations should not profit by the sa of human organs for transplantation38 the house conference report for that bill reiterated that sec tion 301 was directed toward monetary exchanges this title intends to make the buying and selling of human organs unlawful39 during congressional hearings in 2003 on incentives to increase organ donations strong objec tions were proffered against the use of direct monetary incentives to procure organs40 living donations of kidneys from sing biologically compatible living donor to recipient had taken place before nota was enacted in 1984 since nota specifically allowed certain expense paymen ts to be provided to living donor it was clear that living donations were not pr ecluded by nota and that single living donations did not implicate the 301 prohib ition against the exchange of valuable

organs in recent years some transplantation facilities have imp lemented living donation programs involving multiple recipients andor donors41 however other transplant facilities have hesitated to implement such multiple living donation programs because of possible legal concerns over whether such practices could be construed as viola ting the exchange of valuable consideration prohibition in nota42 congress in december 2007 enacted pl 110144 the charlie w norwood living organ donation act43 which clarifies that human organ paired donation is not human organ transfer for valuable consideration and thus does not violate nota44 valuable consideration and living donation arrangements it has always been clear that livin g donation arrangements such as paired donation and list donation do not involve actua l monetary payments to the donor or recipient the concern that has been ra ised is whether the donors and recipients in multiple living donation arrangem ents have received valuable consideration for their promises to get something in return for specific acts such arrangements arguably involve some kind of bargain since there are mutual promises on both sides of the arrangement45 the argument has been made that where donor trades his organ for compatible organ for his intended be neficiary the donor receives valuablehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33902crs13 46

not violate nota s prohibition of valuable c onsideration in return for organ donation issues may still be raised regarding other kinds of living donation arrangements such as list donation because congress clarified only the legality of paired donation arrangements two legal opinions issued before congresss recent amendment of 301 of nota regarding paired donation arrangements continue to be relevant to the question of the legality of other kinds of multiple living donation arrangements such as list donation the associate general counsel to in 2006 provided legal analysis of the applicability of 301 of nota to both paired donation and list donation arrangements concluding that nota 301 is legally and historically inapplicable to todays living donation arrangements47 elaborating on the applicability of the 301 prohibition on the ex change of valuable consideration the legal analysis stated as follows48 valuable consideration under nota 301 is monetary transfer or transfer of valuable property between donor reci pient andor organ broker in sale transaction it is not familial emotional psychological or physical benefit to the organ donor or recipient all of which attach equally to the livingrelated kidney transplants in yesterdays terminology and to the multiparty intended recipient donations paired donations and similar i nnovative and highly beneficial living donation arrangements of today and tomorrow there is valuable consideration under nota 301 in any of these living donation arrangements the donor receives none the recipient give s none and none is transferred to broker in fact there is consideration at all in living organ donation arrangement because the donation is gift gift is different from contract contract does not involve donative intent consideration and the mutual agreement of the parties are required to make the contract legally binding gift on the other hand involves gratuitous transfer by the donor and transfer of money pr operty or services or agreement not to exercise rights or to suffer material detriment consideration by the beneficiary for that reason it is often said that consideration is present in gift promise to make gift of an organ is not intended to be legally binding the donation of an organ is properly cons idered to be gift rather than contractual undertaking as gifts living donations may be made conditionally for specific purpose the condition can be construed as consideration only if the happening of the condition will be benefit to the person who promises

although list donation and paired donation involve more than sing set of recipients andor donors the condition in each case benefits the intended recipient rather than the donor thus these transactions are conditional gifts nd do not involve any federally prohibited exchange of valuable consideration in addition pursuant to request by the hhs general counsel the us department of justices office of gal counsel olc rendered an opinion in march 2007 on the legality of alternative organ donati on practices under 301 of nota the hhs general counsel reque sted the olcs opinion so that the secretary of hhs would know whether 301 imposes barrier to his engaging in various actions to encourage practices ch as paired and list donation the olc concluded at that time that paired ex changes and living donor transplants for increased priority in deceased donor allocation do not involve valuable consideration and are theref ore not prohibited under nota49 the olc opinion examined relevant statutory provi sions the common law of contracts contemporaneous state laws and case law while the opinion acknowledged that the common law understanding of valuable c onsideration was somewhat vague the meaning derived from case law and the context of the term in the nota statute suggested that consideration to be val uable should be pecuniary because 301 is criminal provision it is th erefore appropriate to apply the rule of lenity in favor of narrower reading and thus to understa nd valuable consideration in section 301 of the act as referring to the buying and selling of organs for monetary gain or to organ exchanges that are otherwise commercial and not to alternative organ donation practices such as paired and list donation50 while congress has made it clear that paired donation arrangements do not violate notas prohibition against the exch ange of valuable consideration for human organs the legality under 301 of nota of current list donation arrangements and of other future multip recipientdonor arrangements remains an open question the two legal opinions c ited above lend credence to the argument that such arrangements may not be found to involve illegal ex changes of valuable consideration for human organs further clarification of these issues would be helpful httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33902crs15 51 acot was established under the authority of 42 usc

those related to evolving tran splantation systems the directive that physicians do harm riskbenefit ratios informed consent type recipients resource allocation parity and the possibility of paying

summarized in the following sections evolving transplantation systems as new transplantation systems test the boundaries of old regulations the primary question arises does congress want to maintain direct control over key components of the system to help ensure that ethical boundaries are not breached or does congress want to delegate more of its authority in order to make the system more

technol ogies and methods evolve54 this would allow the secretary to make modifications as new systems are developed and to develop any definitions necessary to interpret the regulations ethical issues related to living donation in medical practice generally three primary guiding principles are that physician should above all do harm to patient that proce dures benefits to patient should outweigh its risks and that one must obtain informed consent prior to medical procedures the practice of obt aining organs from living donors challenges all three of these principles because pl 110114 will presumably expand the practice of living organ donation it raises issues with respect to these three principles but not to greater extent than such issues already raised by the current practice of living organ donation above all do harm the traditional first rule of medicine above all do harm would seem on its face to proscribe the practice of removing heathy organ from healthy person making one pa tient solely to be nefit another person who is already patient indeed one surv ey of 100 liver transplant surgeons found that 77 experienced moral dilemma in placing living donor at risk55 still 72 also agreed that transplant centers had duty to offer their patients the possibility of transplantation using living donors iom c onsidered this point in its report and suggested that the

doctor should not perform procedure unless the potential benefits outweigh the risks57 this calculation is generally made for each patient independently it is not ethically acceptable for one patient to bear all of the risks and another to reap all of the benefits on this point iom noted that living donor may gain psychosocial benef its from donating an organ to one in need which could arguably outweigh the risks to the donors phy sical health however in order to help ensure that the risk is not too great for particular donor due to preexisting medical condition or the like iom recommended that an independent donor advocate be appointed to assess the riskbenefit ratio even with donor advocate to make th riskbenefit assessments one major factor complicates the assessment of th ratio

solicited public comments from the organ transplant community for living donation after several widely publicized living donor deaths and an increasing trend in the number of living donations60 informed consent ethically justifiable living organ donation presupposes the competent donors voluntary informed c onsent acot specified that living donors informed consent must be compet ent free from coercion and fully informed of the risks and benefits as donor among other things61 as iom noted obtaining informed consent is confounded by the same l ack of longterm health data that makes assessing the riskbenefit ratios difficult62 it is not possible to fully inform potential living donors necessary component of informed consent without information about the likely impact of the procedure on longterm health iom suggested that creating living donor registry would enha nce informed consent as well as inform the riskbenefit analysis further problems in obtaining informed consent are related to the requirement that it be given voluntarily establishing voluntary process may be complicated if donors are not legally competent to consent eg children or if situations are coercive eg loved ones f eel pressured to become liv ing donors some potential donors have expressed relief at discovering that they were incompatible with their intended recipients expande d use of paired exchanges and the prospect of list exchanges may eliminate the incompatib ility excuse for potential donors and may thus create coercive situation ioms recommendation that each living donor receive an advocate is aimed at protectin g voluntary informed consent as well as evaluating the riskbenefit ratio in ddition iom recommends that the advocates address gender disparities in living dona tion women represent 56 to 59 of living kidney donors each year and one study suggests that this is due primarily to the fact that women are asked to donate more often than men63 ethical issues related to

more than five years as noted previously several authors ve expressed concern that individuals with the blood type an already disadva ntaged population in the transplantation system may be further disadvantaged by list donation system implementing system with disparate impact particularly one that falls on an already disadvantaged group has caused some authors to recommend that list paired donation have minimal ro on national level65 it has caused others to recommend that the system be modifi ed to protect type recipients66 different set of authors has come out in favor of the list exchange program despite the impact on people with type blood67 they claim that the impact on type recipients would be transient thoug h some people would be bumped to the top of the transplant list their absence from that list when they would have come to its top 45 years later would eventually balance out the impact of the system current law avoids the type issue by focusing only on paired and not list donation earlier proposals w ould have raised this issu by explicitly permitting list donation eg s 2306 109th and s 573 is 108th or potentially allowing the practice hr 710 eas 110th ethical issues related to directed donation paired and list directed donation which allows an organ donor to specify the recipient creates issues related to the equita ble allocation of organs pa ired and

available at continuedand length of time the patient has been on the waiting list for transplant68 by contrast directed donation allows the donor to choose who receives their organ or in the case of list donation who is to dvance on the waiting list the pcbe noted that this raises the question of whether it is ethical for one person to receive an organ before another more needy person simply because someone cares for them enough to make donation69 pcbe also noted that prohibiting such acts of love as living donation in the name of justice would be perverse parity some have suggested that in pa ired and list donations the donated and received organs must be of equal value to ensure an equitable exchange70 while this might be possible with paired exchange it is almost certainly not the case with list donation because the intended recipient will r eceive kidney from deceased donor instead of living one deceased donor organs do not typically last as long as living donor organs other issues relate d to parity have been raised such as whether one donor in paired exchange ma change his or her mind if the other donor has already undergone surgery to prevent these scenarios it has been suggested that both donors should undergo surgery at the same time71 other authors have suggested that outcome parity cannot be guaranteed in list and paired exchange programs72 if one organ fails the recipient is not necessarily entitled to receive another ethical issues related to proposals for expanding the organ supply exchanging valuable consideration for an organ the demand for transplantable organs s inspired wide variety of proposals to increase the supply including some that would allow or encourage forms of payment for organs congress has cons idered several proposals to give donors honorific or tax incentives for donating organs73 the use of financial incentives has been studied proposed and debated in the general literature va rious organizations including the

harves ted should be able to share in some of the profits76 there has been resistance to proposal s that encourage commodification of human organs the iom conducted an ex tensive analysis of various types of financial incentives to encourage donati on such as payment through regulated futures markets payment of funeral expens providing bereavement counseling tax incentives and providing health insurance77 iom concluded that none should be promoted at this time because of lack of evidence that these incentives would improve donation rates because once put in motion system of financial incentives would be difficult to reverse and because of fears that such systems might disproportionately affect the poor th is recommendation came as disappointment to some who seek to increase the supply of transplantable organs78 while current law clarifies that paired donation does not violate notas prohibition on the exchange of human orga ns for valuable consideration it does not permit the payment of money in exchange for organ donation to date congress has not considered legislation that would do so
