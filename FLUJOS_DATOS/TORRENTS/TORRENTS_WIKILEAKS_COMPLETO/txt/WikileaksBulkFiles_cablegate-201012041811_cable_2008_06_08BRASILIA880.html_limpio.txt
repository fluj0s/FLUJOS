security concerns ref state 65088 b brasilia 834 classified by ambassador clifford m sobel reason 14 b and d 1 c the ambassador met with brazilian presidential foreign policy advisor marco aurelio garcia on june 25 to express our concern regarding the bolivian governments lack of concrete assurances to protect our embassy in paz garcia promised to raise the issue with the bolivian ambassador which he did immediately after meeting with the ambassador and with higher levels in the bolivian government he also said he would bring the request to president lulas attention garcia said that in his view bolivia is at dangerous time and is in for lengthy period of increased instability he encouraged the usg to offer the bolivian government gestures that clearly signal we are fully neutral between the bolivian government and opposition garcia also told the ambassador that president lulas trip to venezuela was focused on commercial cooperation that he did not see raul castro making any additional changes in response to the eu lifting of sanctions and that president bush and president lula should take up cooperation on biofuels at their meeting during the g8 in japan end summary 2 c the ambassador accompanied by polcouns notetaker met with marco aurelio garcia on june 25 to deliver points ref garcia was accompanied by advisors ambassador marcel biato and elio almeida cardoso after conveying condolences on the death of former first lady ruth cardoso the ambassador explained to garcia our concerns with regard to the security of our embassy in bolivia and requested brazils assistance note the day before ministry of foreign relations under secretary for south america enio cordeiro had called to followup his conversation with the ambassador ref b cordeiro said he had spoken with the colombian vice minister of foreign affairs regarding the security of the us embassy and they had agreed that the best approach to the bolivian government would be through the papal nuncio end note 3 c the ambassador asked for garcias assessment of the situation garcia said that the current problems stem in part from president morales having come to office acting as if it were revolution his polemics have been factor in instability garcia said but the instability already existed noting he had visited bolivia twelve times during president lulas first term and had met with four presidents bolivias institutional problems remain and there has been effort on either side to follow established procedures the opposition is controlled by hard element on the one hand on the other the government has refused to differentiate between opposition hardliners and modern rightists like tuto quiroga so instead of resolving issues garcia said each side has hardened their position and they are beyond hearing each other 4 c as result new stalemate has developed this will continue garcia predicted even after the august 10 referendumif the referendum happens at all he explained that the questioning of the referendums legitimacy by the opposition provinces called into question whether it would even take place garcia said it is his personal opinion that bolivia faces enormous dangers now the intention of the opposition he believes is to make the central government irrelevant to make it bleed so it will be brought down by noninstitutional means he said the government might in fact fall but only within the established timeframes opposition efforts to force it out of power would not work in any case garcia believes long period of instability is going to ensue that like flammable gas in the air could be set off by even small spark the fact is that bolivia is going through major social and political change which is hard to control brasilia 00000880 002 of 003 5 c garcia said that many brazilians were surprised by morales confrontational posture toward brazil early on and it had required great deal of patience to put the relationship back on track and establish frank dialogue brazil has told the bolivian government that it needs to tone down the rhetoric and resolve its disputes if it wants to make progress toward what morales wants to achieve the government has reasonable macroeconomic situation he said but needs to make sure that the current economic growth is more than just bubble as result its ability to attract investmentand particularly to maximize its energy potentialis crucial in the latter case in particular it will run into problems not only in filling contracts with brazil and argentina but also in supplying its growing domestic needs 6 c the ambassador said that bolivia needs to understand that companies including brazilian companies will not invest when they see our embassy under attack garcia acknowledged the point saying that he had pushed petrobras to go back into bolivia in part as sign to other investors the ambassador asked if garcia thought that the breakdown of stability and security in bolivia would hurt foreign companies there he responded that many companies have solid commitment and longterm perspective heavyweight investors know that the conflict wont go beyond certain point and whichever side wins out bolivia will need investment petrobras has not lost any money there he concluded 7 c garcia said he would deliver the message to the bolivians noting that he would be meeting with the bolivian ambassador following the meeting with ambassador sobel garcia suggested that maybe it is time for the united states to have frank discussion with bolivia adding that tom shannon is wellrespected in bolivia he cannot see how conflict with the united states is beneficial to bolivia he said the ambassador suggested that it might serve as distraction for the bolivian governments domestic problems garcia took the point but said that in the long run they would gain in some ways but lose in others 8 c we bet on dialogue garcia stressed suggesting that mutual nonaggression pact was in order the ambassador responded that public support for the security of our embassy would undoubtedly open other channels for dialogue but stressed that security of our embassy cannot be open for discussion garcia agreed but he cautioned that we should not underestimate antiamericanism in some circles theres an old joke we used to tell he said why hasnt there ever been coup in the united states because they dont have an american embassy he said that the united states needs to offer sign that we are not on anyones side something that would increase american credibility visavis the bolivian government without wishing to be mediator he said brazil is willing to help in whatever it can recalling similar commitment he made to as shannon two years earlier he suggested that brazil had hand in encouraging venezuelan president chavez to lower his tone and become less present today on the issue chavez understood that his efforts were too invasive and ultimately counterproductive 9 c coming back to the request garcia said the bolivian ambassador in brasilia was very professional and he would sound him out he also committed to raising the request with president lula adding he knew that as shannon had raised the issue with brazilian ambassador patriota in washington note in readout on june 26 amb biato said that garcia had had long meeting with the bolivian ambassador and had made clear that it was important for the bolivian government to cease provoking the united states and to make amends garcia had stressed that conflict could not be helpful to the bolivians biato reiterated that garcia intended to raise the issue with president lula and with higher levels in brasilia 00000880 003 of 003 bolivia end note 10 c the ambassador asked about president lulas priorities for his june 27 meeting with president chavez garcia said that chavez is seeking an import substitution model for venezuelan agriculture and development and the two presidents will discuss ten projects that are still being developed in the areas of steel production integrated circuits television and plastics among others in agriculture the venezuelans are looking to work with brazil to develop either family farms or largescale ie 80000 soy farms they are also interested in dairy and poultry the ultimate goal for chavez he said is food security and the venezuelans are trying to create the infrastructure for the entire food production chain using both public and private investment as an aside garcia said that venezuelas new finance minister ali rodriguez is different in that he is knowledgeable and can talk directly to chavez 11 c the ambassador asked what garcia thought would come of the eu decision to lift its sanctions garcia said he did not see raul castro giving any type of concession to foreign pressure and that the eu move was sign that there is perception cuba is changing he noted that in brazil both businesses and the press that had been critical of brazils cuba policy have changed their tune businesses are now interested in investing and there is less criticism in the press 12 c the ambassador raised biofuels stressing that although many would like to divide brazil and the united states on the issue we would like to continue working together he recalled that civil household minister dilma rousseff had pressed for president bush to attend the renewables conference that brazil plans to host in november and asked what the objective would be garcia said that presidents bush and lula should take the issue up again at the g8 in japan comment it has become clear over the course of conversations with foreign ministry and presidency officials that brazil is still in the initial stages of planning the conference they have asked for usg input on the agenda and objectives end comment after garcia departed to meet with the bolivian ambassador the ambassador stressed to biato that brazils effort to distinguish between corn and cane ethanol was not productive and that our focus should be on the future of biofuels biato stressed that president lula was not intending to go to rome for the fao conference but had done so in the end when the focus of criticism fell on ethanol the draft speech he had taken with him to rome had been toughened up there biato said he could not predict how lula would react to the idea of lowering the tone on this issue comment other contacts however have told us they do expect lula to back away from this line end comment sobel
