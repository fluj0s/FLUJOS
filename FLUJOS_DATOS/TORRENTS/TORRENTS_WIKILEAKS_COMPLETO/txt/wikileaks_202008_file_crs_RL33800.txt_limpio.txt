copeland specialist in resource and environmental policy resources science and industry division water quality issues in the 110th congress oversight and implementation summary although much progress has been made in achieving the ambitious goals that congress established more than 35 years ago in the clean water act cwa to restore and maintain the chemical physical and biological integrity of the nations waters longstanding problems persist and new problems have emerged water quality problems are diverse ranging from pollution runoff from farms and ranches city streets and other diffuse or nonpoint sources to toxic substances discharged from factories and sewage treatment plants there is little agreement among stakeholders about what solutions are needed and whether new legislation is required to address the nations remaining water pollution problems several key water quality issues exist evaluating actions to implement existing provisions of the law assessing whether additional steps are necessary to achieve overall goals of the act that have not yet been attained ensuring that progress made to date is not lost through diminished attention to water quality needs and defining the appropriate federal role in guiding and paying for clean water infrastructure and other activities for some time efforts to comprehensively amend the cwa have stalled as interests have debated whether and exactly how to change the law congress has instead focused legislative attention on enacting narrow bills to extend or modify selected cwa programs but not any comprehensive proposals for several years the most prominent legislative water quality issue has concerned financial assistance for municipal wastewater treatment projects and it has been in focus in the 110th congress as well the house passed three bills dealing with wastewater infrastructure financing hr 720 hr 700 and hr 569 and the senate environment and public works committee approved another s 3500 at issue is how the federal government will assist states and cities in meeting needs to rebuild repair and upgrade wastewater treatment plants especially in light of capital costs that are projected to be as much as 390 billion also of interest have been programs that regulate activities in wetlands especially cwa section 404 which has been criticized by landowners for intruding on private landuse decisions and imposing excessive economic burdens environmentalists view these programs as essential for maintaining the health of wetland ecosystems and they are concerned about court rulings that narrowed regulatory protection of wetlands and about related administrative actions many stakeholders desire clarification of the acts regulatory jurisdiction but they differ on what solutions are appropriate in the 110th congress committees held hearings on legislation that seeks to provide that clarification hr 2421 s 1870 other issues discussed in this report that also have been of interest in congress include implementation of current programs to manage stormwater discharges and nonpoint sources of pollution as these are major contributors to water quality impairments across the country

has been made in achieving the ambitious goals that congress established 30plus years ago to restore and maintain the chemical physical and biological integrity of the nations waters longstanding problems persist and new problems have emerged water quality problems are diverse ranging from pollution runoff from farms and ranches city streets and other diffuse or nonpoint sources to point source discharges of metals and organic and inorganic toxic substances from factories and sewage treatment plants the principal law that deals with polluting activity in the nations streams lakes estuaries and coastal waters is the federal water pollution control act pl 92500 enacted in 1972 commonly known as the clean water act or cwa it consists of two major parts regulatory provisions that impose progressively more stringent requirements on industries and cities to abate pollution and meet the statutory goal of zero discharge of pollutants and provisions that authorize federal financial assistance for municipal wastewater treatment plant construction both parts are supported by research activities plus permit and enforcement provisions programs at the federal level are administered by the environmental protection agency epa state and local governments have major responsibilities to implement cwa programs through standardsetting permitting and enforcement1 the water quality restoration objective declared in the 1972 act was accompanied by statutory goals to eliminate the discharge of pollutants into navigable waters by 1985 and to attain wherever possible waters deemed fishable and swimmable by 1983 although those goals have not been fully achieved considerable progress has been made especially in controlling conventional pollutants suspended solids bacteria and oxygenconsuming materials discharged by industries and sewage treatment plants progress has been mixed in controlling discharges of toxic pollutants heavy metals inorganic and organic chemicals which are more numerous and can harm human health and the environment even when present in very small amounts at the partsperbillion level moreover efforts to control pollution from diffuse sources termed nonpoint source pollution rainfall runoff from urban suburban and agricultural areas for example are more recent given the earlier emphasis on point source pollution discharges from industrial and municipal wastewater treatment plants overall data reported by epa and states indicate that 45 of river and 1 for further information see crs report rl30030 clean water act summary of the law by claudia copeland crs2 stream miles assessed by states and 47 of assessed lake acres do not meet applicable water quality standards and are impaired for one or more desired uses2 in 2006 epa issued an assessment of streams and small rivers and reported that 67 of us stream miles are in poor or fair condition and that nutrients and streambed sediments have the largest adverse impact on the biological condition of these waters3 approximately 95000 lakes and 544000 river miles in the united states are under fishconsumption advisories including 100 of the great lakes and their connecting waters due to chemical contaminants in lakes rivers and coastal waters and onethird of shellfishing beds are closed or restricted due to toxic pollutant contamination mercury is contaminant of growing concern as of 2003 45 states had issued partial or statewide fish or shellfish consumption advisories because of elevated mercury levels the last major amendments to the law were the water quality act of 1987 pl 1004 these amendments culminated six years of congressional efforts to extend and revise the act and were the most comprehensive amendments since 1972 authorizations of appropriations for some programs provided in pl 1004 such as general grant assistance to states research and general epa support authorized in that law expired in fy1990 and fy1991 authorizations for wastewater treatment funding expired in fy1994 none of these programs has lapsed however as congress has continued to appropriate funds to implement them epa states industry and other citizens continue to implement the 1987 legislation including meeting the numerous requirements and deadlines in it the clean water act has been viewed as one of the most successful environmental laws in terms of achieving its statutory goals which have been widely supported by the public but lately some have questioned whether additional actions to achieve further benefits are worth the costs criticism has come from industry which has been the longstanding focus of the acts regulatory programs and often opposes imposition of new stringent and costly requirements criticism also has come from developers and property rights groups who contend that federal regulations particularly the acts wetlands permit program are costly intrusion on private landuse decisions states and cities have traditionally supported water quality programs and federal funding to assist them in carrying out the law but many have opposed cwa measures that they fear might impose new unfunded mandates many environmental groups believe that further finetuning is needed to maintain progress achieved to date and to address remaining water quality problems congressional activity after pl 1004 following enactment of amendments in 1987 major cwa legislative activity occurred until the 104th congress 1995 the house approved comprehensive reauthorization bill hr 961 that was opposed by environmentalists and the clinton administration hr 961 would have amended many of the 2 us environmental protection agency national water quality inventory report to congress 2002 reporting cycle epa841r07001 october 2007 39 p 3 us environmental protection agency wadeable streams assessment collaborative survey of the nations streams epa 841b06002 may 2006 1 vol crs3 regulatory and standards provisions of the law required epa to use extensive new risk assessment and costbenefit procedures and increased flexibility with regulatory relief from current clean water programs critics said that the bill would undermine the existing framework for protecting us waters the senate did not take up hr 961 or other cwa legislation thus legislation was enacted since the 104th congress comprehensive reauthorization legislation has been introduced but beginning in the 106th congress number of bills dealing with specific water quality issues and programs in the law have been enacted congress first passed bill to strengthen protection of coastal recreation waters through upgraded water quality standards and coastal waters monitoring programs pl 106 284 congress also passed bill pl 106457 that reauthorized several existing cwa programs ie chesapeake bay cleanup clean lakes and the national estuary program and bill to authorize cwa grant funding for wet weather sewerage projects included as provision of the fy2001 consolidated appropriations bill pl 106554 the 107th congress enacted the great lakes legacy act pl 107303 it amended existing great lakes provisions cwa section 118 to authorize 50 million annually for fy2004fy2008 for epa to carry out projects to remediate sediment contamination in the great lakes the bill also reauthorized cwa provisions concerning the lake champlain basin program section 120 the 108th congress enacted legislation amending the act to extend the national estuary program nep cwa section 320 through fy2010 pl 108399 the nep authorized by the 1987 cwa amendments is directed at improving the quality of estuaries of national importance the 109th congress enacted two cwa measures in december 2005 congress passed hr 3963 hrept 109293 authorizing 40 million per year to extend the long island sound program in section 119 of the act for six years through fy2010 president bush signed it on december 22 2005 pl 109137 in november 2006 congress passed hr 6121 bill to reauthorize the lake pontchartrain basin program in section 121 of the act through fy2011 president bush signed it on december 12 pl 109392 since the 107th congress the dominant cwa issue has been water infrastructure financing ie extension and modification of provisions of the act authorizing financial assistance for municipal wastewater treatment projects house and senate committees have approved bills but none has been enacted because of varied controversies see authorization of wastewater infrastructure funding below in addition to the enacted legislation described here throughout this period since the 1987 amendments number of bills dealing with other specific cwa programs have been reported by house and senate committees some of these were passed by one house of the congress but were not enacted the remainder of this report discusses key cwa issues that were of particular interesting during the 110th congress including legislation that was introduced in several of the areas it first discusses issues that were most prominent on the cwa agenda in congress including water infrastructure funding regulatory protection of crs4 wetlands regulating wastewater discharges from vessels and extension of the great lakes legacy act it then discusses several other issues of interest stormwater discharges management of sewer overflows wastewater security management of nonpoint sources of pollution and regulation of waste discharges from animal feeding operations the report concludes with brief discussion of appropriations for water quality programs legislative issues in the 110th congress the year 2007 marked the 35th anniversary of passage of the clean water act and 20 years since the last major amendments to the law while as noted there has been measurable clean water progress as result of the act observers and analysts agree that significant water pollution problems remain however there is less agreement about what solutions are needed and whether new legislation is required several key water quality issues exist evaluating actions to implement existing provisions of the law assessing whether additional steps are necessary to achieve overall goals of the act that have not yet been attained ensuring that progress made to date is not lost through diminished attention to water quality needs and defining the appropriate federal role in guiding and paying for clean water infrastructure and other activities for some time efforts to comprehensively amend the act have stalled as interests have debated whether and exactly how to change the law many issues that might be addressed involve making difficult tradeoffs between impacts on different sectors of the economy taking action when there is technical or scientific uncertainty and allocating governmental responsibilities for implementing the law these factors partly explain why congress has recently favored focusing legislative attention on narrow bills to extend or modify selected cwa programs rather than taking up comprehensive proposals other factors also are at work these include general reluctance by most members of congress to address controversial environmental issues in view of the slim majorities held by political parties in the house and the senate lack of presidential initiatives on clean water issues neither the clinton nor the bush administration proposed cwa legislation and since the terrorist attacks of september 11 2001 more prominent congressional focus on security terrorism and iraq war issues than on many other topics including environmental protection as result of the 2006 midterm elections and changed congressional leadership many observers anticipated that the 110th congress would pursue oversight of clean water and other environmental programs particular legislative focus is water infrastructure financing legislation specifically reauthorization of the acts financial aid program also on the congressional agenda was consideration of the geographic reach of the clean water act over the nations waters and wetlands in light of court rulings including two supreme court decisions that have narrowed the laws regulatory jurisdiction but in ways that are somewhat unclear number of other issues of interest included implementation of current programs to manage stormwater discharges and nonpoint sources of pollution as these are major contributors to water quality impairments across the country implementation of rules governing discharges of wastes from large animal feeding operations and crs5 implications of number of court rulings concerning the scope of the acts discharge permit requirements authorization of water infrastructure funding meeting the nations needs to build upgrade rebuild and repair wastewater infrastructure is significant element in achieving the clean water acts water quality objectives the acts program of financial aid for municipal wastewater treatment plant construction is key contributor to that effort since 1972 congress has provided more than 78 billion to assist cities in constructing projects to achieve the acts requirements for secondary treatment of municipal sewage equivalent to 85 reduction of wastes or more stringent treatment where required by local water quality conditions state and local governments have spent more than 25 billion of their own funds for construction as well still funding needs remain very high an additional 2025 billion nationwide for all types of projects eligible for funding under the act according to the most recent needs survey estimate by epa and the states released in january 2008 an 86 increase above the estimate reported four years ago4 epa reported several reasons for increased needs problems due to aging infrastructure treatment plant improvements needed to meet more protective water quality standards and additional capacity required to handle wet weather flows this current estimate includes 1344 billion for wastewater treatment and collection systems 105 billion more than the previous report 548 billion for combined sewer overflow corrections 15 billion less than the previous estimate 9 billion for stormwater management 28 billion more than the previous estimate and 43 billion to build systems to distribute recycled water new category in this report the estimate does not explicitly include funding needed to address security issues discussed below needs related to growth and expansion in regions that are experiencing population growth or funding possibly needed for treatment works to adapt to climate change impacts in september 2002 epa released study called the gap analysis that assesses the difference between current spending for wastewater infrastructure and total funding needs both capital and operation and maintenance5 in that report epa estimated that over the next two decades the united states needs to spend nearly 390 billion to replace existing wastewater infrastructure systems and to build new ones funding needs for operation and maintenance not eligible for clean water act funding are an additional 148 billion the agency estimated according to the gap analysis if there is increase in investment there will be about 6 billion gap between current annual capital expenditures for wastewater treatment 13 billion annually and projected spending needs of approximately 19 billion the study also estimated that if wastewater spending increases by 3 annually essentially meaning doubling of rates the gap would shrink by nearly 90 to 4 us environmental protection agency clean watersheds needs survey 2004 report to congress washington january 2008 1 vol available at httpwwwepagovowmmtb cwns2004rtctochtm 5 us environmental protection agency the clean water and drinking water infrastructure gap analysis september 2002 epa 816r02020 50 p crs6 about 1 billion annually at issue has been what the federal role should be in assisting states and cities especially in view of such high projected funding needs debate over the nature of the nations efforts regarding wastewater infrastructure was central and controversial part of the 1987 amendments to the act the amendments extended through fy1990 the traditional title ii program of grants for sewage treatment project construction under which the federal share was 55 of project costs the 1987 law initiated program of grants to capitalize state water pollution control revolving funds srfs which are loan programs in new title vi states are required to deposit an amount equal to at least 20 of the federal capitalization grant in the fund established under title vi under the revolving fund concept monies used for wastewater treatment construction would be repaid by loan recipients to the states repayment was not required for grants under the title ii program to be recycled for future construction in other communities thus providing an ongoing source of financing the expectation in 1987 was that the federal contributions to srfs would assist in making transition to full state and local financing by fy1995 although most states believe that the srf is working well early funding and administrative problems and continuing large funding needs have delayed the anticipated shift to full state responsibility thus srf issues have been prominent on the clean water act reauthorization agenda in recent congresses6 srf monies may be used for specified activities including making loans for as much as 100 of project costs at or below market interest rates including interest free loans to buy or refinance cities debt obligation or as source of revenue or security for payment of principal and interest on stateissued bond srf monies also may be used to provide loan guarantees or credit enhancement for localities loans made by state from its srf are to be used first to assure progress towards the goals of the act and in particular on projects to meet the standards and enforceable requirements of the act after states achieve those requirements of the act srf monies also may be used to implement nonpoint pollution management and national estuary programs since the srf program began states have used 26 billion to assist more than 8650 nonpoint management projects none has gone to estuary management activities all states have established the mechanisms to administer the new loan programs and have been receiving srf capitalization funds under title vi many have complained that the srf program is unduly complicated by federal rules even though congress had intended that states were to have greater flexibility congressional oversight has examined the progress toward reducing the backlog of wastewater treatment facilities needed to achieve the acts water quality objectives while newer estimates of future funding needs have drawn increased attention to the role of the srf program in meeting such needs although there has been some criticism of the srf program and debate continues over specific concerns the basic 6 for further information see crs report 98323 wastewater treatment overview and background by claudia copeland crs7 approach is well supported congress used the clean water srf as the model when it established drinking water srf in 1996 pl 1041827 while the initial intent was to phase out federal support for this program congress has continued to appropriate srf capitalization grants to the states providing an average of 135 billion annually in recent years but that amount has been declining since fy2005 table 1 summarizes wastewater treatment funding under title ii traditional grants program and title vi capitalization grants for revolving loan programs since the 1987

for special project grants in individual cities issues associated with special project grants are discussed in crs report rl32201 water infrastructure project earmarks in epa appropriations trends and policy implications by claudia copeland crs8 one issue of continuing interest is impacts on small communities these entities in particular have found it difficult to participate in the srf loan program since many are characterized by narrow or weak tax bases limited or access to capital markets lower relative household incomes and higher per capita needs they often find it harder to borrow to meet their capital needs and pay relatively high premiums to do so meeting the special needs of small towns through reestablished grant program other funding source or loan program with special rules has been an issue of interest to congress because remaining clean water funding needs are still so large nationally at issue is whether and how to extend srf assistance to address those needs how to allocate srf funds among the states and how to prioritize projects and funding additionally there is concern about the adequacy of srf or other funding specifically for highcost projects dealing with problems of overflows from municipal combined and separate sewers which can release partially treated or untreated wastewaters that harm public health and the environment epa estimates that the cost of projects to control sewer overflows from combined and separate sanitary sewer systems and manage stormwater runoff is nearly 64 billion nationwide and more recently wastewater utilities have sought assistance to assess operational vulnerabilities and upgrade physical protection of their facilities against possible terrorist attacks that could threaten water infrastructure systems9 bush administration officials have said that infrastructure funding needs go beyond what the federal government can do on its own and the presidents budget for several years has advanced the concept that federal funding would cease after 2011 and that state and local selffinancing would occur thereafter while saying that federal and state funding can help water utilities meet future needs epas principal water infrastructure initiative has been to support other types of responses to help ensure that investment needs are met in an efficient timely and equitable manner in particular since 2003 epa has promoted strategies that it terms the four pillars of sustainable infrastructure based on concepts of better management fullcost pricing efficient water use and watershed approaches to protection10 epa is pursuing sustainable infrastructure leadership initiative in partnership with water utilities to promote the four pillars the purpose of the initiative is to identify new and better ways of doing business in the water and wastewater industries and promote them widely and thus ensure sustainability of water systems for example epa is working to encourage rate structures that lead to full cost pricing and will support water metering and other conservation measures epa also is encouraging consumers to use waterefficient products eg residential bathroom products with the intent of reducing national water and wastewater infrastructure needs by reducing projected water demand and wastewater flow thus allowing deferral or downsizing of capital projects 9 for additional information on many of these issues see crs report rl31116 water infrastructure needs and investment review and analysis of key issues by claudia copeland and mary tiemann 10 us environmental protection agency sustainable water infrastructure for the 21st century see httpwwwepagovwaterinfrastructure crs9 legislative responses congress has considered water infrastructure funding issues several times since the 107th congress in that congress house and senate committees approved bills to extend the acts srf program and increase federal assistance hr 3930 s 1961 srept 107228 report on hr 3930 was not filed neither bill received further action in large part due to controversies over application of prevailing wage requirements of the davisbacon act and over the formula for allocating srf grants among the states the issue of the applicability of the davisbacon act to srffunded projects has affected consideration of water infrastructure legislation for some time because that act has both strong supporters and critics in congress critics of davisbacon say that it unnecessarily increases public construction costs and hampers competition while supporters say that it helps stabilize the local construction industry by preventing competition that would undercut local wages and working conditions under the original srf program authorization enacted in 1987 the davisbacon act applied to socalled first use monies provided by state from its srf that is loans made from initial federal capitalization grants but not subsequent monies provided from repayments to the srf when that authorization expired at the end of fy1994 davisbacon requirements also expired thus the recent issue has been whether to restore the applicability of those requirements in the 108th congress four bills to reauthorize the clean water act srf program were introduced s 170 s 2550 hr 20 hr 1560 in addition separate bills to reauthorize funding for sewer overflow grants cwa section 221 were introduced hr 784 s 567 in october 2004 the senate environment and public works committee reported legislation authorizing 4125 billion over five years for wastewater and drinking water infrastructure programs including 20 billion for the clean water srf program s 2550 srept 108386 the bill included new formula for statebystate allocation of clean water srf grants renewal of the clean water acts sewer overflow grant program and provisions such as extended loan repayments and subsidies for disadvantaged communities prior to the senate committees action in july 2003 the house transportation and infrastructure subcommittee on water resources and environment approved hr 1560 legislation similar to hr 3930 the bill approved by that committee in the 107th congress but further action occurred hr 1560 did not include language specifying that the davisbacon act shall apply to srffunded projects while s 2550 did include such requirement other factors that clouded these bills were administration opposition to authorization levels in both bills and disputes over funding allocation formulas in the 109th congress the senate environment and public works committee approved s 1400 the water infrastructure financing act in july 2005 srept 109 186 the bill was similar to s 2550 in the 108th congress it would have authorized 20 billion for grants to capitalize the clean water act srf program and 15 billion for safe drinking water act srfs through fy2010 as approved by the committee s 1400 would have revised the cwa formula for statebystate allocation of srf monies and also specified that the prevailing wage requirements of the davisbacon act shall apply to all projects financed from an srf as similarly provided in the committees bill in the 108th congress further action on this bill occurred crs10 for some time interest has been growing in identifying and developing new mechanisms to help localities pay for water infrastructure projects beyond federal grants or srfs which appear insufficient to fully meet funding needs in june 2005 the house transportation and infrastructure subcommittee on water resources and environment held hearings on alternative means to fund water infrastructure projects in the future at the first hearing witnesses focused on one way to increase funding for water infrastructure that has recently been advocated by some groups creating national clean water trust fund that would conceptually be similar to trust funds that exist for highway and aviation projects witnesses and subcommittee members discussed difficulties in identifying potential revenue sources that would be deemed fair and equitable the second hearing addressed other financing options such as expanded use of taxexempt private activity bonds and more efficient management techniques such as asset management programs and sustainable infrastructure initiatives in the 109th congress legislation was introduced to establish 75 billion federal trust fund for wastewater infrastructure improvements this bill hr 4560 proposed to use concept for funding such projects that has been promoted by wastewater treatment industry officials other stakeholders and some environmentalists who argue it could provide new source of money for necessary system upgrades amid dwindling federal funds the bill contemplated system of user fees to create the fund but the source of revenue was not specified in the bill congress did not act on this legislation 110th congress wastewater infrastructure financing again received attention in the 110th congress in march 2007 the house approved three bills addressing the following issues however the senate did not act on any of them hr 720 the water quality financing act of 2007 was passed by the house on march 9 2007 it is substantially similar to legislation that the house transportation and infrastructure committees water resources and environment subcommittee approved in the 108th congress hr 156011 it would authorize 14 billion for the clean water srf program for fy2008fy201112 it includes several provisions intended to benefit economically disadvantaged and small communities such as allowing extended loan repayments 30 years rather than 20 and additional subsidies eg principal forgiveness and negative interest loans for communities that meet states affordability criteria it includes provisions to require communities to plan for capital replacement needs and to develop and implement 11 for background information on this earlier legislation see crs report rl32503 water infrastructure financing legislation comparison of s 2550 and hr 1560 by claudia copeland and mary tiemann 12 the original version of hr 720 approved by the transportation and infrastructure committee on february 7 authorized 20 billion over fy2008fy2012 for the srf program in order to comply with budget compliance rules of the house the committee approved substitute version of the bill on march 1 with lower authorization level over fouryear period the substitute also includes provision restoring vessel tonnage duties that were in effect from 1990 to 2002 on certain cargocarrying vessels that enter or depart from us ports the additional tonnage duties are intended to offset the cost of hr 720 crs11 an asset management plan for the repair and maintenance of infrastructure that is being financed one key difference between this bill and the earlier legislation is the specification in hr 720 that the davisbacon act prevailing wage requirement shall apply to all projects financed in whole or in part through an srf this issue was extensively debated during subcommittee and full committee markups of the bill and amendments to delete the requirement and to request gao study of impacts of the davis bacon act were defeated hr 720 includes provisions requesting that gao prepare report for congress on alternative public and private mechanisms to fund water infrastructure and report on potential funding mechanisms for clean water trust fund during debate on the bill the house rejected an amendment that would have deleted the davisbacon requirements in the bill and adopted several other amendments including one directing epa to study us and canadian wastewater discharges to the great lakes and another directing states to give funding priority to existing needs before investing in projects for additional wastewater treatment capacity hr 569 would reauthorize cwa section 221 to authorize for projects to correct municipal sewer overflows hrept 11016 it is similar to legislation approved by the transportation and infrastructure committee in the 109th congress hr 624 the house passed this bill on march 7 2007 as passed the bill would provide 17 billion over five years hr 700 would reauthorize cwa section 220 to extend pilot program to develop alternative water source projects hrept 110 15 it would authorize total of 125 million for section 220 the house passed this bill on march 9 2007 the senate environment and public works committee held an oversight hearing on wastewater infrastructure needs in september 2007 and later took up specific legislative proposal dealing with financing issues in september 2008 the committee approved the water infrastructure financing act s 3617 bill that is similar to measure that the committee approved in the 109th congress s 1400 s 3617 authorizes 20 billion for grants to capitalize the clean water act srf program and 15 billion for safe drinking water act srf capitalization grants through fy201213 the bill expands eligibility for clean water srf assistance including for example projects that implement stormwater management water conservation or efficiency projects and water and wastewater reuse and recycling projects the measure includes number of provisions to make the clean water and drinking water srf programs more parallel such as allowing srf assistance to be used by private as well as public wastewater treatment systems it also includes several provisions to benefit small or economically disadvantaged communities such as through new technical assistance and more generous loan terms the committee 13 these amounts do not reflect an amendment approved during committee markup to reduce all authorizations in the bill by 2 crs12 approved an amendment adding davisbacon act language similar to that in house passed hr 720 specifying that prevailing wage requirement shall apply to all projects financed in whole or in part through an srf regulatory protection of wetlands how best to protect the nations remaining wetlands and regulate activities taking place in wetlands has become one of the most contentious environmental policy issues especially in the context of the cwa which contains key wetlands regulatory tool the permit program in section 404 it requires landowners or developers to obtain permits for disposal of dredged or fill material that is generated by construction or similar activity into navigable waters of the united states including wetlands section 404 has evolved through judicial interpretation and regulatory change to become one of the principal federal tools used to protect wetlands although that term appears only once in section 404 itself and is not defined there at the same time its implementation has come to be seen as intrusive and burdensome to those whose activities it regulates at issue today is how to address criticism of the section 404 regulatory program while achieving desired goals of wetlands protection14 unlike the rest of the act the permit aspects of section 404 are administered by the us army corps of engineers rather than epa although the corps uses epa environmental guidance other federal agencies including the us fish and wildlife service fws and natural resource conservation service nrcs have more limited roles in the corps permitting decisions tension has existed for many years between the regulation of activities in wetlands under section 404 and related laws on the one hand and the desire of landowners to develop property that may include wetlands on the other hand the conflicts over wetlands regulation have for the most part occurred in administrative proceedings as congress has not amended section 404 since 1977 when it provided exemptions for categories of routine activities such as normal farming and forestry controversy has grown over the extent of federal jurisdiction and impacts on private property burdens and delay of permit procedures and roles of federal agencies and states in issuing permits judicial proceedings involving section 404 one issue involving long standing controversy and litigation is whether isolated waters are properly within the jurisdiction of section 404 isolated waters wetlands which are not physically adjacent to navigable surface waters often appear to provide only some of the values for which wetlands are protected such as flood control or water purification even if they meet the technical definition of wetland on january 9 2001 the supreme court ruled on the question of whether the cwa provides the corps and epa with authority over isolated waters the courts 54 ruling in solid waste agency of northern cook county swancc v us army corps of engineers 531 us 159 2001 held that the corps denial of 404 permit for disposal site on isolated wetlands solely on the basis that migratory birds use the site exceeds the authority provided in the act 14 for additional information see crs report rl33483 wetlands an overview of issues by jeffrey zinn and claudia copeland crs13 the full extent of impacts on the regulatory program resulting from this decision remains unclear even five years after the ruling in part because of different interpretations of swancc reflected in subsequent federal court cases while it continues to be difficult to fully assess how regulatory protection of wetlands will be affected as result of the swancc decision and other possible changes the remaining responsibility to protect affected wetlands falls on states and localities15 environmentalists believe that the court misinterpreted congressional intent on the matter while industry and landowner groups welcomed the ruling policy implications of how much the decision restricts federal regulation depend on how broadly or narrowly the opinion is applied some federal courts have interpreted swancc narrowly thus limiting its effect on current permit rules while few read the decision more broadly the governments view on this key question was expressed in epacorps guidance issued in january 2003 it provides legal interpretation essentially based on narrow reading of the courts decision thus allowing federal regulation of some isolated waters to continue but it calls for more headquarters review in disputed cases administration press releases say that the guidance demonstrates the governments commitment to nonetloss wetlands policy however it is apparent that the issues remained under review because at the same time the administration issued an advance notice of proposed rulemaking anprm seeking comment on how to define waters that are under jurisdiction of the regulatory program16 the anprm did not actually propose rule changes but it indicated possible ways that clean water act rules might be modified to further limit federal jurisdiction building on swancc and some subsequent legal decisions the government received more than 133000 comments on the anprm most of them negative according to epa and the corps environmentalists and many states opposed changing any rules saying that the law and previous court rulings call for the broadest possible interpretation of the clean water act and thus narrow interpretation of swancc but developers sought changes to clarify interpretation of swancc in december 2003 epa and the corps announced that the administration would not pursue rule changes on federal regulatory jurisdiction over isolated wetlands the epa administrator said that the administration wanted to avoid contentious and lengthy rulemaking debate over the issue environmentalists and state representatives expressed relief at the announcement interest groups on all sides have been critical of confusion in implementing the 2003 guidance which constitutes the main tool for interpreting the reach of the swancc decision environmentalists remain concerned about diminished protection resulting from the guidance while developers said that without new regulations confusing and contradictory interpretations of wetland rules will continue 15 for additional information see crs report rl30849 the supreme

january 15 2003 crs14 federal courts continue to have key role in interpreting and clarifying the swancc decision on february 21 2006 the supreme court heard arguments in two cases brought by landowners rapanos v united states carabell v us army corps of engineers seeking to narrow the scope of the cwa permit program as it applies to development of wetlands the issue in both cases had to do with the reach of the cwa to cover waters that were not navigable waters in the traditional sense but were connected somehow to navigable waters or adjacent to those waters the act requires federal permit to discharge dredged or fill materials into navigable waters many legal and other observers hoped that the courts ruling in these cases would bring greater clarity about the scope of federal jurisdiction the courts ruling was issued on june 19 2006 rapanos v united states 547 us 715 2006 in 54 decision plurality of the court led by justice scalia held that the lower court had applied an incorrect standard to determine whether the wetlands at issue are covered by the cwa justice kennedy joined this plurality to vacate the lower court decisions and remand the cases for further consideration but he took different positions on most of the substantive issues raised by the cases as did four other dissenting justices17 legal observers suggest that the implications of the ruling both shortterm and longterm are far from clear because the several opinions written by the justices did not draw clear line regarding which wetlands and other waters are subject to federal jurisdiction one likely result is more caseby case determinations and continuing litigation there also could be renewed pressure on the corps and epa to clarify the issues through an administrative rulemaking on june 5 2007 nearly one year after the rapanos ruling epa and the corps issued guidance to enable their field staffs to make cwa jurisdictional determinations in light of the decision18 according to the guidance the agencies will assert regulatory jurisdiction over certain waters such as traditional navigable waters and adjacent wetlands jurisdiction over others such as nonnavigable tributaries that do not typically flow yearround and wetlands adjacent to such tributaries will be determined on casebycase basis to determine if the waters in question have significant nexus with traditional navigable water the guidance details how the agencies should evaluate whether there is significant nexus the guidance is not intended to increase or decrease cwa jurisdiction and it does not supersede or nullify the 2003 guidance discussed above which addressed jurisdiction over isolated wetlands in light of swancc in accompanying documents epa and the corps said that the administration was considering rulemaking in response to the rapanos decision but they noted that developing new rules to interpret the decision would take more time than issuing the guidance they also noted that while the 2007 guidance provides more clarity for how jurisdictional determinations will be made concerning nonnavigable tributaries and their adjacent wetlands legal challenges to the scope of cwa 17 for additional information see crs report rl33263 the wetlands coverage of the clean water act is revisited by the supreme court rapanos and carabell by robert meltz and claudia

agencies also solicited public comments for sixmonth period the agencies could make changes to the guidance based on those public comments but they have not done so yet congressional actions in september 2002 house government reform subcommittee held hearing on the governments response to the swancc decision committee members and public witnesses indicated that lack of guidance from the government clarifying its interpretation of the case had led to inconsistent regulatory decisions by corps officials in individual regions of the country and subsequent judicial decisions by other federal and state court have been mixed at the hearing corps and epa officials testified on their efforts to develop guidance which subsequently was released in january 2003 concern about lingering confusion over the swancc decision and corps implementation was the topic of an oversight hearing by the senate environment and public works committee in june 2003 developers and others in the regulated community criticized the corps and epa saying that the january 2003 guidance document had not clarified the reach of federal jurisdiction house transportation and infrastructure subcommittee also held hearing on postswancc issues in march 2004 controversies persist about the 2003 swancc guidance on may 18 2006 the house adopted an amendment to bill providing fy2007 appropriations for epa hr 5386 the amendment passed by 222198 vote would have barred epa from spending funds to implement the 2003 policy guidance supporters of the amendment said that the guidance goes beyond what the supreme court required in swancc has allowed many streams and wetlands to be unprotected from development and has been more confusing than helpful opponents of the amendment predicted that it would make epas and the corps regulatory job more difficult than it already is congress adjourned sine die in december 2006 without taking final action on hr 5386 legislation to overturn the swancc and rapanos decisions by providing broad definition of waters of the united states was introduced in the 110th congress hr 2421 and s 1870 the clean water authority restoration act of 200719 similar legislation was introduced in the 107th 108th and 109th congresses other legislation to narrow the definition of waters of the united states also was introduced in the 109th congress hr 2658 on august 1 2006 senate environment and public works subcommittee held hearing on the courts rapanos decision for now it is unclear whether the decision in the rapanos and carabell cases will accelerate congressional action on legislative proposals to address uncertainties about federal jurisdiction over wetlands and other waters but both the swancc and rapanos rulings remain highly controversial the house transportation and infrastructure committee held hearings on hr 2421 and related jurisdictional issues on july 17 and july 19 2007 another hearing was held april 16 2008 the senate environment and public works committee 19 for additional information and discussion of legislation see crs report rl33483 wetlands an overview of issues jeffrey zinn and claudia copeland crs16 held hearing on issues related to the rapanos ruling on december 13 2007 and held legislative hearing on s 1870 on april 9 2008 proponents contend that congress must clarify the important issues left unsettled by the supreme courts 2001 and 2006 rulings and by the 2007 corpsepa guidance bill sponsors argue that the legislation would reaffirm what congress intended when the cwa was enacted in 1972 and what epa and the corps have subsequently been practicing until recently in terms of cwa jurisdiction but critics question the constitutionality of the legislation and assert that it would expand federal authority thus likely increasing confusion rather than settling it prospects for the legislation are uncertain given the divided views on how it might be interpreted by federal agencies and the courts regulating discharges from vessels concerns have been expressed about court ruling on regulation of ballast water which is used by tankers bulk cargo carriers and cruise ships to stabilize vessels during transport ballast water is often taken on in the coastal waters of one region and discharged at the next port of call as cargo is offloaded or added clean water act rules currently exempt ballast water and other discharges incidental to the normal operation of vessels from cwa permit requirements20 because of the growing problem of the introduction of invasive species into us waters via ballast waters environmental groups sued epa to force the agency to rescind the regulatory exemption in march 2005 federal district court ruled in favor of the groups and subsequently the court remanded the matter to epa with an order that the challenged regulation be set aside by september 30 2008 requiring the epa to issue cwa permits after that date northwest environmental advocates v epa c 0305760 si ndcal september 18 2006 the district courts ruling was upheld on july 23 but on august 31 the district court approved epas request to delay the courts order until dec 19 2008 although the government appealed the district courts ruling epa initiated efforts to respond to the courts mandate in case the appeal is unsuccessful significantly the courts ruling applies fully to all types of vessel discharges that are covered by the regulatory exemption including gray water wastewater from sinks and laundries ballast water and bilge water some observers argued that legislative clarification of this issue was needed because an appeal might not be resolved before the deadline mandated by the district court epa estimated that as many as 13 million recreational boats and 98000 commercial vessels could be affected by permitting program concern over this possibility led to the introduction of several bills in the 110th congress to statutorily exempt vessels from cwa permit requirements that epa might adopt in response to the federal courts order in july congress passed two of these bills and president bush signed both one is pl 110288 s 2766 it exempts recreational boats from cwa permit requirements and requires epa to develop management practices for discharges other than sewage that are incidental to the normal operation of such vessels the second is pl 110299 s 3298 it provides twoyear permit 20 this regulatory exemption does not include sewage discharges from vessels which are regulated under cwa section 312 crs17 moratorium for fishing vessels and other vessels less than 79 feet in length and requires epa to evaluate the impact of discharges other than sewage and ballast water that are incidental to the normal operation of vessels on june 17 while waiting for the court of appeals or congress to provide relief from the district courts order epa proposed two cwa general permits one permit covers recreational vessels less than 79 feet in length and the second covers commercial and large recreational vessels enactment of s 2766 and s 3298 relieved recreational boats from permit requirements but as many as 50000 large commercial vessels still must comply when permits are finalized by epa in december 200821 related to this issue the 110th congress also considered legislation to provide uniform national approach for addressing aquatic nuisance species from ballast water under program administered by the coast guard s 1578 ordered reported by the senate commerce committee on september 27 and housepassed hr 2830 some groups oppose these bills because they would preempt states from enacting ballast water management programs more stringent than coast guard requirements under the legislation which the cwa allows22 extension of the great lakes legacy act significant portions of great lakes waters are impaired due to years of discharges of toxic chemicals that have accumulated in the sediments of the lakes toxic chemicals in sediment can enter the food chain and threaten the health of fish wildlife and humans together the us and canadian governments have identified 42 specific areas of contaminated sediments throughout the lakes as areas of concern and have initiated variety of remedial actions however concern over the slow pace and limited funding for such projects led to enactment of the great lakes legacy act on 2002 pl 107303 it amended the great lakes provision of the cwa section 118 to authorize funds for monitoring evaluating and remediating contaminated sediments in areas of concern in the lakes authorizations under the original legislation expired at the end of fy2008 thus the 110th congress enacted legislation hr 6460 to extend authorizations for two years through fy2010 at existing funding levels of 50 million per year in response to comments from stakeholders the new legislation makes several procedural changes to the cleanup program to speed up the ranking prioritization and remediation of contaminated sites gives epa greater flexibility to manage funds and allows use of cleanup funds to include habitat restoration president bush signed the bill on october 8 2008 pl

rl34640 regulating ballast water discharges current legislative issues by claudia copeland crs18 other clean water act issues several other issues affecting efforts to achieve the goals and objectives of the clean water act also were of interest during the 110th congress through oversight and legislation implementation of the beach act in 2000 congress enacted the beaches environmental assessment and coastal health act the beach act in order to augment federal and state efforts to prevent human exposure to polluted coastal recreation waters including the great lakes this act directed coastal states to adopt updated water quality standards and epa to develop new protective criteria and standards it also authorized grants to coastal states to support monitoring and notification programs in may 2007 the gao issued report on federal and state implementation finding that epa has implemented most provisions of the act but has not yet published new or revised water quality criteria which the law required by 200523 several bills to extend authorization of appropriations for the beach grants were introduced in the 110th congress hr 723 hr 909 hr 2537s 1506 s 2844 and hearings on the status of implementation were held by senate and house committees on april 16 2008 the house approved hr 2537 with several amendments hrept 110491 the bill would allow states to use beach act funds to track sources of pollution and would require states to use rapid testing methods of beach water in order to improve public notification it would increase grant funds to the states from 30 million annually to 40 million it also directs epa to publish revised water quality criteria for pathogens key pollutant of concern at beaches as well as list of all pathogens and pathogen indicators it has studied and observed in the course of developing those criteria on may 21 2008 the senate environment and public works committee ordered reported companion legislation s 2844 srept 110414 the senate version would increase authorized grant funds to 60 million per year further action occurred stormwater discharges epa has struggled since the 1970s to regulate industrial and municipal stormwater discharges in workable yet comprehensive manner for many years it was generally believed that stormwater was largely clean or uncontaminated however studies have shown that this type of discharge carries with it large amounts of organic and toxic pollutants that can harm water quality including oil and grease heavy metals pesticides soil and sediment in pl 1004 congress established firm deadlines and priorities for epa to require permits for discharges of stormwater that are not mixed or contaminated with household or industrial waste epa issued rules in november 1990 that addressed phase i of the program detailing the process of applying for stormwater permits for industries medium and large municipalities and construction sites larger than 5 acres the agency worked with an advisory committee of stakeholders beginning in 1994 to develop rules for regulating smaller stormwater dischargers which were not covered 23 us government accountability office epa and states have made progress in implementing the beach act but additional actions could improve public health protection gao07591 may 2007 61 p crs19 by the 1990 rules rules for smaller dischargers unregulated industries small construction sites and small cities phase ii of the program were issued in october 1999 the burden of complying with the rules continues to be an issue with many industries and municipalities especially small cities which faced compliance deadlines beginning in march 200324 may 2007 gao report examined municipalities implementation of the phase i and phase ii stormwater rules and burdens of the regulatory program on communities gao reported that issuance of some permits was delayed for years after the application deadlines almost 11 of all communities were not permitted as of fall 2006 as result almost all phase ii and some phase i communities are still in the early stages of implementation thus gao concluded that it is too early to assess the program or determine its overall burden gao attempted to analyze epas estimates of program costs but found methodological and data problems serious enough that gao could not use the estimates as indicators of actual program costs further gao found that municipalities annual reports to epa were too limited and inconsistent to permit assessing the costs of the stormwater program25 stormwater issues were addressed in one provision of omnibus energy legislation in the 109th congress as the march 2003 compliance deadline approached for phase ii small construction sites to comply with stormwater permit rules epa proposed twoyear extension of those rules for small oil and gas construction sites to allow the agency to assess the economic impact on that particular industry in march 2005 epa again extended the deadline until june 2006 during this time congress considered legislative solution which it enacted in section 323 of the energy policy act of 2005 pl 10958 it provides permanent exemption from stormwater runoff rules for the construction of exploration and production facilities by oil and gas companies or the roads that service those sites industry officials said that epas original stormwater rule created costly permitting requirements even though the short construction period for drilling sites carries little potential for stormwater runoff pollution the enacted provision makes epas temporary delay permanent and makes it applicable to construction activities at all oil and gas development and production sites regardless of size including those covered by an earlier phase i of the stormwater program opponents argued that the provision did not belong in the energy legislation and that there was evidence that construction at oil and gas sites causes less pollution than other construction activities congress passed the conference report on the legislation with the oil and gas stormwater provision in july 2005 president bush signed it into law on august 8 2005 24 for further information see crs report 97290 stormwater permits status of epas regulatory program by claudia copeland 25 us government accountability office further implementation and better costs data needed to determine impact of epas storm water program on communities gao07 749 may 2007 110 pp crs20 in june 2006 epa promulgated rule to conform the cwa to these provisions of pl 1095826 the rule exempts oil and gas construction activities from cwa permits including sedimentladen stormwater discharges even if such discharges contribute to violation of water quality standards environmental groups challenged the rule saying that because sediment is pollutant epa exceeded its authority by including uncontaminated sediment in the permit exemption in may 2008 federal court agreed with the challengers ruling that the regulation constituted an impermissible construction of the cwa and vacated the regulation natural resources defense council v epa ca 9 0673217 may 23 2008 the governments request for rehearing of this ruling was denied in november epa has not indicated how it will respond to vacatur of the rule combined and separate sewer overflows total of 772 municipalities have combined sewers where domestic sanitary sewage industrial wastes infiltration from groundwater and stormwater runoff are collected these systems serve approximately 40 million persons mainly in older urban and coastal cities normally under dryweather conditions the combined wastes are conveyed to municipal sewage treatment plant properly designed sized and maintained combined sewers can be an acceptable part of citys water pollution control infrastructure however combined sewer overflow cso occurs when the capacity of the collection and treatment system is exceeded due to high volumes of rainwater or snowmelt and the excess volume is diverted and discharged directly into receiving waters bypassing the sewage treatment plants often the excess flow that contains raw sewage industrial wastes and stormwater is discharged untreated many combined sewer systems are found in coastal areas where recreational areas fish habitat and shellfish beds may be contaminated by the discharges in 1994 following negotiations with key stakeholder groups epa issued cso permitting strategy cities were to implement nine minimum controls by january 1 1997 eg proper operation and maintenance programs for sewer systems and pollution prevention programs controls generally are based on combinations of management techniques such as temporary retention of excess flow during storm events and structural measures ranging from screens that capture solids to construction of separate sewer systems epa officials stated in 1998 that only about onehalf of the cities with combined sewers implemented the minimum measures called for in the 1994 strategy epa has been working with states to remind cities of their obligations to address cso problems however formal enforcement strategy is not contemplated one issue concerning some cities is the problem of overflows from municipal separate sanitary sewers ssos that are not csos because they transport only sanitary wastes discharges of untreated sewage from these sewers can occur from 26 us environmental protection agency amendments to the national pollutant discharge elimination system npdes regulations for storm water discharges associated with oil and gas exploration production processing or treatment operations or transmission facilities 71 federal register 33628 june 12 2006 crs21 manholes broken pipes and deteriorated infrastructure and undersized pipes and can occur in wet or dry weather epa estimates that there are about 18000 municipalities with separate sanitary sewers all of which can under certain circumstances experience overflows explicit epa or statutory control policy currently exists in 1995 epa convened stakeholders group to discuss how to address those overflows that pose the highest environmental and public health risk first on january 5 2001 the clinton administration proposed regulations to improve the operation of municipal sanitary sewer collection systems reduce the frequency and occurrence of overflows clarify the existing cwa prohibition on sso discharges and clarify circumstances appropriate for enforcement action the clinton proposal was not finalized by the bush administration which reportedly is continuing to consider sso policy issues funding for cso and sso projects is major concern of states and cities the most recent clean water needs survey found that the largest needs category totaling 55 billion and representing 27 of total needs is to address csos in december 2000 congress passed legislation the wet weather water quality act authorizing twoyear 15 billion grants program to reduce wet weather flows from municipal sewer systems both csos and ssos this bill was included in the fy2001 consolidated appropriations bill section 112 of division b pl 106554 which codified epas cso policy on sewer overflows discussed above congress provided appropriations for these wet weather grants during the two years of authorization fy2002fy2003 as described above in march 2007 the house passed legislation to reauthorize this grant program hr 569 the 110th congress also addressed related issue that of notification to the public when sewer overflow event occurs on june 23 the house passed hr 2452 bill intended to ensure that sewage treatment plants monitor for and report discharges of raw sewage from combined or separate sewers the bill would require epa to issue criteria to guide plant operators in assessing whether sewer overflow has the potential to affect human health or imminently and substantially endanger human health on september 17 the senate environment and public works committee approved s 2080 with an amendment providing the text of housepassed hr 2452 further action occurred wastewater security since the september 11 2001 terrorist attacks in the united states congressional attention has focused on security preparedness and emergency response issues among the topics of interest is protection of the nations water infrastructure facilities both drinking water and wastewater from possible physical damage biologicalchemical attacks and cyber disruption27 policymakers have examined number of legislative options in this area including enhanced physical security communication and coordination and research in the 107th congress the house passed legislation to authorize 200 million in grants for security activities at wastewater treatment plants hr 5169 similar legislation was introduced in the senate s 3037 but further action occurred 27 for information see crs report rl32189 terrorism and security issues facing the water infrastructure sector by claudia copeland crs22 congress did enact legislation directing medium and large drinking water utilities to assess their vulnerabilities to terrorist attack and authorizing 160 million in grants for these utilities to conduct assessments pl 107188 following on those new requirements affecting drinking water utilities in the th 108 congress the house passed legislation that would have authorized 200 million in grants to wastewater utilities to conduct vulnerability assessments and an additional 20 million for technical assistance and improved assessment tools hr 866 the senate environment and public works committee approved similar bill s 1039 further action occurred due in part to concerns expressed by some that the legislation would not mandate vulnerability assessments and would not require that they be submitted to epa as is the case with drinking water assessments required by pl 107188 wastewater security issues again received attention in the 109th congress in may 2006 the senate environment and public works committee approved s 2781 srept 109345 it was similar to s 1039 in the 108th congress in that it would have encouraged wastewater utilities to conduct vulnerability assessments and would have authorized 220 million to assist utilities with assessments and preparation of site security plans it also included provisions responding to march 2006 gao report that found that wastewater utilities have made little effort to address vulnerabilities of collection systems which may be used by terrorists to introduce hazardous substances or as access points for underground travel to potential target s 2781 would have authorized epa to conduct research on this topic during committee consideration of the bill an amendment was rejected that would have required rather than encouraged treatment works to conduct vulnerability assessments and also would have required highrisk facilities to switch from using chlorine and similar hazardous substances to other chemicals that are often referred to as inherently safer technologies further action occurred on this bill bill in the 110th congress s 1968 would authorize grants for vulnerability assessments and security enhancements at wastewater treatment and drinking water treatment plants and also would authorize research activities there was action on this bill nonpoint pollution management prior to the 1987 cwa amendments the acts requirements focused primarily on controlling pollution from point sources that is discharges from wastewater treatment plants and industrial facilities yet as industrial and municipal sources have abated pollution uncontrolled nonpoint sources have become relatively larger portion of remaining water quality problems perhaps contributing as much as 50 of the nations water pollution nonpoint pollution is rainfall or snowmelt runoff from farm and urban areas as well as construction forestry and mining sites in 1987 congress added new section 319 to the act to strengthen the law regarding this major contributor to water pollution by requiring states to develop and implement programs to control nonpoint sources of pollution states were required to identify waters not expected to meet water quality standards because of nonpoint source pollution and to implement plans for managing pollution from runoff federal grants totaling 400 million were authorized to cover as much as 60 of the costs of implementing states management plan at issue today is what progress is being made to manage nonpoint source pollution and what additional efforts may be needed involving section 319 or other crs23 public and private activities several concerns have been raised about the program such as whether state plans have comprehensively addressed their nonpoint pollution problems some observers are critical of the largely voluntary nature of the section 319 program consisting of all carrot but stick while others argue that the types of individual land management decisions that are needed to manage nonpoint source pollution cannot be regulated in the same ways that industrial sources are controlled funding has become an important issue as states moved from assessment and plan development to management since congress intended that section 319 funds be used primarily to implement nonpoint pollution controls on the ground precise estimates of management costs are not available because so much depends on the sitespecific nature of problems and solutions however in 1994 epa estimated that current and planned spending by private sources states and cities under provisions of current law is between 750 million and 11 billion per year without adequate funding to implement state management plans it is doubtful that much will be achieved under section 319 to control nonpoint source pollution because agricultural activities are known to be significant source of nonpoint pollution nationwide the adequacy of efforts to address these sources has received much attention questions have been raised about the 319 grant programs efficacy and overlap with farm bill conservation funding in particular the white house office of management and budget omb found that epa had not demonstrated results under the program and has urged the agency to shift its focus away from implementing projects in agricultural areas and toward implementing plans in impaired waters state officials have been concerned that omb is not fully aware of the extent to which section 319 funds address range of nonpoint pollution control needs beyond the agricultural sector strategy concerning animal feeding operations as noted previously epas water quality reports identify agricultural activities as the leading contributor to water quality impairments nationwide animal feeding operations afos are only subset of the agriculture category but because more than onehalf of the states specifically identify afos as contributing to impairments public and policy attention has increased on how to minimize public health and environmental impacts of runoff from them afos are agricultural facilities that confine livestock and their feeding activities thus concentrating animal populations and waste animal waste is frequently applied to land for disposal and to utilize the nutrient value of manure to benefit crops if not managed properly however it can pose risks to water quality and public health contributing pollutants such as nutrients sediment pathogens and ammonia to the environment clean water regulations issued in the 1970s required discharge permits for the largest afos termed confined animal feeding operations cafos however epa acknowledged that compliance and enforcement of these permit rules was poor less than onethird of covered facilities actually have permits and that the regulations themselves were outdated in december 2002 epa issued revised rules to regulate waste discharges from cafos among the key elements the rules include requirements for development of nutrient management plans to better manage land application of manure epa estimated that 15500 cafos would be regulated by the rule at an annual compliance cost of 335 million farm groups said that the crs24 regulations are generally workable and consistent with environmental initiatives in the 2002 farm bill pl 107171 but environmental groups criticized the rule for inadequately addressing animal waste runoff problems28 january 2003 gao report concluded that the rules will be ineffective unless epa increases its oversight of state regulatory programs which have primary responsibility for ensuring compliance by feedlot operators29 in february 2005 federal court issued ruling in set of challenges to the cafo rule waterkeeper alliance american farm bureau et v epa 399 f3d 486 2d cir 2005 the litigation involved challenges to the permitting scheme of the rule the type of discharges subject to regulation and the effluent limitations established in the rules the court upheld major parts of the epa rule held in favor of some of industrys challenges held in favor of several of environmentalists challenges and in some cases directed epa to explain more fully why it did or did not do certain things with regard to specific provisions of the rule in october 2008 epa issued final revisions to the 2003 cafo rule in response to the courts decision30 other implementation issues also of legislative interest are the impacts of court rulings in several cases concerning implementation of existing provisions of the law and involving questions of whether certain activities require clean water act discharge permit fundamental element of the act is the requirement that the discharge of pollutant from point source shall be carried out pursuant to permit authorized by the national pollutant discharge elimination system npdes program under section 402 of the law in 2004 the supreme court held that the transfer of polluted water from one waterbody to another requires permit notwithstanding that new pollutant is added in the process of transfer south florida water management district v miccosukee tribe of indians 124 s ct 1537 200431 the decision raised concerns in agricultural areas where such transfers often occur in supplying irrigation water presently without permit congress has not held oversight hearings on impacts of the courts decision and legislation that might address the ruling has not been introduced in response to the courts ruling in june 2008 epa promulgated rule defining categories or types of water transfers that the agency believes do not require npdes permits the rule which supports epas longstanding legal interpretation of the cwa is controversial and was quickly challenged in federal courts by the miccosukee indian tribe of florida and environmental advocates 28 for additional information see crs report rl31851 animal

requirements of federal law including the federal insecticide fungicide and rodenticide act fifra these and related decisions drew the attention of many pesticide applicators including public health entities such as mosquito control districts concerned with how the rulings might affect their need to control pests associated with diseases such as the west nile virus in november 2006 epa finalized
