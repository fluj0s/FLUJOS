the citys elected leadership have considered legislation concerning the future role of the cfo after the restoration of home rule the office of the cfo ocfo has played critical role in the citys success in maintaining budget discipline and its return to fiscal health the city has considered legislation that makes the ocfo permanent part of the citys governing structure without such legislation the ocfo will cease to exist beyond september 30 2001 the end of the control period3 in july 2001 conference committee considering supplemental appropriations for the district of columbia for fy2001 considered but later withdrew proposal regarding the districts chief financial officer the proposal sought to strengthen the powers of the office by giving the cfo subpoena powers and access to all city agencies records further the proposal would have extended the ocfos independence from the mayor to fy2006 in addition the plan would have permitted the mayor to appoint cfo and would have given that official control of the agencys 68 million budget 1000 employees legal counsel and contracts the proposal was introduced in part to fill an oversight void that will be created by the departing financial control board which ceases to exist on october 1 2001 the plan was withdrawn during conference committee consideration of the bill in deference to legislation being considered by the city council on june 19 2001 the city council held public hearing on the independence of the chief financial officer establishment act of 2001 b140254 the legislation makes the position of cfo

both houses of congress are in session public benefits corporation during the past year city leaders and congress have attempted to address problems and controversies surrounding the public benefits corporation pbc dc general hospital and the restructuring of the citys health care delivery system for uninsured residents of the city in november 2000 congress included provision in the district of columbia appropriations act of fy2001 pl 106522 prohibiting the pbc from borrowing funds from the district of columbia government in addition the act required the mayor the city council the authority the cfo and the chair of the board of directors of the pbc to develop and approve restructuring plan for dc general hospital reform in the citys delivery of health care to the poor was sought by congress because of the welldocumented problems of the pbc and its mismanagement of dc general hospital since 1997 the pbc amassed 109 million in unbudgeted loans from the city using its power to borrow from the citys general fund in anticipation of medicaid reimbursements these unbudgeted loans were used by the pbc to cover deficit spending and defer mounting debt however the hospital did poor job in seeking reimbursement for treatment in addition to its poor financial management the pbc had been the subject of newspaper stories detailing questionable hiring practices including the hiring of friends and relatives of city council members and former associates of the executive director of the pbc the pbc was also thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31013crs5 subject of critical report by health care consultants cambio health solutions hired by the pbc in 2000 the consultants criticized the pbc for 1 lack of oversight by the pbcs board of directors 2 poor patient care 3 undocumented or poorly documented overtime and 4 the lack of health care experience among some members of the pbcs management team the consultants recommended the downsizing and restructuring of the hospital from 250bed advance trauma center to community access hospital or urgent care facility that treats and releases or transfers patients within 23 hours of admittance by late august 2000 the downsizing of the hospital staff had begun with the announcement that 550 employees of the 2000person workforce would be laid off before the end of the year in december 2000 the mayor with the support of the authority had formalized proposal that downsized dc general hospital and provided health care services through contract with group of private health care providers led by greater southeast community hospital the mayors proposal was not supported by majority of the city council on march 6 2001 the city council unanimously passed resolution rejecting the authoritys recommendation for the awarding of contract for health care services for the uninsured to greater southeast community hospital several city council members expressed concern that the privatization proposal would erect new barriers to care for the citys 65000 uninsured residents the majority of the city council preferred keeping dc general as fullservice hospital their plan involved providing the hospital with 21 million in assistance that would have been used to keep it open until the end of the fiscal year which was also the end of the control period and the authoritys powers during this time the city could find more permanent solution short of downsizing or closing the hospital after 2001 the city council would be in strong position to override the mayors veto without the threat of the control board negating their veto override on april 30 2001 the authority used its veto power to negate city council s override of mayoral veto of the 21 million city council proposal that would have kept dc general hospital open until september 30 2001 the end of the 2001 fiscal year in addition the authority voted to dissolve the pbc and transferred its responsibilities to the citys department of health the authority signed an agreement with greater southeast community hospital corporation and the healthcare alliance to provide health care services to the citys uninsured residents the authoritys actions were controversial and represented departure from its more recent efforts to allow the citys elected officialsthe mayor and the city councilto work out their policy differences the action was taken after the city council rejected the mayors proposal for revamping the citys health care service delivery system and voted on april 27 2001 to override mayoral veto and provide 21 million in fy2001 supplemental assistance to the pbc the control boards constitutional authority to exercise such power was challenged in court by two members of the city council and several unions representing hospital employees on april 30 2001 city council members kevin chavous and david cantania filed suit in the united states district court for the district of columbia challenging the authoritys powers to award the contract for health care services and to dissolve the pbc the council members suit argues thathttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31013crs6 4the committee was created in april 1999 and was to issue report one year later the committee has not yet issued final report the control board acted without statutory authority and over the objection of the city council which on march 6 2001 unanimously passed resolution rejecting the authoritys recommendation for the awarding of contract for health care services for the uninsured to greater southeast community hospital the court which issued its opinion on august 6 2001 found that only the council members had standing to bring suit against the authority the court further found that although the council members had standing to bring suit the authority acted within the powers granted it by congress under pl 1048 when it overrode the city council and awarded the contract school reform in june 2000 voters approved by referendum an amendment to the citys home rule charter the referendum changed the structure of the board of education it abolished the 11member board comprising one person elected from each of the citys eight wards and threeincluding the chairelected atlarge the composition of the new ninemember board of education includes four members elected to represent four school districts an elected chair of the board and four members appointed by the mayor this new structure gives the mayor significant voice in determining the direction of public education and it makes him more accountable by way of his appointments for the future success or failure of the citys public schools in november 2000 voters elected chair and four members to the new board of education and the mayor subsequently appointed four others the citys new ninemember school board began its oversight of the school system in january 2001 earlier this summer the board announced threeyear contract extension with superintendent paul vance the move was applauded by parents city officials and congressional leaders the reformminded board of education and superintendent face several challenges including improving special education raising academic achievement and improving the physical facilities the board also faces issues concerning its oversight of charter schools and skepticism about the effectiveness of school board composed of appointed and elected members and its ability to avoid the pitfalls that have confronted other school reform efforts november 22 2000 report by the districts inspector general was critical of the school systems inability to provide adequate transportation services for special education students in 1999 district court assigned special master to monitor the situation in addition an unreleased draft report by the city council special council committee on special education4 has detailed problems in the districts delivery of other special education services the draft report is critical of district of columbia public schools dcps past operation of special education programs and the process for the evaluation of student needs for special services among the recommendations contained in the draft report are the following 1 that the dcps strengthen its commitment to provide adequate and qualified staff in the delivery of special education services 2 that the dcps improve its management ofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31013crs7 transportation costs and the dependability of transportation services and 3 that the dcps improve the process used to assess and place students with special needs students performance on standardized reading and math tests again has disappoin ted school administrators remaining stagnant for the second consecutive year despite this lack of progress superintendent paul vance remains optimistic that improvement will be made in the coming years the dcps has hired at least 29 new principals and has begun to implement its strategic plan which includes efforts to improve the dcpss interaction with other city agencies the plan also holds principals accountable for school performance the lack of progress in improving academic performance in the public schools has fueled the growth of public charter schools nearly 10000 studentsone in every 10 studentsare enrolled in one of the approximately 34 public charter schools in the district at least 17 of these schools were chartered by the board of education with the remainder receiving charters from the public charter school board which was created by congress when its passed charter school legislation in 1996 the lack of consistency between the two governing bodies charged with granting and overseeing charter schools and the increased costs of regulating charter schools are two of the concerns about the existence of two chartering authorities for additional information on charter schools in the district of columbia see the dc appleseed center report entitled charter schools in the district of columbia improving systems for accountability autonomy and competition april 2001 on september 6 2001 city and school officials announced an 80 million budget deficit for fy2001 the overspending mostly cost overruns in special education and the failure to document properly special education expenses submitted for medicaid reimbursement will be offset by hiring freezes fund transfers and unanticipated growth in tax revenue though the deficit does not jeopardize the citys return to home rule the unanticipated overspending was source of embarrassment for school officials the cfo and the citys elected leaders in order to deal with the deficit school board officials announced that they were considering shortenin g the school year by 7 days the school board reconsidered after the idea was criticized by congressional members and the citys elected leadership and after city leaders provided an additional 10 million in funding for the remaining school year receiverships during the past year the district government successfully removed four agencies from control by courtappointed receivers in september 2000 the districts housing authority and the district of columbia jail medical services were returned to district control working with the courts and advocacy groups mayor williams and his administrati on were able to negotiate the return of the mental health services and child and family services to district control although the return of the departments was major accomplishment for the mayor the inability of the two courtappointed receivers to make significant progress in the delivery of services also played role in the courts willingness to return administrative control to the district government on october 23 2000 district court judge thomas hogan approved plan for returning the child and family services agency to district control by the summer ofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31013crs8 2001 the agency had been under receivership since august 1995 following findings in lashawn v williams that the agency failed to provide adequate supervision of children under its care and that children under its care were abused and neglected the judges consent decree of october 23 2000 established 26 preconditions and sixmonth probationary period before the agency could return to district control the conditions imposed by the consent decree included prohibiting budget cuts and layoffs increasing the number of home visits by social workers passing legislation that would place the responsibility for investigating abuse and neglect cases with child and family services rather than splitting the duty between the police and the agency developing licensing standards for foster care and group homes and elevating the agency to cabinetlevel status the child and family services agency establishment act of 2001 was passed on april 4 2001 elevating the agency to cabinetlevel status and fulfilling one of the final requirements for termination of the receivership on may 21 2001 judge hogan entered an order terminating the receivership effective july 15 2001 in addition congress is considering legislation that would amend and restructure the family court division of the district of columbia superior court the house bill hr 2657 and the senate bill s 1382 would increase to 15 the number of judges assigned to family court and would require judges assigned to family court to have expertise in family law agree to participate in ongoing training and serve for minimum term of three to five years congressional interest in reforming family court can be traced to the tragic death of 23monthold child briana blackmon who was beaten to death after family court judge ordered that the child be returned to her mentally unstable mother in may 2001 the city council passed the department of mental health establishment emergency amendment act of 2001 passage of the act was one of the requirements for the transfer of the commission on mental health services back to district government control the agency had been under the control of court appointed receiver since 1997 much of the support for returning the agency to city control centered on the receivers inability to manage the agency adequately newspaper series chronicled the agencys problems including the deaths of 24 mentally retarded or developmentally disabled group home residents since 1999 future role of the authority and the cfo the district of columbia financial responsibility and management assistance act pl 1048 identified four conditions for the ending of control period and the return to home rule the district must demonstrate that 1 all obligations arising from the authoritys issuance of bonds notes or other obligations have been discharged 2 all borrowing by the

httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31013crs9 4 the district has achieved balanced or surplus budgets for four consecutive fiscal years on february 14 2001 the authority announced that the district of columbia

policy issues needle exchange the continuation of needle exchange program funded with federal or district funds is one of several key policy issues that congress considered when approving the districts appropriations act for fy2002 the controversy surrounding funding needle exchange program touched on issues of home rule public health policy and governm ent sanctioning and facilitating the use of illegal drugs proponents of needle exchange program contend that such programs reduce the spread of hiv among illegal drug users by reducing the incidence of shared needles opponents of these efforts contend that such programs amount to government sanctioning of illegal drugs by supplying drugaddicted persons with the tools to use them in addition they content that public health concerns raised about the spread of aids and hiv through shared contaminated needles should be addressed through drug treatment and rehabilitation programs another view in the debate focuses on the issue of home rule and the citys ability to use local funds to institute such programs free from congressional actions the prohibition on the use of federal and district funds for needle exchange program was first approved by congress as section 170 of the district of columbia appropriations act for fy1999 pl 105277 the 1999 act did allow private funding of needle exchange programs the district of columbia appropriations act for fy2001 pl 106522 continued the prohibition on the use of federal and district funds for needle exchange program and restricted where privately funded needle exchange activities could take place section 150 of the district of columbia appropriations act for fy2001 makes it unlawful to distribute any needle or syringe for the hypodermic injection of any illegal drug in any area in the city that is within 1000 feet of public elementary or secondary school including any public charter school provisions contained in an earlier house version of the district of columbia appropriations act for fy2000 hr 3194 would have prohibited any organization that received federal or district funds from funding needle exchange program with private funds this prohibition was dropped during conference consideration of the bill which was signed by the president on november 29 1999 presently only one entity prevention works private nonprofit aids awareness and education program operates privately funded needle exchange program at minimum district officials were seeking to remove restrictions on needle exchange activities and to lift the prohibition on the use of district funds for needle exchange programs the final version of the act pl 10796 lifts the restriction that prohibits the operation of needle exchange programs within 1000 feet of public elementary and secondary schools including public charter schools it also maintains the restriction on the use of federal and district funds for needle exchange programs the bill as initially approved by the house would have continued the prohibition on the use of federal and local government funding of needle exchange programs the senate bill would have allowed the use of local government funds for needle exchange programs but would have maintained the prohibition on the use of federal funds httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31013crs23 medical marijuana the medical marijuana initiative provision in the district of columbia appropriations legislation is another issue that engenders controversy the district of columbia appropriations act for fy1999 pl 105277 included provision that prohibited the city from counting ballots of voterapproved initiative that would have allowed the medical use of marijuana to assist persons suffering debilitating health conditions and diseases including cancer and hiv infection congresss power prohibiting the counting of medical marijuana ballot initiative was challenged in suit filed by the dc chapter of the american civil liberties union aclu on september 17 1999 district court judge richard roberts ruled that congress despite its unique legislative responsibility for the district under article i section 8 of the constitution did not possess the power to stifle or prevent political speech which included the ballot initiative this ruling allowed the city to tally the votes on the november 1998 ballot initiative to prevent the implementation of the initiative congress had 30 days to pass resolution of disapproval from the date the medical marijuana ballot initiative initiative 59 was certified by the board of elections and ethics language prohibiting the implementation of the initiative was included in pl 106113 the district of columbia appropriations act for fy2000 opponents of the provision contend that it and similar actions undercut the concept of home rule the district of columbia appropriations act for fy2002 pl 10796 includes provision that continues to prohibit the district government from implementing the initiative abortion provision the public funding of abortion services for district of columbia residents is perennial issue debated by congress during its annual deliberations on the district of columbia appropriations district officials cite the prohibition on the use of district funds as just another example of congressional intrusion into local matters the district of columbia appropriations act for fy2001 pl 106522 includes provision prohibiting the use of federal or district funds for abortion services except in cases where the life of the mother is endangered or the pregnancy is the result of rape or incest this prohibition has been in place since 1995 when congress approved the district of columbia act for fy1996 pl 104134 since 1979 with the passage of the district of columbia appropriations act of 1980 pl 9693 congress has placed some limitation or prohibition on the use of public funds for abortion services for district residents from 1979 to 1988 congress restricted the use of federal funds for abortion services to cases where the mothers life would be endangered or the pregnancy resulted from rape and incest the district was free to use district funds for abortion services when congress passed the district of columbia appropriations act for fy1989 pl 100462 it restricted the use of district and federal funds for abortion services to cases where the mothers life would be endangered if the pregnancy was taken tohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31013crs24 term the inclusion of district funds and the elimination of rape or incest as qualifying conditions for public funding of abortion services was endorsed by president reagan who threatened to veto the districts appropriations act if the abortion provision was not modified in 1989 president bush twice vetoed the districts fy1990 appropriations act over the abortion issue he signed pl 101168 after insisting that congress include language prohibiting the use of district revenues to pay for abortion services except in cases where the mothers life was endangered the district successfully fought for the removal of the provision limiting district funding of abortion services when congress considered and passed the district of columbia appropriations act for fy1994 pl 103127 the fy1994 act also reinstated rape and incest as qualifying circumstances allowing for the public funding of abortion services the districts success was short lived the district of columbia appropriations act for fy1996 pl 104134 and subsequent district of columbia appropriations acts limited the use of district and federal funds for abortion services to cases where the mothers life is endangered or cases where the pregnancy was the result of rape or incest the prohibition on the use of district and federal funds is included in the house senate and conference versions of the district of columbia appropriations act for fy2002 pl 10796 district of columbia antiterrorism appropriations the fy2002 district of columbia appropriations bill as approved by the senate appropriations committee on october 11 2001 and the house on september 25 2001 included 16 million in funding for emergency planning the
