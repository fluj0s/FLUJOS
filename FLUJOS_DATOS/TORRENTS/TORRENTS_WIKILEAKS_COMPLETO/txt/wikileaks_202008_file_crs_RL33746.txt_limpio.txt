failures summary the growth of hedge funds private highrisk unregulated investment pools for wealthy individuals and institutions has been striking development in financial markets there are now about 8000 funds with perhaps 15 trillion under management both figures are roughly 10 times what they were decade ago hedge funds are said to account for 2030 of trading volume in us stocks and at times even higher proportions in more specialized instruments such as convertible bonds and credit derivatives their trades can move markets since hedge fund investment is limited by law to the very wealthy who are presumed to be capable of understanding the risks and bearing the losses of financial speculation the traditional view has been that there is public interest in regulating them many still hold this view however as their size and presence in the markets has grown hedge funds have attracted scrutiny from regulators and congress does hedge fund trading now create risk exposure outside the relatively narrow circle of their principals and investors there are two ways this could happen first the failure of large fund or number with similar portfolios could pose risks to banks and other creditors if hedge funds had to liquidate large market position quickly prices could fall sharply widening the circle of losses it was to avoid such an outcome that the federal reserve organized rescue of the longterm capital management ltcm hedge fund in 1998 because it judged that default posed an unacceptable risk of disruption to the financial system since financial turmoil began in mid2007 however there have been relatively few hedge fund failures and none that has posed systemic threat hedge funds are one focus of the securities and exchange commissions sec investigation into abusive short selling of financial stocks second investor protection concerns have emerged as the popularity of hedge fund investment has grown hedge funds are open only to accredited investors defined as those with over 1 million in assets in the past this standard seemed high enough to exclude the small unsophisticated investors who provide the rationale for government regulation however since the 1 million figure includes the value of an individuals residence rising home prices and inflation have lifted many who are not necessarily expert in financial matters over the accredited threshold at the same time institutional investors like pension funds and university endowments are placing more of their money in hedge funds which means that rankandfile workers retirees and others may be unwittingly exposed to hedge fund losses this report lists major hedge fund failures since ltcm because hedge funds are unregulated and do not file public financial statements reports of the amount of losses and the reasons for failure are usually second hand and subject to inaccuracies the list is based on sources crs considers generally reliable but there are real limits on the availability of information for general discussion of hedge funds see crs report 94511 hedge funds should they be regulated by mark jickling this report will be updated as events warrant contents background 1 why hedge funds fail 3 list of tables table 1 selected hedge fund failures and losses since longterm capital management 5 acknowledgment alison raab was an original author of this report heather durkin negley contributed to several updates hedge fund failures background in 1998 the federal reserve bank of new york organized rescue of long term capital management ltcm hedge fund that was on the brink of collapse in exchange for providing about 3 billion to meet the funds shortterm cash obligations 14 of ltcms chief creditors including some of the bestknown wall street firms became the new owners of the hedge funds portfolio the feds intervention was very unusual because investment in hedge funds is by law limited to wealthy individuals and institutions who are presumed to be capable of understanding the risks and bearing the losses of speculation regulators do not normally view hedge fund failure as cause for government action their strong preference is to let hedge funds collapse rather than send signal to other market participants that they too might be rescued from their mistakes in the ltcm case however the fed concluded that default might have repercussions far beyond the losses that would accrue to the hedge funds principals and investors1 investors had about 3 billion in ltcm but the fund had borrowed to accumulate bond portfolio of about 100 billion and had assumed derivatives positions with notional value of about 1 trillion the fed feared that default might have jeopardized the solvency of ltcms creditors which included several of the worlds largest financial institutions and its numerous derivatives counterparties moreover if ltcm had been forced to liquidate its positions quickly prices of bonds and other instruments might have been severely depressed and other holders would have suffered unexpected losses even though they had had dealings whatsoever with ltcm given that global markets were already under stress at the time russia had defaulted on its sovereign debt and asia was experiencing second round of financial crises and investor confidence was low the fed chose to intervene rather than risk widespread disruption to the financial system the possibility that the failure of single institution could set off cascading failures throughout the financial system is known as systemic risk the classic case is banking crisis where trouble in one bank can trigger runs on others including financially sound institutions if enough depositors decide to withdraw their funds as precaution with ltcm regulators recognized that hedge funds can also be source of systemic risk there are several possible scenarios first single hedge fund could grow large enough to pose systemic threat if its investments were concentrated in single market and constituted significant share of that of that 1 for more on the ltcm neardefault and on hedge funds generally see crs report 94 511 hedge funds should they be regulated by mark jickling crs2 market in practice this is unlikely to happen as suggested by the case of the amaranth hedge fund which collapsed in september 2006 after losing about 6 billion in natural gas markets without major impact on the price of gas or other energy commodities the risk increases however if number of hedge funds make similar investments and incur losses simultaneously or if other institutions such as commercial or investment banks copy hedge fund strategies2 hedge funds may also generate systemic risk when they are successful during the asian crises of 19971998 central bankers and regulators in several countries blamed hedge funds for manipulating currency prices and doing serious harm to the real economies in addition some observers believe that hedge fund speculation played role in high and volatile us energy prices in 2005 and 20063 in 2008 as share prices of financial institutions plunged short selling by hedge funds perhaps abetted by the spreading of false information became focus of securities and exchange commission sec investigation4 postltcm perceptions of systemic risk are not the only policy concern associated with hedge fund failure as hedge fund investment has become more popular new investor protection concerns have emerged hedge funds are open only to accredited investors defined as those with assets worth over 1 million in the past this standard seemed high enough to exclude the small unsophisticated investors who provide the rationale for government regulation of securities markets however since the 1 million figure includes the value of an individuals residence rising home prices have lifted many who are not necessarily expert in financial matters over the accredited threshold decade ago most hedge funds required minimum investment of 200000 or more beyond the reach of most households whose assets were concentrated in their homes as result of competition and the growing number of hedge funds however there are now funds that will accept amounts as low as 20000 at the same time pension funds foundations and other institutional investors are placing more and more of their money in hedge funds which means that rankandfile workers retirees and others may be unwittingly exposed to hedge funds losses the sec has cited this retailization of hedge funds as reason to impose some form of disclosure requirements on the funds or their managers5 2 this was the case with ltcm the fund was able to borrow extensively and on very favorable terms in part because the lenders wanted information about ltcms strategy which was devised by nobel prizewinners and executed by legendary wall street traders 3 see senate permanent subcommittee on investigations excessive speculation in the natural gas market staff report june

retailization of hedge funds as distressing move that raised the possibility that less sophisticated investors might not understand the inherent risks see also implications of the growth of hedge funds sec staff study september 2003 pp 8082 crs3 systemic risk and investor protection concerns make hedge fund failure subject of regulatory and legislative interest table 1 below provides basic information about the most prominent hedge fund failures since the ltcm episode the list is not comprehensive many funds fail each year without attracting much notice because the list has been generated by searching periodical literature databases principally proquest nexis and factiva the cases included have been newsworthy for one reason or another generally because of their size the amount of investor losses the risky or exotic trading strategies employed or because fraud was involved and thus should not be taken as representative of the entire hedge fund industry why hedge funds fail although some employ very conservative investment strategies hedge funds can generally be characterized as highrisk highreturn operations pursuit of risk implies high failure rate various studies have estimated that from 7 to 10 of hedge funds fail each year6 estimates of the number of hedge funds range from 7000 to 9000 which suggests that several hundred funds cease operations each year recent study7 distinguishes between three reasons for hedge fund failure financial issues or losses stemming from unfavorable market moves operational issues such as errors in trade processing or mispricing complex opaque financial instruments and fraud or misbehavior by fund management the most common cause is undoubtedly the first when hedge funds fail to earn the hopedfor returns they are generally unable to attract new investors and managers find it unprofitable to continue the normal course is to dissolve the fund in accordance with the partnership agreement and return funds to investors in many cases investors suffer loss at all other than the opportunity cost of their failure to select more profitable fund and the end of the hedge fund receives public notice such failures are not captured in the table below when financial losses to hedge funds are sudden or severe investors are likely to suffer major losses and the event is more likely to be reported in the press several such cases are listed below it is noteworthy however that none of the post ltcm failures has appeared to pose such risk to the financial system that the 6 see eg naohiko babo and hiromichi

conference on the risks of financial institutions august 2005 p 51 7 constantin christory stephane daul and jeanrene giraud quantification of hedge fund default risk journal of alternative investments fall 2006 pp 7186 crs4 federal reserve has had to intervene nor have there been waves of hedge fund failures stemming from major market movements such as the bear market in stocks of 20002002 the subsequent sharp fall in interest rates or the energy price volatility that followed the invasion of iraq the most recent episodes however show that problems in the subprime mortgage market and perhaps other corporate debt markets have caused difficulties for number of funds around the world when the market turmoil that began in the summer of 2007 has subsided the multiple failures may be seen as having constituted significant risk to the system the incidence of failure as result of operational issues is probably much lower but is difficult to judge because hedge funds disclose so little information about themselves operational concerns have been addressed by regulators however in october 2005 the federal reserve bank of new york convened meeting of 14 major credit derivatives dealers to address backoffice problems and to set goals to reduce the backlog of unprocessed trades in that market where hedge funds play significant role8 where fraud is involved in hedge fund failure legal and regulatory actions ensure that an unusual amount of information is made public about the fund and the circumstances of the failure9 thus cases of fraud are likely to be overrepresented in any tabulation of failures while the sec has noted many times that the lack of disclosure makes hedge fund fraud potentially serious problem10 there is consensus as to whether actual fraud is more common among hedge funds than other types of private investment vehicles limited information is available about the relative frequency of these three reasons for failure christory daul and giraud categorize 109 cases of hedge fund default between 1994 and 2005 and find that 54 involved fraud 33 involved financial issues and 13 involved operational issues11 sometimes the categories may overlap some cases of fraud begin with financial losses that fund managers seek to cover up by reporting false earnings data to investors 8 statement regarding developments in the
