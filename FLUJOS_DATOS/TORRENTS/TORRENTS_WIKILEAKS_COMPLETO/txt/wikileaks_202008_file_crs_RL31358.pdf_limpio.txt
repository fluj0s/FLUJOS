disease and other diseases president bush announced in august 2001 that for the first time federal funds would be used to support research on human embryonic stem cells but funding would be limited to existing stem cell lines federal funds can not be used for the cloning of human embryos for any purpose including stem cell research in july 2002 the presidents council on bioethics released its report on human cloning which unanimously recommended ban on reproductive cloning and by vote of 10 to 7 fouryear moratorium on cloni ng for medical research purposes the ethical issues surrounding reproductive cloni ng commodification safety identity and therapeutic cloning embryos moral st atus relief of suffering impact various proposals for regulation restrictions bans and uses of federal funding in january 2002 the national academies released scientific and medical aspects of human reproductive cloning it recommended that the us ban human reproductive cloning aimed at creating child it suggested the ban be enforceable and carry substantial penalties the pa nel noted that the ban should be reconsidered within five years however the panel concluded th at cloning to produce stem cells should be permitted because of the potential for veloping new therapies and advancing biomedical knowledge on may 24 2005 the house passed hr 810 castle which would allow federal support of research that uses human embryonic stem cells regardless of the date on which the stem cells were derived from human embryo thus negating the bush stem cell policy limitation on existing stem cell lines in july of 2006 the senate passed hr 810 nd president bush vetoed it the first veto of his presidency an attempt in the house to override th veto was unsuccessful action on the weldon bill which passed the house in the 108th congress and stalle d in the senate is also possible it was reintroduced in the 109th congress as hr 1357 and s 658 brownback the bill bans the process of cloning as well as the importation of any product derived from an embryo created vi cloning it bans not only reproductive applications but also research on therap eutic uses which has implications for stem cell research advocates of the legislative ban say that allowing any form of human cloning research to proceed raises serious ethical issues and w ill inevitably lead to the birth of baby that is human

report human embryo produced via cloning involves the process called somatic cell1 nuclear transfer scnt in scnt the nucleus of an egg is removed and replaced by the nucleus from mature body cell such as skin cell in cloning the embryo is created without sexual reproduction there is joining of egg and sperm concern over the possibility of producin g human clone increased with the announcement on february 24 1997 that scien tists in scotland had used scnt in 1996 to produce the first cloned adult ma mmal dolly the sheep ian wilmuts group at the roslin institute in edinburgh removed the nucleus from sheep egg and replaced it with the nucleus of mammary gland cell from an adult sheep the resulting embryo was then transferred to the uterus of surrogate sheep total of 277 such embryos were transfe rred but only one lamb was born2 analyses of dollys genetic material confirmed that she was derived from the sheep mammary cell dolly was euthanized on february 14 2003 after developing lung infection although some claim that her somewhat early death at six years was related to being clone scientists at the roslin institute believe her ailment may be due to the fact that she was raised indoors for security r easons rather than as pastured sheep which can live to 11 or 12 years of age3 although scientists have been successf ul in using scnt to produce other animals such as cat goat cow horse mu pig mouse and rabbit the efficiency of the procedure is still very low and frequently results in bnormal development proponents maintain that one day cloning may be very useful for number

efficiency of creating human cloned embryos using scnt and in isolating human stem cells from the cloned embryos these eleven new stem cell lines were derived using cells from patients with either spinal cord injury diabetes or an immune deficiency and offered the hope of one day provi ding treatments with patientmatched cells4 the team attributed the improved success rate in part to the use of freshly harvested eggs from younger fertile women instead of leftover eggs from older women who recei ved fertility treatments5 however serious concerns about the achievements of the snu group began in november 2005 when coauthor of th 2005 paper gerald schatten of the university of pittsburgh accused woo suk hwang the lead researcher of the snu group of ethical misconduct6 in violation of some ethi cal standards and contrary to statements made in the 2005 paper junior scientists in the s nu lab secretly donated their own eggs for the experiments and they along with other women received payment for their role the accusation halted plans for collaboration between the snu scientists and us and uk labs that had been announced only one month earlier and resulted in hwang resigning from

to the chemicals after five days six eggs had matured into larger mass of cells before division st opped none of the embryos developed by act divided sufficiently to produce stem cells act suspended its work in 2004 the goal of acts work was to produce human embryonic stem cells and develop new therapies for diseases such as diabetes and parkinsons disease24 scientists believe that stem cells transplanted into patient could treat disease or injury by replacing damaged tissue if the cell nucleus used in scnt is from the patient the stem cells would be genetically identical to the patient recognized by the patients immune system and would avoid any tissue rej ection problems that could occur in other stem cell therapeutic approaches because of this many scientists believe the scnt technique ma provide the best hope of eventually treating patients using stem cells for tissue transplantation others with human cloning intentions within year of the dolly announcement concerns over human cloning were heightened when dr richard seed chicago scientist announced on january 7 1998 his intention to clone human being in response bills were introduced in the 105th congress that would

and that attempts to produce cloned child would be highly unethical64 the national bioethics advisory commission reached consensus in its objection to reproductive cloning because current scientific information indicated that this technique was not safe in humans65 the national academies agrees with this line of reasoning given that animal experimentation has demonstrated that only small percentage of attempts are successful many of the clones die during gestation nd newborn clones are often abnormal or die66 while these objections about safety are widely held they may be temporary in nature as research advances it may become less risky and thus some may find it less objectionable to attempt reproductive human cloning unlike concerns about safety other ty pes of objections while not so widely held may be more lasting because they are not likely to be alleviated by scientific progress these tend to be philosophical in nature these concerns listed in the following paragraphs have been acknowle dged by the presidents council nbac ucssb and the national academies according to the presidents council different council members give varying moral weight to the following different concerns67 only the ucssb found the c oncerns persuasive in total identity some objections to reproductive cloning are based upon fears that cloned children will have difficulty w ith their identities because each will be genetically virtually identical to human being who has already lived and because the expectations for their lives may be shadowed by constant comparisons to the life of the original68 these concerns are dismissed by others who point out that this argument rests largely on the crudest genetic determinism69 they cite both the effect that environment plays on individua

they are such an attitude toward children could also contribute to increased commercialization and industrialization of human procreation71 this in turn may fuel new eugenics in which parents lect not only whether to have child but which child to have72 others point out that these ty pes of concerns were raised about most forms of assisted reproduction such as in vitro fertilizati on and preimplantation genetic diagnosis which have not led to objectification in addition if being born is considered to be benefit to the one born to the extent that the technology is used to benefit the child objec tification of the child takes place73 familial relationships complicated lineage has also been introduced as an objection to reproductive cloning by confounding and transg ressing the natural boundaries between generations cloning coul d strain the social ties between them fathers could become twin brothers to their sons mothers could give birth to their genetic twins and gra

assi sted reproductive technologies may also have complicated re lationships to genetic gestational and rearing parents yet there is evid ence that confusion over family roles has harmed children born through assisted reproductive technologies although the subject has not been carefully studied75 societal view of children concerns have been voiced about the effects of cloning on society cloningtoproduce children would affect not only the direct participants but also the entire society that allows or supports this activity even if practiced on small scale it could affect the way society looks at children and set precedent for future nontherapeutic interv entions into the human genetic endowment or novel forms of control by one generation over the next76 this objection is

moral reasons for not regarding the embr in its earliest stages as the moral equivalent of human person but rather as having developing and intermediate moral worth that commands our special respect81 the minority based its opinion on the fact that at the blastocyst stage the one useful for stem cell research for example the cells are still undifferentiate d and could still be split and develop

to complex tissue culture and thereby bypass moral concerns about the creation and disruption of human embryos85 some have criticized dr hurlbuts proposal to create something that is not an embryo yet generates embryonic stem cells as one focused on semantic issue not scientific one86 others have lauded dr hurlbuts proposal as potential scientific solution to moral problem included among them is dr leon kass the ch air of the council and wellknown opponent of embryo destruction who said the proposal raises the possibility that the partisans of scientific progre ss and the defenders of nascen t human life can go forward in partnership without anyone having to violate things they hold dear87 deliberate creation for usedestruction second set of considerations underlying the debate have to do with mora l aversion to the prospect of creating life in order to destroy it as majority of the presidents council pointed out cloning for therapeutic purposes requires the creation of human life expressly and exclusively for the purpose of its use in re search research that necessarily involves its destruction transforming nascent human life into nothing more than resource tool88 the usccb agrees with this characterization the council minority countered that the embryos would not be created for destruction but for use in th service of life and medicine89 further thepractice of sacrificing the life of the unborn in orde r to save the live of the pregnant woman while not moral parallel to the cas of using cloned embryos for biomedical research shows that there is some moral

that honors moral limits that respects all life whether strong or weak and that refuses to secure the good of some human beings by sacrificing the lives of others91 approving therapeutic cloning would harm society by crossing the boundary from sexual to asexual reproduction thus approving in principle the genetic manipulation and control of nascent human life92 usccb also shares this point of view counter arguments have been made by those who note that historically scientific inquiry has been protected and even encouraged b ecause of the great societal benefit the public recognizes in maintaining the sanc tity of knowledge and the value of intellectual freedom93 in addition they note that cloning is replication rather than transformation in an importa nt sense cloning is not the most radical thing on the horizon much more significan t would be the ability to actually alter or manipulate the genome of offspring wh ich could then lead to child being born with characteristics other than it would have had94 the council minority nbac nancy reagan gerald ford and the n obel laureates share this perspective going too far or drawing appropriate limitations some such as the majority of the presiden ts council and usccb belie ve that policies allowing therapeutic cloning would cr eate slippery slope openi ng the door to other moral hazards such as cloningtoproducechildre

consensus on the need for an informati onrich coercionfree method of obtaining eggs however there is some disagreement on the specifics of whether payment for eggs necessarily constitutes coercion the prospect of paying women for thei r eggs which has been debated in the context of seeking donor eggs both for re productive purposes for example to enable women who do not produce their own eggs to become pregnant and for research purposes is not unheard of in the united states according to 2000 study by the american society of reproductive dicine asrm some ivf programs reportedly offered as

reproductive purpos first some have argued that payment creates incentives to increase th number of egg donors thus facilitating research and bene fitting infe rtile c ouples second some reason that payment for eggs gives women parity with sperm donors who may be compensated for donating gametes at lower rate given that they require much less involved procedure third some allege that fa irness dictates that women who donate eggs ought to be able to benefit from their action fourt h some claim that pressures created by financial incentives may be greater th an those experienced by women asked to make altruistic egg donations for relatives or friends and may thus not rise to the level of coercion these are the types of arguments that led asrm to recommend in 2000 that sums of up to 5000 may be appropriate for typi cal egg donation while sums of up to 10000 may possibly be justifie d if there are particular difficulties woman must endure to make her donation several arguments have so been put forth against payment for egg donation first some voiced fears that payment might lead to the exploitation of women particularly poor women nd the commodification of re productive tissues second some have argued that payment for ggs for research purposes might undermine public confidence in endeavors such as human esr arguments such as these have prompted both the nas and the pcbe to recommend that women not be paid for donating their eggs for research purposes it also led the pcbe to note that in theory there is the possibility that eggs could be procured from ovaries harvested from cadavers which might at least alleviate concerns related to coercionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31358crs23 98 national bioethics advisory commission cloning human beings june 1997 p 78 99 presidents council human cloning p xxxviii 100 national bioethics advisory commission cloning human beings june 1997 p 105 101 ibidit is worth noting that woman may c hoose to undergo egg retrieval for her own reproductive purposes which woul d effectively take the pr ocess of egg procurement out of the research arena and avoid the question of payment entirely for example this could be an option for woman seeking ivf because her fallopian tubes are blocked types of restrictions one final set of argu ments center around the types of actions that the government may take with respect to therapeutic andor reproductive cloning these include per mitting regulating funding discouraging and temporarily or permanen tly banning the practices as starting point nbac offers in the united states governmental policies that prohibit or regulate human actions require justification because of general presumption against governmental interference in individual activities98 as may be expected the opinions regarding appropriate courses of action are largel linked to points of view about the appropriateness of the various endeavors the most permissive approach available permitting cloning with restrictions is not supported by any of the individuals or organizations referenced herein by contrast the next most per missive approach regulating cloning is supported by the council minority nbac nancy reagan gera ld ford and the nobel laureates as appropriate for therapeutic cloning so as to enable it to continue in accordance with socially accepted scientific research practices as summarized by the council minority we believe that this research could provide relief to millions of americans and that the government s hould therefore support is within sensible limits imposed by regulation99 voluntary prohibition the third most permissive appro ach was recommended by nbac as the appropriate immediate response to reproductive cloning by the private sector nbac called for an immediate request to all firms clinicians investigators and professi onal societies in the priv ate and nonfederally funded sectors to comply voluntarily with the intent of the federal moratorium100 as longer term approach nbac r ecommended the fourth most permissive approach temporary ban on reproductive cloning federal legislation should be enacted to prohibit anyone from attempting whether in research or clinical setting to create child through somatic cell nuclear transfer it is critical however that such legislation include sunset clause to ensure that congress will review the issue after specified time period three to five years in order to decide whether the prohibition continues to be needed101 readers may be interested to note that if enacted in 1997 when nbacs report was published fiveyear ban on reproductive cloning would have expired in 2002 th national academie s also recommended ban on reproductive cloning and did not ca ll it temporary but did add that it should be reconsidered every five years on the topic of therapeutic rather than reproductivehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31358crs24 102 presidents council human cloning p xxxvii 103 presidents council human cloning p xxxiv 104 presidents council human cloning p xxxvicloning majority of the council reco mmended temporary moratorium as the proper approach because it would reaffirm the principle that science can progress while upholding the communitys moral nor ms and would therefore reaffirm the communitys moral support for scie nce and biomedical technology102 the most restrictive approach to cloni ng permanent ban was proposed by the council minority and ma jority and nancy reagan as appropriate for reproductive cloning by permanently banning cloni ngtoproduce children this policy gives force to the strong ethical verdict agains t it unanimous in the council and widely supported by the american people103 this approach is also favored by the usccb not only for reproductive cloning but also for therapeutic cloning one related issue that of the use of fe deral funding for therapeutic cloning has also been discussed proposals have been made by any of the groups or individuals listed above for the use of federal funding for reproductive cloning opponents of funding therapeutic cloning such as the council majority have expressed concern that use of federal funding for therapeutic cloning would put the federal government in th novel and unsavory position of mandating the destruction of nascent human life104 proponents of fede ral funding for therapeutic cloning such as the council minority nbac nanc reagan gerald ford and the nobel laureates cite as support the advancements that might be powered by the infusion of federal dollars into the research as well as the ethical protections that would attach with the money
