two broad categories closedsystem and opensystem closed system gift cards are issued by retailers and are purchased from and redeemable at single store location or merchant chain some retail gift cards can also be purchased and redeemed online merchants have also marketed their gift card products to customers as fast and easy way to make reoccurring purchases eg morning cup of coffee or groceries or simply as convenient substitute for cash the merchant pointofsale pos electronic terminal must be programed to accept the gift card thirdparty processors support the operational requirements after each transaction the amount of the purchase is deducted and the card stores any remaining value merchants do not refund cash often the cards are sold in fixed amounts eg 25 50 or 100 and there is maximum on the total card value some closedsystem cards may be reloaded opensystem gift cards are branded with the logo of payment card network such as american express discover mastercard or visa major difference between closed and opensystem cards is that the latter offer the possibility and flexibility of being redeemed anywhere the cards logo is accepted the prepaid card

banks thrifts and retailers the prepaid cards can be purchased and used online over the phone or in person the maximum total value for gift card is established by the card issuer each time the card is

form of payment for the same transaction if card cannot be reloaded consumer may find it difficult to spend the cards entire value currently federal consumer protection laws do not regulate gift card programs consumer advocates have urged the federal reserve system to extend the provisions of regulation to cover all types storedvalue or prepaid card products regulation implements the electronic funds transfer act 4 which establishes the rights responsibilities and liabilities for participants using electronic fund transfers systems eg atms and pos terminals regulation protections include initial disclosures periodic statements and error resolution rights federal financial regulatory agencies have traditionally exercised restraint in regulating new financial products because premature regulation could stifle innovation the regulators closely monitor new banking activities to ensure safety and the soundness of financial institutions they may issue guidance for the depository financial institutions they regulate andor consumers the variety of prepaid card products and therefore the types and degrees of risk they present to cardholders and issuers complicates regulation of these payment instruments with onesizefitsall approach on august 24 2006 the federal reserve issued final rule 5 that makes one sector of prepaid cardspayroll card productssubject to regulation these cards were singled out because of certain characteristics including that they represent recurring stream of payments that is likely the primary source of the consumers income they are replenished on recurring basis and designed for ongoing use at multiple locations 6 the federal reserve stated that gift cards and other prepaid cards were not covered in part because these products are generally not intended to be held and used over long period of time in addition the funds held on individual cards were minimal the costs to the issuer of provid ing regulation protections are significant gift cards are addressed by the laws of some states and those states vary in their treatment some state consumer protection laws prohibit or set time limit for an expiration date various types of fees are addressed in different ways some prohibited and some capped number of states have adopted escheat laws these laws determine who can claim the value of an abandonedor unused gift card the consumer the vendor or the state government escheat laws generally presume abandonment after stated number of years the national conference of state legislatures ncsl tracks state statutes covering gift cards and gift certificates 7 consumer advocates have raised concerns about the problems resulting from inadequate consumer disclosure protections provided by gift card programs the national retail federation has suggested that uniform federal disclosures might be preferable to regulation on statebystate basis the gift card protection act hr 85 introduced in the 109 th congress on january 4 2005 by representative rodney p frelinghuysen and referred to the subcommittee on commerce trade and consumer protection of the house committee on energy and commerce would have prohibited expiration dates service charges and dormancy fees on gift certificates the bills definition of gift certificate included prepaid storedvalue electronic cards action beyond subcommittee referral was taken on the bill

that gift cards have found wide acceptance among merchants and their customers nevertheless the popularity of gift cards raises number of consumer protection issues generally involving charges and terms of which consumers may be unaware the issue of adequate disclosure is complicated by the fact that the buyer of the card is often not the ultimate card user the terms and conditions of individual gift card programs in both open and closed systems can vary significantly factors include card acceptance fees expiration dates loststolen card policy return policy and the process used to file complaint consumer advocates express concern that gift card programs do not universally provide adequate clear disclosure to both the giver and receiver of gift card of special concern are the expiration dates and various types and amounts of fees expiration dates are not generally printed on the card not all cards have an expiration date and those that do may allow the cardholder to extend the date usually for fee fees connected to gift cards include purchase fees activation fees inactivity or dormancy fees transaction fees monthly maintenance fees inquiry fees and delivery fees for cards bought online or by phone the amounts charged vary it is possible to lose significant portion of the gift cards value to these charges expiration dates and dormancy fees are particularly unpopular with consumers consumers may view an old gift ca rd as an interestfree loan to the merchant or card provider in general terms and fees are defended as being in line with charges and terms associated with checking accounts and other financial products the regulatory response to these consumer protection issues are set out below

institutions issue guidance in part to advise institutions on emerging and significant risks and to articulate the regulators expectations for institutional practices for managing those risks and preventing problems from arising on august 14 2006 the occ issued guidance to national banks on marketing and disclosure issues raised by gift card programs 12 on february 28 2007 the ots issued guidance on gift cards offered by ots regulated financial institutions13 the agencies recognized that the rapid growth of the gift card market together with the assortment of fees and other terms and conditions required clear disclosure policies the guidance from the two agencies is similar with respect to consumer protection considerations the guidelines recognize the need for both the purchaser and recipient to be fully informed the guidance illustrates information the regulator would expect to see disclosed on the gift card itself which may also be on an affixed sticker or tape and in separate set of disclosures that would accompany the gift card the expiration date the amount or the existence of fees and contact information for customer rvice would be provided on the card disclosures accompanying the card would include the name of the issuing financial institution additional fee information if applicable where the card can be used and what to do if the card is lost or stolen finally the guidance addresses misleading marketing and promotional practices to be avoided the ots guidance also stated that 1 thrift institutions should consider antimoneylaundering laws regulations and guidance for reporting suspic ious activities in connection with their gift card programs and 2 institutions that issue opensystem gift card products should develop systems to apply the customer identification program to these products g3g158g157g145g152g155g561g5g152g151g157g138g140g157g561g11g151g143g152g155g150g138g157g146g152g151g561 pauline smale analyst in financial
