provided as s hortterm fiscal stimulus in 2001 did not make those tax provisions refundable that is taxpay ers with tax liability received rebate and taxpayers with liability smaller than the maximum re bate would receive limited rebate the issue of ref undability has been subject to debate in the current consideration of rebate an initial administration propos would have reduced the 10 income bracket to 0 but provi ded refundability the initial proposal negotiated between the house leadership and the administration would provide for some limited refundability for wage earners with at least 3000 in income with more limited maximum re bate and rebate for child ren proposal by senate finance committee chairman baucus would extend refundability to senior citizens by allowing rebates for those who have at least 3000 in social security benefits and this provision was retained in the final bill nonrefundable rebates can exclude for typical households in examples presented single individuals with in comes below 8750 and married couples with three children with incomes below 30000 many individuals age 65 and over are also excluded from taxation because social security is largely exempt and because of extra personal exemptions and retirement credits nonrefundable rebate excludes appr oximately 37 of households due to lower incomes the houseadministra tion proposal which provides refundability for households with 3000 or more of earnings would exclude about 20 of households many of these likely to be elderly households w ho have neither tax liability nor earnings the houseadmin istration proposal does appear to be progressive in relative sense on aver age incomes increase proportionally more at lower levels although dollar amounts for th rebate are lower in the lower income quintile the average rebate in the lowest quintile is 221 under the houseadministration plan as compared to 16 for nonrefundable rebate the average rebate in the lower quintile in the senate plan is 564 and under that plan 65 of households would not receive reba because of low incomes the final plan is similar to the senate in its c overage of lower income households but the average rebate is in the lower in come quintile is smaller at 391 directing rebates to lower income individuals is likely to be more effective shortterm stimulus because lower income i ndividuals tend to spend more of their income extending the rebate to lower income retired individuals who tend to be nonfilers would enhance progressivity but present administrative difficultieshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34341contents introduction 1 income levels affected by refundability 2 t x p r s u n d r 6 5 2 x m p t l v l s f r t h s 6 5 n d v r 4 what families are affected 5

committee on taxation description of the economic stimulus act of 2008 jcx0808 january 28 2008tax rebate refundability effects and issues introduction tax rebates provided as s hortterm fiscal stimulus in 2001 did not make those tax provisions refundable that is taxpay ers with tax liability received rebate and taxpayers with liability smaller than the maximum rebate would receive limited rebate the issue of ref undability has been subject to debate in the current consideration of rebate the administration had initially suggest ed nonrefundable tax rebate which would have apparently allowed reducti on in the 10 tax bracket to 0 which would have produced rebates up to appr oximately 1600 for ma rried couples and 800 for singles subsequent agreement between the house leadership and the administration would have provided reba of 100 billion with ref undability for taxpayers with earned income1 under the initial version of h r 5140 married couples would have had reduction from 10 to 0 for the first 12000 of income in the current 10 bracket and singles would have re duction for the first 6000 leading to maximum rebate of 1200 and 600 respectively those without tax liability would have received 300 rebate for singles nd 600 rebate for married couples as long as they had earned income of at least 3000 there would also have been 300 dollar tax rebate for each child regardless of tax liability as long as the taxpayers had either 3000 of earnings or 1 of tax liability the rebate was to be phased out for single individuals with income over 75000 and married couples over 150000 with the benefit falling by 5 of income over these levels taxpayers with incomes above 87000 if single nd 174000 if jo int would r eceive rebate thus taxpayers who would receive rebate incl ude lower income taxpayers who have earnings and tax liability mostly retired taxpayers and high income taxpayers who are phased out of the rebate measure reported out of the senate finance committee would have extended refundable rebates to senior c itizens by also allowing rebates for those with at least 3000 in social security benefits and th rebate would be set at 500 1000 for joint return2 the chairmans initial proposal would have eliminated the phaseout at higher incomes and thus the rebate w ould be flat payment to virtually allhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34341crs2 3 two other provisions in the senate finance proposal that were adopt ed included provisions to allow refundable rebate based on veterans disability payments and to eliminate payments by illegal immigrants by requiring the taxpayer identification number to be social security number eligible benefits to qualify under the social security payments refundability benefit include old age survivors and disability payments and tier i railroad retirement the do not include supplemental s ecurity income ssi or pensions the irs has issued fact sheet fs200816 that xplains these refundable rebates see httpwwwirsgovirsarticle0id17909600html households but revision included pha out of the rebate at 150000 300000 for married couples the final bill followed the initial house pr oposal in the size of the rebates and the phaseouts but as in the senate proposal it included social security payments in the determination of the 3000 necessary to receive rebate these rebates are at the lower levels in the house bill 300 for singles nd 600 for couples3 minimum rebate is also allo wed if the household has at least 1 in tax liability and adjusted gross income equal to the sta ndard deduction plus personal exemption two personal exemptions in the case of couple this report discusses the income leve ls at which tax rebates would not be available in the absence of refundability th magnitude and types of taxpayers likely affected and the issues surrounding th existence and scope of refundability provisions income levels affected by refundability this section first discusses taxpay ers under 65 and then taxpayers over 65 taxpayers with earnings and especially those with children tend to have higher income levels after accounting for tax credits that are larg ely or partially refundable the child credit and the earned income credit these levels differ from those that would trigger change in tax liability through rate reductions taxpayers over 65 tend to have higher exempt levels due to rate reductions because they receive additional personal exemptions and the nonrefundable retirement credit taxpayers under 65 because of the earned income credit some families can ve relatively high incomes before they have any tax liability if refunds are based on 2007 tax returns and tax laws taxpayers with income s below the amounts in column 2 of table 1 would receive credit if rebate were re stricted to families w hose tax liability after all credits is greater than or equal to zero these examples assume all income is earned the standard deducti on and credits other than the child credit and the earned income credit as seen in the table these exempt levels can reach in excess of 50000 for families with three or more children cons ider the level for married couple with one child in 2007 the sum of standa rd deduction of 10700 and three personalhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34341crs3 exemptions of 3400 means there will be taxable income until income reaches 20900 however the family is eligible for child tax credit of 1000 to eliminate all tax on taxable income up to this point through the child tax credit would permit the familys income to rise to 30900 this income would result in taxable income of 10000 and tax liability at 10 rate the first bracket rate of 1000 this liability would be eliminated by the child tax credit the family would still be eligible for an earned income tax credit which does not completely phase out until income reaches 35241 at the income level of 33572 the increasing tax liability would be just offset by falling earned income credit different exempt level would occur if the benefit is in the form of rate reduction that would affect ta x applied before excess tax credits for example the initial proposal by the administration was to reduce the 10 rate bracket to zero rate bracket because this point occurs before credits taxpayers would lose the rebate benefit at lower leve l of income if all credits were fully refundable the level at which rebate benefit would occur would be the point where there is tax liability before credits which for typical taxpayer is the sum of personal exemptions and the standard deduction table 1

thresholds for selected years 1996 through 2007 by gregg esenwein and maxim shvedov numbers in column 3 are the sum of standard deductions and personal exemptions numbers in column 4 where different from column 3 are where the sum of tax liability plus the limit on the refundable portion of the child credit equals the total allowable child credit for singles and married individuals who receive only the fully refundable earned income credit that income remains at the level at which rebate benefit is received it also remains at the same level for the married couple with one child in their case taxable income is zero at 20900 for 2007 the family would still be eligible for ahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34341crs4 refundable child tax credit which is limite d to 15 of income in excess of 11750 since that amount is larger than the 1000 maximum child tax credit both the child credit and the earned income credit are fully refundable at this point and the level at which rebate benefit would be received does not change for families with two and three children the level at which tax change would occur is somewhat higher this occurs because the limit on the refundable tax credit is below the maximum credit for thes families 2000 for two children and 3000 for three children and some of the credit they receive is against tax liability when tax liability is lowered the credit is also reduced the point at which tax benefit is received is when the tax liability plus the refundable credit equals the maximum credit the exempt levels in columns 3 and 4 apply regardless of whether income is earned or unearned and therefore would also apply to retired individuals under 65 but would reflect earnings included in in come and not exempt social security benefits note that the exempt levels in these tables would be higher if other credits are received such as the child care tax credit exempt levels for those 65 and over this discussion considers only taxpayer s without children but addresses the circumstances of those who are over 65 th taxpayers fall into three categories single taxpayers over 65 married couples with one spouse over 65 and married couples with both spouses over 65 taxpayers over 65 without children do not receive the child tax credit and do not receive the earned income tax credit if they do not have earnings however they have three provisions that tend to make their income higher before being taxed than families without children and that would reflect refundability that is based on taxa ble income first each taxpayer over 65 receives an additional sta ndard deduction second indi viduals over 65 are eligible for retirement income credit although the credit is reduced by exempt income such as social security and half of other income excess of floor taxpayers with significant amounts of social security income would not receive this credit however social security income is not taxable unless adjusted gross income plus ½ of social security income reaches given level so that taxpayers can have much higher levels of actual income before they are subject to tax table 2 shows the exempt level taking into account these provisions the retirement credit in the absence of social security income slightly increases the exempt level for singles and for couples with both spouses over 65 but it is the additional personal exemptions that have the most effect compare to column 3 in table 1 incomes can become considerably higher before there is taxable income with social security paymentshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34341crs5 4 see tax

httpwwwtaxpolicycenterorgnumbersdisplayatabcfmdocid1769doctypeid4 10 see tax policy center table t080060the tax policy center also in addressing the original proposal to allow non refundable rebate of the 10 bracket5 found that after excluding approximately 7 million returns that were claimed as dependents on other taxpayers returns 33 million returns filed would have rebate benefit corre sponding closely to the 30 million without tax liability re ported in table 3 thus the combination of 33 million filers and 23 million non filers out of total filers of 127 million excluding those claimed as dependent s on other returns and non filers results in 37 of households who would receive rebate benefit because of low incomes out of this group of 56 million 30 million had earnings and 26 million did not thus out of the proposal that allows benefit for earnings 17 pe rcent of house holds w ould not receive benefit these households are lik ely to be elderly out of the group without benefit due to low tax liability 19 million were in derly households accounting for 12 of the total and 60 of all elde rly households significant share would also receive partial bene fit under the original propos 21 million taxpayers about 14 of households for the houseadministration proposal w ith refundability ba sed on income the tax policy center6 estimates 39 million returns with rebate benefit 17 million filers and 22 million nonfilers according to distributional data about the plan7 32 of the top income quintile would recei ve rebate presuma bly because of the phase out about 9 million returns thus 30 million lower income returns about 20 of households would recei ve rebate because they have tax liability and little or earnings of the total 39 million returns that would receive rebate 18 million are returns of households with ag exemptions finally another 44 million returns 29 of households would r eceive only partial benefit below the maximum of 600 for singles and 1200 for joint returns for the initial senate pr oposal approximately 10 milli on returns would receive rebate 65 of the total8 virtually all of these returns are in the lowest quintile of the 10 million with benefit 2 million have age exemptions one million households less than 1 of the total woul d receive partial be nefit and the addition of the income phaseout would eliminat another 18 due to high incomes9 the bill as adopted retains the senate refundability provisions so that 65 of households would not receive rebate because of low incomes overall 13 do not receive rebate change that largely

httpwwwtaxpolicycenterorgnumbersdisplayatabcfmdocid1779doctypeid2within the income distribution the or iginal administration rebate proposal without refundability tends to favor the middle and upper income classes in dollar terms and to favor the middle class as percentage of after tax income measure of relative distribution table 411 reports these measures fo r the original proposal to eliminate the 10 bracket without refunda bility the houseadministration proposal that would limit the maximum provide reba benefit for thos without tax liability based on earnings and provide rebate benefit for childre n and the senate proposal which would provide relatively flat paym ent all proposals provide the largest dollar benefits for middle and upper middle income taxpayers although the benefits have shifted down through the income di stribution for the houseadministration proposal and even more so for the senate plan the refundability in the house proposal has increased the average benefit in the lowest 20 of the population from an estimated 16 to 221 while the refunda bility in the senate proposal has increased the benefit to 564 both the house and senate pr oposals are progressive in relative sense in that the percentage increase in income falls on average as income rises although this is clearly not true for every case as some households do not receive rebate while the senate proposal allows benefits for higher income taxpayers they are small relative to incomeshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34341crs8 12 see crs report rs21126 tax cuts and economic stimulus how effective are the

source tax policy center urban institute and brookings institution table t080011 table t08 0034 and t080055 issues in structuring rebate there are three basic issues in structuring rebate effectiveness in achieving its purpose in stimulating the economy fair ness and administrative feasibility from an economic point of view the most efficient way to have large stimulus effect is to direct the tax benefit towards lowe r income households who have greater tendency to spend the rebate12 on this basis rebates that are refundable and increases in transfer programs have greater likelihood of creating shortterm economic stimulus one macroeconomic m odel for example finds the multiplier the increase in output per dollar of tax cu t to be 102 for nonrefundable rebate buthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34341crs9 13 mark zandi washington throws the economy rope january 22 2008 at httpwwweconomycomhome article_dsaspcid102598 14 not all nonfilers would be likely to file since some may be evading tax by not filing returns and would not want attention called to them126 for ref undable rebate13 it also finds multiplier of 164 for unemployment benefit increases and 173 for food stamp in creases two alternative approaches to rebates thus refundability is likely to aid in more eff ective shortterm stimulus and that effectiveness would proba bly be increased if the derly were covered as well there are different perspectives on fairness for those concerned about progressivity of tax cut extending the cut to lower income individuals contributes to that progressivity as shown above othe rs feel that it is in appropriate to provide rebate to those who do not pay taxes although proposals to increase transfers would have that effect given that wer income households are to receive the rebate some would see it as unfair to provide the benefits only to those with earnings and not to those who are retired and liv ing on social security and pensions perhaps the major reason for not extending refundability especially to those without earnings such as the elderly is th at this population is mostly nonfilers both compliance and administrative costs would be increased if nonfilers are included in the group eligible if all of these individuals filed returns14 the irs could have to process another 23 million returns and taxpayers would have to file these returns
