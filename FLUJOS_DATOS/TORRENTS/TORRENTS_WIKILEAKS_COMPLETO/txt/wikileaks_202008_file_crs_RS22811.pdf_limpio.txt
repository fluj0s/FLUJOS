in the 460seat lower house of parliament and decided to call elections in hopes of strengthening its mandate the decision to hold early elections proved to be political miscalculation by jaroslaw who underestimated popular dissatisfaction with his government and the consequent determina tion of poles to oust pis rnout on election day was 553 the largest since the end of the communist era this unprecedented voter participation particularly by young people is considered to have been key factor although pis received more votes in 2007 than it had in the 2005 elections the increase came largely at the expense of its former coalition partners so and lpd neither of which managed to pass the 5 threshold necessary for repr esentation in parliame nt in addition the increase in pis votes was more than offset by the big jump in turnout 15 over earlier elections tusks party won 209 seats nd its coalition partner the centrist polish peasants party took 31 together they hold comfortable majority in parliament and tusk was sworn in as prime minister in november 2007 however the new government will likely face staunch resistance on some issu from president lech kaczynski whose term runs until 2010 since 60 vote is nece ssary to override presidential veto the government may need occasional help from the leftist lid2 some analysts believe that the elections reflected tugofwar between the emerging liberal ie freemarket poland embodied by tusks po and the poland of social solidarity which advocates continued government intervention in the economy represented by pis however on practical level many poles believed that rather than addressing needed reforms pis had emba rrassed poland internati onally and had wasted precious time and resources in its hunt to expose members of the socalled uklad the web of former communist elites that th kaczynski brothers were convinced had manipulated successive governments from be hind the curtain since 1989 in addition piss conduct
