june 7 2001 david lockwood specialist in us foreign policy and national defense foreign affairs defense and trade division congressional research service the library of congress military base closures estimates of costs and savings summary approximately 13 years ago in december 1988 the first military base closure commission recommended the closing and realignment of 145 us domestic bases and facilities this action was the consequence of the department of defenses broad reevaluation of its mission in conjunction with the weakening and ultimate collapse of the soviet union there was little need according to the pentagon to continue to retain the vast cold warera infrastructure funds saved from closing down underutilized bases dod further noted could be used to enhance development of new weapons and improved readiness the 1988 round of infrastructure reductions was followed by three additional rounds in 1991 1993 and 1995 since then further rounds of base closures and realignments have been authorized by congress despite repeated requests from the department of defense in recent years for two additional rounds the reasons for congressional resistance are twofold first there is concern over likely backlash from constituents living in or near military installations second many members of congress remain wary about repetition of the perceived political intrusion by the clinton administration that occurred in regard to the 1995 recommendations to close kelly and mcclellan air force bases the four base closure and realignment brac commissions recommended individually total of 534 actions to close realign or otherwise affect specific bases facilities and activities in december 1998 the general accounting office reported that the four brac commissions generated 499 recommendations but that in its final tally only 451 of these ultimately required action primarily because 48 were changed in some manner by recommendations of later commission the closing of all 451 brac installations major minor and other from the four rounds is expected to be completed by the end of fy2001 as originally scheduled the disposing of all the closed property however is expected to take many more years the pentagons current estimate of the percentage reduction in base structure as result of the first four rounds is 21 this figure is used as support for additional infrastructure reductions since other key indicators such as the defense budget and the force structure personnel and units have declined 40 and 36 respectively in terms of costs and savings associated with the first four rounds of closures and realignments dod report april 1998 estimated net total savings of about 14 billion through fy2001 it projected that net annual savings thereafter would be in the vicinity of 56 to 57 billion as for the two new rounds currently being sought the pentagon has estimated an annual savings of about 3 billion after they are implemented contents introduction 1

estimates of costs and savings introduction this report provides information on the current status of us military base closures and realignments it includes data on domestic bases including us territories the report also provides information on the costs and savings associated with implementation of domestic base closings and realignments1 from 1976 to 1988 virtually us domestic bases were closed as result of congressionally imposed restrictions2 this situation changed radically in 1988 when the us congress passed legislation establishing the first of four independent base realignment and closure commissions brac the four commissions activated in 1988 1991 1993 and 1995 generated 499 recommendations for closing and realigning bases only 451 of these ultimately required action primarily because 48 were changed in some manner by recommendations of later commission3 closures and realignments problem of defining terms the term base closure is frequently used loosely and imprecisely brac action may not involve base as one might commonly envision it to be but rather facility mission or function it also may not involve closure or even realignment but rather disestablishment relocation or redirection in 1995 report on the brac process the general accounting office gao noted that the term base closure often conjures up the image of larger facility being closed than may actually be the case military installations are rather diversified 1 information on us base closures abroad process independent of the domestic base closing process and largely

homeport or leased facility further more than one mission or function may be housed on given installation the report noted additionally that an individual brac recommendation may actually affect variety of activities and functions without fully closing an installation full closures to the extent they occur may involve relatively small facilities rather than the stereotypically large military base4 thus base closure is highly amorphous imprecise term that may serve to facilitate communication but often fails at the same time to provide an exact understanding of the action taken scale of the base structure the military base structure of the department of defense includes approximately 5000 properties worldwide these properties range widely in personnel assigned and amount of property controlled from unmanned navigational aid stations to major military bases with thousands of personnel and in the case of nellis air force base more than million acres the department of defense currently maintains website list of 588 installations worldwide5 this list is subset of properties excluding numerous minor activities and smaller properties the 588 installations are divided into the following three groups 1 50 united states 519 installations 2 3 us territories 8 installations 3 19 foreign countries 61 installations the 527 us installations comprising those within the 50 states and its territories are grouped according to three categories major minor and other each major service determines for itself the method of defining its categories for example the army defines major installation as one with 5000 or more us service members dod civilian employees andor other authorized tenants it defines minor installation as one with personnel numbering between 1000 and 5000 in its other category it includes sites and facilities with personnel levels between 300 and 1000 the air force on the other hand has classified major and minor installations on the basis of wing or squadron size the navy determines its 4 see us general accounting office report gaonsiad95133 military bases analysis of dods 1995 process and recommendations for closure and realignment april 1995 pp

closure actions number of military bases closed four base closure and realignment brac commissions on the basis of their individual reports recommended total of 534 actions to close realign or otherwise affect specific bases facilities and activities the breakdown for each of the commissions reports is as follows 1988 brac 145 recommendations 1991 brac 82 recommendations 1993 brac 175 recommendations 1995 brac 132 recommendations the 1995 brac commission report however stated that the number of brac actions from all four rounds totaled 505 not 534 most recently in december 1998 the general accounting office gao reported that the four brac commissions generated 499 recommendations but that in its final tally only 451 of these ultimately required action primarily because 48 were changed in some manner by recommendations of later commission6 these discrepancies make it difficult to pin down the precise number of brac actions as the gao report explained the brac commissions have been somewhat arbitrary in the way they enumerate recommendations the recommendations have included closures realignments disestablishments relocations and redirections7 the closing of all 451 brac installations major minor and other from the four rounds is expected to be completed by the end of fy2001 as originally scheduled the disposing of all the closed property however is expected to take many more years according to gao about 464000 acres of brac real property were determined to be excess but as of march 1998 only about 31 of property designated for nonfederal users had been formally transferred8 the main delaying factor in the process has been the need to meet strict environmental cleanup standards in order to move things along more swiftly dod has adopted the use of interim leases until such time as formal deeds can be issued 6 us gao status op cit p 25 7 in closure all missions carried out at base either cease or relocate although some property may be retained for new purposes while in realignment base remains open but loses and sometimes gains missions disestablishments and relocations refer to mission those disestablished cease operations while those relocated are moved to another base redirection refers to cases in which brac commission changes the recommendation of previous commission us gao ibid p 26 footnote 8 only about 8 of the property designated for federal entities had actually been transferred us gao ibid p 25 crs4 it is difficult to find consistently determined figures on overall brac actions however the department of defense does provide one such set of statistics smaller in number that identifies 97 major closures and realignments the overall baseline figure for dods major bases nonbrac as well as brac is 495 as of september 30 1999 the following information on brac major closures and realignments was as follows major brac closures recommended 97 1988 commission 16 1991 commission 26 1993 commission 28 1995 commission 27 major brac closures completed 95 major brac closures uncompleted 2 the two remaining brac major bases are scheduled to be closed during fiscal year 2001 they are mcclellan afb ca and roslyn air guard station ny percent of base structure closed in its report to the 1993 base closure commission the department of defense estimated that under the first two rounds 1988 and 1991 domestic base structure was reduced by only 9 measured by plant replacement value9 it stated that adding the 1993 closures recommended by dod to the previous ones would reduce the domestic base structure by about 15 in its recommendations to the 1995 base closure commission the department of defense estimated that adding the 1995 closures recommended by dod to the previous ones would reduce the domestic base structure by approximately 21 the pentagons current 1999 estimate of the percentage reduction in base structure remains essentially the same 21 see figure 1 for comparison with other indicators of defense drawdown for several years the department of defense has been urging congress to authorize additional base closure rounds it has stressed that base structure reductions lag significantly behind the reductions in the defense budget and in the force structure military units and personnel additional base closures according to dod would free up funds urgently needed for the development of new weapon systems as well as providing for increased training and readiness of the armed forces many if not most authorities on defense policy agree with dods assessment few have suggested however that the underlying premise of relative parity may be false for start some argue that the defense budget and military personnel columns below represent worldwide figures while the domestic base structure 9 plant replacement value as defined by dod is what it would cost to replace all the buildings pavements and utilities at base crs5 column represents the fifty united states and its territories if the us overseas bases closed are added to those of the domestic base structure the comparable figure would be an overall reduction of about 26 second concern has to do with the issue of reconstitution potential need to increase military capability when the united states is confronted at some future point by hostile and powerful enemy state the argument is that while the defense budget can be increased in matter of weeks the same is not true of the force structure or the base structure some believe the problem of reconstitution is potentially most hazardous with regard to the base structure once property is converted to civilian use it is for all practical purposes permanently lost as military asset prospects for future base closures 10 in mid1997 secretary of defense william cohen called for two new rounds of base closures and realignments he explained that while four previous rounds had achieved significant savings it was important to continue the process of closing underutilized facilities despite dod pressure most members of congress were reluctant to support authorization of new base closure legislation at that time the reasons given included among others grassroots opposition from communities likely to be affected and president clintons intervention in the 1995 base closure commissions recommendations regarding mcclellan and kelly air force bases11 of the two chambers the house of representatives expressed the stronger and more united opposition in the senate proponents of new base closure rounds attempted to attach an amendment to the fy1999 defense authorization bill but failed figure 1 relative defense drawdown 1988 2001 source us department of defense defense reform initiative report november 1997 p 37 10 for

crossroads after base closing loss washington post may 19 1998 p a19 crs6 the base closing issue however was revived at the outset of the 106th congress proponents believed that their cause would be helped by the fact that it was not an election year on january 20 1999 senator john mccain along with senators carl levin and charles robb introduced legislation s 258 that would authorize two new rounds of base closures in 2001 and 2003 on february 1 the clinton administration submitted to congress its budget for fy2000 which included provision for two more rounds in 2001 and 2005 on may 12 and 13 however the senate armed services committee in its markup of the fy2000 defense authorization bill s 1059 rejected proposals by senators mccain and levin to include authority for new base closings the two senators attempted to revive the base closure proposal during floor debate on s 1059 but met with defeat by vote of 60 to 40 on january 18 2000 just prior to the opening of the new session of congress the department of defense announced that the clinton administration would once again seek congressional authority to close more military bases starting in 2003 its spokesman said that this is particularly opportune time to make such transitions since the national economy is so strong additionally he reassured critics and sceptics alike that politics would not be allowed to intrude on any future rounds of base closings in its statements urging new rounds of closures the pentagon added its stamp of approval to the brac process stating that it was proven effective tool to make difficult decisions that impact both national security and local communities it proposed that future brac rounds adopt the same procedures that were used in the 1995 brac round however most members of congress were not inclined to act on an issue fraught with potential controversy especially during presidential election year nevertheless senator john mccain and senator carl levin sponsored an amendment 3197 that sought two additional rounds of base closures and realignments beginning in 2003 and 2005 in floor debate june 7 2000 senator mccain stressed the importance of removing the armed services burden of managing and paying for an estimated 23 excess infrastructure costing at least 36 billion year the mccainlevin initiative however was solidly rejected by vote of 35 to 63 at the outset of the 107th congress senators mccain and levin have once again introduced bill s 397 to authorize two new rounds of base closures in 2003 and 2005 in its february 27 2001 press release the taxpayers for common sense tcs national budget watchdog organization immediately applauded the initiative and said that it would save billions for other important defense priorities it estimated the cost of maintaining excess military bases at about 36 billion each year and said that projected pentagon savings could amount to as much as 21 billion through 2015 if the military were allowed to close bases in 2003 and 2005 crs7 costs and savings two important aspects of analyzing costs and savings are associated with brac closings the first has to do with the element of chronological timing in the early years base closure costs greatly exceeded savings at later point in time 1998 costs and savings became about equal see where the two lines in figure 2 cross presently with the implementation of four brac rounds nearing completion the deadline is end of fy2001 savings are projected to be significantly greater than costs the second and more fundamentally problematic aspect has to do with determining the accuracy of data especially data involving savings the inability of dod to locate some of its data including the original cost and savings estimates it gave to the brac commissions has complicated matters these difficulties have been addressed at some length by dod as well as by the congressional budget office and the general accounting office see below figure 2 brac estimated costs and savings 1990 2001 source gaos analysis of dod data 12 dod and agency findings department of defense at the request of congress the department of defense submitted report in april 1998 on the status of base realignments and closures13 in its report dod provided data on the estimated costs and savings for the first four rounds 1988 1991 1993 and 1995 the report stated that overall 12 us gao status op cit p 36 13 us department of defense the report of the department of defense on base realignment and closure april 1998 144 p crs8 the resultant savings from the shutdown of bases and facilities during bracs rounds would exceed initial estimates it also said that the dramatic level of savings would permit the department to increase spending on the modernization and transformation of its forces while sustaining high levels of readiness the dod report stressed that all organizations must estimate savings produced by management reforms consolidations and reorganizations accounting systems can keep accurate records of costs but parallel systems exist to track savings to determine brac savings the report explained requires either 1 estimating what the composition of the dod budget would have been without brac or 2 distinguishing the effects of brac from the effects of other myriad factors that affect dod installations and budgets over more than decade with this caveat the dod report proceeded to estimate net total savings from the four brac rounds of about 14 billion through 2001 see table 1 it projected that annual savings thereafter would be in the vicinity of 56 to 57 billion table 1 brac estimated costs and savings 1988 2001 dollars in billions implementation period estimates round 6year costs savings net

c total savings through 2001 consist of 6year implementation period savings plus recurring savings for each year after the end of round through 2001 for example brac 1991 total savings of 124 billion

consist of total savings through 2001 less the costs incurred through 2001 crs9 congressional budget office as required by provision of law the congressional budget office cbo and the general accounting office gao reviewed dods 1998 report following its release cbo found dods estimates of savings from previous closure rounds as fully implemented consistent with its own estimates 56 billion as compared to 50 billion cbo also acknowledged that firm measures of brac savings requested by congress do not and cannot exist it elaborated as follows brac savings are really avoided costs costs that dod would have incurred if brac actions had not taken place because those avoided costs are not actual expenditures dod cannot observe them and record them in its financial records as result dod can only estimate savings rather than actually measure them14 in its review cbo made number of other interesting observations it stated that dod was unable to locate some of the data requested by cbo including the original cost and savings estimates that dod gave to the brac commissions also cbo noted that estimates of brac costs and savings would be more accurate if they included dods environmental and caretaker costs for some bases after the sixyear implementation period is completed general accounting office the general accounting office submitted its review of dods report on november 13 199815 it was longer and provided more supporting detail than the cbo review gao asserted that the four previous brac closure rounds would result in substantial net saving it noted also that dods report should be viewed as providing rough approximation of costs and savings rather than precise accounting it said that dods data systems do not capture all savings associated with brac actions nor has dod established separate system to track brac savings pair of consistent messages are present in the three reports reviewed above first there is practicable way to determine with precision the actual costs and savings from the brac rounds one has to be satisfied with estimates second regardless of substantial initial costs much greater savings will be achieved in the long run as result of the four rounds of military base closures prospects for future savings the department of defense during the last several years has repeatedly stated its need to close more military bases citing studies that confirm an excess base capacity in the range of 23 it has sought authority from congress so far to avail for two new base closure and realignment rounds in 2003 and 2005 according to dods estimates two new rounds each roughly the size of the last two rounds initiated in 1993 and 1995 would generate annual savings of about 3 billion after 14 us congressional budget office review

november 1998 54 p crs10 they are implemented16 failure to close unneeded bases dod has warned could seriously impede its efforts to allocate resources in the most efficient and effective manner it has stated also that such failure could cost the pentagon in the future 20 billion that would be better spent on ships jet aircraft and other crucial military equipment17 the prospects for achieving future savings depend greatly on congress actions in the course of the next two sessions during which conditions for establishing new independent base closure commission will be most advantageous conclusion the pentagon insists that the high cost of maintaining base structure far in excess of its current and most likely future requirements imposes very significant financial burden on the department the removal of this burden remains major department of defense objective it is an especially important item on dods agenda this year as it presents and defends its annual budget in hearings before the committees of the new 107th congress with the conclusion of the year 2000 presidential election members of congress may be more inclined now than before to undertake the necessary steps to authorize new base realignment and closure brac rounds the longstanding argument of many members of congress against any new rounds as long as the clinton administration remained in place because of perceived abuse in the handling of mcclellan and kelly air force bases has now become largely moot major impediment to further closures and realignments thus appears to have been removed it is generally agreed however that congress has only brief window of opportunity to muster the support needed to establish new independent base closure commission the previous one having expired more than 5 years ago any extended delay by congress that moves brac decision closer to the next election in 2004 it is widely acknowledged will likely result in dwindling support and possible rejection 16 us
