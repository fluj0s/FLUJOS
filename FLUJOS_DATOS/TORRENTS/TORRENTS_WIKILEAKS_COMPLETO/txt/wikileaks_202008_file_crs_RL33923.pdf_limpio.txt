being developed through litigation over activities that allegedly infringe patent holders rights the losi ng party in these cases may appeal the district courts decision to the us court of appeals for the federal circuit specialized tribunal established by congress that has exclusive appellate jurisdiction in patent cases parties dissatisfied with the federal circuits rulings may petition the us supreme court to review the appellate courts decision however the supreme court is not required to entertain the appeal it has discretion to decide whether to grant certiora ri to review the case while the supreme court has left the federal circuits opinions undisturbed in the vast majority of patent cases since the creation of the specialized patent court in 1982 the court has shown over the past three terms an increased willingness to hear cases that raise patent law issues the supreme court justices apparent newfound interest in patent cases perhaps stems from recognition of the growing importance of intellectual property to the nations informationbased economy as well as need to correct perceived errors in lower courts interpretation and application of patent law this report provides brief summary of the supreme courts patent law jurisprudence in the following eight cases that have been decided since 2005 merck kgaa v integra lifesciences i unitherm food systems v

may consider legislation to amend the us patent system to address perceived deficiencies1 the us supreme court also plays significant role in clarifying vague or ambiguous language in the patent act that is often at the heart of disputes between parties involved in patent infringement suits in the tter half of this decade the supreme court has granted certiorari in eight patent cases perhaps in recognition of the increasing importance of intellectual property to technological innovation as well as in order to correct errors in lower courts interpretation and application of patent law 2 what follows is general overview of the facts and outcomes of these recent cases presented in chronological order starting from the october term 2004

anyone without prior authorization to use make offer to sell or sell any patented invention within the united states3 however there are exceptions to this general rule for example statutory exception codified at 35 usc 271e1 provides it shall not be an act of patent infringement to use or import into the united states patented invention solely for uses reasonably related to the development and submission of information under the federal food drug and cosmetic act 4 this is safe harbor provision that immunizes parties from liability for their otherwise infringing acts the factual history of

peptides to determine their efficacy in inhibiting angiogenesis integra sued merck seeking monetary damages for mercks alleged infringement of its patented compounds in defense merck asserted in part that its actions involving the rgd peptides came within the statutory safe harbor discussed above at trial the us district court for the southern district of california instructed the jury that for merck to prevail on the safe harbor defense it must prove by preponderance of the evidence that it was objectively reasonable for the company to believe that there was decent prospect that the experiments would contribute relatively directly to the generation of information likely to be relevant to the drug approval regulatory process 7 the jury found merck liable for infringing integras patents because merck had failed to show that 271e1 protected its research activities in june 2003 divided panel of the us court of appeals for the federal circuit federal circuit affirmed the district courts determination as to mercks liability the panel majority narrowly construed the safe harbor provision as exempting from infringement liability only clinical research activities8 that contribute relatively directly to information submitted to the food and drug administration fda for consideration in the drug approval process9 merck appealed the federal circuits decision to the us supreme court the question presented to the supreme court was whether uses of patented inventions in preclinical research the results of which are not ultimately included in submission to the food and drug administration fda are exempted from infringement by 35 usc 271e110 in vacating the federal circuits interpretation of the safe harbor provision the supreme court unanimously ruled that the exemption applies to all uses of patented inventions that are reasonably related to the process of developing any information for fda submission including preclinical use of patented inventions in the drug research and development process11 the court explained that under certain conditions the safe harbor provision is even sufficiently broad to protect the use of patented compounds in experiments that are not ultimately submitted to the fda or drug experiments that are not ultimately the subject of an fda submission12 6 integra lifesciences i ltd v merck kgaa 331 f3d 860 863 fed cir 2003 7

invention is novelty13 for an invention to be considered novel it must not be wholly anticipated by the socalled prior art or public domain materials such as publications and other patents in early 2000 the food company conagra inform ed companies that sold equipment andor processes for browning precooked meats that such browning processes may infringe its patent on method for browning precooked whole muscle meat products and offered those companies the opportunity to license its patent compet itor unitherm sued conagra for declaratory judgment that the patent was invalid and unenforceable and that conagra had violated federal antitrust laws by attempting to enforce patent that was obtained by committing fraud on the us patent and trademark office 14 the us district court for the western district of oklahoma ruled that conagras patent was invalid15 because of evidence that unitherms president had invented the process described in that patent six years before conagra had filed its patent application the court then allowed the antitrust claim to proceed to trial before the case was submitted to the jury conagra filed motion with the court for judgment as matter of law on the grounds that reasonable jury would have legally sufficient evidentiary basis to support verdict in favor of unitherm on the antitrust issue 16 the district court denied the motion and the jury returned verdict for unitherm conagra however failed to renew its re quest for judgment as matter of law by filing another motion after the verdict procedural requirement under federal rules of procedure 50b nor did it request new trial under federal rules of procedure 59 conagra appealed to the federal circuit assertin g that there was insufficient evidence to sustain the jurys verdict the federal circuit determined that conagras failure to file postverdict motion did not preclude the company on appeal from raising the challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence on the antitrust claim17 the appellate court then proceeded to review the evidence and after concluding it was insufficient vacated the jurys judgment in favor of unitherm and remanded the case for new trial18 13 see 35 usc 102 person shall be entitled to patent unlessa the invention was known or used by others in this country or patented or described in printed publication in this or foreign country before the invention thereof by the applicant for patent or b the invention was patented or described in printed publication in this or foreign country or in public use or on sale in this country more than one

was precluded from reviewing the case and reversed its judgment the court explained that partys failure to file postverdict motion challenging the sufficiency of the evidence under rule 50b renders an appellate court without power to direct the district court to enter judgment contrary to the one it had permitted to stand19 strict compliance with this postverdict motion rule is necessary according to the court because determination of whether new trial should be granted or judgment entered under rule 50b calls for the judgment in the first instance of the judge who saw and heard the witnesses and has the feel of the case which appellate printed transcript can impart 20 because conagra did not file such motion in the district court it is not entitled to pursue new trial on appeal the court ruled21 g11g149g149g146g151g152g146g156g561g22g152g152g149g561g25g152g155g148g156g561g159g495g561g11g151g141g142g153g142g151g141g142g151g157g561g11g151g148g561 this case involved the practice of trident subsidiary of illinois tool works of selling its patented printing systems consisting of patented ink jet printheads and patented ink containers to manufacturers of printers only on the condition that those manufacturers and their customers agree to purchase their ink exclusively from trident although such ink itself is unpatented 22 independent ink competitor manufacturer of ink that could be used in those printheads sued trident alleging that tridents practice was an illegal tying arrangement and monopolization in violation of federal antitrust laws23 traditionally for tying to constitute an antitrust violation the plaintiff must affirmatively establish that the defendant has market power ie control over the market in which his product competes independent ink asserted that trident necessarily had market power in the market for the tying product pri ntheads as matter of law solely by virtue of its patent on the printhead system the us district court for the central district of california rejected that claim and found that there had been affirmative evidence of the relevant market nor of tridents position in it 24 thus the court granted summary judgment in favor of trident in january 2005 the federal circuit reversed the district courts decision holding that rebuttable presumption of market power arises from the possession of patent over tying product25 in so ruling the appellate court emphasized that it had duty to follow the precedents of the supreme court until the court itself chooses to expressly overrule them26 the supreme court has held for more than sixty years that where patented product was the tying product there was presumption that the existence of patent monopoly creates sufficient market power to support an antitrust violation27

amended the patent act in 198829 yet neither congress nor the supreme court had decided whether the presumption remained in antitrust jurisprudence when the tying product is patented in march 2006 the supreme court vacated the federal circuits judgment without dissent30 holding that the mere fact that tying product is patented does not support such presumption31 the court explained that its reevaluation of its precedents establishing the per rule was prudent in light of congresss narrowing of the patent misuse defense as well as the vast majority of academic literature that had

auctioneer after determining that 1 monetary damages would be an adequate remedy at law 2 mercexchange would not be irreparably harmed in the absence of an injunction 3 the balance of hardships fell slightly in ebays favor and 4 the public interest would not necessarily be furthered in this case because mercexchange does not practice its patents39 and exists merely to license its patented technology to others40 on appeal the federal circuit unanimously affirmed the jurys verdict on the finding of infringement41 however the appellate court ruled that mercexchange was entitled to an injunction to prevent further infringement by ebay finding inadequate the district courts reasons for refusing to issue an injunction42 according to the federal circuit because the right to exclude recognized in patent is but the essence of the concept of property the general rule is that permanent injunction will issue once infringement and validity have been adjudged 43 in may 2006 the supreme court unanimously vacated the federal circuits judgment and remanded the case to the district court for further proceedings consistent with the courts opinion in this case44 although the court noted that we take position on whether permanent injunctive relief should or should not issue in this particular case45 the court clarified that the traditional principles of equity that govern issuance of injunctive relief apply with equal force to disputes arising under the patent act46 thus dispelling any notion that patent disputes are subject to different standards than those applicable to cases arising under other areas of law the court explained that neither of the lower courts had fairly applied the traditional equitable principles in determining whether injunctive relief should issue in this case the district court had erred by improperly suggesting that injunctive relief was categorically unavailable in cases where patent holders only license their patents rather than commercialize the invention themselves on the other hand the federal circuit was incorrect in pronouncing rule unique to patent cases that strongly favored injunctions when infringement has been adjudged two concurring opinions written by chief justice john roberts jr and justice anthony kennedy were filed in ebay v mercexchange and reveal an apparent disagreement among the justices chief justice roberts concurring opinion joined by justices antonin scalia and ruth bader ginsburg predicted that injunctive relief will likely continue to be the usual remedy for patent infringement consistent with the long tradition of equity practice 47 district courts equitable discretion in granting or denying an injunction in patent cases therefore is not unfettered in the view of these three justices 39

may be instructive in applying the fourfactor test when the circumstances of patent case are similar to those of earlier cases justice kennedys concurring opinion joined by justices john paul stevens david souter and stephen breyer suggested that historical practice might not necessarily be helpful for courts to follow when dealing with some patent infrin gement suits in the current business environment trial courts should bear in mind that in many instances the nature of the patent being enforced and the economic function of the patent holder present considerations quite unlike earlier cases 48 justice kennedy acknowledged the emergence of patent holding companies and their impact on patent litigation today an industry has developed in which firms use patents not as basis for producing and selling goods but instead primarily for obtaining licensing fees for these firms an injunction and the potentially serious sanctions arising from its violation can be employed as bargaining tool to charge exorbitant fees to companies that seek to buy licenses to practice the patent when the patented invention is but small component of the product the companies seek to produce and the threat of an injunction is employed simply for undue leverage in negotiations legal damages may well be sufficient to compensate for the infringement and an injunction may not serve the public interest 49

elevated level of this amino acid correlates with deficiency in the two vitamins54 metabolite filed patent infringement lawsuit against laboratory corporation labcorp clinical reference laboratory that performs tests to help health care providers in diagnosing and treating their patients the lawsuit asserted that labcorp committed infringement on the patented method when it induced doctors to infringe by performing homocysteine tests and making the correlation in november 2001 jury found that the patent was valid and deemed labcorp guilty for willful patent infringement the us district court for the district of colorado entered an injunction against labcorp from performing any homocysteine tests in june 2004 the federal circuit affirmed the district courts decision the appellate court explained that infringement of the patent at issue occurs when physician determines there is cobalamin or folate deficiency by correlating particular test result of elevated levels of homocysteine with b vitamin deficiencies 55 this is the direct infringement of the patent56 for which labcorp was held liable for inducing57 the federal circuit cited evidence in the record that labcorp was liable for such infringement because its educational publications and informational materials distributed to medical doctors stated that elevated total homocysteine correlates to vitamin deficiencies58 the question presented on which the supreme court granted certiorari in this case was whether method patent setting forth an indefinite undescribed and nonenabling step directing party simply to correlate test results can validly claim monopoly over basic scientific relationship used in medical treatment such that any doctor necessarily infringes the patent merely by thinking about the relationship after looking at test result59 in its petitions submitted to the supreme court on this question labcorp urged reversal of the federal circuits judgment labcorp argued that upholding the patent claim in this case would amount to allowing patent on scientific principle or scientific fact in violation of patent jurisprudence that prohibit patenting laws of nature natural phenomena and abstract ideas60 in reply metabolites briefs argued that the supreme court should dismiss the case on procedural grounds metabolite noted that the issue of whether the diagnostic method met subject matter patentability requirements should not be considered by the court because the matter was never properly raised or addressed in labcorps arguments before the district court or federal

certiorari or affirm the federal circuits decision in per curiam decision62 issued on june 22 2006 the court dismissed the case stating only that the writ of certiorari was improvidently granted63 the effect of the dismissal is that the federal circuits judgment affirming infringement liability and the patents validity is left undisturbed three justices dissented to the dismissal of the writ justice stephen breyer writing for himself and justices john paul stevens and david souter argued that the question is not unusually difficult to decide the parties have fully briefed the question and that the court has the authority to decide it furthermore he opined that thos who engage in medical research who practice medicine and who as patients depend upon proper health care might well benefit from this courts authoritative answer64 justice breyer explained that he would have held the patent invalid because there can be little doubt that the correlation between homocysteine and vitamin deficiency is natural phenomenon that is not patentable65 in addition justice breyer offered insight into his views regarding the legal correctness of the federal circuits state street bank decision in 1998 which had held that process is patentable if it produces useful concrete and tangible result66 this controversial federal circuit decision has paved the way for inventors to obtain patent s on methods or techniques of doing business for example the patent in the ebay case discussed above is socalled business method patent justice breyer criticized the state street bank ruling asserting that

rights of any interested party seeking such declaration whether or not further relief is or could be sought in case of actual controversy within its jurisdiction the supreme court has held that an action for declaratory relief qualifies as case or controversy under article iii70 furthermore it has explained the question in each case is whether the facts alleged under all the circumstances show that there is substantial controversy between parties having adverse legal interests of sufficient immediacy and reality to warrant the issuance of declaratory judgment 71 the question that the supreme court faced in medimmune v genentech is whether patent licensee must terminate or breach its license agreement before it can bring suit to obtain declaratory judgment that the underlying patent is invalid unenforceable or not infringed72 medimmune inc is pharmaceutical company that manufactures drug synagis used to prevent respiratory tract disease in infants and young children year before the us food and drug administration approved synagis for marketing to consumers medimmune had entered into patent license agreement with the biotechnology company genentech in 1997 concerning an existing genentech patent relating to the production of chimeric antibodies the cabilly i patent and also thenpending patent applic ation for the coexpression of immunoglobulin chains in recombinant host cells73 medimmune agreed to pay royalties on sales of any licensed products that it may make or sell which would infringe the claims of either of the patents if not for the license agreement 74 in december 2001 genentech was awarded patent on the coexpression application that was the subject of the licensing agreement cabilly ii patent genentech sent medimmune letter asserting that the synagis drug came within the scope of the new cabilly ii patent and that therefore it was licensed product for which royalties are owed under the 1997 license agreement medimmune however believed the cabilly ii patent invalid and unenforceable or alternatively that synagis did not infringe the patents claims despite this assessment medimmune paid the royalties under protest because it considered genentechs letter threat to sue for patent infringement if it failed to comply with the demands therein 75 medimmune initiated declaratory judgment action against genentech seeking declaration that the patent was invalid genentech filed defense motion pursuant to federal rules of civil procedure 12b1 asserting that the federal courts lacked article iii jurisdiction over the claim because actual controversy existed between the parties the us district court for the central district of california granted the motion dismissing the case for lack of subject matter

the patent because the license agreement obliterates any reasonable apprehension that the licensee will be sued for infringement78 because medimmune continued to pay royalties under the license agreement it was licensee in good standing and was not unde r threat or in reasonable apprehension of suit the court reasoned79 on appeal the federal circuit affirmed the district courts judgment relying on its earlier gen probe decision in determining that there was lack of justiciable controversy80 in 81 decision the supreme court reversed the federal circuits judgment and remanded the case to the district court the court held that patent licensee is not required to repudiate its license agreement before seeking declaratory judgment in federal court that the underlying patent is invalid unenforceable or not infringed81 however the court expressed opinion on whether such nonrepudiating licensee is relieved of its contract obligations during the suit challenging the patents validity82 writing for the majority justice antonin scalia first explained that the article iii case or controversy requirement would have been satisfied if medimmune had refused to make royalty payments83 at issue here however was whether case or controversy still existed when medimmunes compliance with the license terms eliminated the immediate threat of injury from patent infringement lawsuit justice scalia offered comparison to situation where the government threatens legal action in which there is requirement that plaintiff expose himself to liability before bringing suit to challenge the basis for the threatfor example the constitutionality of law threatened to be enforced 84 in such case courts have not found article iii jurisdiction to be lacking despite the fact that the plaintiffs own action or inaction in failing to violate the law eliminates the imminent threat of prosecution85 although private party rather than the government thre atened the enforcement action in medimmune this distinction does not make significant legal difference that would eliminate jurisdiction justice scalia argued86 thus the federal circuit erred when it upheld the district courts dismissal of the case for lack of jurisdiction in lone dissent justice clarence thomas maintained that patent licensee in good standing must breach its license prior to challenging the validity of the underlying patent87 he stated the declaratory judgment procedure cannot be used to obtain advanced rulings on matters that would be addressed in future case of actual controversy in his view medimmunes suit was an attempt to seek ruling on hypothetical or conjectural matters and thus federal courts lacked article iii jurisdiction over its claims 78 medimmune 127 sct at 768 quoting genprobe inc v vysis inc 359

provides one of the statutory bars for patentability of inventions such that patent claim is invalid if the di fferences between the subject matter sought to be patented and the prior art89 are such that the subject matter as whole would have been obvious at the time the invention was made to person having ordinary skill in the art to which said subject matter pertains90 in other words for the subject matter of an alleged invention or discovery to be patentable it must be nonobvious at the time of its creation the nonobviousness requirement is met if the subject matter claimed in patent application is beyond the ordinary abilities of person of ordinary skill in the art in the appropriate field91 in the landmark 1966 case graham v john deere co of kansas city the supreme court established an analytic framework for courts to determine nonobviousness the socalled graham test describes several factors that must be assessed while the ultimate question of patent validity is one of law the 103 condition which is but one of three conditions each of which must be satisfied lends itself to several basic factual inquiries under 103 the scope and content of the prior art are to be determined differences between the prior art and the claims at issue are to be ascertained and the level of ordinary skill in the pertinent art resolved against this background the obviousness or nonobviousness of the subject matter is determined such secondary considerations as commercial success long felt but unsolved needs failure of others etc might be utilized to give light to the circumstances surrounding the origin of the subject matter sought to be patented as indicia of obviousness or nonobviousness these inquiries may have relevancy 92 while single prior art reference could form the basis of finding of nonobviousness multiple prior art references are often involved in the analysis in such situation the federal circuit had developed an approach in which an invention woul d be considered obvious only if there was an explicit or implicit teaching suggestion or motiv ation that would lead person of ordinary skill to combine multiple prior art references to produce an invention93 such teaching suggestion or motivation tsm could have come from either 1 the references themselves 2 knowledge of those skilled in the art or 3 the nature of problem to be solved leading inventors to look to references relating to possible solutions to that problem94 because 103 of the patent act requires that an inventions obviousness be determined from the standpoint of 88

invention was made the tsm test was designed in part to defend against the subtle but powerful attraction of hindsightbased obviousness analysis95 the patents at issue in ksr international co v teleflex inc pertain to an adjustable pedal system aps for use with automobiles having electronic throttlecontrolled engines teleflex inc holds an exclusive license for the patent on this device that allows driver to adjust the location of cars gas and break pedal so that it may reach the drivers foot ksr international co also manufactures an adjustable pedal assembly and in mid2000 designed its aps to incorporate an electronic pedal position sensor in order for it to work with electronically controlled engines which are being increasingly used in automobiles in 2002 teleflex filed patent infringement lawsuit against ksr asserting that this new design came within the scope of its patent claims in defense ksr argued that teleflexs patents were invalid because they were obvious under 103a of the patent actthat someone with ordinary skill in the art of designing pedal systems would have found it obvious to combine an adjustable pedal system with an electronic pedal position sensor for it to work with electronically controlled engines 96 the us district court for the eastern district of michigan agreed with ksr that the patent was invalid for obviousness granting summary judgment in favor of ksr97 the court determined that there was little difference between the teachings of the prior art and claims of the patentinsuit 98 furthermore the court opined that it was inevitable that aps would be combined with an electronic device to work with electronically controlled engines99 upon teleflexs appeal the federal circuit vacated the district courts ruling the appellate court found that the district court had improperly applied the tsm test by not adhering to it more strictlythe district court had reached its obviousness ruling without making findings as to the specific understanding or principle within the knowledge of skilled artisan that would have motivated one with knowledge of the inve ntion to make the combination in the manner claimed 100 in the federal circuits view unless the prior art references address the precise problem that the patentee was trying to solve the problem would not motivate person of ordinary skill in the art to combine the prior art teachingshere the placement of an electronic sensor on an adjustable pedal 101 the supreme court granted certiorari on june 26 2006 to review the ksr case in which the central question before the court was whether the federal circuit had erred in crafting tsm as the sole test for obviousness under 103a of the patent act102 on april 30 2007 the court unanimously reversed the federal

proper framework for court or patent examiner to employ when determining an inventions obviousness is that set forth in the courts 1966 opinion graham v john deere co of kansas city that analytic framework provides an expansive and flexible approach to the question of obviousness that the rigid and mandatory tsm formula does not offer104 justice kennedy observed that the graham approach as further developed in three subsequent supreme court cases decided within ten years of that case105 is based on several instructive principles for determining the validity of patent based on the combination of elements found in the prior art when work is available in one field of endeavor design incentives and other market forces can prompt variations of it either in the same field or different one if person of ordinary skill can implement predictable variation it is likely obvious under 103 and unpatentable if technique has been used to improve one device and person of ordinary skill in the art would recognize that it would improve similar devices in the same way using the technique is obvious unless its actual application is beyond his or her skill106 justice kennedy then provided additional guidance for courts in following these principles to determine whether there was an apparent reason to combine the known elements in the manner claimed by the patent at issue courts should explicitly engage in an analysis that considers the following elements the interrelated teachings of multiple patents the effects of demands known to the design community or present in the marketplace and the background knowledge possessed by person having ordinary skill in the art107 the federal circuits tsm test and its mandatory application is contrary to graham and its progeny because it limits the obviousness analysis and is too formalistic justice kennedy argued108 in addition he believed that the tsm test hindered the ability of courts and patent examiners to rely upon common sense109 however justice kennedy allowed that tsm provides helpful insightthat patent comprised of several elements is not obvious just because each of those elements was 104 id at 1739 1741

tsm test is not necessarily inconsistent with the graham analysis and thus he predicted that the federal circuit has likely applied the tsm test on many occasions in ways that accord with the graham principles it is the federal circuits rigid application of its tsm rule however that the court deemed was problematic in this case111 justice kennedy identified four specific legal errors committed by the federal circuit first the appellate court had held that courts and patent examiners should look only to the problem the patentee was trying to solve rather than other problems addressed by the patents subject matter112 second the appellate court had assumed that person of ordinary skill trying to solve particular problem will be led only to those elements of prior art designed to solve the same problem however common sense teaches that familiar items may have obvious uses beyond their primary purposes and in many cases person of ordinary skill will be able to fit the teachings of multiple patents together like pieces of puzzle 113 the third error of the lower court was its erroneous conclusion that patent claim cannot be proved obvious by showing that the combination of elements was obvious to try instead justice kennedy noted the fact that combination was obvious to try might show that it was obvious under 103114 the final error was the federal circuits adherence to rigid preventative rules to avoid the risk of hindsight bias on the part of courts and patent examiners because such rules deny factfinders recourse to common sense 115 as to the specific patent claim at issue in this case the court adopted the obviousness analysis of the district court and expressly held that the claim must be found obvious in light of the prior art 116

disks to replicate the master disk in generating multiple copies of windows for installation on foreignassembled computers that are then sold to foreign customers122 in considering microsofts motion the us district court for the southern district of new york first cited previous federal circuit decisions supporting the proposition that software is patentable123 then the court explained that 271f does not limit components to only physical machines or tangible structures but rather could include intangible information or data thus the district court rejected microsofts argument that software could not be component of patented invention under 271f124 as for the copies made abroad from the golden master disk sent from the united states the district court held that such copies still came within the scope of 271f in light of the legislative intent of the statute to prohibit the circumvention of infringement through exportation125 upon microsofts appeal divided panel of the federal circuit affirmed the district courts decision the appellate court relied on prior federal circuit case law that had held that without question software code alone qualifies as an invention eligible for patenting and statutory language does not limit section 271f to patented machines or patented physical structures such that software can very well be component of patented invention for the purposes of 271f 126 the federal circuit also ruled that because the act of copying is subsumed in the act of supplying the exportation of the golden master disks with the specific intent that they be

includes the act of foreign copying judge rader expressed concerns that such an interpretation is in effect an impermissible extraterritorial expansion of us patent law because it reaches c opying activity overseas128 in his view atts remedy lies not in us law but rather the law of the foreign country in which the infringement due to copying occurred129 the supreme court accepted microsofts petition for writ of certiorari in october 2006130 in order to answer two questions 1 whether digital software codean intangible sequence of 1s and 0smay be considered component of patented invention within the meaning of section 271f1 and if so 2 whether copies of such component made in foreign country are supplied from the united states in 71 decision131 issued in late april 2007 the court reversed the federal circuits judgment holding that microsoft was not liable for patent infringement under 271f as the statute is currently written when foreignmanufactured computers are loaded with windows software that has been copied abroad from master disk or an electronic transmission sent by microsoft from the united states 132 in regard to the first question posed in the case associate

abstract software code does not qualify as co mponent for purposes of triggering liability under 271f because it is an idea lacking physical embodiment and thus it cannot be usable combinable part of

statutory provision did not include the export of design tools such as blueprints schematics templates and prototypes136 thus for the windows software to be considered component under 271f the software code must be encoded or otherwise expressed in some sort of tangible mediuma computer readable software copy such as cdrom137 the court thus declined to adopt tts characterization of software in the abstract as combinable component that qualifies for 271f liability 138 in reaching its answer to the second question the court largely agreed with judge raders dissent from the federal circuits opinion the copies of windows used for installation on the foreign computers had been made abroad those copies were not supplied from the united states even though the master disk from which they were duplicated had been exported justice ginsburg noted according to her this distinction is legally relevant for liability purposes under 271f further such liability is not affected by the ease of copying software139 furthermore justice ginsburg argued that the traditional presumption against extraterritorial application of us law particularly in patent law would help favor the court construing 271f in manner that excludes intangible software code and copies of software made abroad140 echoing judge raders advice justice ginsburg observed that if at t desires to prevent copying abroad its remedy lies in obtaining and enforcing foreign patents141 at the end of the opinion justice ginsburg conceded that the courts decision effectively creates loophole for software makers to avoid liability under 271f142 however she explained that the court would resist using the dynamic judicial interpretation that would be needed to adjust the patent law to account for the realities of
