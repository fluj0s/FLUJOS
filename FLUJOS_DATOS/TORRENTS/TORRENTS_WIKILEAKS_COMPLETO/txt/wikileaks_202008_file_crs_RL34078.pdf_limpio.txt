regulatory requirements were implemented at time when cable was monopoly and were intended to protect broadcasters now that the market dynamics have changed they argue some of these rules should be changed to allow for more evenhanded negotiations at the same time however as result of consolidation and clustering in the cable industry there are few very large cable companies which primarily serve major markets as well as the two national satellite operators that appear to have suﬃcient market strength to be able to withstand many of the demands of the programmers with musthave

divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34078retransmission consent and other federal rules affecting programmerdistributor negotiations issues for congress summary when conflicts arise between programme r broadcaster or cable network owner and multichannel video programming distributor mvpd usually cable or satellite operator about the carriage of particular vide programming the price for that programming or the tier on which the programming is to be offered to the end user many consumers can be affected recently there have been several incidents in which negotiating impasse between programmer and dist ributor has resulted in the programmer refusing to allow the mvpd to carry or the mvpd choosing not to carry program network while cont ractual terms cond itions and rates are determined by private negotiations they are strongly affected by number of federal statutory provisions and regulatory re quirements including the statutory retransmission consent and mustcarry rules the fcc program exclusivity rules localintolocal and distant signal provisions in satellite laws copyright law provisions relating to cab and satellite statutor commercial leased access requirements and program carriage and nondiscriminatory access provisions and the fccs media ownership rules the recent increase in negotiating impasses appears to be the result of structural market changes that have given programmers with musthave programming much greater leverage particularly when they are negotiating with small distributors competitive entry in distribution almost all cable companies now face competition from two satellite companies and are beginning to face competition from telephone companies has em boldened programmers with popular programming to demand cash payment from distributors for the right to carry that programming in particular local broadcas ters increasingly are using the statutory retransmission consent requirement to demand cash payment from small cable companies who could lose subscribers to the satellite provide rs and new telephone entrants if they reach an impasse with the broadcaster and can longer carry the local broadcast signals in the past the cable companies were the only mvpd in market and could use that countervailing pow er to refuse to pay cash for carriage thus ironically competition in the distribution market may be resulting in higher programming costs that mvpds may have to pass on to their subscribers the small cable companies have argued that some of the existing statutory and regulatory requirements were implemented at time when cable was monopoly and were intended to protect broa dcasters now that the market dynamics have changed they argue some of these rules should be changed to allow for more evenhanded negotiations at the same time however as result of consolidation and clustering in the cable industry there are few very large cable companies which primarily serve major markets as well as the two national satellite operators that appear to have sufficient market strength to be able to withstand many of the demands of the programmers with musthave progra mming and to place small independent

twelfth annual report adopted fe bruary 10 2006 released march 3 2006 at 8 as of june 2005 there were 1096 million television households of which approximately 942 million subscribed to an mvpd service of the latter 694 received video programming from franchised cable operator and 277 from dbs operator 2 even where the impasse involves broadcast programming that is transmitted over the air most households that subscribe to an mvpd longer have an antenna and therefore at minimum would have to obtain and install an antenna to continue to receive the programming in these cases the mvpd typi cally has offered to provide free rabbit ears antenna although in many cases higher quality rooftop antenna is needed to get good over the air reception and some households ca nnot get decent reception even with rooftop antenna indeed that inability to receive br oadcast signals over the air was the original impetus for cable television which was then called community antenna television or catv retransmission consent and other federal rules affecting programmerdistributor negotiations issues for congress overview virtually all us households have television and almost 86 of these

than re lying upon free overtheair broadcast television signals1 as result when conflicts arise between programmers and mvpds about the carriage of particul ar video programming the price for that programming or the tier on which the programming is to be offered to the end user for example on basic or premium tier on top 60 or top 120 tier or on an analog or digital tier many consumers can be affected recently there have been several in cidents in which negotiating impasse between programmer and an mvpd has resulted in the programmer refusing to allow the mvpd to carry or the mvpd choosing not to carry program network forcing the mvpds subscribers to choose between foregoing that program network or switching to competing mvpd that does carry the program network2 there also have been number of situations in wh ich programmerdistribut or negotiations have been resolved without any disruption in program carriage but only after the negotiations played out in public with s ubscribers

usc 534 these rules apply to all cable operators att has claimed that due to the technology employed its mvpd servi ce is an information service rather than cable service and thus not subject to cable ru it views the retransmission consent rules as part of the copyright licensing framework and has agreed to negotiate for retransmission consent but it views the mustcarry rules as pa rt of the cable

614b3a of the communications ac t states that cab operator shall carry continuedeach side to contact the other side in order to place pressure on them to compromise often these public negotiations have occurred when the programming at risk included upcoming sports events that some subscribers placed high value on viewing3 also there have been incidents in which an mvpd has announced price increase to subscribers shortly after the conclusi on of contentious negotiations with programmer with the mvpd attributing the price increase to higher programming costs and the programmer nying the causal connection although the contractual terms conditions and rates at whic h content providers make their content available to programme rs and at which prog rammers make their programming available to distributors are determined by private negotiations there are number of federal statutory provisions and regulatory require ments that strongly affect those negotiations4 these include the retransmission consent and mustcarry rule s which govern the carriage of television broad cast signals by cable operators5 under these rules every three ye ars each local commercial broadcast television station must choos between 1 negotiating retransmission consent agreement with each cable system operating in its service area whereby if ag reement is reached the broadcaster is compensated6 by the cable system for the right to carry the broadcast signal and if agreement is not reached the cable system is not allowed to carry the signal or 2 requiring each cable system operating in its service area to carry its signal but receiving compensation for such carriage7 with this mandatory electionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34078crs3 7 continued in its entirety on the cable system of that ope rator the primary video transmission of each of the local commercial television stations ca rried on the cable system as broadcasters have deployed digital technology they have been able to use their new digital spectrum to transmit multiple video streams not just single stream andor to transmit their programming in highdefinition as well as sta ndard format the broadcasters have sought an interpretation of the mustcarry rule that would require cable operators to carry both their analog and their digital transmissions and wh ere they are offering multiple video streams or highdefinition transmissions that would re quire cable operators to carry their multiple streams and highdefinition transmissions to date the fcc has not adopted that interpretation but it is currently under discussi on as result carriage of these additional video transmissions has been subject to re transmission consent negotiations and is not mandatory on the part of cable or satellite operators 8 these rules are found in part 76 of the fccs rules for description of these rules see the fcc retransmission consent report at footnote 8 and at paras 1730 9 commercial television station licensees are entitled to protect the network programming they have contracted for by exercising nondup lication rights against more distant television broadcast stations carried on local cable levision system that serves more than 1000 subscribers commercial broadcast stations may assert these nonduplication rights regardless of whether or not their signals are being transmitted by the local cable system and regardless of when or if the network programming is scheduled to be broadcast generally the zone of protection for such programming cannot exceed 35 miles for stations licensed to community in the commissions list of top 100 television markets or 55 miles for stations licensed to communities in smaller tele vision markets in addition cable operator does not have to delete the network progra mming of any station which the commission has previously recognized as significantly viewed in the cable community 10 with respect to nonnetwork programming cable systems that serve at least 1000 subscribers may be required upon proper notifi cation to provide syndicated protection to broadcasters who have contracted with progra m suppliers for exclusive exhibition rights to certain programs within specific geographic area s whether or not the cable system affected is carrying the station requesting this protec tion however cable system is required to continuedbroadcasters with popular progra mming that are confident the local cable systems will want to carry that programming can make the retransmission consent election nd be assured compensation for such carriage and broadcasters with less popular programming that the local cable systems might ot herwise not choose to carry can make the must carry election and be assured that their signal will be carried by all local cable systems in many cases local broadcasters that are affiliated with national broadcast network and have elected the retransmission consent option have as part of their affiliation agreement assigned to the network the right to negotiate the terms of retransmission consent number of federal communications commission fcc or commission exclusivity rules8 that give local broadcasters the exclusive right to distribute certain programming the network program nonduplication rules9 and syndicated exclusivity protection rules10 or that protect sports teams or sports leagues distributionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34078crs4 10 continued delete program broadcast by station that ither is significantly viewed or places grade b or better contour over the community of the cable system 11 cable system located within 35 miles of th city of license of broadcast station where sporting event is taking place may not carry the live television broadcast of the sporting event on its system if the event is not available live on local television broadcast station if the holder of the broadcast rights to the even t or its agent requests such blackout the holder of the rights is responsible for notifying the cable operator of its request for program deletion at least the monday preceding the calendar week during which the deletion is desired if television broadcast station is licensed to the community in which the sports event is taking place the 35mile blackout zone extends from the broadcast stations licensed community with which the sports event or team is identified if the event or local team is not identified with any particular community for instance the new england patriots the 35mile blackout zone extends from the community nearest the sports event which has licensed broadcast station the sports blackout rule does not apply to cable television systems serving less than 1000 subscrib ers nor does it require deletion of sports event on broadcast stations signal that was carried by cable system prior to march 31 1972 the rule does not apply to sports programming carried on nonbroadcast program distribution services such as espn these services however

that would prevent an mvpd from requiri ng financial interest in program service as condition for carriage from coercing programmer to grant exclusive carriage rights or from discriminating against an unaffiliated programmer in fashion that unreasonably restrains the ability of that programmer to compete when the programming is distributed over satellite15 the requirements for nondiscriminatory access to programming in which cable operator has an attributable interest in section 628 of the communications act whic h directs the fcc to establish rules to prevent vertically integrated cable operator from discriminating in the prices terms and conditions at which it makes its programming available to nonaffiliated mv pds or have exclusive access to the programming in which it has an attributable interest16 but these prohibitions do not hold if the vertically integrated companys programming is distributed over terrestrial facilities for example over broadband lines an exception

baseball club of baltimore v national baseball clubs the supreme court ruled that baseball is sport subject to state regulations not business involved in interstate commerce that woul d be subject to the federal antitrust laws although the supreme court acknow ledged in its 1953 decision in toolson v new york yankees inc and again in its 1972 decision in flood v kuhn that the baseballs antitrust exemption was an anomaly it ruled that it is up to congress to change baseballs antitrust exemption other sports leagues do not enjoy the same broad antitrust exemption as baseball but the sports broadcasting act of 1961 15 usc 1291 created limited antitrust exemption that allows league to nego tiate the broadcasting rights for all the teams in football baseball basketball or hockey league the act was amended in 1966 to exempt the combining of any professional football leagues apply to all cable pr ogram networks as br oadband fiber optic cable becomes more widely deployed this exception has been termed by some the terrestrial loophole the broadcast ownership rules17 and cable ownership rules18 which can affect the relative negotiating strength of programmers and distributors by restricting or allowing their reach in national or local markets for example some parties have argued that changes in broadcast ownership rules that allow broadcasters to own more than one television station in market has significantly strengthened the retransmission consent bargaini ng position of those broadcasters that own or control more than one station in local market19 certain statutory exemptions from the antitrust laws for sports leagues20 in addition to these federal rules there sometimes is informal government intervention into programmerdistributor negotiations because of po litical sensitivity to consumers losing access to programmin g and especially local programming parties involved in negotia ting impasses or consumers affected by those impasses often will seek intervention by an elected official or regulatory agency even where there is formal process for such interv ention in some instances political pressurehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34078crs8 21 some cable companies have complained that although once broadcast station has chosen the retransmission consent option rather than the mustcarry option there is statutory requirement for cable company to reach retransmission consent agreement with the broadcast station if it is not in the cabl companys interest to do so in practice the political pressure placed on the cable company ca n force it to accept detrimental contract see for example the lengthy interview of fred dressler executive vice president of programming time warner cable presented as past present and future an oral history fred dressler reflects on his career the industry and its future an advertising supplement to multichannel news december 18 2006 at pp 18a36a 22 see anne veigle cox maneuver puts tv stations back on cable communications daily february 3 2005 at pp 45 23 there is precedence for changing regu lations affecting the programmerdistributor relationship as market conditions change fo r example in 1970 prior to the development of cable and satellite television when the thenthree major broadcast networks cbs nbc and abc captured approximately 90 of television viewers the fcc implemented financial interest and syndication rules fins yn rules that prohibited the networks from holding financial interest in the television programs they aired beyond firstrun exhibition and from creating inhouse syndication arms consent decrees executed by the department of justice in 1977 solidified the rules and limited the amount of primetime programming the networks could produce themselves in 1991 based in part in the decrease in major broadcast networks audience market share to approximately 65 the fcc relaxed the fin syn rules appeals courts later relaxed the rule s even further in eff ect eliminating the rules by november 1995can be placed on party to resolve contractual conflict in fashion that it would not agree to in strictly private negotiation21 in at least one situation in which cable company and broadcast station reached an impasse in retransmission consent negotiations and the local broadcast sign was removed from the cable companys offering city attorney threatened legal action against the cable company unless the broadcast signal were restored claiming that not providing the signal was violation of the franchising agreement between the city and the cable company22 recently there have been more frequent incidents of programmers and mvpds failing to reach contractual agreements and in several instances one or the other party or end users who were affected by the impasse have sought federal government intervention either at the fcc or with congress the parties seeking intervention often propose modification of ex isting statutory provisions or regulatory requirements that allegedly favor one side in the ne gotiations or undermine the successful consummati on of negotiations23 although these impasses have involved number of different issues the most c ontroversial and widely publicized conflicts have involved unresolved retransmission c onsent negotiations or agreements that would award single distributor exclusive rights for sports programming or that would require that highpriced sports networks be placed on the expanded basic tier there are three basic functional com ponents to the provision of video programming producing cont ent assembling content into programming package such as network that can be effici ently distributed and distributing the programming to end users for convenience in this report th content assembler is called programmer httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34078crs9 in most cases the programmer is media company that packages individual programs or program series to create an overtheair broadcas t network or cable network that programmer ma or may not own the production studio or sports team where the creative talent actors directors athletes etc directly produces the content that is may or may not vertically integrate backwards into direct production on occasion sports team or l eague will vertically integrate forward by packaging its own games and other progra mming into network under its own brand name for example national football l eague major league baseball or yankees network also sometimes company is both programmer and distributor for example while an overtheair broadcaster is just programmer for the majority of households that receive thei r video programs from an mvpd it is also distributor of that programming to the minority of hous eholds that continue to receive their programming overtheair similarly most of the large mvpds have vertically integrated backward and now have partial or total equity interests in some of the cable networks distributed over their cable or satellite systems several mvpds also own sports teams for example cablevis ion owns the new york knicks and thus are content producers as well moreover the large media companies that own broadcast networks also own cable networks and often tie distributor access to their broadcast networks to agreement to ca rry some of their cable networks further complicating these relationships although existing statutory rules give the local broadcast station the right to negotiate the terms under which it makes its programming available for retransmission by mvpds many of those local broadcasters are affiliated w ith national television netw ork and in their affiliation agreements with the national network give the network the right to negotiate the terms of retransmission consent moreover increasingly the negotiations between large programmers and large distributors also involve video ondemand rights to large portions of the programmers library of content as well as provisions setting conditions on how the programmer can make its programming available for internet cellphone and other new avenue s of distribution in addition during the transition from analog to digital transmission and the initial deployment of high definition technology programmerdistr ibutor negotiations increasingly involve issues of whether program will be carried in multiple formats analog and digital high definition and standard defi nition and whether network will be placed on an analog or digital tier despite all these complexities the relationships among content producer programmer and distributor are characterized by mutual need both the content producer and the programmer need distributor s that have direct contact with the potential audience the dist ributor needs content produ cers and programmers with good content to attract subscribers at th same time there is an inherent tension as each seeks to capture the lions share of the value that consumers place on the content each must weigh the potential loss if an impasse occurs and the programmer refuses to permit the distributor to carry the programming or if the distributor chooses not to carry the prog ramming for example for the programmer that potential loss could take the form of foregone compensation from the mvpdhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34078crs10 24 kagan research reported in economics of basic cable networks 2006 at p 5 that the advertisersupported cable networks had gross advertising revenues of 137 billion and also had license fee revenues of 137 billion in 2004 kagan projected that in 2009 those totals would be 254 billion and 242 billion respectivel in contrast broadcast networks historically have received almost all of their revenues from advertising not from per subscriber fees imposed on mvpds broadcaster attempts to increase those per subscriber fees have been at the core of the recent br oadcastermvpd retransmission consent conflicts 25 this report does not directly address spor ts programming because there are number of factors that are unique to sports programming such as vertical integration by the content continuedandor foregone advertisin g revenues as advertisers re spond to reduced audience24 both of which could be substa ntial if the mvpds subscribers represent significant portion of the programmers total audience and if those subscribers do not switch to another mvpd that does carry the progra mmers network for the distributor that potential loss could take the form of fore gone subscriber revenue if without the programming as part of its offering some end users shift to competing mvpd as well as foregone advertising revenues the losses could be substantial if many subscribers switched to competing mvpd given these risks negotiating impasses usually are avoided over time market for ces have led to the adoption of business models that serve content providers programmers and distributors but these business models represent an unstable equilibrium when market conditions that affect the relative nego tiating strength of content providers programmers and distributors change th newly strengthened party typically attempts to change the prevailing business model to its advantage that is happening today content providers nd programmers are taking adva ntage of structural market changes favorable to them to pressure mvpds to make cash payments for programming that until now was availa ble either for free or for noncash considerations or where cash payments have been made in the past to make higher cash payments some mvpds have had sufficient countervailing market power to resist or limit these changes but others have not this had led to calls by the smaller often rural mvpds for modifications to the retransmission consent rules and other federal rules that allegedly favor programmers and in particular local broadcast stations in their negotiations with distributors there is one critical business practice th at tends to hold for the contractual relationships at all levels the practice of including strict nondisclosure provision that prohibits the parties from revealing the terms rates and conditions in the contract this practice limits the informa tion publicly available to the negotiating parties and thus tends to favor the larger partie s whether programmers or distributors who are involved in more negotiations and thus privy to more confidential informa tion this prac tice also severely limits public policy makers access to information since even partie s that would be willing to make such information available to government agencies are prohibited from doing so this report first analyzes the changing programmerdistributor market dynamics for nonsports programming that are thr eatening to undermine traditional business models25 it then provides examples of recent programmerdistributor conflicts thathttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34078crs11 25 continued providers into distribution the unique demand ch aracteristics of sports fans the lack of close substitutes for major sports leagues and the seasonal nature of sports that yield viable business models that do not apply to nonsports programming sports programming is addressed in this report to the extent it re presents musthave programming that affects programmerdistributor negotiations that affect nonsports as well as sports programming 26 these are companies that have been awar ded franchises by local franchising authorities and have built their own wireline networks in areas already served by an incumbent cable operator these overbuilders frequently offer broadband access service as well as cable service and often serve smaller geographic areas than the incumbent cable operator sometimes serving only highrise buildings 27

made by various parties to modify current statutory and regulatory rules in light of the market changes market changes affecting the programmer distributor relationship the increase in programmerdistributor conflicts is in large part the result of several structural changes in the video market that are affecting the relative negotiating strengths of the various pa rties and hence undermining prevailing business models and affecting the availability and pricing of video programming for consumers more distribution options the most significant structural change in the video market is the increase in the number of program distribution options today programmers can distribute their product not only through traditi onal broadcast television sta tions and cable operators but also through direct broadcast satellite operators and other satellite companies the new multichannel video offe rings of the major telephone companies cable overbuilders26 online video streams and even cellular telephones as result programmers have more options available to them to reach audiences and are able to negotiate with distributors from positi on of strength often demanding terms conditions and rates that are more favorable to themselves and less favorable to distributors than those that have prevailed in the past27 the market implications are greatest for musthave programming such as major sports programming and the programming of the four major broadcast networks for which significant portion of subscribers have sufficiently strong intensity of demand that they consider carriage of that programming prerequisite for subscribing with an mvpd an mvpd that does not offer musthave programming may find itself at significant competitive disadvantage in the market by contrast the prevailing business model was developed and some of the programmerdistribut or contracts that arehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34078crs12 28 this is greater concern for national programmer such as cable network or broadcast network than for local progra mmer such as local broadcast station 29 it is not always clear whether it is the sa tellite company or the programmer that is actually paying the customer to switch mvpd for example when sinclair broadcast group and mediacom communications were in an impasse in retransmission consent negotiations late in 2006 mike wilson the general manager of sinclairs fox 17 station in iowa issued statement to viewers stating in part that t he termination of our relationship with mediacom need not limit your ability to continue to wa tch us you may choose to subscribe to either directv or to the dish network both of which will continue to carry fox 17 we particularly encourage you to call directv because if you sign up with them prior to december 1 2006 and comply with certain requirements fox 17 will pay you 150 which will be applied as rebate against your directv bill which will be applied as fifteen 10 rebates against each of your

1990s when cable operators typically were the monopoly mvpd in their service area and therefore had countervailing market power when negotia ting with programmers including those programmers with musthave programming one group of distributors small and midsized cable companies has been placed in particularly difficult position by this structural market change while second group of distributors the newl yentering telephone companies has hastened this change and both in tur n have had an impact on all distributors small and midsized cable companies of ten face direct competition from the two major satellite companies directv and dish network these cable companies have far fewer subscribers than the major satellite companies and thus when negotiating with programmers typically do not pose serious risk to the programmers if there is an impasse and the programming is not carried programmers foregone per subscriber fees from these cable comp anies and foregone advertising revenues would not be substantial by cont rast programmers revenues could be significantly reduced if one of the satellite companies discontinued carriage since each of the satellite carriers have more than 13 million subscribers28 moreover many of the smaller cable companies have limited or ability to offer telephone and broadband access services and ther efore limited ability to offer bundled videotelephonebroadband services that tend to foster customer retention even when favored programming is longer carried thus if an impasse were to occur smaller cable company would face significan t risk of losing subscribers to satellite companies in fact where smaller cable company has had an impasse with programmer sometimes the programmer or satellite operator that has an agreement with the programmer and is competing with the cable company has offered bounty of upwards of 200 to households to switch to the satellite service with these offers marketed over the programmers network while the programmercable company negotiations are still ongoing29 the telephone company entrants which ar starting to offer multichannel video service and therefore must offer wide array of programming to attract consumers away from incumbent cable and satellite providers also have very limited leveragehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34078crs13 30 the very large cable companies appear to have been more successful than the two large satellite companies in resisting cash payments fo r several reasons their strategy to cluster their systems in limited number of local markets has given them high subscriber penetration in those markets which helps in negotiations with local broadcast stations also their ability to offer bundles of video voice and data services reduces the likelihood that subscribers will change provider based so lely on the loss of particular video program finally they are negotiating from history of not making cash payments at least to broadcasters and this has created an inertia that takes greater effort for the programmers to overcome in their negotiations with programmers but this situation may not be particularly harmful to the telephone companies busine ss plans for several reasons first they may be less resistant to higher per s ubscriber charge for access to programming than has previously prevailed in the market because they currently have very few subscribers and thus this cost represents very small portion of their market entry costs their costs for programming even if paying premium pale in relation to the capital investments and operating costs associated with truck rolls to customer premises needed to bring fiber or other wireline broadband technologies close to the home moreover in contrast with th smaller cable companies the telephone companies have signifi cant revenues streams from telephone and broadband access services that contribute toward the fixed costs of their infrastructure the willingness of the telephone companie s to pay more than the previously prevailing rates for programming and the inability of many smaller cable operators to withstand programmer demands for higher payments have adversely affected the ability of the large incumbent mvpds cable and satellite to resist less favorable terms for progra mming despite the counterva iling market strengths that they bring to their negotiations althoug h these large mvpds have rarely had an impasse in negotiations that resulted in carriage of particular programming being disrupted the trade press has noted very contentious negotiations and despite contractual language requiring all parties to keep all terms confidential evidence that the cash payments that the large cable nd satellite companies are paying for popular programming are increasing30 ironically the market consequence of greater competition in the distribution of video programming appears to be greater negotiating leverage for programmers with popular and especially musthave programming resulting in higher programming prices that mvpds tend to pass through at least partially to subscribers consolidation and cluste ring of cable operators at the same time that additional distribution options have become available to video programmers consolidation acquisitions resulting in small number of large firms serving an increasing portion of tota l subscribers nationwide and clustering acquisitions resulting in individual firms serving an increasing portion of subscribers in particular local market are occurring among cable operators and the two major satellite operators are growing so that the largest video distributors are serving higher share of total mvpd subscribers than they have in the past and the large cable operators serving areas have become incr easingly concentrated into small number of very large clusters these trends are the result of acquisitions by the large cablehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34078crs14 31 the herfindahlhirschman

been included in this list they would have ranked second and fourth respectively32 but satellite operators have somewhat different market impact because they have subscribers dispersed all around the country while cable companie s tend to cluster their systems in limited number of geographic areas an individual cable cluster most likely consists of multiple cable franchises negotiated with many local jurisdictions in the early years of the cable industry most of the rger firms bidding for cable franchises did not focus their efforts on narrow geographic regions as result the larger cable operators tended to have cable franchise that were wide ly scattered geographically subsequently many of these large firms trad ed franchises to develop clusters in smaller number of geographic areas

the most basic tier offered by these mvpds that is th one with largest number of subscribers for example the top 60 tier rather than the top 120 tiercable system consolidation and clus tering have diffe rent programmer distributor negotiating implications when the programmer has national reach for example national cable program network or national broadcas t network vs local reach for example local broadcast stati on as explained below consolidation increases the leverage of cable system relative to national program networks while clustering increases the leverage of cable system relative to local broadcast stations negotiating with cable program network cable program networks get approximately half their revenues from per subscriber fees imposed on mvpds and half from advertising33 and those advertising fees depend on the number of subscribers reached so the more subscribers an mvpd reaches the more valuable that mvpd is to the program network cable program networks that fa il to achieve substantial penetration on mvpd systems face financial peril in recent proceedings at the fcc parties have filed comments asserting that in order to generate the advertising revenues necessary for success national program network must reach between 40 and 60 million and perhaps as many as 75 million subscribers34 carriage on the major mvpd systems comcast time warner directv and dish network therefore is key to cable program network success cable program ne twork business strategies therefore focus on obtaining and retaining such carriage for new cable program network that might involve giving one of the major mvpd s an equity interest in exchange for carriage for an established cable network with strong brand identity that might involve creating sister network and manding mvpds to carry the new network in lieu of cash for carriage of the estab lished network but even an established program network is unlikely to risk negotiating impasse that results in discontinued carriage by any of those large mvpds as shown in table 4 the 20 most widely distri buted advertisersupported cable program networks each are available to more than 90 000000 households vias mvpd subscription comparing table 2 to table 4 it is clear that the cable program networks that have achieved pe netration rates of 90000000 enjoy carriage on each of the four largest mvpd systems the systems of the two largest cable operators as well as on the systems of the two major dbs operators35 as shown in table 2 subscriber reach falls quite quickly beyond those large mvpds while cable program networks will seek carriage on all mvpds as the subscriber reach ofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34078crs19 the mvpd falls the financial risk to cable program network provider of failing to reach carriage arrangement with the mvpd falls this may make it easier for the cable network provider to push harder for high per subscriber fee from smaller mvpd from the perspective of small or midsized cable operator however failing to reach carriage arrangement for relatively popular cable program network that is carried by directv andor dish network can be risky thus cable operators negotiating position visavis cable network programmers will be strengthened by consolidation table 4 cable program networks with the largest number of subscribers as of december 2006 rank

broadcast station is conducting its own negotiati ons with mvpds which appears to be happening more often these days in this situation the broadcasters reach is limited to the local market dma in which its station is located or in the case of station that is part of nonnetwork broadcast group the local markets in which the group has stations its concern will not be with the total subs criber reach of the mvpds with which it is negotiating but rather with the subscriber reach of those mvpds within the local markets in which the group has stations db s operators are likely to offer service in many or all of those markets but an individual cable company even one as large as comcast or time warner is unlikely to ope rate in all those local markets what becomes most important then is whether the cable company is clustered in the market or markets in which the broadcaster has stations comparing the subscriber reach of cable clusters presented in table 3 to the populations of the markets covered by those clusters it is clear that there are many cable clusters that serve substantial portion of the households in the local broa dcast markets in which they are located in these situations the local broadcasters are less likely to risk negotiating impasse with the clustered cable company and therefore likely to face constraints on the demands they can make for retr ansmission consent compensation charter communications ceo neil smit has stated that actions it has taken to increase the densities of its existing clusters have strengthened its position in retransmission consent nego tiations making it more difficult for station groups to play hardball given that they would put greater portions of their ad revenues at stake36 one industry observer has described this negotiating situation as follows cable operators have more clout than lcos and even dbs cable operators are big enough in major markets to take broadcaster dark in 6080 of local homes overnight that would guarant ee immediate pain as major advertisers cancel but dbs operator might serve just 1020 of local homes so it can inflict far less pain telcos are in the weakest position37 more program networks fragmented audiences another major structural market change has been the dramatic expansion in the number of program networks sometimes referred to as channels available to consumers with

much compensation from mvpds for carriage rights it may well be that if such program network is not affiliated with an mvpd or with major programmer it will have to rely on the commercial leased access rules and pay to gain access to an mvpd39 on the other hand the relatively few pr ogram networks that attract larger audiences are valuable to mvpds for two reasons first program network that

negotiations with local cable systems because the latter would not want to risk losing carriage of the programming of tw major networks and two local stations 42 see for example david bauder data says 25 million less watching tv associated press wire may 8 2007 might choose among competing mvpds based on the availability of that networks programming there is greater business risk to mvpds not to carry that program network second larger audiences tend to attract more advertis ing revenues for the mvpd according to kagan research in 2005 of the several hundr ed advertising supported cable networks only 8 receive d from mvpds average monthly license fees of 40 cents or more per subscriber only 24 received fees of 20 cents or more only 51 received fees of 10 cents or more and only 112

price increases for them and in any case losing the right to carry such program network is unlikely to result in significant subscriber migration to competing mvpds some program networks how ever remain extremely valuable to mvpds and in fact in some ways network proliferati on has increased the value of these networks even if their audience share has shrunk over time table 6 shows that although the major broadcast networks share of u s television household usage has fallen substantially over time they continue to capture relatively large audiences more than 25 of all television usage including usage to watch vcrs and to play video games is spent viewing the national programming offered by the four major broadcast networks and the local and syndicated programming offered by those networks local broadcast station affiliates and that is projected to continue to approach 25 of all usage at the end of the decade since both the national programming and the local programming offered by these major network affiliates attract such relatively large audiences an mvpd in market where there is competition from other mvpds could find itself at risk of losing substantial numbers of subscribers if contract negotiation impasse resulted in it not carrying the programming of one of those affiliates41 interestingly recent reports that the four major broadcast networks lost 25 million viewers during the spring of 2007 specifically raised the impact that this might have on the advertising rates charged by the networks but did not address the pot ential impact on the

distributors television households are far more likely to switch mvpd providers if they fear the loss of particular time sensitive programming such as the super bowl the olympic games the national football league season or the finale of american idol or some other extremely popular series some programmers have effectively timed their negotiations with distributors to take advantag of such program schedules45 i n s m c s s programmers with the rights to sports events have agreed to monthtomonth extensions of lapsed agreements with mvpds until time when key sports event was imminent and then used the threat of st access to that sports event as leverage to complete more favorable distribution agreement with the mvpds46 table 7 shows that despite the dominan ce of the four major

in cash flow in 2004 with an enviable margin of 341corporate brand umbrella such as disney discovery espn or fox since then the increase in the number of channels av ailable to households and continued competitive entry by new program networks has resulted in more and more video networks being only margina lly profitable most progra m networks do not generate revenues in excess of produc tion costs and the likelihood of new program network proving very popular and prof itable is diminishing this may be constraining the incentive which has been strong in the past of large programmers to introduce additional program networks sometimes even when they can use their entrenched successful networks to cross market their new networks48 thus although it has been common for distributors to compensate programmer for carriage of that programmers popular programming by agreeing also to carry the programmers new program networks that is becoming less attractive form of compensation unless the programmer has an extremely strong brand identity to exploit it appears that increasingly more attractive alternative is for the programmer to extract the value from its popular programming directly by manding cash payment from distributors for carriage of that popular programming audience fragmentation also appears to be affecting the relationship between the large broadcast networks and their ffiliated broadcast stations traditionally under the networkaffiliate contracts the networks assumed the retransmission consent rights of their affiliates in exchange for making cash payments to the affiliates the broadcast networks then typically negotiated retransmission consent agreements in which the mvpds agreed to carry new or less popular cable program networks owned by the broa dcast networks for example msnbc or espn classic as partial compensation for carrying the br oadcast network recently the broadcast networks seem to be changing their business strategy giving back to their affiliate broadcast stations the right to negotiate retransmission consent compensation from mvpds in exchange for reducing or eliminating the cash payments they make to their affiliate stations according to report in multichannel newswire and during the past several years the big four networks have renegotiated affiliate deals to eventually eliminat oncelucrative network compensation fees paid to stations to carry programming from abc cbs fox and nbc perhaps not coincidentally those fees began to decline precipitously in 2005 right around the time that retransmission consent revenue for the affiliate stations began to rise for example in 2005 network compensation at hearst argyle fell 359 from 288 million to 191 million and dipped another 487 in 2006 to 98 million

say that retransmission consent fees have replaced the steady decline in revenues from television network compensation49 the trend toward greater program ne twork proliferation and fragmented audiences is complicated by several significant technologicallydriven forces during the transition from analog to digital tec hnology programmers of both cable networks and broadcast networks are trying to get mvpds to carry their programming in both analog and digital format and to carry their digital programming in high definition as well as standard format thus single program network now might seek multiple channels on an mvpd system to offer anal og digital and highdefinition feeds at the same time the deployment of digital technology is allowing broadcasters to provide multiple digital signals that is multiple video programs on their licensed spectrum not just single signal broadcaster that previously provided programming for one channel on an mvpd system now may seek multiple channels which depending on how the fcc ultimately implements the mustcarry and retransmission consent rules in multicast digital environment could result in larger portion of an mvpds system being set aside exclusively for broadcast program networks whether these technolog ical changes strengthen the negotiating positions of programmers or distributors may well depend almost entirely on how the fcc or congress adopts the mustcarry and retransmission consent rules for this new environment in the short run howev er to obtain carriage of multiple signals in their retransmission consent

local broadcast signals to be able to compete with cable in february 2006 nexstar ceo perry sook said the company expected to collect around 12 million per year from its recent round of negotiations

basic tier with perhaps 60 program channels and progressively higherpriced tiers with perhaps 120 and 180 program channels programmers of course typically seek placement of their networks on the most basic tier which will be purchased by the most households and thus generate higher revenues in the form of greater per subscriber fees and more advertising revenues industry analysts and the trade press often report the subscriber levels for each of these tiers but rarely agree on those particular levels the discussion in this section cites number of different sources with inconsistent subs

broadcast television stations hearstargyle therefore had the right to negotiate retransmission consent agreements with the cable and satellite companies operating in those local broadcast markets there were about 16 million television households in those local markets approximately 14 million of which subscribed to mvpds but hearst argyle traditionally had made lifetime its agent in the retransmission consent negotiations with the mvpds and in t hose negotiations life time had successfully secured carriage of and higher cash payments for the various lifetime cable networks rather than seeking cash payments from the mvpds for carriage of the hearstargyle broadcast signals in exchange lifetime compensated hearstargyle 18 million in 2004 and 5 million in the first nine months of

that lifetime if forced to negotiate carriage on its own outside the context of retransmissi on consent negotiations would lack market leverage and would have to accept lower cash paymen t since its

dish network lose nonethel ess because it had set the precedent of paying cash for carriage of broadcast network in any case dish network could not accomplish its objective if it made cash payments to

value of 100 to comcast and comcast would attribute the full 100 to the adve rtising but if in the absence of the agreement sinclair would have sold that advertising time to someone else then the incremental value to sinclair of that advertising time would be less than 100 perhaps 30 sinclair might then attribute only 30 to advertising and 70 to cash payment for retransmission consent142 similarly sinclair might place low value on the video on demand rights to its programming but comcast which is attempting to retain subscribers while competing w ith satellite by creating large vod library might place higher value on the programmin g for example it might be important to comcast that its subscribers have the ability to watch the 6 oclock local news at 8 oclock thus cable company

signals cities outside the 100 largest us markets typica lly have only three or four broadcast television stations and those broadcasters would not drop an affiliation with major broadcast network to carry the cw networ k cw thus was attempting to get those local broadcast stations which had space on their digital signals for few additional channels to carry the cw network on digita l slot

between programmers nd distributors although private are strongly affected by statutory and regu latory requirements nd cannot be properly characterized as freemarket those requirements were enacted to foster the three pillars of us media policy localism diversity of voices and competition congress tried to craft them in fashion that would minimize but not eliminate government intrusion in the market the specific public policy objectives they were intended to further include fostering local programming especially local broadcast programming fostering diversity of news and public affairs voices and entertainment choices fostering competition in all media markets encouraging innovative programming keeping cable and satellite subscription rates affordable and fostering infrastructure investment sometimes government intervention to foster one of these objectives will impede another it is possible that as market conditions have changed statutes or regulations that did not unduly favor one party over another when they were enacted or that were intended to favor party that was viewed as being in disadvantageous position now affect negotiations in an uni ntended fashion for example the various rules relating to cable carriage of broadcast signal s retransmission consent network non duplication and syndicated exclusivity rule s were developed at time when the local cable operator typically was the only mvpd in broadcasters service area and there was concern that cable operators might refuse to carry local signals or in some other way threaten the viability of local broadcasting today with competitive provision of multichannel vide services by satellite nd telephone systems the tables are somewhat turned and broadcasters with musthave programming often can negotiate from position of strength pecially with cable systems whose subscribers do not represent significan t portion of broadcasters audience the earlier discussions of market trends and of specific programmerdistributor disputes showed there is great variability in the negotiating strength of both individual programmers and i ndividual distributors they also showed that almost all impasses that resulted in mvpds not carrying particular programming occurred outside major markets despite the trend toward greater programmer negotiating strength in major markets distributors tend to have enough market clout to be able to reach agreements they can live with this is not the case in smaller markets in this new market environment it is possible that the one size fits all regulations currently in place may longer be foster ing the public policy objectives they were intended to advance especia lly outside major markets most of the proposals for modification of the current statutory and regulatory framework have come fromhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34078crs57 145 see httpwwweconomistcomresearch economicsalphabeticcfmletterr viewed on june 28 2007parties that operate in sma ller markets in reviewing these proposals it is important to consider their potential impact on large markets as well as smaller markets and to try to determine whether any changes s hould and could be limited to those markets where the current statutory and regulatory framework may be failing to safeguard the public against lost programming or higher prices also it is important to note that the parties that have been proposing statut ory or regulatory ch anges often cite the combined impact of multiple rules for example the impact of retransmission consent and program exclusivity rules in markets where broadcaster owns multiple stations that are affiliated to two or more major broadcast networks would changing just one of the existing rules resolve alleged existing problems or create new ones would changing multiple rules represent overkill economic factors relevant to analysis of the proposals for statutory and regulatory change in addition to the various market trends that were discussed in detail earlier there are three economic factors that might be relevant to specific proposals that have been made for statutory and regulatory ch ange these are the substantial economic rents earned by some factors of program production how to divide the value of must have programming and the rents it generates among programmers distributors and subscribers and the extent of consumer demand for program diversity successful existing network programs that have demonstrated the ability to generate larger audiences than the average program hit programs such as american idol and certain sports events be come more expensive to produce precisely because they are successful costs increase as the talent associated with those programs athletes actors direct ors producers are able to renegotiate contracts to command larger portion of the revenues they generate popular programming that attracts large audience or perhaps attracts somewhat smaller audience that has high intensity of demand typically generates large revenues either from advertisers or from direct subscr iber charges these higher than average revenues are shared by the owners of the programming and the program distributors in the form of profits and by the talent actors directors athletes in the form of high renegotiated salaries that include what economists call economic rent economic rent which some view as meas ure of market power is the difference between what factor of production is paid and how much it would need to be paid to remain in its current use star in successful television program might be paid 500000 per episode when his next best em ployment opportunity might be to sign up for new untested series for 100000 pe r episode if the ratings for the successful program were to fall or for some other reason the programmer could longer command as much compensation from distributors and subscribers as it had been receiving the star would likely continue to act but his salary would likely fall substantially reducing rent does not change production decisions so economic rent can be reduced without any dverse impact on the real economy145 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34078crs58 these economic rents become part of the cost of the programming the costs associated with each episode of successful network program at the peak of that programs popularity therefore could be many times the average costs of all programming from the perspective of the viewing public the substantial advertising and subscriber fee revenues generated by popular programming both of which ultimately are passed on to c onsumers are beneficial if they generate additional programming of the sort that the public prefer s to the extent these windfalls are ploughed back into the production of qually popular programming or innovative programming that might not otherwise be produced the public benefits but to the extent most talent athletes writers di rectors producers etc would continue to perform at the same level even if th ey could not command such high prices for their services the public does not benefit from system that fosters extremely high economic rents for example whenever sports league has negotiated new contract with broadcast or cable networ k that substantially increases the revenues flowing to the league the athletes in those leagues are able to command significantly higher salaries it is unlikely that the quality of those athletes performances would fall or those athletes would choose not to continue to play if their salaries were 1 million per year rather than 10 million but the level of these economic rents will affect the prices that subscribers pay for their mvpd service it is important to distinguish between economic rents which if reduced would not affect production and compen sation profits or earnings that are needed to attract factors of production for example it will be necessary for programmers to earn high profits on their successful programming in order to cover their losses from their unsuccessful programming this often lead s to debate about the amount of revenue that programmers need to generate in order to continue to provide quality programming and beyond that when prog ram is highly popular and can generate large revenues how those dditional revenues should be di stributed among the talent as salaries or other comp ensation programmers and di stributors as profits and subscribers through charges that are less than their full valuation of the programming this inevitably has been an area of conflict in retransmission consent negotiations broadcast signals typically consist of national network programming nationally syndicated programming and locally produced programming broadcasters argue that their stations have high audience ratings are more highly valued than cable networks and theref ore they should receive the bulk of the revenues generated by their programming mvpds argue those signals are provided free overtheair broadcasters get comp ensated by the dvertising revenues generated mvpd carriage increases the size of broadcast audiences and therefore increases broadcasters advertising reve nues and therefore mvpds should not be required to pay cash to carry the broadcast signals to their subscribers subscribers complain to their elected officials about increasing mv pd rates nd may switch to lowercost provider but ra rely discontinue service entirely in response to price increases there is market evidence about how subscribing households value these broadcast signals in 1999 congress enacted the satellite home viewerhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34078crs59 146 pl 106113 147 media dynamics inc tv dimensions 2006 at pp 2628improvement act shvia146 which allowed satellite operators to carry the signals of their subscribers local broadcast television stations the two major satellite operators directv and dish network began offering localintolocal service in some markets charging their subscribers separate 5 per month to receive the local signals in their market that charge is longer separated out the vast majority of their subscribers chose to receive the local broadcast signals showing willingness to pay for the combination of network syndicated and local programming provided by their local broadcast stations that does not answer the question however of how to distribute that value of that programming between the broadcaster and the mvpd or to allow the subscribers to pay less than their full va luation of the programming since economic rents do not generate additi onal productive value however it is in the public interest not to generate economic rents which ultimately are borne by consumers there also has been some discussion of the extent to which households value having access to one hundred or more channels when the average household only watches small portion of thos channels this could be useful information to help assess the impact on consumers of offering programming in tiered service offerings that bundle many networks together or in an à carte basis according to media dynamics inc147 although the average television household can now receive 106 channels typical adult wa tches only 13 to 14 of those channels on weekly basis over longer periods of time however the number of program sources the average viewer samples grows significantly as shown in table 11 the average adult cable subscriber watches at least 10 minutes of programming on 16 to 17 different channels in week on 31 different channels in f our weeks and on 43 channels in 13 weeks these data do not provide information on th value consumers assign to additional choices but do suggest that they take advantage of the

signals how ever subscribers could use rabbit ear or rooftop antennas to receive their local broadc asters signals off the air and thus receive the network syndicated and locally produced programming and in fact in cases where impasses have developed cable operators typically have offered subscribers free rabbit ear antennas in some situations however subscribers are not able to receive the local broadcast stations signal with rabbit ears or even with rooftop antenna because they are too far away from the broadcaster or unusual terrain intrudes blocks signal transmissionspecific proposals to modify current statutes and regulations the first two sections in this report scribed recent structural market changes that have altered the relative negotiating strength of programme rs and distributors and showed that in general this has occurred to the detriment of smaller cable companies most of the federal statutes and regulations affecting programmer distributor negotiations were enacted before these recent market changes nd indeed several were specifically intended to strengthen the negotiating position of broadcasters not surprisingly then most of the proposals to m odify current statutes and regulations have come from small distributors proposal allow the importation of distant signals when retransmission consent impasse develops currently cable operator that reaches retransmission consent impasse with local broadcaster is pr ohibited under the ne twork program nonduplication and syndicated exclusivity rules from importing the same network and syndicated programming provided by that local broad caster from distant broadcaster without the permission of the local broadcaster for example cable operator experiencing retransmission consent impasse with its local abc broadcast ffiliate cannot import the abc network programming transmitted by more distant abc affiliate thus even though the network and syndicated programming is not produced by the local broadcaster that broadcaste r has control over its distribu tion in its designated market area some small cable companie s have proposed modifying these exclusivity rules to allow distributors to import distant network and syndicated programming when retransmission consent impasse develops148 this would allow an mvpd to negotiate with multiple providers of ne twork and syndicated programming for the carriage of that programming if the mvpd reaches an impasse with its local broadcaster carriage of such distant sign als would allow subscribers to continue to receive the network and syndicated programming149 there appear to be two aspects to this proposal to prohib it broadcast networks and their affiliates from employing exclusive arrangements that do not allow cablehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34078crs61 companies to seek alternative sources of broadcast network and syndicated programming and to deny the local affiliates the ability to get windfall from popular network programming the propos als proponents claim that the local broadcaster has not produced the network and syndicated programming but the exclusivity rules allow it to act like monopoly producer and extract all the economic rents from the programming which only forces up subscriber rates although it is true that exclusivity rrangements are intended to allow the broadcast network and its affiliates to maximize their revenues from the network programming it is not clear that elimination of the fccs exclusivity rules would have any market impact virtually the same exclusivity terms and conditions are included in the contracts that local broadcasters have with their affiliated networks and with their providers of syndicated programming indeed the fcc rules specifically were constructed to mirror the language that already existed in most broadcasterprogram owner contracts so unless such contract terms were prohibited elimination of the rules would have practical impact similar types of exclusive distribution territories are common thr oughout the us economy and pass antitrust muster with respect to the concern about the ex clusivity rules allowi ng local affiliates to earn windfalls it is not clear to what extent recent market changes have created windfalls or simply changed the form of compensation as was discussed earlier in the past most local broadcast stations that were affiliated with major broadcast network made that network its agent to negotiate retransmission consent terms with mvpds and thus the networks received the bulk of the retransmission consent compensation often in the form of agreemen t by the mvpd to carry other broadcast or cable program networks produced by the major broadcast network but in exchange the major broadcast networks made major cash payments to their local broadcast affiliate sta tions in recent years however the major networks have agreed to allow their local broadcast affiliates to directly negotiate their own retransmission consent compensation with mvpds while substantially decreasing the cash payments from the broadcast networks to their local affiliates thus even if retransmission consent negotiations result in direct cash payments to the local broadcast affiliates at least some of the compensation r eceived by those local broadcasters is indirectly being passed through to the program producers in the form of lower payments to affiliates the proposal to allow the importati on of distant network and syndicated programming could have an impact beyond an impasse situation it could strengthen the negotiating position of mvpds by poten tially allowing them to bargain among alternative providers of the same musthave network programming to the extent that the local broadcast stations existin g network and syndica tion contracts did not already prohibit this but giving all mvpd s the ability to negotiate with any network affiliate would strengthen the negotiating leverage of large as well as small mvpds and might have the uninte nded consequence of foster ing retransmission consent impasses in larger marketshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34078crs62 150 id 151 in the matter

in good faith csr7058c memorandum opinion and order adopted and released january 4 2007 at 25proposal require broadcast ers to publish rate cards that would apply to all mvpds the smaller independent cable companies complain that due to their lack of negotiating power broadcasters have demande d higher per subscriber fees from them than from the large cable and satellite companies in retransmission consent compensation one has proposed nondiscrimination requirement that broadcasters publish rate cards that would apply to all distribut ors of broadcasters programming150 since the rate would apply to rge and small distributors alike and the broadcaster would have to take into account the negotia ting strength of the large distributors when setting its rate the purpos of this proposal is to give small distributors the same negotiating leverage as the larger ones this might help keep small cable systems programming costs down and thus reduce upward pressure on their retail charges to subscribers one problem with this proposal however is that most retransmission consent negotiations involve large number of meters not just the per subscriber fee broadcaster might be willing to accept lower per subscriber fee from large distributor in exchange for some other form of compensation such as the mvpd agreeing to carry the broadcasters multiple digital signals but smaller cable companies might not have the capacity on their networks to offer similar carriage similarly large distributor might partially compensate the broadcaster by purchasing advertising time on the broadcast station but small distributor might not be willing or able to do so in these situations requiring all distributors to pay the same per subscriber charge would represent discrimination against the larger distributors who also are providing the broa dcaster alternative forms of compensation for the programming proposal require parties to s ubmit to binding arbitration to resolve

mediacom and sinclair do not reach an agreement by the deadline but sinclair refused to do so and the commission did not choose to take action this has led to proposals that rather th an allowing

broadcast stations negotiating retransmission consent agreements156 broadcaster may not refuse to negotiate with an mvpd broadcaster must appoint ne gotiating representative with the authority to bargain broadcaster must agree to meet at reasonable times and locations and cannot delay the c ourse of negotiations broadcaster may not offer single unilateral proposal in responding to an offer

commisso mediacom communications ceo entitled rx for retransmission in multichannel news february 1 2 2007 at p 27a broadcaster is prohibited from entering into an agreement with any party conditioned upon denying re transmission consent to any mvpd and broadcaster must agree to execute written retransmission consent agreement that sets forth the full agreement between the broadcaster and the mvpd under the second part of the good faith test an mvpd may present facts to the fcc which even though they are not specifi c violation listed bove given the totality of the circumstances constitute fa ilure to negotiate in good faith157 in its order the fcc concluded that it is not possible to identify objective competitive marketplace factors that broadcasters must use in negotiating to provide guidance the fcc listed some conditions that are potential competitive marketplace considerations and some that are not for in stance the order notes that any effort to stifle competition through the negotiati on process would not meet the good faith negotiation requirement the order di rects the commission staff to expedite resolution of good faith complaints and not that the burden of proof is on the mvpd complainant the order also allows parties to pursue vol untary mediation and the fcc will consider favorably broadcas ters willingness to participate but non participation will not constitute violation of good faith subsequent to adoption of these rules several mvpds have filed complaints against broadcast stations the commissi on itself has not acted on any of these complaints but rather has given the media bureau delegated authority to reach determinations the bureau generally has not responded quickly to these complaints in most cases the parties have reached agreement before the bureau has taken action and the complaints were then retracted where it has made determinations the bureau has not found the broadcasters in vi olation of the good faith rules typically the bureau has found these impasses repres ented difference of opinion about the value of the broadcast signals under disput not refusal by the broadcaster to negotiate in good faith since the commission itself has chosen not to get involved in any of these complaints and therefore there has not been any commissionlevel order identifying what constitutes good faith nego tiations some mvpds have pr oposed that the fccs good faith standards be re visited and strengthened to prohibit any form of discriminatory pricing abusive prac tices and anticompetitive behavior by broadcasters158 as explained earlier retrans mission consent compensation often is made in both cash and noncash form it therefore often may be difficult if not impossible to identify what would const itute discriminatory pricing abusive practices and anticompetitive behavior often are subject to antitrust scrutiny absent specific list of actions that would repres ent bad faith negotiations it is not possible to fully evaluate

modified160 it might be reasonable for the fcc to undertake an analogous review of its retransmission consent complaint process proposal prohibit tying carri age of popular programming to carriage of less popular programming although most recent retransmission consent impasses have centered on unresolved conflicts about cas h payments for carriage the smaller cable operators have long sought limitations on another form of compensation the practice of the large broadcast networks that also own cable networks of tying retransmission consent for particular broadcast stations signal to carriage of an entire suite of cable and broadcast networks161 these tieins sometimes extend beyond carriage on the local cable system and may require multisystem operators to carry the suite of cable networks on all their cable systems andor for time periods that extend far beyond the threeyear period covered by th broadcast station retransmission consent agreement being negotiated162 the american cable association aca claims that such tieins can result in cable system operators providing programming their customers do not prefer or passing through high programming charges to customers the aca therefore has proposed prohibition on programmers requiring distributors to carry less popular progra mming in order to gain access to more popular programming which it claims woul d give cable and sa tellite operators especially small cable operators whose systems have limited capacity greater discretion in choosing cable networks that meet their subscribers tastes to the benefit of those subscribers and also w ould help independent cable networks gain access to cable systems the programmers that own broadcast st ations have responded that in some cases it was cable operators not progra mmers who initially proposed that their compensation for retransmission consent take the form of carrying the programmers cable networks as well as the broadcast signal at low charge or charge rather than paying high price for the retransmission rights to the broadcast signal at the time the cable operators had available capacity on their systems but not much cash to pay for programming now the situation is reversed many cable operators have limited available capacity for additional cable networks and some would prefer to payhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34078crs67 higher prices for the broadcast programming and free up scarce capacity on their systems prohibition on tieins would strengthen the negotiating position of distributors and independent networks relative to the large programmers that own multiple cable networks and broadcast networks but it might have other impacts or little impact under prohibition the large prog rammers that could longer tie retransmission consent for their popular broad cast networks to carriage of their other program networks would seek an alterna tive form of compensation from mvpds for retransmission consent the most likely alternative would be to increase the cash payment demanded for carriage of the popul ar broadcast network which could lead to an increase in the number of negotiation impasses in general the fewer the number of parameters involve d in retransmission consen t negotiation the fewer the areas where compromise can be reached nd the higher the likelihood of unresolved conflict while many small cable operators have sought prohibition on tieins the larger mvpds many of whom are them selves large progra mmers have supported that form of compensation in part because they like to tie their own cable networks but also in part because it provides more opportunity for give and take in the negotiations under prohibition on tying several busin ess strategies at the heart of the current cable programmer business mode l would be constrained the large programmers have followed the business strategy of creating multiple networks because of the efficiencies they can gain by crossmarketing one network on another and developing strong brand identity if distributors can choose not to carry the large programmers less popular networks th programmers efficiencies from cross marketing and branding would be diminished at the same time if their strategy of proliferating their own bra nded networks were curtaile d it might become easier for new independent networ ks to enter the market which might increase the diversity of independent voices proposal require programmers to offer their broadcast and cable networks to distributors on an à carte basis less intrusive and restrictive govern ment intervention would not prohibit programmers from offering their popular netw orks as part of tiein with less popular networks but would require the pr ogrammers also to offer each of their program networks to mvpds on an à carte basis this could include requirement for nondiscriminatory pricing of the à carte offerings but as discussed earlier carriage agreements often include other forms of compensation or services and therefore it would be difficult to determine what constituted discriminatory pricing it is not clear what impact this re quirement would have however for two reasons first tying more popular prog ram networks to ss popular ones has been at the core of the cable industry for more than decade because in most situations it is beneficial to the mvpd as well as th programmer consumer demand for large tier of program networks tends to be far less price elastic far less sensitive tohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34078crs68 increases in price than demand for indi vidual program networ ks thus in most situations the mvpd is not harmed by having to purchase bundle of program networks from broadcast or cable progra mmer there are some exceptions for example small cable operator whose system has limited channel capacity or an mvpd with relatively few subscribers demanding sports programming facing bundle of networks that includes one or veral very highpriced sports programming second it is likely that the large programme rs would price an à carte offering in fashion that took into account both the lost marketing efficiencies from tying less popular programming to popular programming and the lost reve nues if network proliferation had been successful way to forestall competitive entry thus the rates for à carte offerings are likely to be very high which might discourage most mvpds from choosing that option the ex ceptions might be small cable operators whose systems have such limited channel capacity that their only viable choice would be the à carte offerings of at least some programmers and programming for which there is an audience with high intensity of demand that the mvpd intends to offer on premium tier assuming the programmer allowed the mvpd to offer the programming on premium tier see the next proposal proponents of à carte pr icing of retail mvpd service have been among the strongest proponents of mandatory à carte pricing at the wholesale level since they believe the latter would foster the former these proponents argue that à carte pricing gives subscribers the greatest cont rol over their video purchases it allows them to pay only for the programming that they want and also allows them to keep programming that they fi nd offensive out of their home in additi on noting that subscribers price elasticity of demand sensitivity to price increases tends to be greater for individual networks than for larg tiers they argue that requiring an à carte option would place downward pressure on both wholesale and retail prices opponents of mandatory à carte pricing argue that the current system of large tiers allows both programmers and distributors to take dvantage of the significant economies in crossmarketing and fosters diverse programming by giving new networks the opportunity to build audiences how would subscribers even learn about the existence of new networks in an à carte environment unless those new networks were owned by one of the large programmers who could continue to cross market and supporting minority and indepe ndent networks that might not attract enough subscribers in an à carte nvironment to survive the data in table 11 showing that over 13 week period most viewers watch programming on far more networks than they do in week suggests that there likely are many casual and infrequent viewers of any i ndividual network that now ar part of that networks audience but would be unlikely to subscr ibe to that network in an à carte environment this might require the networ k and mvpd to set high à carte price for the diminished audience of course as long as subscribers continue to have tiered options as well as the à carte opti on they need not change their

the expanded basic service tier often when major programmer with musthave programming is negotiating with distributor it not only seeks to tie carriage rights to that programming to carriage of its less popular pr ogram networks it also seeks to require the distributor to place the less popular networks on its most widely subscribed to tier the enhanced basic service tier that will maximize the number of households receiving the programming and will help in ratings and hence advertising revenues but the secondary or tertiary networ ks of that programmer may not be the program networks most sought by subscribers and thus the mvpd sometimes will prefer not to place them on its expanded basic service tier the aca therefore has proposed prohib iting programmers from requiring cable and satellite operators to offer the programmers cable networks only on the expanded basic service tier and instead allow the mvpds to determine program placement on their network tiers in most situations distributors share the large programmers preference for single large expanded basic service tier and thus the impact of this proposed prohibition might be limited but there may be situations in which programmer and distributor intere sts diverge and more generically the prohibition could create an opportunity for di stributors to experiment with their cable tiers for example while cable programmers receive about half their revenues from advertising and half from per subscriber fees assessed on cable and satellite operators cable and satellite operators get almost 90 of their revenues from subscribers and only little more than 10 from advertisers163 an optimal tiering strategy for programmers therefore might not be optimal for distributors moreover cable and satellite operators do not have retail layer to insulate them from subscribers and therefore may be more re sponsive to consumer complaints about the placement of specific networks on tiers cable and satellite operators may be more willing than programmers to take particular cable networks off the expanded basic service tier and place them on premium tiers because they only indirectly benefit from the strategies of cross promotion of networks and ne twork proliferation that di rectly benefit programmers which depend heavily on single large expanded basic service tier cable and satellite ope rators also may choose to ex periment with cable tiers and even with à carte pricing if they perceive that these additional offerings might increase their profits when the per subscriber license fee for cable network does not appear to be in equilibrium with subscriber viewing patterns164 then thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34078crs70 164 continued viewed on june 28 2007 espn responded that cox fails to take into account

at 14 operator will have the incentive to either decrease payments to the programmer or increase revenues from end users or both by placing highcost network on separate tier the operator might be able to reduce payments to the programmer by only paying for those subscribers who actually desire that network while maintaining or at least not decreasing by as much the revenues received from subscribers if the operator were able to take highcost cab network off its ex panded basic service tier place it on separate tier and then reprice the expanded basic service tier in way that did not lower revenues from that tie r by as much as it gained revenues from the new separate tier it w ould benefit from having the discretion to place cable networks on tiers as it saw fit some observers have questioned whether giving distributors greater control over the tier placement of cable networks would yi eld lower prices for subscribers they cite the most recent fcc re port on cable industry prices which found that satellite operators do not provide sufficiently strong competitive constraints on cable operators to restrain prices165 and suggest that the shift of control over the placement of networks on tiers from programmers to distributors is less likely to reduce rates to subscribers than to redistribute the profits from programmers to distributors but even if the price effect were small distributor control over network placement on tiers would improve the ability of distributors to base placement on their subscribers preferences rather than the negotiating strength of the programmers proposal prohibit the ownership or control of more than one television station in market or prohibit duopoly owner from tying retransmission consent for one station to another in the earlier section presenting specific examples of programmerdistributor conflicts it was striking how often the br oadcaster involved in dispute owned or controlled more than one broa dcast station in small or medium sized local market it appears that where broadcaster owns or controls two stations that are affiliated with major networks that potentially gives that broadcaster control over two sets of musthave programming and places distribut or especially relatively small cable operator in very weak negotiating position since it would be extremely risky to lose carriage of both signals alternatively when broadcaster owns or controls one station that is affiliated w ith major broadcast network and second station that is affiliated with weaker broadcast network it may be able to tie carriage of the major broadcast network to demand that the cab operator also carry and perhaps pay for carriage of the signals of the weak er broadcast network which otherwise

record developed when constr ucting the 2003 rules did not take into account the impact of duopoly control of television stations on retransmission consent because at that time the market changes that were strengthening the negotiating position of broadcasters had not yet occurred or had not yet been affecting negotiations rather the focus of the analysis of the local television multiple ownership rule was on the number of independent voices and competition in the market for advertising the co mmission concluded that the old rule which is now again in place could not be ju stified on diversity or competition grounds while those remain important bases for analysis it appears from recent retransmission consent negotiations that in its current proceeding the fcc might also want to look at the effect of duopol ownership on retransmission consent negotiations since any impact on broadcasterd istributor negotiations may also affect the availability and price of programming to mvpd subscribers for example in comments filed in the current proceed ing suddenlink argued that common ownership of two or more of the top four stations in local market places cable operators at disadvantage in retransmission consent carriage negotiations and therefore should be prohibited173 this may become more complex issue as broadcast stations begin to use their digital multicast capability to offer multiple signals that may include the signals of more than one network as explained earlier tying these secondary or tertiary digital signals to retransmission consent negotia tions involving the broadcasters primary signal might prove the most effective way for smaller broadcast networks to obtain carriage on cable systems it is unlikely that the local affiliates of these new networks will become one of the four top sta tions in local markets in the near future but multicasting broadcaster may try to tie mvpds rights to carry its major network signal to carriage of its multicast signals

their customers that would receive all the local broadcasters digital signals for free wit hout the cable companies having to pay for the right to retransmit the signals since this could be threat to the retransmission consentmustcarry regime set up by congress and since broadcasters ar seeking modification of the mustcarry option to require mvpds to carry local broadcasters multiple digital signals not just the primary signal as currently required by law it is likely that this technological development will play role in any attempt to modify the current statute proposal close the

the fcc to establish rules to prevent vertically integrated cable operator from discriminating in the prices terms and conditions at which it makes its programmin g available to non affiliated mvpds or have exclusive acce ss to the programming in which it has an attributable interest applies only if the vertically integrated companys programming is transmitted to distributors via satellite it does not apply to programming that is transmitted to distributors over terrestrial facilities for example over broadband lines an exception that frequently applies to regional sports networks and potentially could apply to all cable pr ogram networks as broadband fiber optic cable becomes more widely deployed so parties have proposed closing this terrestrial loophole there does not appear to

arbitration would not necessarily result in an arbitration decision requiring comcast and time warner to carry tac but it would create the possibility of such an outcome which might in turn encourage
