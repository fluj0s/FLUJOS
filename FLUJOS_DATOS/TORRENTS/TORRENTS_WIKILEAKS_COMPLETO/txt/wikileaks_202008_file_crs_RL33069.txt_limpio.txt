under the official definition was reported at 125 the incidence of poverty varies widely across the population according to age education labor force attachment family living arrangements and area of residence among other factors under the official poverty definition an average family of four was considered poor in 2007 if its pretax cash income for the year was below 21203 this report will be

distribution of income within the economy and changes in the composition of the us population the poverty rate or percent of the population considered poor was 125 in 2007 statistically unchanged from that estimated in 2006 of 123 in 2007 an estimated 373 million people were counted as poor statistically significant increase from the 365 million estimated as poor in 2006 the 2007 poverty rate of 125 was still well below the most recent peak of 151 in 1993 strong economy during most of the 1990s is generally credited with the declines in poverty that occurred over the later half of the decade resulting in recordtying historic low poverty rate of 113 in 2000 rate statistically tied with the previous lowest recorded rate of 111 in 1973 the poverty rate increased each year from 2001 through 2004 trend generally attributed to the economic recession that occurred from march to november of 2001 but has yet to head back towards its pre recession low as shown in figure 1 with the exception of the recession in the early 1960s poverty rates have tended to increase in periods corresponding to economic recession changes in household and family composition especially the growth in the number of singleparent families who tend to have high incidence of poverty have contributed to higher overall poverty rates and especially higher rates of child poverty over the years government income transfer programs have helped to reduce the incidence of poverty and the depth of poverty among the us population social security in combination with maturing pension system has helped greatly to reduce the incidence of poverty among the aged over the years in contrast to social security cash welfare programs which are targeted on the poor tend to lift few families incomes above the poverty line but in combination with other noncash aid such programs help to reduce the depth of income and material deprivation poor families incur crs2 figure 1 trend in poverty rate and number of poor persons 19592007

opportunity reconciliation act prwora pl 104193 continue to be assessed in terms of their possible impacts on economically vulnerable populations1 the welfare reform law ended the aid to families with dependent children afdc program replacing it with the temporary assistance for needy families tanf program2 among other features tanf sets fiveyear lifetime limit on receipt of cash assistance allowing lower limits at state option imposes strong work requirements and allows states to impose sanctions reducing or denying benefits to families who fail to comply with program requirements definition of poverty the census bureaus poverty thresholds form the basis for statistical estimates of poverty in the united states3 the thresholds reflect crude estimates of the amount of money individuals or families of various size and composition need per year to purchase basket of goods and services deemed as minimally adequate according to the living standards of the early 1960s the thresholds are updated each year for changes in consumer prices in 2007 for example the average poverty threshold for an individual living alone was 10590 for twoperson family 13540 for family of four 21203 persons are considered poor for statistical purposes if their familys countable money income is below its corresponding poverty threshold annual poverty estimates are based on census bureau household survey current population survey conducted each march the official definition of poverty counts most sources of money income received by families during the prior year eg earnings social security pensions cash public assistance interest and dividends alimony and child support among others for purposes of officially counting the poor noncash benefits such as the value of medicare and medicaid public housing or employer provided health care and near cashbenefits eg food stamps are not counted as income nor are tax payments subtracted from income nor are tax credits added eg earned income tax credit eitc there is mounting interest in including the value of noncash benefits and tax credits when assessing progress against poverty these benefits represent growing share of assistance to the poor in fy2007 the federal government provided an estimated 304 billion in food stamp benefits most of which went to poor 1 see crs report rl30797 trends in welfare work and the economic wellbeing of femaleheaded families with children 19872005 by thomas gabe 2 see crs report rs20807 short history of the 1996 welfare reform law by joe richardson and vee burke 3 the department of health and human services hhs releases poverty income guidelines that are similar to the census poverty thresholds these guidelines are used by hhs and other federal agencies for administering programs particularly determining program eligibility crs4 households the eitc program is the fastest growing form of cash aid for children in fy2007 the treasury paid an estimated 365 billion in eitc to families with relatively low earnings who owed income tax neither food stamp benefits nor the eitc are counted as income under the official poverty definition the census bureau provides variety of alternate measures of poverty based on various combinations of cash noncash and after tax income these alternative measures are still considered experimental none have displaced the official measure the poverty rate is the estimated percentage of the national population living alone or in families whose money income is below the poverty threshold under an alternate experimental definition of poverty the poverty rate would be lower than under the official definition of poverty based on pretax cashincome using more comprehensive definition of income measured against the poverty line one which includes the value of noncash benefits and the effect of taxes the estimated poverty rate would have been 103 in 20054 as opposed to 126 under the official measure in 2005 major changes to the way in which poverty is defined and measured in the us have been recommended by congressionally commissioned study conducted by national academy of sciences nas panel of experts5 the nas panel recommended that the poverty level be reset to take into account improvements in the us standard of living that have occurred over the past 40plus years ie since the current poverty measure was originally devised the academy recommended that noncash benefits taxes and tax credits be counted with cash income and that certain expenses eg work related child care expenses housing and out of pocket medical expenses be deducted from income in determining families poverty status the effect of these and other changes would result in comparatively more working families being counted as poor the nas panel also recommended that the poverty income levels be adjusted for area cost of living differences the current poverty income thresholds are uniform across the 50 states and the district of columbia most experts agree that the current measure underestimates the extent of poverty in high cost of living areas if adopted cost of living adjustment to the poverty thresholds would result in comparatively higher levels of measured poverty in the northeast and west compared to the south and midwest 4 alternative poverty estimates for 2007 will not be available until late fall 2008

october 2001 crs5 poverty among selected groups even during periods of general prosperity poverty is concentrated among certain groups and in certain areas minorities women and children the very old the unemployed those with low levels of educational attainment low skills or disability among others are especially prone to poverty racial and ethnic minorities6 african americans and hispanics have poverty rates that exceed the white poverty rate by several times in 2007 245 of blacks 92 million and 215 of hispanics 99 million had incomes below poverty compared to 82 of non hispanic whites 160 million and 102 of asians 13 million although blacks represent only 126 of the total population they make up 248 of the poor population hispanics who represent 154 of the population account for 265 of the poor children7 in 2007 128 million children 176 were poor statistically significant increase in the number poor up from 123 million and in the poverty rate up from 169 from 2006 the lowest recorded rate of child poverty was in 1969 when 138 of children were counted as poor children living in single femaleheaded families are especially prone to poverty in 2007 child living in single female headed family was five times more likely to be poor than child living in married couple family in 2007 430 of all children living in single femaleheaded families were poor in contrast 85 of children living in marriedcouple families were poor the increased share of children who live in single femaleheaded families has contributed to the high overall child poverty rate in 2007 241 of children were living in femaleheaded families about double the share who lived in such families when the overall child poverty rate was at its historic low 1969 among all poor children nearly six in ten 589 lived in femaleheaded families in 2007 in 2007 343 of black children were poor 38 million compared to 283 of hispanic children 43 million and 97 of white nonhispanic children 40 million among children living in single femaleheaded families the poverty rate for black children was 504 and for hispanic children 516 nonhispanic white children in such families had poverty rate of 324 the poverty rate among 6 beginning with the march 2003 cps the census bureau allows survey respondents to identify themselves as belonging to one or more racial groups in prior years respondents could select only one racial category consequently poverty statistics for different racial groups for 2002 and after are not directly comparable to earlier years data the term blacks and whites above refers to persons who identified with only single racial group the term hispanic refers to individuals ethnic as opposed to racial identification hispanics may be of any race 7 related children in families for an indepth discussion of child poverty see crs report rl32682 children in poverty profile trends and issues by vee burke thomas gabe and gene falk crs6 hispanic children who live in marriedcouple families 192 was over oneand threequarters higher than that of black children 110 and more than four times that of white nonhispanic children 47 who live in such families contributing to the high rate of overall black child poverty is the large share of black children who live in single femaleheaded families 553 compared to hispanic children 264 or white nonhispanic children 157 adults with low education unemployment or disability adults with low education those who are unemployed or who have work related disability are especially prone to poverty in 2007 among persons age 25 to 34 330 who had high school diploma were poor compared to 158 who had high school diploma only and 43 who had at least bachelors degree about 12 of 25 to 34 yearolds lack high school diploma among persons between the ages of 16 and 64 who were unemployed in march 2008 231 were poor based on their families incomes in 2007 among those who were employed 56 were poor in 2007 persons who reported work disability represented 103 of the age 16 to 64 population and 264 of the poor population within this age range among those with severe work disability 334 were poor compared to 135 of those with less severe disability and 91 who reported having workrelated disability the aged the poverty rate of persons age 65 and older in 2007 was 97 36 million poor the poverty rate among the aged in 2007 was statistically tied with its historic low rate of 94 in 2006 among those age 75 and over 106 were poor in 2007 compared to 88 of those age 65 to 74 although the aged poverty rate tends to be lower than the child poverty rate many of the aged live just slightly above the poverty line as measured by slightly raised poverty standard 125 of the poverty threshold 161 of the aged could be considered poor or near poor 140 who are age 65 to 74 and 184 who are 75 years of age and over in comparison 238 of children persons under age 18 could be considered poor or near poor crs7 figure 2 us poverty rates

households that received any meanstested assistance during the year such assistance could include cash aid such as temporary assistance for needy families tanf supplemental security income ssi payments food stamps medicaid subsidized housing free or reduced price school lunches and other programs in 2006 only 195 of poor persons lived in households that received cash aid 376 received food stamps 546 where one or more household members were covered by medicaid and 165 lived in subsidized housing poor singleparent families with children are among those families most likely to receive cash aid among poor children who were living in single femaleheaded families 275 were in households that received government cash aid in 2006 the share of poor children in single femaleheaded families receiving cash aid is well below historical levels in 1993 702 of these childrens families received cash aid in 1995 the year prior to passage of sweeping welfare changes under prwora 65 of such children were in families receiving cash aid the geography of poverty poverty is more highly concentrated in some areas than in others about twice as high in center cities as in suburban areas and nearly three times higher in the poorest states than in the least poor states within metropolitan areas the incidence of poverty in central city areas is considerably higher than in suburban areas 165 versus 90 respectively in 2007 nonmetropolitan areas had poverty rate of 154 in 2003 the most recent years data available for this comparison over onethird 348 of the nations poor lived in neighborhoods of concentrated poverty areas based on census tracts and minor civil divisions with poverty rate of 20 or higher based on the 1990 census poor racial and ethnic minorities are more likely to live in areas of concentrated poverty than nonhispanic whites among poor african americans 529 lived in areas of concentrated poverty among poor hispanics 475 in contrast 188 of poor nonhispanic whites lived in areas of concentrated poverty in 2007 poverty rates were lowest in the midwest 111 northeast 114 and west 120 and highest in the south 142 8 census bureau estimates for 2007 were not available at the time this report was produced see httppubdb3censusgovmacro032007povnew26_002_01htm crs9 up to this point the poverty statistics presented in this report come from the us census bureaus annual social and economic supplement asec to the current population survey cps for purposes of producing state and substate poverty estimates the census bureau now recommends using the american community survey acs because of its much larger sample size the acs produces estimates with much smaller margin of statistical error than does the aseccps however it should be noted that the acs survey design differs from the aseccps in variety of waysand produces somewhat different estimates than those obtained from the aseccps for example the aseccps estimates that 125 of the nations population was poor in 2007 whereas the acs estimates that 130 of the population was poor in the prior 12 months from when the survey was administered the acs estimates are based on income information collected between january and december 2007 for the prior 12 months for example for the sample with data collected in january the reference period is from january 2006 to december 2006 and for the sample with data collected in december from december 2006 to november 2007 the acs data consequently cover time span of 23 months with the data centered at middecember 2006 figure 3 shows estimated poverty rates for the united states and for each of the 50 states and the district of columbia on the basis of the 2007acs in addition to the point estimates the figure displays 90 statistical confidence interval around each states estimate indicating the degree to which these estimates might be expected to vary based on sample size although the states are sorted from lowest to highest by their respective poverty rate point estimates the precise ranking of each state is not possible because of the depicted margin of error around each states estimate for example new hampshire would appear to have the lowest poverty rate 71 but it overlaps with connecticut 79 and hawaii 80 mississippi stands out as having the highest poverty rate 206 and is followed by three states that appear to be statistically tied louisiana 186 new mexico 181 and arkansas 179 crs10 figure 3 poverty rates for the 50 states and the district of columbia 2007 american community survey acs data poverty rate and
