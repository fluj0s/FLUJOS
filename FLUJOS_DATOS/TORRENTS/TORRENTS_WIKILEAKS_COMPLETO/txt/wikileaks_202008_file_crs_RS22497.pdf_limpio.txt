library of congresscrs report for congress received through the crs weborder code rs22497 august 18 2006 extraterritorial application of american criminal law an abbreviated sketch charles doyle senior specialist american law division summary crime is ordinarily proscr ibed tried and punished according to the laws of the place where it occurs american criminal law however applies beyond the geographical confines of the united states under certain limited ci rcumstances the federal exceptions to the genera l rule usually involve crimes aboard ship or airplane crimes condemned by treaty crimes committed against federal officers or employees abroad or crimes planned or initiated overseas with an impact in this country state prosecution for overseas miscondu ct is limited almost exclusiv ely to multijurisdictional crimes ie crimes where some elements of the offense are committed within the state and others are committed beyond its boundaries although substantial number of fede ral criminal statutes have undisputed extraterritorial application and great many more have apparent extraterritorial application prosecutions are relatively few in such cases federal investigators and prosecutors face legal practical and often diplomatic obstacles that can be daunting the mutual legal assistance treaties which the united states has with some fifty other countries reduce or eliminate some of these impediments this is an abridged version of report which with citations footnotes appendices and bibliography app ears as crs report 94166 extraterritorial application of american criminal law by charles doyle united states crimes abroad the constitution does not forbid the enactment of laws that apply outside the united states several passages suggest that the constitution contemplates the application of american law beyond the geographical confines of the united states for instance it speaks broadly of felonies on the high seas offences against the law of nations commerce with foreign nations and of the impact of treaties nevertheless the powers granted by the constitution are not without limit the clauses enumerating congresss powers carry specific or implicit limits which govern the extent to which the power may be exercised overseas other limitations ppear elsewhere in the constitution mosthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22497crs2 notably in the due process clauses yet lthough american courts that try aliens for overseas violations of american law must operate within the confines of due process the supreme court has observed that the constitutions due process commands do not protect aliens who lack any significant voluntary c onnection with the united states moreover the courts more recent decisions often begin with the assumption that the issues of extraterritorial jurisdiction come without constitutional implications statutory construction thus the question of the extent to which particular statute applies outside the united states has generally been considered matter of statutory rather than constitu tional construction general rules of st atutory construction have emerged which can explain if not presage the result in given case the first of these holds that statute will be construed to have only territorial application unless there is clear indication of some broader intent second rule of construction states that the nature and purpose of statute may provide an indication of whether congress intended statute to apply beyond the confines of the united states the third principle encompasses misconduct overseas which has an impact within the united states the final rule declares that unless contrary intent is clear congress is assumed to have acted so as not to invite action inconsistent with international law international law suppor ts rather than dictates deci sions in the area of the overseas application of american law neither c ongress nor the courts are bound to the dictates of international law when enacting or interpreting statutes with extraterritorial application yet congress looks to international law wh it evaluates the policy considerations associated with legislation th at may have interna tional consequences for this reason the courts interpret legislation with the presumption that congress or the state legislature unless it indicates otherwise intends its laws to be applied within the bounds of international law to what extent does international law permit nation to exercise extraterritorial jurisdiction the question is essentially one of national interests what national interest is served by extraterritorial application and what in terests of other nations suffer by an extraterritorial application the most common classification of these interests dates to 1935 rvard law school study which divided them into five categories involving 1 the regulation of activ ities occurring within the territory of country 2 the regulation of the conduct of it s nationals 3 the protection of its nationals 4 the regulation of activities outside country which have an impact within it and 5 the regulation of ac tivities which are universally condemned legislation may reflect more than one interest or principl and there is little consensus of the precise boundaries of the principles the american law institutes third restatement of the foreign relations law of the united states contains perhaps the most comprehensive contemporary statement of international law in the area it indicates that the latitude international law affords country to act try and punish violations of its law extraterritorially is matter of reasonabl eness and its assessment of reasonableness mirrors balancing of the interests represented in the principles while the restatements views carry considerable weight with both congress and the courts the courts have traditionally ascertained the extent to which international law would allow extraterritorial application of particular law by examining american case law source which historically has provided more permissi ve view of extraterritorial jurisdiction than either the restatement or the harvard studyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22497crs3 current american extraterritorial criminal jurisdiction congress has expressly provided for the extraterritorial application of federal criminal law most often by proscribing conduct that occurs within th special maritime and rritorial jurisdiction of the united states it supplies an explicit basis for the extraterritorial application of various federal criminal laws relating to 1 air travel special aircraft jurisdiction of the united states 2 customs matters customs waters of the us 3 us spacecraft in flight 4 overseas federal facilities and overseas residences of federal employees 5 members of us armed forces overseas nd those accompanying them and 6 overseas human trafficking and sex offenses by fe deral employees us military personnel or those accompanying them the obligations and principles of various international treaties conventions or agreements to which the united states is party supply second common ground for explicit extraterritorial application of federal criminal statutes members of the final class of explicit extraterritorial federal criminal statutes either cryptically declare that their provisions are to apply overseas or describe series of ju risdictional circumstances under which their provisions have ex traterritorial application not infrequently involving the foreign commerce of the united states in conjunction with other factors the federal courts have f ound extraterritorial application implicit in instances the purpose for enactment might otherwise be frustra ted thus they have held that american extraterritorial criminal jurisdiction includes wide range of statutes designed to protect federal officers employees and property to prevent smuggling and to deter the obstruction or corruption of the overseas activities of federal departments and agencies logical extension would be to conclude that statutes enacted to prevent and punish the theft of federal prope rty apply worldwide and there seems to be obvious reason why statutes protecting the united states from intentional deprivati on of its property by destruction should be treated differently than those where the loss is attributable to theft investigation and prosecution using the terminology of international law in which countries are referred to as states the restatement observes it is unive rsally recognized as corollary of state sovereignty that officials of one state may not exercise their functions in the territory of another state without the latters consent thus while state may take certain measures of nonjudicial enforcement agai nst person in another state its law enforcement officers cannot arrest him in nother state and can engage in criminal investigation in that state only with that states consent failure to comply can result in strong diplomatic protests liability for reparations and other remedial repercussions to say nothing of the possible criminal prosecution of offending foreign investigators consequently investigations within another country of extraterritorial federal crimes without the consent or at least acquiescence of the host country are extremely rare mutual legal assistance treaties and agreements congress has endorsed diplomatic efforts to increas multinational cooperative law enforcement activities the united states has over fifty mutual legal assistance treaties in force they ordinarily provide similar clauses with some variations for locating and identifying persons and items service of process executing search warrants taking witness depositions persuading foreign nationals to come to the united states voluntarily to present evidence here and forfeiture related seizureshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22497crs4 search and seizure abroad the fourth amendment governs the overseas search and seizure of the person or property of americans by american law enforcement officials the supreme courts verdugourquidez decision holds that the fourth amendment does not apply to the search and seizure by united states agents of property that is owned by nonresident alie n and located in foreign country 494 us at 261 otherwise neither the fourth amendmen t nor its exclusionary rule are considered applicable to overseas searches and seiz ures conducted by foreign law enforcement officials except under two ci rcumstances the first excep tion covered foreign conduct which shocked the conscience of the court the second reached foreign searches or seizures in which american law enforcemen t officials were so deeply involved as to constitute joint ventures or some equivalent level of participation selfincrimination overseas like the fourth amendment protection against unreasonable searches and seizures the fifth amendment selfincrimination clause and its attendant miranda warning requirements do not apply to statements made overseas to foreign officials subject to the same joint venture and shocked conscience exceptions of course as general rule to be admissible at trial in this country any confession must have been freely made statute of limitations 18 usc 3292 and related matters federal capital offenses and certain federal terrorist offenses may be prosecuted at any time with some exceptions prosecution of other federa l crimes must begin within five years prosecution of nonviolent federal terrorism ffenses must begin within eight years moreover the statute of limitations is suspended or tolled during any period in which the accused is fugitive finally section 3292 authorizes the federal courts to stay the running of statute of limitations in order to await the arrival of evidence requested of foreign government section 3292 suspensions may run for more than six months if the requested foreign assistance is provided before the time the statute of limitations would otherwise have expired and for more than three years in other instances the suspension period begins with the filing of the request for foreign assistance and ends with final action by the foreign government upon the request because of the built in time limits the government need not show that it acted diligently in its attempts to gather overseas evidence extradition extradition is perhaps the oldest form of international law enforcement assistance it is creature of treaty by which one country surrenders fugitive to another for prosecution or service of sentence the united states has bilateral extradition treaties with roughly twothirds of the nations of the world treaties negotiated before 1960 and still in effect reflect the view then held by the united states and other common law countries that cr iminal jurisdiction was territorial and consequently extradition could not be had for extraterrito rial crimes subsequently negotiated agreements either require extrad ition regardless of where the offense occurs permit extradition regardless of where the offense occurs or require extradition where the extraterritorial laws of the two nations ar compatible more r ecent extradition treaties address other traditional features of our earlier agreements that complicate extradition most notable the nationality exception the political offense excep tion and the practice of limiting extradition to list of specifically designated offenses as an alternative to extrad ition particularly if the suspect is not citizen of the country of refuge foreign authorities ma be willing to expe l or deport him underhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22497crs5 circumstances that allow the united states to taken him into custody in the absence of specific treaty provision the fact that the defendant wa s abducted overseas and brought to the united states for trial rather than pursuant to request under the applicable extradition treaty does not deprive the fede ral court of jurisdiction to try him venue federal crimes committed within the united states must be tried where they occur venue over extraterritorial crimes is matter of statute 18 usc 3238 section 3238 permits the trial of extrate rritorial crimes either 1 in the district into which the offender is first brought or in which he is arrested for the offense or 2 prior to that time by indictment or information in the di strict of the offenders last known residence and if none is known in the district of colu mbia the phrase first brought as used in section 3238 means first brought while in cu stody as the language of the section suggests venue for all joint offenders is pr oper wherever venue for one of their number is proper testimony of overseas witnesses federal courts ma subpoena united states resident or national found abroad to ppear to before it or the grand jury they have authority to subpoena fo reign nations located in foreign country mutual legal assistance treaties and agreements generally c ontain provisions to facilitate transfer of custody for foreign witnesses who are imprisone d overseas and in other instances to elicit assistance to encourage foreign nationals to come to this country and testify voluntarily unable to secure the presence of overseas witnesses federal courts may authorize depositions to be taken abroad under excepti onal circumstances and in the interests of justice under even more limited circumstances they may admit such depositions into evidence in criminal trial when deposition is taken abroad the courts prefer that the defendant be present that his counsel be allowed to crossexamin the witness that the deposition be taken under oath that verbatim tran script be taken and that the deposition be captured on videotape but they have permitted depositions to be admitted into evidence at subsequent criminal trials in this country notwithstanding the fact that one or more of these optimal conditions are not present in the case of some of those nations whose laws might not otherwise require or even pe rmit depositions under cond itions considered preferable under our law treat provision addresses the issue yet the question of admissibility of overseas depositions rests ultimately upon whether the confrontation clause demands can be satisfied the cases thus far have relied upon the supreme courts decisions either in roberts v ohio or in maryland v craig faced with the question of whether trial witnesses might testify remotely via twoway video conference craig held that the confrontation clauses requirement of physical face toface confrontation between witness and defendant at tr ial can be excused under limited circumstances in light of considerations of public policy and necessities of the case roberts dealt with the question of whether the admission of hearsay evidence violated the confrontation clause and declared that as long as the hearsay evidence came within firmly rooted hearsay exception its admission into evidence in criminal trial constituted breach of the clause more recent decisions might be thought to call into question an continued reliance on roberts and craig at minimum the supreme courts crawford v washingtonhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22497crs6 repudiates the suggestion that roberts permits anything less than actual confrontation in the case of testimonial hearsay and at leas t one appellate panel has concl uded that the prosecutions need for critical evidence does not alone supply the kind of public policy considerations necessary to qualify for craig exception on the other hand since the pre crawford cases required good faith effort to assure the defendants attendance at overseas depositions it might be argued that crawford requires adjustment in the areas jurisprudence moreover the circuits craig analysis implied that it thought the use of overseas depos itions at trial more compatible with the confrontation clause than the use of video trial testimony admissibility of foreign documents there is statutory procedure designed to ease the evidentiary admission of foreign business records in federal courts 18 usc 3505 the section covers foreign records of regularly conducted activity in virtually any form ie any memorandum report r ecord or data compilation in any form of acts events conditions opinions or diagnos maintained in foreign country 18 usc 3505c1 it exempts qualified business records from the operation of the hearsay rule in federal criminal proceedings and permits their authentication upon foreign certification finally it establishes pr ocedure under which the reliability of the documents can be challenged in conj unction with other pretrial motions early appellate decisions upheld section 3505 in the face of confrontation clause challenges as in the case of depositions drawing support from roberts v ohio crawford cast doubt upon the continued vitality of the roberts rule hearsay poses confrontation problems as long as it falls within firmly rooted hearsay exception when it held that only actual confrontation will suffice in the cas of testimonial hearsay although it left for another day more complete finition of testimonial hearsay crawford did note in passing that most of the hearsay exceptions covered statements that by their nature were not testimonial for exam ple business records at l east one later appellate panel has rejected confrontation clause cha llenge to section 3505 on the basis of this distinction
