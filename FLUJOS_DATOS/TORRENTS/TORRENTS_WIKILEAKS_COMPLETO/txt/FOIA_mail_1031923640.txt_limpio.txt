from tom wigley wigleyucaredu to mike hulme mhulmeueaacuk subject re hadley centre request for magicc date fri 13 sep 2002 092720 0600 cc gareth jones garethsjonesmetofficecom sraperueaucaredu wigleyncarucaredu ben santer santer1llnlgov gareth it seems to from reading your email that you do not realize that this is precisely what magiccscengen already does ie it uses the scaling method that ben santer and i invented in the late 1980s to get time dependent patterns of future climate change i am attaching description of the method as we employ it the current cdrom version uses only sar version of the udebm of course there is tar version that sarah used for the tar developed by and sarah but mainly sarah this has not yet been put into magiccscengen although i am in the process of doing so along with making number of other changes to the software we do not normally give the code for tarmagicc to others unless it is as part of collaborative project as mike hulme noted what we can do forwith you will have to be joint decision with and sarah the issue of how well scaling works compared with full aogcm is both important and of considerable interest to and ben santer it is something we have looked at in the past cursorily and which we were planning to investigate more fully with the suite of pcm runs that we have here there are some tricky issues that need to be addressed so perhaps we should pool our intellectual modelling and data resources anyhow check out the attached and get back to with your views the new and improved version of magiccscengen should be available in betatest form in about month it will have around 30 models in its data base and it does lot of new things that i can tell you about later tom mike hulme wrote gareth thank you for endowing with the grand title of coordinator of magic such position does not really exist here the model developers are sarah raper and tom wigley to whom i am copying this reply and it is the two of them that really need to grant your request my role is more specifically in relation to the availability and distribution of the public domain version of magiccscengen version 24 on cdrom and the accompanying manual however your request is really for the tar version of magicc and even the source code and that request i cannot grant i would hope that eitheror sarah and tom will reply to you directly best wishes mike at 1154 130902 0100 you wrote dear dr hulme i believe that you are the magicc coordinator in the climatic research unit i hope you can assist with the following request i would like to obtain version of the magicc model that would allow the input of climate forcings rather than emission scenerios i am in the detection and attribution group within the hadley centre met office i am working with dr peter stott and dr john mitchell on project that requires an ebm what we want to use the ebm for is to simulate global mean temperatures for different forcings which we can then multiply with equilibrium temperature spatial patterns for the same forcings to create surrogate transient time varying climate patterns if the surrogate patterns compare favourably with our hadcm3 simulations we will then want to investigate how the detection and attribution of climate change for the detection schemes we use will be affected by uncertainties in the forcings we use we would like to use magicc as it has been tuned already to the hadcm3 anthropogenic emissions scenerios and as model used extensively in the recent ipcc tar would be most appropriate for our work would it be possible to obtain copy of magicc or can you tell how i could go about obtaining the model thanks in advance gareth dr gareth s jones climate research scientist met office hadley centre for climate prediction and research london road bracknell rg12 2sy uk httpwwwmetofficecom telfax 4401344 85 69034898 emailgarethsjonesmetofficecomcontenttype xmsword namemagsgdoc contentdisposition inline filenamemagsgdoc attachment converted ceudoraattachmagsg1doc contenttype xmsword namesgflowchartdoc contentdisposition inline filenamesgflowchartdoc attachment converted ceudoraattachsgflowchart1doc
