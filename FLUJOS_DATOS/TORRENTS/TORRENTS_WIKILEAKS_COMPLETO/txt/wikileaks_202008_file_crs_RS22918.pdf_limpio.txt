order code rs22918 july 15 2008 primer on energy derivatives and their regulation mark jickling specialist in financial economics government and finance division summary prices for oil and other energy commodities are set in futures and derivatives markets where producers commercial users and financial speculators buy and sell contracts whose value is linked to the pr ice of the underlying commodity trading occurs on regulated futures exchanges nd in largely unregulated overthecounter otc market both forms of trading are globa l in scope this report presents basic information about these markets the inst ruments traded the regulatory framework speculation and current legislative proposals the report will be updated as warranted derivative financial contract s gain or lose value as the price of some underlying commodity financial indicator or other variable changes in essence traders promise to buy or sell commodity in the future at todays price the terms of derivative contracts which include futures contracts options and swaps may be s imple or complex but all involve two parties one of whom stands to gain if pr ices rise the other if they fall thus futures markets are zerosum any change in the price of the underlying commodity generates profits for some traders and an equal amount of losses for the rest benefits of derivatives trad ing hedging and price discovery it is not inaccurate to describe derivatives as bets on the direction of future price trends questions then arise what separates the market from gambling what public interest is served by the activity there are two recognized benefits to derivatives trading hedging and price discovery hedgers are traders who use the market to avoid price risk arising from their commercial dealings in the underlying commod ity an oil producer for example can use the markets to lock in todays price for futu re sales of physical il obtaining protection against the risk of falling prices the produ cer will purchase contracts that gain value if the price of oil falls if the price does in fact drop by the time the futures position expires the producer will lose money on physical sales but the loss will be offset by futureshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22918crs2 contract profits conversely if prices rise the producer will lose money on the futures contracts but gain on physical sales whic hever way prices move the net result is the same the risk of unfavorable price movements over the term of the futures contracts has been eliminated or hedged the ability to manage price risk with futures enables firms to budget and invest more efficiently and pr ovides buffer against adverse price shocks who takes on the price risk that the hedger gets rid of it will probably be speculator who will never actually handle the physical commodity but is simply seeking to profit by forecasting future prices most trading in derivatives is speculative the futures exchanges are associations of profe ssional speculators the advantage of large volumes of speculative trading is that hedgers can quickly find someone to take the opposite side of their trade for instance firm that is at risk if energy prices rise such as an airline or power utility can instantly find speculator who is willing to bet that prices will fall enabling the hedging firm to lock in the current price price discovery is the second benefit centralized marketplaces like the futures exchanges are forums where all available information about supply and demand for the underlying commodity is brought together nd incorporated into the price traders decisions to buy or sell are guided by da ta on current inventor ies and consumption expectations about longterm supply and demand trends macroeconomic conditions geopolitical risk factors that could disrupt s upply and innumerable other considerations central tenet of free market economics is that competitive market where participant is able to manipulate or dictate prices is the best available mechanism for determining prices that will ensure that supply meets demand and that resources are efficiently allocated the price generated by the futures exchanges is publicly available traders in the market firms in the energy i ndustries and consumers may all use it to guide their energyrelated transactions rapid energy price increases in 2007 and 2008 have led many to conclude that the market is not performing its price discovery function well there are several possible explanations for why this might happen firs t there could be manipulation are there traders in the market oil companies or hedge funds perhaps with so much market power that they can dictate prices the federal regulator the commodity futures trading commission cftc monitors markets and has not found evidence that anyone is manipulating prices the cftc has announced that investigations are in progress but generally manipulations in commodities markets cause shortlived price spikes not the kind of multiyear bull market that has been observed in oil prices since 2002 absent manipulation another possible explanation is that the futures markets could set prices too high if speculative bubble were under way simila r to what happened during the dotcom stock episode if traders in the grip of irrational exuberance believe that the current price is too low and ta ke positions accordingly the price will rise eventually however bubbles burst and prices return to fundamental values often with sharp correction variation on the bubble ex planation is that institutional investors such as pensions funds have increasingly d ecided to allocate part of their portfolios to commodities and that the resulting inflow of cash may have overwhelmed the commodities markets driving prices above fundamental levels there is little data however on the amounts invested by institutions or the effect of their trades on prices the cftc is in the process of obtaining such information using its special call authority and will report its findings in september 2008httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22918crs3 1 volume surges again futures industry magazine marchapril 2008 p 23 2 an oil futures contract is available expiring each month up to about two years into the future most trading involves contracts due to expire in the next 13 monthsderivatives trading ve nues futures exchanges and otc markets the futures exchanges the premier energy futures exchange is nymex the new york mercantile exchange which handles nearly twothirds of global contract volume china japan india and the uk also have major energy futures exchanges in 2007 353 million futures and options contracts ch anged hands on nymex 150 million of which were based on west texas intermediate crude oil1 each wti oil futures contract represents 1000 barrels and s fixed expiration date2 because of the homogenous nature of the contracts they can be traded very rapidly and many speculative traders open and close positions in time fra of minutes or seconds while each contract represents 1000 barrels purchase of futures contract does not mean that the buyer actually expects to take possession of the physical oil most contracts are offset and settled for cash as explained in the appendix section below this means that there is direct relationshi p between the number of futures contracts outstanding and the volume of physical oil ava ilable for purchase in the spot market oil is actually set aside or held off the market to cover the possibility that futures traders may decide to settle their contracts by taking physical delivery participants in exchange trading include exchange members who trade for their own accounts and execute customer or ders financial institutions businesses that deal in the underlying commodities commodity pools the fu tures equivalent of mutual funds and individual investors because of the risks associated with volatile commodity prices however individuals play much smaller role than they do in the stock market nymex like many other futures exchanges is structured as forprofit stockholder owned corporation under the commodity ex change act as descri bed below it is selfregulatory organization it must adhere to set of regu latory principles designed to keep markets free from manipulation and excessive speculation to protect public customers from fraud and to provide tradin g and price data to the public and to regulators the otc market in addition to the exchange market many contracts linked to the price of energy commodities are traded overt hecounter unlike futures contracts otc derivatives are not necessarily homogenous any contract term ma be negotiated between the parties economically however exchan getraded futures and otc swaps or options are close substitutes many traders whether hedgers or speculators are active in both markets otc trading takes two principal forms first there is bilateral dealer market where contracts may be customized to fit the traders particular requirements financial institutions like morgan stanley and goldman sachs are leading dealers and stand readyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22918crs4 to enter into contracts with those who expect prices to rise and those who expect them to fall because the market in otc swaps and options is unregulated very little information about price or volume is availabl to the public or to the cftc another form of otc trading involves ectronic trading facilities where multiple traders may place bids and offers and trade with each other in these markets contracts are standardized and may be bought and sold rapidly as are exchangetraded futures contracts the leading electronic otc mark et is operated by in tercontinentalexchange ice which handles volume of natural gas contracts that is comparable to nymexs and also offers highvolume cont racts in electric power and crude oil as in the bilateral swaps market the cftc does not receive regu lar reports about trading on these markets although it has used its special call author ity to obtain certain information from ice the unregulated status of both types of otc markets is key issue in the current debate over energy speculation derivatives regulation the commodity exchange act the commodity exchange act cea 7 us c 1 et seq provides for regulation of derivatives markets fede ral regulation dates from the 1920s but much of the current regulatory structure was established in 1974 when congress created the cftc as an independent regulatory agency the cftcs regulatory authority is patterned after the securities and exchange commission sec both agencies oversee exchange markets that have selfregulatory res ponsibilities exchanges are requi red to set and enforce rules to protect customers prevent fraud and mani pulation maintain orde rly and fair markets and so on and the regulators ve the power to modify the exchanges rules as well as issue rules and regulations of their own common to securities and commodities law is presumption that certain forms of trading especially when public investors are involved should take place only on regulated exchange unique to the cftc is duty to preven t excessive speculation defined in section 4a as an undue burden on inte rstate commerce the cftc is specifically authorized to establish limits on the size of positions th at speculators are allowed to accumulate however the statute does not provide any specific criteria for identifying an excessive amount of speculation and the term is subject to various interpretations record trading volumes for instance do not necessarily indicate excessive speculation rather than cause of price volatility increased volumes may be the result as speculators see increased profit opportunities and he dgers face more price risk that they wish to trade away the emergence during the 1980s and 1990s of large otc markets in financial and then commodity derivatives was major challenge to the regulatory framework the cea stated that futures trading should only take place on cf tcregulated market raising the possibility that court might rule that otc contracts were illegal off exchange futures contracts and hence unenforceable in 2000 congress passed the commodity futures modernization act cfma pl 106554 in part to address this legal uncertainty and set out th conditions under which derivativ could be traded in the otc market without cftc oversight the cfma established three categories of commodities financial commodities such as interest rates currency prices or stock indexes were defined as excludedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22918crs5 3 for more information see crs report rs22912 the enron loophole by mark jickling 4 cftc report on the oversight of trading on regulated futures exchanges and exempt commercial markets october 2007 23 p and gao commodity futures trading commission trends in energy derivatives market s raise questions about cftcs oversight gao 0825 october 2007 83 pcommodities excluded commodities can be traded in the otc market with minimal cftc oversight provided that small public investors are not allowed to trade second category is agricultural commodities here because of concerns bout price manipulation the law specifies that all derivatives contracts based on farm commodities must be traded on cftcregulated futures exchange unless the cftc issues specific exemption after finding that proposed otc agricultural cont ract would be consistent with the public interest finally there is third allother category exempt commodities which includes anything that is neither financial nor agricultural in todays markets this means primarily metals and energy commodities the statutory exemption from regulation provided by the cfma for exempt commodities is what is commonly known as the enron loophole3 as concerns about manipulation and exce ssive speculation in energy markets has grown in recent years the adequacy of cftc regulation has been questioned in october 2007 both the government accountability offi ce and the cftc issued reports that described the unregulated status of exempt commodities as problematic and suggested that the cftc needed more supervisory authority over the otc market in order to be able to monitor the energy derivatives markets effectively4 the cftc recommended that congress give it authority over electronic trading facilities like ice where certain contracts had come to play significant role in price discovery the farm bill pl 110234 enacted on may 22 2008 included provisions similar to the cftcs recommendations if the cftc determines that an energy contract traded on an otc electronic trading facility play s significant role in setting prices that is if prices generated there are linked to or used as reference points by other markets the otc market will be required to register with the cftc and comply with several regulatory core principles aimed at curbing manipulation and excessive speculation including the establishment and enforcemen t of position li mits it will be required to publish andor report to the cftc information relating to prices trading volume and the size of positions held by speculators and hedgers the farm bill did not address bilateral contracts that are not executed on trading facility but which are negotiate d between the counterparties these remain outside the scope of cftc regulation except for certa in antifraud and manipulation provisions some believe that this omission means th at the enron loophole has been only partially closed number of bills before the 110th congress would remove the statutory exemption for bilateral energy swaps by putting them on the same regulatory basis as otc agricultural contracts which must be pproved by the cftc as consistent with the public interest before they can be traded or by restricting participation in otc energy markets to firms that deal in the physical commodities summaries of these bills appear in crs report rl34555 speculation and energy pri ces legislative responses by mark jickling and lynn j cunninghamhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22918crs6 appendix futures contract the mechanics of futures contract an oil futures contract represents 1000 barrels of oil but neither party to the contract need ever possess the actual commodity contracts may be settled by physical delivery but in practice the vast majority are settled in cash when contract is made today one party called the long agrees to buy oil at future date from the other the short contracts are available with different maturities designated by expiration months but the size is always the same in oil contract expires every month the price at which this future transaction is to take place is the current market price assuming the price of oil is 135 per barrel the long trader is committed to buy at that price and the short is obliged to sell assume that tomorrow the price of oil goes to 140barrel the long trader now has the advantage he is entitled to buy for 135 oil that is now worth 140 his profit is 5000 the 5 per barrel increase times the 1000 barrels specifie d in the contract the short has lost the identical amount she is obliged to ll oil for less than the going price if on the following day the price goes to 145 the long gains another 5000 the short down total of 10000 may reconsider her investme nt strategy and decide to exit the market she can do this at any time by entering into an offsetting or opposite transaction that is she purchases long contract with the same expi ration date her obligation on paper is now to sell 1000 barrels according to the first contract and to buy 1000 barrels the second contract when both contracts expire simultaneously whatev er price prevails at that time the net effect of the two transaction will be zero the shorts position is said to be evened out she is out of the market the shorts decision to exit does not affect th long who may prefer to ride with the trend this is because all contracts are assumed by the exchanges clearing house which becomes the opposite party on each trade and guar antees payment the ability to enter and exit the market by offset without having to ma ke or take delivery of the physical commodity permits trading strategies based on shortterm price expectations while some traders may keep long or short position open for weeks or months others buy and sell within time frame of minutes or seconds the exchange clearing house which guarantees all trades also controls traders funds before entering into the trade described above both long and short would have been required to deposit an initial margin payment of 11813 the amount is set by the exchange the figure is current as of july 9 2008 all contracts ar priced or markedtomarket each day the long trader above would have had his 10000 ga in credited to his margin account while the short would have had to make additional maint enance margin payments to cover her losses it is worth noting that her twoday 10000 loss repr esents 85 of her original investment that is her initial margin deposit of 11813 the risks of futures speculation are high when traders exit the market any funds remaining in their ma rgin accounts are returned other transaction costs such as brokerage commissions nd exchange fees are not returnable options on futures are also available for many futures contracts the holder of an option has the right but not the obligation to enter into long or short futures contract over the life of the option the option will only be exercised if price movements are favorable to the option buyer that is if the underlying futures contract would be profitable the seller of the option receives payment called premium for granting this right the seller profits if the option is not exercised by the buyer
