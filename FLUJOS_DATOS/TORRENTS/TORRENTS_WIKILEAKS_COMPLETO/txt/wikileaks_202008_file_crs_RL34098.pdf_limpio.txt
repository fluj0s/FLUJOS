the agency is divided into nine major functional components consisting of four offices and five research centers the offices centers and key program areas are described below5 unlike the national institutes of health nih or the centers for disease control and prevention cdc which each have separate funding streams for major organizational entities such as centers or institutes ahrq funds are targeted to specific programs or objectives eg comparative effectiveness patient safety and health disparities budget dollars are then allocated to ahrqs centers by the director according to research priorities identified by congress or the department of health and human services therefore table 3 which describes ahrqs budget does not provide funding stream data for the separate re search centers at ahrq instead budget figures are displayed according to several broad program categories also described below offices and research centers the office of the director is charged with ensuring that ahrqs strategic objectives are achieved the office of performance accountability resources and technology coordinates agencywide program planning and administra tive operations the office of extramural research education and priority populations oerep directs the scientific review process manages ahrqs research training programs monitors and evaluates ongoing research and supports or

programs for disseminating the results of ahrq activities and ahrqfunded research the center for outcomes and evidence coe conducts and supports research assessments and demonstrations on safety quality effectiveness and costeffectiveness it serves as repository for evidencebased information on therapeutics technologies and health care practices coe summarizes these findings and provides an array of tools and products to promote and facilitate evidencebased clinical decisions the center for primary care prevention and clinical partnerships cp3 focuses on research addressing the effectiveness and quality of primary and preventive health care services cp3 serves as locus for research on health information technology it also supports work on the preparedness of the health care system to deal with bioterrorism natural disasters and pandemic flu the center for delivery organization and markets cdom conducts and supports qualitative and quantitative studies on how organizational dynamics in the health sector affect access and costs for instance its research examines how market forces influence payment methods financial and nonfinancial incentives safety net funding and employer purchasing strategies the center for financing access and cost trends cfact manages studies of the cost and financing of health care including research analyzing trends and patterns of health expenditures public and private insurance coverage utilization of care and access to care for various subsets of the general population cfacts work includes modeling and projections of health care use population health status and overall health care expenditures the center for quality improvement and patient safety cquips supports research addressing patient safety including studies on health care quality measurement and medical error reporting in addition it develops and disseminates reports aimed at decreasing medical errors risks and hazards in health care settings program areas the ahrq budget presented in table 3 is organized according to program areas these are 1 research on healthcare costs quality and outcomes hqco which consists of patient safety research and nonpatient safety research 2 the medical expenditure panel survey and 3 program support medical errors result in considerable morbidity mo rtality and costs to the health care system with the increased focus on patient safety stimulated by the release of the institute of medicines 1999 report to err is human and with substantial budget increase from congress directed toward patient safety ahrq embarked on strategic approach to develop large targeted patient safety research initiative the ongoing objectives of this effort include developing public private partnerships to build capacity for medical error reduction activities examining the effect of working conditions on patient safety and reviewing different methods of reporting medical errors among its patient safety research programs ahrq is actively involved with researching the advantages and disadvantages associated with health information technology hit hit broadly refers to the use of computers and computer programs to store protect retrieve and transfer clinical administrative and financial information electronically within health care settings clinicians and researchers believe that electronic health records could play an important role in coordinating care especially for people with chronic conditions such as diabetes or asthma who frequently see multiple providers an ahrq priority is the dissemination of new knowledge and best practices from pioneers in this field

researchers at universities and other research institutions for the purpose of studying issues other than patient safety recently ahrq has placed high priority on research regarding the care of individuals with chronic conditions andor multiple comorbidities it has expressed particular interest in funding studies of patientcentered care that evaluate different efforts to redesign structural processes to target sicker individuals this includes interventions that empower patients improve patientprovider communication and facilitate the coordination of care such as telehealth electronic health records diseasemanagement programs medication therapy compliance programs and webbased applications for patients and health care providers ahrq has also devoted considerable resources to eliminating health disparities investigating strategies to reduce racial ethnic and socioeconomic inequities in access to health care services to this end it produces an annual report to congress the national healthcare disparities report 6 the comparative effectiveness program which helps policy makers clinicians and patients determine which medical treatments work best for certain health conditions grew out of section 1013 of the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of 2003 pl 108 173 the program supports the development of new scientific information through research on the outcomes of health care services and therapies including pharmaceuticals and by comparing different therapies used to treat the same condition7 cosponsored by ahrq and the national center for health statistics in cdc the medical expenditure panel survey meps is survey of health care use by the civilian population living in the united states meps produces nationally representative statistics on health care utilization and expenditures it also collects data on health conditions health insurance and coverage meps is composed of three different but related surveys the household component hc the medical provider component mpc and the insurance component ic the meps hc survey collects detailed data on demographic characteristics health conditions health status access to care satisfaction with care and health insurance coverage the mpc survey supplements and validates information on medical care events reported in the meps hc by contacting medical providers

gradually increased in the late 19th and early 20th centuries bia did not have bureauwide medical supervisor until 1908 the snyder act of 192137 authorized federal programs for indians within the bia including health care but did not establish an indian medical agency in 1954 congress passed the transfer act directing that interiors and the bias responsibilities functions and facilities for indian health care be transferred to the surgeon general of the public health service in the department of health education and welfare38 the transfer occurred on july 1 1955 and since then ihs has been part of the phs besides general statutory authority under the snyder act and the transfer act specific ihs programs are authorized by the indian sanitation facilities act of 195939 authorizing the phs to
