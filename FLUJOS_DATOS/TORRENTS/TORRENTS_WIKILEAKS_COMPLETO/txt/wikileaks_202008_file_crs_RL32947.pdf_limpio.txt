the interest in animal agriculture has focused on impacts on water resources because animal waste if not properly managed can harm water quality through surface runoff direct discharges spills and leaching into soil and groundwater more recent issue is the contribution of emissions from animal feeding operations afo enterprises where animals are raised in confinement to air pollution afos can affect air quality through emissions of gases such as ammonia and hydrogen sulfide particulate matter volatile organic compounds hazardous air pollutants and odor these pollutants and compounds have number of environmental and human health effects agricultural operations that emit large quantities of air pollutants may be subject to clean air act regulation further some livestock operations also may be regulated under the release reporting requirements of the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act superfund or cercla and the emergency planning and community righttoknow act epcra questions about the applicability of these laws to livestock and poultry operations have been controversial and have drawn congressional attention enforcement of these federal environmental laws requires accurate measurement of emissions to determine whether regulated pollutants are emitted in quantities that exceed specified thresholds yet experts believe that existing data provide poor basis for regulating and managing air emissions from afos in an effort to collect scientifically credible data in 2005 the environmental protection agency epa announced plan that had been negotiated with segments of the animal agriculture industry called the air compliance agreement it is intended to produce air quality monitoring data on afo emissions during twoyear study while at the same time protecting participants through safe harbor from liability under certain provisions of federal environmental laws many producer groups support the agreement as essential to gathering valid data that are needed for decision making however critics including environmentalists and state and local air quality officials say that the air compliance agreement will grant all participating animal producers sweeping retrospective and prospective liability shield for violations of environmental laws yet because fewer than 30 farms will be monitored it is too limited in scope to yield scientifically credible estimates of afo emissions some industry groups have their own questions and reservations nearly 2700 afos signed up to participate in the agreement in august 2006 epa finished approving agreements with 2568 afos representing more than 13000 farms monitoring involving 24 farms in 10 states began in mid 2007 legal challenge to the agreement by environmental groups was

environmental quality standpoint much of the public and policy interest in animal agriculture has focused on impacts on water resources because animal waste if not properly managed can adversely impact water quality through surface runoff and erosion direct discharges to surface waters spills and other dryweather discharges and leaching into soil and groundwater however animal feeding operations afo enterprises where animals are kept and raised in confinement can also result in emissions to the air of particles and gases such as ammonia hydrogen sulfide and volatile organic chemicals at issue today are questions about the contribution of afos to total air pollution and corresponding ecological and possible public health effects the environmental protection agency epa has authority to address afo air emissions under several lawsthe clean air act comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act and the emergency planning nd community righttoknow act implementation and enforcement of these laws requires scientifically credible data on air emissions and accurate measurement of emissions to determine whether regulated pollutants are emitted in quantities that exceed specified thresholds this report discusses plan announced by epa in january 2005 called the air compliance agreement intended to produce air quality monitoring data on animal agriculture emissions from small number of farms while at the same time protecting all participants including farms where monitoring takes place through safe harbor from liability under certain provisions of federal environmental laws some industry sectors involved in negotiating the agreement notably pork and egg producers strongly support it but other industry groups that were not involved in the discussions have concerns and reservations state and local air quality officials and environmental groups oppose the agreement as discussed below separate reportcrs report rl32948 air quality

feed type and management system storage handling and stabilization emission sources include barns feedlot surfaces manure storage and treatment units silage piles animal composting structures and other smaller sources but air emissions come mostly from the microbial breakdown of manure stored in pits or lagoons and spread on fields pollutants associated with afos have number of environmental and human health impacts most of the concern with possible health effects focuses on ammonia hydrogen sulfide and particulate matter while major ecological effects are associated with ammonia particulates methane and oxides of nitrogen the animal sector of agriculture has undergone major changes in the last several decades fact that has drawn the attention of policymakers and the public in the united states there are an estimated 238000 animal feeding operations where livestock and poultry are confined reared and fed according to the us department of agricultures 1997 census of agriculture organizational changes within the industry to enhance economic efficiency have resulted in larger confined production facilities that often are geographically concentrated 3 the driving forces behind structural change in livestock and poultry production are different than those that affect many other industries technological innovation and economies of scale4 from 1982 to 1997 the total number of us operations with confined livestock fell by 27 at the same time the number of animals raised at large feedlots generally confining 300 animals or more increased by 88 and the number of large feedlots increased by more than 50 5 the traditional image of small farms located in isolated rural locales has given way to very large farming operations some on the scale of industrial activities increased facility size and regional concentration of livestock and poultry operations have in turn given rise to concerns over the management of animal wastes from these facilities and potential impacts on environmental quality agricultural operations often have been treated differently from other types of businesses under numerous federal and state laws some laws specifically exempt agriculture from regulatory provisions and some are structured in such way that farms escape most if not all of the regulatory impact moreover in implementing environmental laws federal and state regulators have traditionally focused most effort on controlling the largest and most visible sources of pollution to the water air and landfactories waste treatment plants motor vehiclesrather than smaller and more dispersed sources such as farms nevertheless certain large animal feeding operations are subject to environmental regulation the primary regulatory focus has been on protecting water resources and has occurred under the clean water act while air emissions from farms typically do not exceed thresholds specified in the clean air act caa and thus generally escape most caa regulatory programs facilities that emit large quantities of air pollutants may be regulated under the act and state programs which 3 for additional information see crs report rl33325 livestock

federal caa requirements with facility construction and operation permits air quality standards for odor and certain afo pollutants monitoring inspection and testing some observers believe that increased federal and state attention to air emissi ons from afos precipitated in part by structural changes in animal production and public concern will likely lead to stricter federal regulation6 some livestock operations may also be subject to the release reporting requirements of the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act cercla the superfund law and the emergency planning nd community righttoknow act epcra the reporting requirements of these laws are triggered when large quantities of certain substances are released to the environment including ambient air livestock facilities emit hydrogen sulfide and ammonia which are reportable substances under these laws there has been little enforcement of these provisions against livestock operations but in lawsuits brought by citizen groups federal courts in two circuits have found afos in violat ion of the reporting requirement provisions of the laws applicability of other provisions of cercla to agriculture provisions concerning liability for costs of cleanup of hazardous substance releases and recovery for damages of releases to natural resources also have drawn attention the net result is growing concern by the agriculture community that other legal actions will be brought thus potentially exposing more of these operations to enforcement under federal law

provisions of federal environmental laws such as the clean air act requires accurate measurement of emissions to determine whether facilities and operations emit regulated pollutants in quantities that exceed specified thresholds monitoring air emissions from feedlots waste lagoons animal confinement buildings and other components of livestock facilities is complex and has been controversial resolving questions about afos contribution to total air pollution and corresponding ecological and possible public health effects is hindered by lack of adequate accurate scientifically credible data on air emissions at the same time increasing public concern about afo emissions and growing number of enforcement actions brought against large afos seeking compliance with environmental laws have led to efforts to gather more and better data early in 2002 representatives of some agriculture industry groupsespecially pork and egg producersapproached epa officials with proposal to negotiate voluntary agreement that would produce air quality monitoring data on emissions from animal feedlot operations discussions between epa and the industry groups continued for more than two years and eventually led to plan called the air compliance agreement that epa announced in january 2005 it was published in the federal register on january 31 2005 thus triggering period during which afos could sign up to participate in the agreement 7 concurrently epa solicited public comments but comments were not expected to lead to changes to the agreement the signup period originally set to last for 90 days was subsequently extended for an additional 60 days until july 1 2005 and the public comment period originally set to end on april 1 was 6 jody m endres and margaret rosso grossman air emissions

signup first to july 12 and then to august 12 2005 in order to provide more time for afo operators to make decisions about participation the public comment period was not extended the agreement is intended to enable scientists to collect and analyze emissions data and create tools that afos could use to estimate their emissions for purposes of regulatory compliance while at the same time protecting participating afos under safe harbor in which epa covenants not to sue and releases participants from epa liability for failing to comply with certain provisions of the clean air act cercla and epcra epa retains the authority to respond to an imminent and substantial endangerment to public health or the environment and participants are not protected against liability for criminal violations of environmental laws the agreement applies to afos in the egg broiler chicken turkey dairy cattle and swine industries it does not address afos that only have openair feedlots such as cattle feedlots those that sign up to participate will pay civil penalty ranging from 200 to 1000 depending on the number of animals at the afo and will contribute 2500 per farm to implement nationwide air monitoring program for afos epa estimated that as many as 4000 afos might sign up to participate in the agreement of those that sign agreements with epa small numberperhaps more than three dozen repres entative farms nationwidewill be selected to participate in onfarm monitoring but all who sign up will be protected by epas covenant not to sue epa reserved the right to decide not to go forward with the agreement and monitoring study if for example an insufficient number of afos signs up to generate the 10 to 12 million estimated to be needed for the study or if some individual animal groups were underrepresented epa also could decline to enter into agreement w ith an individual afo if for example it is the subject of ongoing federal state or local environmental enforcement epa expected that within 30 days after the end of the signup period august 12 2005 agency officials would decide whether to proceed with all part or none of the monitoring study and sign the air compliance agreements submitted by industry participants as described in the following section this process took longer than was anticipated signed agreements would then be forwarded to the agencys environmental appeals board eab for final approval unlike civil enforcement actions that are resolved by judicially approved consent decrees the air compliance agreements are administrative agreements among other responsibilities the eab is the final epa decisionmaker on administrative appeals under all major environmental statutes that the agency administers monies collected from participants will go to nonprofit organization npo set up by the afos called the agricultural air research council 9 the npo in turn will subcontract with science advisor and independent monitoring contractor to run the monitoring study including recommending facilities to be monitored epa s role will be to review and approve the contractors study plan and later to use and analyze the data generated by the study epa also collaborated with industry and other stakeholders to develop protocols for the study which were published with the january 2005 notice of the agreement emissions at the facilities will be monitored at both buildings and waste lagoons and will include ammonia hydrogen sulfide particulate matter carbon dioxide and volatile organic compounds vocs 8 70 federal register 16266 march 30 2005

two years epa will use the data and other relevant available data to develop methodologies for estimating annual emissions within 18 months after the nationwide monitoring study concludes ie early 2008 or possibly some time in 2009 epa expects to publish emissionestimating methodologies for afos in the eligible animal groups once the methodologies are published an afo will have 120 days to apply the methodologies to its facilities apply for all applicable air permits and comply with permit conditions and report any qualifying releases of ammonia and hydrogen sulfide as required by cercla and epcra the epa covenant not to sue and waiver from liability will cover an afos liability for failing to comply with certain provisions of cercla epcra and the caa retroactively and from the start of the agreement up to the time it reports releases and applies for and receives caa permits ie 120 days after publication of estimating methodologies or december 31 2011 whichever is earlier this time period can be extended by mutual agreement of epa and participants without limit to how long such an extension might last 10 g21g157g138g157g158g156g561 the signup period for participating in the agreement closed on august 12 2005 and epa then began compiling and evaluating responses ultimately 2681 afos representing more than 6700 farms signed up to participate in november 2005 an initial group of agreements was forwarded to the agencys environmental appeals board for approval the eab approved the first 20 agreements on january 31 2006 consisting of 10 swine and 10 egglaying operations in 11 states the eab approved larger groups of agreements in april may and july and approved final group in august 2006 with that final action the board ratified total of 2568 agreements

to know whether their farms are subject to federal environmental laws additionally supporters said that producers need the protection provided by the agreement in order to volunteer their farms for participation in the study without this protection there is incentive for producers to participate in the research because the potential penalties for alleged past violations are so great many among those who support the agreement believe that livestock operations should be entirely exempt from cercla and epcra reporting requirements because in their view congress did not intend for these laws to apply to animal agriculture several groups including cattle feedlots even though they are not included in the compliance agreement and chicken and turkey producers have for some time requested that epa resolve the issue for producers through finding or guidance to clarify that animal agriculture facilities are not subject to cercla and epcra they fear that barring statutory change or some clarification from epa the courts will continue to rule that the laws do apply to animal agriculture thus they view the monitoring study and the legal protection provided under it as an incentive to participants that will provide the data needed to determine on national scale which farms are subject to compliance with regulatory requirements state and local air quality officials and members of the environmental advocacy community strongly objected to the agreement which some characterized as grant of retrospective and prospective immunity from liability for every afo in the united states sweeping liability shield to the entire industry 12 environmental groups and air program administrators were not included in epaindustry negotiations on the agreement but several draft versions of the agreement document were publicly circulated throughout the period of its development letters to epa objecting to the proposal were sent by both13 and environmental groups unsuccessfully attempted to halt the plan with september 2003 lawsuit alleging that epa had violated the freedom of information act by failing to disclose documents about the proposed agreement legal challenge to the air compliance agreement was brought by several environmental advocacy groups in may 2005 the lawsuit was dismissed in july 2007 when the court held that the agreements constitute an action that is not reviewable by the court because the agreements fall within the enforcement discretion of epa in dissenting opinion one judge said that the agreement is broader than discretionary enforcement action because it could be in force for years while epa formulates an emissions regulatory program tailored to livestock operations association of irritated residents v ep 051177 dc cir july 17 2007 not all

environmental critics argued that the agreement unlawfully exempts afos from requirements of the clean air act cercla and epcra they argued that epa has authority to defer major stationary sources or facilitys compliance with these laws through permit deferrals or requirements these opponents argued that the broad liability shield provided by the agreement is not justified by contending that there is lack of data they pointed to research that has been conducted for quite some time by academic and government researchers including usda that has documented emissions and adverse health and environmental effects from afo emissions further they argued that epa has authority under caa section 114 to require that afos provide emission monitoring data without the need to prov ide an industrywide exemption in the view of environmentalists the penalties required under the agreement averaging 500 per farm are payment to pollute especially compared with penalties available to epa under those laws 27500 for each civil violation epas position is that the agreement is the quickest and most effective way to address the current uncertainties regarding air emissions and to bring the entire afo industry into compliance with the caa cercla and epcra in contrast to lengthy litigation and casebycase enforcement of the laws 15 environmental critics also were concerned that the agreement does not require afos to reduce pollution epas publication of emissionestimating methodologies will trigger the obligation of participating afos to determine their emissions and to comply with all applicable caa requirements including permits and cercla and epcra reporting requirements critics said however that it does not guarantee air pollution controls at any afo or even require participants to test technologies or management practices to reduce their emissions although all afos are eligible to secure lengthy perhaps indefinite caa amnesty at the end of the study epa could make regulatory or policy decisions that would leave afo emissions unregulated they said even if monitoring indicates there are emissions in am ounts that would be of concern in addition they were critical of the openended timelines in the agreement especially the 18 months after monitoring when epa expects to publish emissionestimating methodologies if epa fails to issue the methodologies the waiver could last indefinitely they said number of commenters criticized the small number of sites that epa expected would be monitoredfewer than three dozen according to epas early indications as noted above in june 2007 epa announced that the study will include 24 farms in 10 states such small number critics said will be insufficient to develop emissionestimating methodologies for all of the covered animal sectors and possible farm configurations and geographic locations in response epa said that its technical experts believe that the monitoring protocol will provide sufficient data to get valid representative sample moreover significantly increasing the number of farms to be monitored would be prohibitively expensive and would not add substantially to the value of the data collected according to epa 16 critics also said that the small sample size for monitoring is inconsistent with recommendations made by the national research council calling for process based rather than model farm approach to estimate emissions17 epa said that developing 15 70 federal register 4958 january 31 2005 16 70 federal register 4960 january 31 2005 17 in 2001 epa asked the national

strategy but will take period of years other critics said that the monitoring protocol under the agreement lacks adequate peer review and involvement of qualified independent scientists who were not involved in its formulation to assure the scientific rigor of the monitoring program some commenters recommended an independent peer review process using reviewers with active ties to the livestock industry in june 2007 when epa announced that the study was ready to proceed agency officials said that purdue and the other participating universities developed 2000 pages of protocol for the design of the study and that it was peerreviewed by epa and its contractors as well as by outside research groups still some critics complained that the public had not been notified or involved in the external review process state and local air quality officials said that the ag reement interferes with their ability to attain air quality standards and enforce air pollution control laws in their view several of the agreements provisions are unclear and could be interpreted to limit the ability of states and localities to enforce air laws these groups along with environmentalists were greatly concerned that the broad waiver of liability will curtail state or local and citizen enforcement or at the very least create very high hurdle for enforcement the agreement says that it is not intended to affect the ability of states or citizens to enforce applicable state laws however these critics contended that by saying that the agreement resolves an afos civil liability for certain potential violations it seriously raises the bar for state or citizen enforcement since participating afo might claim in an enforcement action that the agreement provides immunity from state laws or local ordinances epas position is that the agreement does not undermine state or local enforcement authorities and has impact on the most important state forcement tools including zoning classification state permits nuisance actions workplace regulations and health and safety laws further the agreement does not affect the ability of regulators to bring an action under emergency provisions of the clean air act and other statutes in or der to prevent an imminent and substantial endangerment to public health welfare or the environment epa also was criticized for failing to resolve two important definitional issues in the notice announcing the agreement epa said that after the monitoring study is complete it will issue guidance or rule on whether to treat emissions from different areas at afos as fugitive or nonfugitive emissions fugitive emissions are not counted for purposes of determining whether under the clean air act source is major or minor and thus subject to pollution controls critics said that epa should clarify this important issue quickly should do so in consultation with states and localities and should take any action through formal rulemaking not guidance document similarly epa said that at the end of the monitoring study it will issue guidance on the scope of the term source as it relates to animal agriculture and farm activities 18 state and local air quality officials were concerned that like the fugitive emissions issue epa could define source in such way that emissions from afos do not rise to threshold of regulatory concern in their view this would be contrary to federal court rulings in cases concerning applicability of cercla and epcra reporting requirements to afos states and localities believe that the laws should be interpreted liberally to accomplish goals of cleaning up and maintaining clean air 18 70 federal register 4959 january 31 2005

in negotiations with epa to develop th program but might be expected to participate in the agreement number of commenters from the dairy farming and broiler and turkey producer industries noted confusion about many details of the agreement especially for small farmers resulting in uncertainty about implications and costs to them of participating in it actual costs and transaction costs several asked epa to review public comments on the agreement make suggested changes where appropriate and allow producers and processors additional time to sign up once final agreement was published extending the signup period would allow groups that are less familiar with the agreement the time that they need to assess it they said as noted previously based partly on requests for additional time epa did extend the signup deadline until august 12 2005 but the agreement remained unchanged from what was published in january 2005 number of industry commenters objected that the agreement requires an admission of liability and that the term civil penalty which participants must pay carries negative connotations that imply guilt some companies objected to having to pay to resolve unproven violations epa responded that by voluntarily signing the agreement farmers are not admitting any liability or any sort of wrongdoing payment of penalty is part of the process to obtain release from liability for possible violations according to epa and is not intended to be used for any purposes other than this agreement in epas view signing the agreement is not an admission that participating agricultural operations have been operated negligently or improperly or in violation of any federal state or local law or rule 19 some dairy farmers also raised concerns that the agreement could jeopardize their role in farm programs bank loans and insurance policies in response the secretary of agriculture informed members of congress that the department had concluded that voluntary participation in the air compliance agreement by producer or processor will not cause the producer or processor to be ineligible for usda programs20 both poultry producer groups sometimes called the meatbird sector in contrast to the egg laying segment of poultry and dairy groups said that they would prefer to work with nonprofit organization of their own choosing to manage thei r participation handling funding monitoring facilities presenting the data rather than single organization selected to represent all of the industry purdue university was selected to manage the study the dairy industry preferred to work with its own dairy environmental task force which already is addressing dairy air quality issues and poultry and egg producers preferred to work with researchers that they believe are more familiar with their operations such as scientists from the university of georgia producers in the poultry and dairy sectors also objected to the small number of sites that epa plans to monitor for example the protocol calls for monitoring only four dairy farms and two broiler operations across the country saying that the proposed monitoring program is too limited and that the data will not accurately reflect the variation or range of climatic geographic and 19 us environmental protection agency response to public comments on the animal feeding operation air agreement june

whereas the environmentalists concerns about the small number of sites to be monitored is that the majority of producers will benefit from the safe harbor without having to do anything industry groups have different concerns they fear that epa will impose future requirements that will be both costly and scientifically inappropriate because the limited monitoring under the protocol will not adequately reflect different types of operations within specific sectors or for all segments of animal agriculture one commenter noted as follows an insufficient number of farms are included in the monitoring to allow for the development of models to estimate emissions from individual afos it is unclear how the very limited number of representative farms selected and the resulting emission estimating methodologies will result in data capable of accounting for the various differences in management styles feed regimes water control and numerous other factors that can affect emissions 21 comments from poultry and dairy groups raised other concerns including financial obstacles to participating in the agreement dairy farmers note d that while some animal producers are able to use funds from national checkoff programs to pay for the study so that individual producers do not have to pay the costs outofpocket eg the national pork board has committed 6 million of checkoff funds for pork producers participation the national dairy checkoff program may not be used to fund productionoriented research at the farm level 22 thus there is central mechanism to fund dairy farmers participation in the monitoring study group of pork producers who operate small farms called the campaign for family farms and several individual hog farmers objected to use of mandatory pork checkoff funds to support producers participation in the epa air compliance agreement in may 2005 they petitioned the secretary of agriculture to halt pork checkoff commitments for expenses related to the agreement in their view the epa study is beyond the type of research and promotion that is permissible under the pork promotion resear ch and consumer information act which authorizes the checkoff accord ing to the petitioners the proposed use of pork checkoff funds is means for large concentrated animal feeding operations cafos to buy legal immunity from environmental laws that will not benefit those producers who are too small to be subject to the caa cercla or epcra 23 despite this challenge usda has approved use of the pork check off funds for the study

from the notification requirements of cercla and epcra24 the exemption would apply to releases to the air from manure digestive emissions and urea including animal waste mixed with bedding compost and other specified materials epa explained that the rule is justified because of the resource burden to industry of complying with reporting requirements since the agency cannot foresee situation where response action would be taken as result of notification of releases of hazardous substances from animal waste at farms the proposal drew significant public response during the public comment period including criticism from environmental groups and others such as states some argued that an exemption is premature since epa is moving forward with research on emissions levels under the air compliance agreement and that the agreement could be undermined by regulatory exemption industry groups support the proposed exemption fina l action on the proposal could occur before the obama administration takes office in january 2009 according to epa in september 2008 the government accountability office gao issued report evaluating epas activities to regulate air emissions and water discharges from animal feeding operations gao noted the criticism of epas air emissions monitoring activities and concern that the research may not produce sufficient information to shape future regulation moreover gao questioned the basis for the proposed cerclaepcra exemption it is unclear how epa made this determination when it has not yet completed its data collection effort and does not yet know the extent to which animal feeding operations are emitting these pollutants 25 congressional attention to the issues discussed in this report has been limited with the result that developments have proceeded largely by administrative and some judicial actions not through legislative policymaking legislation regarding the air compliance agreement has been introduced prior to release of the agreement in january 2005 some individual members wrote letters to epa objecting to the pending plan some members also have been critical of epa s proposal to exempt routine animal waste air releases from cercla and epcras reporting requirements questioning the potential for harmful environmental and enforcement impacts of the proposal 26 at september 24 2008 hearing where gaos recent report was discussed several house energy and commerce subcommittee members said that they are skeptical of the epas authority for blanket exemption others suggested that an exemption for small farms whose emissions are unlikely to cause environm ental harm would make sense epa and usda witnesses supported the proposal saying that the air release waiver would only affect reporting meant for emergency response situations but would not affect requirements to report emissions of hazardous substances from other farm sources or releases of hazardous substances from manure into soil ground
