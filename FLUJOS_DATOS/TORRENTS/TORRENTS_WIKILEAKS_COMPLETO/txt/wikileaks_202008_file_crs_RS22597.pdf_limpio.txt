peter folger resources science and industry division updated may 15 2008 abstract recently projected climate changes could have widespread eﬀects on wildlife species these eﬀects might be positive or negative depending on the species some eﬀects might include extinction range shifts mismatches in phenology timing of pollination ﬂowering etc and population changes eﬀects of climate change on wildlife have been reported for some species and populations in localized areas many scientists contend that climate change acts in concert with other variables such as habitat to aﬀect species if the eﬀects of climate change are widespread there is uncertainty on how wildlife will adapt some suggest that evolution and migration will enable species to adapt whereas others contend that adaptation will be mini mal because of limited habitat and changes in climate that may occur more rapidly than adaptation can

have major repercussions for ecological systems as indicated by past major climate shifts effects of climate change are sometimes local although some may be widespread and linked to changes in other regions through food chains nutrient flows and atmospheric and ocean circulation among other things some populations and species could flourish as the environment changes whereas others could decline some species would probably be able to adapt or adjust their ranges to stay within hospitable habitat others may be affected by obstacles to migration disruptions in food chains or habitat alteration or loss wildlife species can be affected by several climatic variables such as increasing temperatures changes in precipitation and extreme weather events some scientists predict that climate change can cause extinctions which would lower biodiversity other scientists contend that many species could benefit from climate change such as some migratory bird species which may have shorter distances to migrate for breeding and overwintering 1 the impacts of regional climate change and extreme weather on wild species has been studied for several decades2 paleoclimatic studies have shown that species have adjusted to climate changes at times in the past without mass extinctions3 yet it is uncertain if projected climate change widely foreseen today would mimic climate change events in the geological record and if humanecosystem relationships would help or hurt adaptation in the last ten years scientists have documented the effects of climate change on species and populations on every continent and in most taxonomic groups 4 some studies provide correlations between climate change and species changes others predict changes with climate and species models and some demonstrate mechanistic connections between species changes and climate change5 many studies report that climate change acts in concert with other factors to affect species and their habitat for this reason and because of differences across biomes and species it is difficult to generalize about the overall impacts of climate change on biodiversity wildlife and ecosystems in discussing the effects of climate change on wildlife some contend that climate change might not be bad for species overall even if some go extinct they reason that because biodiversity is greatest in tropical zones biodiversity may benefit by warming and greater precipitation further they argue that climate change may induce species to evolve behaviors or traits that will allow them to adapt to different conditions 6 others counter these arguments by stating that climate change might be too rapid for species to evolve further some contend that opportunities for species to adapt to climate change might be limited due to habitat loss and fragmentation 1 ra robinson et climate change and migratory species british trust for ornithology norfolk uk 2005 304 p 2 camille parmesan ecological and evolutionary responses to

that climate change affects species in different ways yet the message that these studies convey may be biased because studies that show changes in species due to climate change are less likely to be published7 with monitoring research and modeling the responses of populations species landscapes and ecosystems to climate change may be predicted more reliably but the complexity of living systems and the lack of longterm data make this task difficult g5g149g146g150g138g157g142g561g5g145g138g151g144g142g561g3g143g143g142g140g157g146g151g144g561g25g146g149g141g149g146g143g142g561 climate change producing higher temperatures may affect wildlife by causing species to expand contract or shift their ranges typically toward the poles or higher elevations8 it may alter their phenologies9 leading to mismatches with their food and habitat resources it may also cause habitat loss and allow exposure to new pathogens these changes could have either negative or positive effects on the abilities of species to survive the abilities of species to adapt to some degree of climate change depends in part upon the rate at which the change occurs the following sections of this report provide examples of wildlife that are thought to be in part affected by climate change examples were taken from published studies with appropriate citations the examples illustrate the types of changes that have been observed g20g138g151g144g142g561g21g145g146g143g157g156g561 there are few studies that report the effects of climate change over an entire species range partly because of the difficulties of gathering data throughout range during period long enough to produce significant results10 even so range shifts have been documented in some species of birds and insects and in some marine communities one example is the mountain pine beetle dendroctonus ponderosae the mountain pine beetle feeds primarily on lodgepole pine11 and occasionally on other species including whitebark pine pinus albicaulis 12 until recent decades the beetle has been held in check at higher elevations by its inability to complete full life cycle due to cold temperatures and short growing season research shows that warmer temperatures during winter allow beetles to complete full reproductive cycle within one year in whitebark pine habitat13 as result they can time their breeding cycle to produce huge numbers of eggs whose emerging larvae can overwhelm the defenses not only of damaged trees but also of healthy ones studies show that the expansion of beetle populations correlates closely with local warming 7 see

ecology and environmental science h w hart ed new york ny henry holt co 1993 10 parmesan 2006 11 the lodgepole pine is adapted to this beetle and stands of this fastgrowing tree can regenerate fairly quicklyfor trees 12 the heavy seed crop of the whitebark pine supports many species including the clarks nutcracker which harvests and stores large caches of the seeds and feeds on them through winter and into the breeding season red squirrels also collect and store the seeds the stored caches are important fall and spring food sources for grizzlies 13 this discussion is adapted from michel nijhuis

northward into canada where they are occupying some forest stands for the first time in recorded history g18g145g142g151g152g149g152g144g146g140g138g149g561g5g145g138g151g144g142g156g561 phenological cues are critical in the life cycles of many species when global warming alters the climate certain phenological events generally shift accordingly if phenological change in one species does not match linked changes in an interdependent species an ecological mismatch can occur 14 for example if certain trees bloom earlier in response to warmer springs but pollinators do not hatch earlier disruptions eg failed or inadequate pollination may occur mismatches can occur between predators and prey herbivorous insects and host plants and pollinators and flowering plants among others scientists are st udying potential mismatches caused by climate change because they can disrupt the reproductive cycle of many species in one example variability in precipitation linked to regional climate change is considered as the cause of the extinction of two populations of checkerspot butterflies in california 15 changing levels of precipitation were found to alter the relationship between butterfly larvae and host plants in very wet or dry years larvae do not get the opportunity to feed on host plants before the plants die these lost opportunities for successful reproduction cause declines in butterfly abundance which eventually may lead to their extinction

ssociate wildlife population declines with climate change indirect links have been reported such as population declines in species due to habitat loss exacerbated by climate change for example the impact of climate change on antarctic krill small shrimplike animals has been documented antarctic krill are major grazers in the southern atlantic ocean and are food for various species of fish targeted by commercial fisheries declines in seaice area and in the duration of aice formation linked in part to climate change in antarctica have been connected to declines in krill density variability in krill densities has implications for the antarctic food web which includes penguins albatrosses seals and whales 16 another example is polar bears which are declining due to seasonal reductions in ice cover reductions in ice cover are linked to warmer climate in the arctic g18g138g157g145g152g144g142g151g156g561 some pathogens could increase their ranges due to climate change whereas others may diminish their ranges for example harlequin frogs are declining due to increased outbreaks of harmful chytrid fungus in the last 20 years 67 of the 110 species of harlequin frogs

thermal optimum for chytrid growth and daytime cloudiness prevents frogs from seeking thermal refuges18 these climatic shifts are promoting outbreaks of chytrid fungus in areas where harlequin frog populations reside g25g146g149g141g149g146g143g142g561g3g141g138g153g157g138g157g146g152g151g561g157g152g561g5g149g146g150g138g157g142g561g5g145g138g151g144g142g561 species and populations have demonstrated that they can adapt in variety of ways to some degree of climate change for example they can shift their ranges change their phenologies and with sufficient time may adapt to climate ch ange through evolution paleoclimate evidence indicates that some ecosystems restructured during some past climate changes without records of mass extinctions 19 assessing the ability of species to adapt to climate change is difficult because other stressors that may drive adaptation could be present such as habitat loss due to factors other than climate change competition from other species and invasive species further signs of adaptation such as range expansions or shifts in phenology may initially be viewed as positive responses by species to climate changes but have negative consequences if these shifts do not correspond to other ecosystem properties or other necessary conditions needed for that species survival for example if the natural response to climate change for species would be to expand northward the consequences might be severe if intervening developed areas replace suitable habitat or block access to it the rate of climate change reported in this century is generally seen as being uncharacteristically rapid and many scientists have questions concerning how or whether species will adapt climate change models based on global average temperature changes are less precise about local climate changes that could be important for many species this uncertainty has led some to propose artificial methods of adaptation such as assisted migration which is the collection and transport of species from unsuitable to suitable habitat this technique has been used with mixed results with endangered species and many question its viability and cost other suggestions to assist adaptation of wildlife include building corridors between protected areas to give species paths to migrate and shift their ranges

change will warrant mitigation of effects to wildlife and that planning for mitigation is prudent now others assert that the effects of climate change on species may not need intervention and that many species may be able to adapt successfully addressing this issue may require answering several questions that are still being discussed for example will the rate of any climate change be slow enough to allow species to adapt what are local changes in climate that would affect specific populations and ecosystems how could human development and management of natural resources interact with the natural adaptation process of species under climate change and is the extinction of species due to climate change concern or natural process 18 andrew blaustein and andy dobson message from the

rapidly there are resulting legislative implications several wildlife laws and management plans that have been developed with an understanding of the life history distribution and habitat needs of species may merit assessment to see if they function as desired under projected climate change for example under the endangered species act critical habitat designation habitat conservation plans and biological opinions for several species might have to be redone if data on species change this could overwhelm scientific resources and agency resources to review new data for aquatic species changes in their habitat requirements could require water flows and water supply to be altered in river management plans this possibility is tempered by some who contend that changes to species may be gradual enough that wildlife laws that address potential changes may be sufficient in the case of there are provisions that require the revision of recovery plans or conservation plans if new scientific data are presented the control eradication and prevention of invasive and pest species are generally addressed on speciesbyspecies basis in management plans if rapid climate change affects pest or exotic species scientific knowledge may not keep pace further changes in species ranges may make it difficult to determine if species are exotic or native species with new ranges separating exotic species from adapting species may be relevant for national park and refuge managers managers might be faced with challenging management objectives whether to preserve and protect current wildlife species and facilitate the adaptation of new species into protected areas 20 the effects of climate change on wildlife are being viewed by some as an issue within the larger context of potential changes to ecosystems ecological factors that affect wildlife including water flows and availability soils and nutrients can be addressed in an ecosystem context consequently largescale ecosystem restoration initiatives might have to incorporate changes in their restoration plans to address the potential effects of climate change restoration plan horizons generally range from 20 to 50 years over which local climate may change substantially for example the restoration of the everglades ecosystem is expected to take 30 years under the comprehensive everglades restoration plan this plan could need to be revised if recently predicted sea level rise occurs and causes changes in water flow in the everglades 21
