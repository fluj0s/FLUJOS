infrastructure implications summary the 109th congress is expected to take up reauthorization of funding programs for surface and marine transportation infrastructure that were debated but not enacted by the 108th congress grain shipping has been either central part or at least an element of the policy debate on many of the infrastructure funding proposals most notably key infrastructure project under c onsideration is enlarging the locks on the upper mississippi river and illinois wate rway umriww to speed up passage of barge tows grain shipping has also figure d prominently in deba tes over federal aid for rail infrastructure particularly for short line rail track located in agricultural states highway policy discussions partic ularly relevant to grain transportation include funding rural intersta tes and other federa laid designated roads to support the growth of heavy grain hauling trucks nd improving the truck routes connecting highways with ports and rail terminals over the past two decades the amount of grain transported has increased by nearly 70 while all modes have participated in this growth they have done so at different rates barge modal share has decreased slightly rail share has decreased substantially and trucking s share has increased substantially the doubling of domestic demand for grain and static ex port demand has favored truck transport because trucks generally have an advantag in moving grain over shorter distances barges and railroads favor hauling large vol umes of grain long distances which suits the export market farm and rail consolid ation has also favor ed truck transport large farms may find it more economical to own their own fleet of trucks because trucking offers more flexibility as to when where and how much grain is delivered by using trucks farmers can better time their deliveries to grain elevators in order to receive the highest price as result of rail consolidation ma ny of the smaller country elevators and short line railroads are being bypassed in the grain delivery network leaving grain farmers to rely more on trucks to deliver grain to the larger elevators while the bulk method for sh ipping grain dominates new logistics pattern utilizing containers is also emerging as described in this report the grai n supply chain is multifaceted system changes or developments with one compone nt of the system will likely affect the ability of other components to perform effi ciently the complexity of the grain supply chain raises number of issues for congress as it evaluates pending investment decisions in surface and marine transportation infrastructure one issue is if systemslevel perspective can lead to more sound investment decisions than modespecific perspective another issue is balancing the desire for transportation efficiency with local economic development concerns concern for local economic development raises the question of wh ether supporting grain valuechain as opposed to grain volumechain would create more jobs and income for rural communities the additional infrastructure costs that utilizing larger vehicles imposes on others is also an issue fina lly whether system users should pay greater share of the cost of infrastructure improve ments is key policy issue this report will not be updatedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32720contents infrastructure

wrda is enlarging the locks on the upper mississippi river and illinois wate rway umriww to speed up passage of barge tows grain shipping has been front and center in the debate over this project because grain accounts for about half the tota l freight tonnage carried on these rivers similarly grain transportation has figured prominently in debates over federal financial assistance for rail

funding and equity issues among states dominated congressional debate in the 108th congress but freight transportation in general rms has received considerab attention trucks carry about half of annual grain tonnage or about the same amount that barges and railroads carry combined highway policy di scussions particularly relevant to grain transportation include funding rural inters tates

those trends the final part identifies some of the implications these trends have for targeting future investment in the grainhandling system infrastructure funding issues relevant to grain shipping the infrastructure issues identified below are particularly relevant to shipping grain these are infrastructure segments th at have been targeted for investment in legislation debated in congress they ar briefly described here because there are other crs reports cited below that discuss these infrastructure segments in more detail mississippi and illinois river locks one infrastructure investment proposal congress is evaluating is whether to upgrade locks on the mississippi and illinois rivers several of the lower locks on the upper mississippi river have been ta rgeted for extension from 600 feet to 1200 feet to enable larger barge tows to pass through more quickly and thus reduce the cost of barge transport of exported grain and other bulk commodities many of the current locks were built between 1930 and 1950 standard tows since then have grown from 600 feet to over 1100 feet nearly the length of four football fields the lock chambers targeted for extens ion can only accommodate 600 foot tows and therefore the standard tow must move th rough the locks in two passes requiring break up and reassembly of some tows passage through 1200foot lock can take about 45 minutes or less but transiting 600foot lock take s approximately 90 minutes which can produce queuing delays for other barges specific plans for these lock improvements are discussed in greater detail in crs report rl32574 proposed authorization of uppe r mississippi river illinois waterway investments the potential benefits of these lock improvements are heavily dependent on agricultural trade pattern s evolving agricultural trade patterns and projections for future agricultural car go on these waterways is discussed in crs report rl32401 agriculture as source of barge demand on the upper mississippi

short line rail infrastructure needs 106th congress 2nd session july 25 2000 6 in this report the terms class i railroad and main line railroad are used interchangeably class i railroads are those with operating revenues of at least 2777 million in 2003sections of track focusing their resour ces on their trunk lines as the main line railroads transition to the use of the larger 286000 pound railcars short line railroads need to upgrade their track beds and brid ge structures to support these heavier cars and continue their role as collectors and di stributors of main line traffic the short line rail industry estimates that it could cost almost 7 billion to upgrade their rail systems to accommodate the heavier cars5 rural roads and bridges the continuing trend toward greater re liance on trucking in the grain delivery system as discussed further in the next section has led to increasing concern with the wear and tear on rural roads and bridge s many of these roads and bridges were built before this trend was evident and therefore were not designed for this type of traffic since many of these roads are located in sparsely populated rural counties the tax base may be insufficient to meet the cost of maintaining these roads although rural roads and bridges are the responsibility of local and state governments they are mentioned here because the expense of maintaining them to accommodate heavy grain hauling trucks s fueled the debate over public support for preserving short line rail service pr oponents of short line rail assistance contend that it might be more costeffective to provide public aid to maintain short line rail service in affected areas than to reinforce rural roads and bridges capacity of main line railroads railroad main lines are experiencing high track utilization rates much of the main line network is single tracked double or even triple tracking and increasing the number of sidings would allow more time sensitive freight trains to pass less service sensitive trains some industry anal ysts contend that the privately financed class i freight railroads are failing to keep pace with the growth in demand for freight transportation capacity6 because freight railroads are critical to the nations economy upgrading and expanding their infrastructure according to proponents of public support for rail infrastructure s hould be federal government concern capacity problems are most acute during the fall peak shipping season grain farmers complain of railcar shortages and train delays that cut into their potential profits class i railroads argue that they cannot be expected to build their physical plant to meet relatively shortlived sp ike in demand that occurs around harvest time legislative

facilities such as the access roads to marine and rail terminals these routes are typically short segments of road generally less than two miles in length that connect freight rminals to the highway system many of the connector roads especia lly those leading to seaports are in older industrialized areas and have preponderance of atgrade rail crossings that impede traffic flow two recent department of transportation dot surveys have found these access roads in many cases to be inadequate to accommodate the heavy truck traffic they handle the pavement may be in poor condition or the inte rsections and width of the roads are not designed to handle large trucks the results of these surveys and the policy issues they raise are disc ussed further in crs report rl31887 intermodal connectors method for impr oving transportation efficiency to address the issue of deficient intermodal connectors the highway reauthorization bills would create freight intermodal connectors program which would allow states to set aside portion of their federal highway funds to improve these roads to cargo hubs highway reauthor ization is discussed further in crs issue brief ib10138 surface transportation reauthorization of tea21 while the infrastructure segments iden tified above are pres ented as separate issues viewed from the perspective of the grain supply chain there is high degree of connectivity among them an examination of the grain supply chain can help prioritize investments in thes infrastructure components the grain supply chain trucks trains and barges both compete and complement one another in moving grain to successively larger elevators grain elevators accumulate critical mass of product that creates economies of scale in shipping bulk grain between origin and final destination most grain shipments ve traveled by two or more modes of transportation trucks traditi onally have an advantage in moving grain for shorter distances less than 250 miles and theref ore function primarily as the short haul gatherers of grain railroads have cost advantage in moving grain long distances barges have even greater cost advantage than rail in long distance transport but only where waterway is available ba rges moreover cannot compete with trucks and trains in terms of transit time and waterways are not always available due to ice floods or drought figure 1 illustrates the cost advantages of the three grain hauling modes in terms of shipment distancehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32720crs5 7 usda transportation of us grains modal share analysis 19782000

depending on the distance either trucks or short line railroads move the grain from the country elevator to the domestic processor feed manufacturing plant or offfarm feed lot operator livestock farmer the us department of agriculture usda reports that in 200 0 trucks transported about twothirds of grain tonnage sold in the domestic market while railroads carried about onethird and barges carried less than 27 much of the grain exported has to travel long distances to reach us ports so class i railroads and barges are the prima ry modes in moving grain for the export market the usda reports that in 2000 ba rges transported 55 of exported grain tonnage rail transported 38 and trucks transported 78 the preponderance of exported corn and soybean moves by barge since these crops are grown relatively close to either the upper mississippi illinoi s or ohio rivers barges transport 90 of the corn moving to center gulf ports while railroads transport 10 the high level of

and lee schrader longterm structural shifts in grain oilseed and animal industries in the united states usda nov 2000 growth in tonnage transported since 1978 the amount of grain transporte d has increased almost every year grain tonnages increased from 242 million in 1978 to 4 04 million in 2000 an increase of 69 in 22 years the growth in demand for grain transportation is the result of increases in grain production but also because of an increasing amount of grain used off the farm from which it is grown more grain used to feed cattle and poultry is moving offfarm because of continuing trend toward consolidation of livestock and poultry production into rgescale operations which purchase significant amounts of feed grown offs ite livestock nd poultry production is moving away from major feedgrainproduc ing states to areas of deficit grain production thus increasing demand for feedgra in transport the growth in ethanol production other industrial uses of grai n and food products made from grain also requires transportation of the product off the farm to domestic processors while all modes have participated in the growth in demand for grain transportation they have done so at differe nt rates from 1978 to 2000 tons of grain hauled by truck increased 170 tons of grain carried by barge increased 43 and tons of grain carried by rail increased 13 the reasons for these differing rates of increase are explained in the following section modal shifts in the supply chain long term trends in the amount of grai n sold domestically versus exported has shifted modal market shares the majority of grain is sold in the domestic market the usda reports that from 1996 to 2000 near ly 70 of grain movements were for the domestic market11 moreover the amount of grain transported for the domestic market has been increasing steadily from 123 million t ons in 1978 to 280 million tons in 2000 an increase of 128 typica lly about 80 of corn 65 of soybeans and 50 of wheat production is sold domestically12 the smaller export market is much more volatile than the domestic ma rket after surging during the 1970s the amount of grain exported has fluctuated rratically but overall has been about the same since the late 1970s in 1978 119 milli on tons of grain was exported while in 2000 122 million tons of grain was exported as can be seen in these tonnage figures in 1978 nearly the same amount of grain was exported as was sold in the domestic market but in 2000 about two nd quarter times more grain was sold domestically than exported figure 3 illustrates the impact these trends have had on modal market shares for grain transport these modal shares are based on the transportation mode used for the last leg of grain shipment within the united states ie to domestic buyer or to us seaport or land border crossi ng for export the transportation services branch of the usda has calculated thes modal market shares from 1978 to 2000httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32720crs8 13 larry kaufman booming grain busine ss has small shippers seeing red trains april 2004since 1978 barge modal share has decreased slightly rail share has decreased substantially and truck sh are has made up the difference from 1978 to 2000 trucks modal share increased significan tly from 31 to 49 while rails market share dropped significantly from 48 to 31 and barges dr opped sligh tly from 21 to 18 increasing domestic dema nd and static expor t demand has favored truck transport because as ntioned above trucks genera lly have an advantage over rail and barge for shorter haul shipments also domestic buyers tend to buy grain in smaller volumes because they operate throughout the year13 smaller shipment size fits the characteristics of truck transport more than rail and barge class i railroads and barges are more interested in long distance trainl oad or bargeloadsize shipments which suits the export market more than the domestic market

contributed to truckings predominance in grain movement s due to farm and rail consolidation the smaller country elevators and short lin railroads are increasingly being bypassed in the grain delivery system trucks are replacing short line railroads in the grain collection function the movement of grai n for relatively short distances in one survey industry expert s predicted that one in four of the more than 10000 grain elevators in todays network will long er be in existence decade from now14 farm consolidation between 1980 and 1998 the number of farms decreased by 15 while the average size of farms increased by nearly 1115 larger farms may find it more economical to own th eir own fleet of trucks and move their product directly to the subter minal elevator or to the pro cessor or feed lot farmers receive payment at delivery and thus can receive payment faster if their product moves by truck rather than short line railroad for farms with sufficient onfarm storage trucking offers farmers more flexibility than rail as to when and where they deliver their product they can adjust delivery times and amounts more easily to obtain the highest grain price other reasons farmers may us trucks rather than short line railroads is that trucks are more pendable truck rates are lower and because the rail line available may not serve the most profitable market rail consolidation the construction of rapid loadout facilities on class i railroad networks has also contributed to greater reliance on trucking for the initial leg of shipment class i railroads are exploiting operating efficiencies by consolidating their trackage and rolling st ock around larger subterminal elevators these larger elevators have enough grain to not only load longer trains but also trains using larger and heavier grain cars new super jumbo cove redhopper railcars have loaded weights of 286000 to 315000 pounds compared with 263000 pounds for the traditional cars the larger elevators are also equipped with highspeed loading gear which can fill milelong train in 15 hours or less less time spent loading at the terminals means that trains can increase their turnaround time making more trips in given period in addition to streamlining the loading process railroads have streamlined their train operations with new c onfigurations the rail cons olidation process emphasizes unit and shuttle trains deemphasizing carload service in favor of shipment sizes that can fill entire trains and operating from single origins and destinations rather than multiple origins and destinations16 these unitgraintrains are designed to reduce switching costs and delays thereby improving car cycle times by concentrating on the longhaul portion of grain movements class i railroads have simplified their

washington dc p 19 19 us senate committee on commerce science and transportation rail freight transportation in north dakota march 27 2002one study estimates that in 1999 approximate ly 50 of us rail shipments of corn and 10 of rail shipments of wheat were handled by unit trains17 the class i railroad tactic of increasing the density of grain movements over their track is consistent with their strategy in moving other commodities as well from 1970 to 1999 the number of tonmiles of all commodities carried by class 1 railroads increased by 87 percent while the number of miles of railway operated by class i railroads declined by 43 percent18 north dakota invers rail rates an illustrative example the influence that class i railroad strategies can have on the grain delivery system is illustrated in north dakota the practice of socalled inverse rate pricing by the burlington northern santa fe bnsf railroad drew lot of attention in the state and was the subject of congressional field hearing at the hearing grain farmer located near gladstone in the southwestern part of the state described how he trucked his grain to subterminal elevator in jamestown located 160 miles to the east even though his local elevator was located only 20 miles from his farm19 the reason he trucked his grain to the more distant elevator was because he received better price for his grain at that elevator than from his local elevator the subterminal elevator gave him better price because grain farmers are paid the price of grain minus the cost of transportati on which in this case was the cost of rail transportation to seaport in the pacific northwest pnw the bnsf railroad charged less to ship grain from eastern north dakota than western north dakota to pnw ports even though the distance is farther hence the term inverse rates from the subterminal elevator in jamestown the bnsf would then haul the grain back west passing through the grain farmers yard located near gladstone on its way to pnw port while inverse pricing may seem peculiar from the railroads perspective it is sound pricing strategy traditionally grain produced in eastern north dakota would be sold in the domestic market or exported via the port of duluth for shipment through the great lakes or via minneapolis or another mississippi river port for barge transport to the port of new orleans thus trucks or barges would capture most of the inland freight revenues for shipment of eastern north dakota grain and eastbound rail shipments would be for relatively short distances however if the bnsf railroad could encourage the movement of this grain in the opposite direction that is west to pnw ports it could capture all of the inland transport revenues because this route would utilize bnsfs rail network over much longer distance in eastern north dakota the bnsf also faced competition from canadian pacific railroad which can carry grain to the port of vancouver bc to compete with these alternative routes bnsf had to reduce the cost of eastern north dakota to pnw gr ain movements so that it could lower its rates to do this it streamlined and simplified its train ope rations employing the rail rationalization strategy described above in so doing it resulted in rail ra tes to pnw ports from eastern north dakota costing less than from western north dakota in western north dakota there is competing railroad and it is farther from duluth and the mississippi river making these destinations cost prohibitive while this pricing strategy benefitted grain farmers in eastern north dakota it aggravated grain farmers in western north dakota source senate committee on commerce science and transportation field hearing entitled rail freight transportation in north dakota march 27 2002

united states usdaams november 2000 21 chilled meat requires tighter temperat ure specifications than frozen meatinland waterway infrastructure improvements may affect grain producers with waterway access versus those without access through differential pricing rail network can act as mechanism by which the competitive dynamics in one part of railroads service territory influence the rates charged to shippers located at other parts of the network differential pricing stems from the fact that railroads can charge higher price to customers whose demand for service is relatively price inelastic while charging less to customers w ho have other shipping options ie their demand is relatively elastic it means that rail shippers with the fewest alternatives for instance where truck or barge is not economically feasible pay higher portion of railroads fixed costs differential pricing has lot to do with how railroads pay for their infrastructure railroads primarily fi nance their infrastructure on their own therefore track maintenance nd construction is fixed cost in contrast trucks and barges finance their infrastructure through the payment of fuel taxes charged per gallon in addition to taxes on equipment in the case of trucks which are deposited into the federal highway trust fund thus for trucks and barges infrastructure is not fixed cost but variable cost their in frastructure costs vary in proportion to the amount of fuel they consume which is ge nerally in proportion to the amount of cargo they haul new logistics pattern utilizing containers refrigerated products as discussed above higher levels of domestic grain processing and offfarm livestock produc tion are responsible for increases in domestic grain transport while the export of bulk grain has remained flat in recent years bulk grains are also us ed as inputs in more highly processed farm products that are exported for instance part of the gr owth in domestic demand for feed grains is due to increased asian demand fo r livestock and poultry products20 frozen or chilled animal products are exported in refri gerated containers despite the long overland hauls to seaports large share of frozen and especially chilled meat product exports are moved by truck rather than ra ilroad because of the products high value and high service requirements in terms of transit time and temperature control21 to the extent this trend continues one can view it as the replacement of bulk grainexport movements by barge down the mississi ppi river to gulf ports with truck shipments of grain to domestic feed ts and subsequent truck movement of containerized meat exports to west coast ports per unit of weight the containerized transport system is more expensive than the bulk system and therefore tends to attract higher value agricultural products specialty grain varieties also small but growing quantity of grain is exported in containers about one milli on tons per year accounting for only about 1 of us grain production is exported in containers however recent spike in dry bulk ocean freight rates which have surged to their highest levels on record has increased interest in utilizing containers for exporting grain one study expects thathttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32720crs12 22 kimberly vachal tamara vanwechel heidi reichert us containerized grain oilseed exports industry

organically produced grains wheat with specific baking characteristics corn with hi gh protein content nd wheat that produces creamy colored noodlecontainerized grain shipping will grow to about 3 of us grain production over the next five years22 although it is still fledgling grain distribution channel it is worthy of inclusion when reviewing grain flow patterns because it has important implications for infrastruct ure investment decisions containerized grain exports follow logistics pattern separate from traditional bulk grain exports bulk grain can be aded into containers packaged in bags stacked on pallets or in raw bulk form us ing open top containers that have canvas tops and whose interiors are lined or have been sanitized utilizing containers the grain producer can control the shipment from the farm to final overseas destination rather than merely from the farm to the first elevator while grain exported in the bulk manner is treated by ocean carriers as fronthaul move containerized exports are treated as backhauls and are priced accordingly23 the persistent us merchandise trade deficit ma nifests itself in container shipping as the problem of having to ship empty containers back ove rseas to reduce the number of containers that have to be shipped back empty ocean lines typically reduce their rates for export shipments the rate differential between inbound and out bound shipments depends on the current trade imbalance in goods sh ipped in containers shipping lines may rate outbound shipments merely to recover the variable cost of shipping the container back rather than at remunerative rate thus us producers of relatively lower valued products which typically would not ship via contai ners can take advantage of the containerized trade imbalance however even thoug h outbound container rates are generally rated at discount it is still much less expensive to export grain by the traditional bulk method hence the small portion of grain that is exported in containers tends to be higherval ued and specialized grain varieties24 which are purchased in smaller quantities and must be kept separate often referred to as identitypreserved grain from the comin gling of product that occurs with the elevatorbased system also the cla ss i railroad promoti on of trainloadsize shipments in the elevatorbased system is incompatible with the shipping requirements of specialized grain markets while the containerbased system can facilitate this market grain exported in containers follows similar modal path as other containers originating from locations far inland tr uck will typically deliv er the container to the nearest intermodal rail ramp from where it moves by intermodal train to seaport ports in the pacific northwest are the leading gateways for containerized grain as asia is the largest purchaser of these productshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32720crs13 25 gao us grain transportation network needs system perspective to meet future

marine transportation infrastructure modespecific versus systemslevel perspective the process for making decisions on wher to target investment in transport infrastructure is largely mode specific railway investment decisions could be characterized as primarily marketdriven they are made in the private sector by the railroads themselves although some s hort line railroads may be either owned or subsidized by state departments of tran sportation road and waterway investment decisions could be characterized as primarily policydriven as they are made in the public sector state and local government s have primary responsibility for roadway investment decisions waterway infrastruct ure investment decisi ons are made at the federal level given the seemingly disjointed and disp ersed nature of this decision making process an issue for congress is whethe r to develop coordinated infrastructure investment strategy that supports the need s of an increasingly interconnected grain handling system the benefit of coordinated strategy is that it can lead to grain distribution system that allocates grain to the mode or modal combination best suited to particular shipments service require ments thereby reducin g the nations overall cost of shipping grain analyzing tr ansportation investment from supply chain perspective can lead to more coordinate d or integrated approach however an integrated strategy is difficult to develop because transportation is still largely administered and funded along modal lines gao report on grain transportation states efforts to improve grain trans portation tend to concentrate on individual transportation modes rather than on the tr ansportation network as whole and that without an integrated analysis that cons iders interrelationships between the various components of the grain transportation system implementin g wise policies is difficult25 although this gao report was written in 1981 its recommendation is less relevant today the high degree of intermodal functioning in todays grain supply chain essentially means that policy decisions affecting one mode affect all other modes any major capital project even if modespecific is likely to affect the interrelationship among all the freight m odes as well as their grain customers optimizing an individual component of the grain handling system without considering the whole system could merely divert traffic from one route to another without appreciably improving the performance of the overall system proposals for providing financial aid to s hort line railroads to upgrade their track illustrates the need for systemslevel perspective for instance the short line grant program prescribed in the senate version of the highway bill in the 108th congresshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32720crs14 s 1072 requires the dot to ensure the awar d of grant is justified by present and probable future demand for rail service by the railroad dete rmining which short lines have viable economic future largel depends on where the larger subterminal elevators are located where these larger elevators are located in turn is largely dependent on the routing decisions of th class i railroads the policy issue is whether financial aid to shor t line railroads can be succe ssful in preserving their service in light of market pressures for large volume rail shipping methods and the greater flexibility that trucking offers grain producers transportation efficiency and economic development in evaluating grain transportation inves tment choices it is important to define whether the objective is econo mic efficiency or economic development the supply chain perspective adopts econo mic efficiency as its prima ry criterion for evaluating investment choices however members of congress may also weigh local economic development as equally or more important than economic efficiency concerns when evaluating transportation funding choices promoting transportation efficiency on national scale and promoting local or regional economic deve lopment are often not compatible as exhibited in the bulk grain delivery system there is an economic incentive for bulk grain shippers and carri ers to pursue high volume logistics strategy this strategy consolidat grain handling operations around limited infrastructure in order to maximize the use of their fixed and mobile assets rural towns and remote communities located near elevators or rail lines that have been abandoned or seen reduction in business as result of this process are negatively affected legislators concerned with the economic development of these regions have desire to provide resources to these areas however consolidation in the grain delivery system means that some facilities will be aba ndoned and thus greater risk for public investment in these facilities or the infrastructure that provides links to these facilities some investment choices in the grainhandling network therefore involve trade off between national cern for transportation efficiency and local concern for economic development volumechain and valuechain as identified in this report three grain supply chains can be distinguished 1 export of bulk grain 2 bulk grain for the domestic market 3 and the export of containerized specialty grain products nd containerized refri gerated meat products in which grain was used as feed each of these supply chains are tied to their own infrastructure network the bulk export system relies most heavily on river navigation and class i railroad trunk lines to reach seaports the domestic bulk market relies more heavily on rural interstates or short line railroads to reach domestic processors and livestock farms the container export system relies heavily on interstate highways railr oad trunk lines and efficient intermodal interchanges at rail ramps and marine terminals an issue for policymakers is prioritiz ing limited public resources among these various supply chains in one sense the export supply chai ns involve choice between volume chain and value chain in terms of tonnage the bulk export system dominates but in terms of value the container export system gains morehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32720crs15 26 kimberly vachal tamara vanwechel heidi reichert us containerized grain oilseed exports industry survey july 2003 prepared for

in containers in 2002 but by valu over 52 of all agricultural trade was shipped by this method26 grain producers with access to the umriww navigation system particularly corn and soybean farmers that export much of their product via this system advocate investment in lock extensions they note that brazil and argentina are becoming increasingly competitive as global s uppliers of grain because of their lower production costs us competitiveness in this market they contend is highly dependent on the superior efficiency of the us inland transportation system to compete in the global marketplace these wate rway shippers argue that it is vital that the lock system be upgraded to accommoda the prevalent use of 1100 foot barge tows other observers noting the relatively w margins in the export of unprocessed bulk grain question whether winning this market does not in actuality mean losing they assert that wiser i nvestment strategy would be to focus on the infrastructure segments that support the relatively high er margin food products market these observers contend that the grain pro cessing and food manufacturing industries generate more jobs and income for rural communities than does the exportation of unprocessed bulk grain therefore if econo mic development is the policy goal they argue that investment in th infrastructure that supports the domestic or containerized export supply chains deserv careful consideration27 vehicle size and in frastructure demands competitive forces push grain carriers to move more grain move it faster with less assets and at lower cost this puts pressure on carriers to utilize larger vehicles railroads deploy longer trains using larger and heavier rail cars barges utilize longer tows and trucks maximize the size and weight of their trailers up to the legal limit while increasing vehicle capacity improves operating efficiency and reduces freight rates charged by particul ar mode the cost sa vings may be merely shifted on to others resulting in net benefit to society for instance heavier railcars require short line railr oads to upgrade their track beds and bridges to handle the new cars they in turn are seeking public aid from state and federal taxpayers to fund these upgrades while longer barg tows reduce barge co sts they also require lock extensions for efficient passage lf the construction cost for new locks are paid for by general taxpayers general taxpayers also pay all of the costs of maintaining the locks some trucking firms want to increase federal weight limits to 97000 pounds which would reduce truck ope rating costs but would increase road maintenance costs for other motorists and local taxpayers as well as for truckers if the additional infrastructure costs of larger vehicle size are born by others carriers can be expected to discount these costs when calculating the costs andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32720crs16 28 us dot federal highway cost allocation study august 1997 with addendum in may 2000 29 cbo paying for highways airways and wate rways how can users be charged may 1992 p 53benefits of deploying larger ve hicles in other words to the extent that infrastructure costs are external to carriers cost analysis their decisions regarding vehicle size will be biased in favor of larger vehicles thus potential issue for policymakers is whether infrastructure costs cannot be pa id for by the carriers to greater degree in order to more accurately reflect th additional costs of bigger vehicles who should pay for infrastructure improvements the discussion above raises the issue of the appropriate cost share arrangement between general taxpayers and system users for infrastructure improvements as mentioned earlier class i railroads primar ily finance their infrastructure on their own trucks pay for their infrastructure th rough fuel taxes and other fees although dot cost allocation study suggests that the heaviest trucks tend to underpay 80 of the costs they generate on the highwa system while other highway users tend to overpay28 barges also pay for their infrastructure via fuel tax but cbo study indicates that this user fee contributes only small fraction of the total cost of their infrastructure29 the continuing trend toward consolida tion in the grain delivery system raises the issue of whether the systems users who are increasingly fewer in number and larger in size shoul d not shoulder greater share of the cost burden for their infrastructure use in addition to an issue of fairness the level and manner in which user fees are assessed affects system efficiency some transportation economists assert that the fuelbased tax system used to finance highway and waterway infrastructure could be refined to include congestion tolls and other fees which would be more closely tied to the time and place of infrastructure use alternative pricing mechanisms they contend could maximize the throughput of existing highway and waterway infrastructure reducing the need to build additional infrastructure assessing competitive balances as described in this report the grainhandling system encompasses many market dynamics this report has focused on the competitive dynamics among transportation modes based on their operating characteristics among grain hauling modes competition is most fierce between trucking and short line railroads for shorter haul shipments and between barges and class i railroads for longer haul shipments of likely interest to transportation policymakers is the affect that infrastructure funding decisions coul d have on the competitive balance among modes if the interrelationship among th various components of supply chain are not examined or not quantif ied policies may work at crosspurposes for instance increasing truck weight limits while at the same time providing financial assistance to short line railroads would be mutually inconsistent similarly policymakers may consider the affect that the transition to larger railcars will have on future demand forhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32720crs17 barge transportation conversely they may consider to what extent the heavy draw from general treasury funds to finance rive r navigation is encouraging the railroad rationalization process or if it could require offsetting financial aid to railroads in the near future
