consideration most measures are called up by unanimous consent but when this consent cannot be obtained motion to proceed to consider is used sometimes senator other than the majority leader offers this motion but usually only in coordination with him and as his designee of 231 motions to proceed identified as offered in the senate from 1979 through 2000 only seven were offered other than by the major ity leader or at his direction none of these seven successfully resulted in consideration of the measure in question order code rs21255 updated september 15 2003 crs report for congress received through the crs web motions to proceed to consider in the senate who offers them richard s beth specialist in the legislative process government and finance division summary httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21255 in recent practice the senate generally concedes to its majority leader the prerogative of calling up measures for floor consideration most measures are called up by unanimous consent but when this consent cannot be obtained motion to proceed to consider is used sometimes senator other than the majority leader offers this motion but usually only in coordination with him and as his designee of 261 motions to proceed offered in the senate from 1979 through 2002 all but eight were evidently offered either by the majority leader or at his direction only one of the remaining eight successfully resulted in consideration of the measure in question this report will be updated at the end of each congress the motion to proceed and the senate agenda business may reach the floor of the senate for consideration in three ways pursuant to call of the calendar by unanimous consent or through agreement to motion to proceed to consider the formal calendar call has for several decades become disused and the motion to proceed to consider is normally used only when unanimous consent cannot be obtained as consequence most measures bills and resolutions today reach the floor by unanimous consent the number called up through motion to proceed to consider has not exceeded few dozen in any recent congress1 the measures called up by motion however are more likely to be controversial or highly contested senate rule viii paragraph 2 provides for the motion to proceed to consider measure or matter often called simply motion to proceed2 the rule places 1 items of executive business ie nominations and treaties are also called up by unanimous consent or through motions to proceed to consider this report however examines only motions to proceed to consider legislative business 2 us congress senate senate manual containing the standing rules orders laws and continued congressional research service the library of congress crs2 restrictions on who may offer the motion3 in the course of the twentieth century however the senate came increasingly to accord its majority leader the responsibility for arranging and implementing its floor agenda the senate nowadays normally concedes to the majority leader the prerogative of calling up measures either by motion or by unanimous consent in the absence of this deference it would become difficult for any majority leader to carry out the function of managing the schedule even in recent congresses nevertheless some motions to proceed have also been offered by other senators these actions suggest questions about how far senate deference to leadership scheduling efforts extends senators offering the motion to proceed most measures reach the senate floor by unanimous consent this consent may be granted in the form of either 1 simple request for unanimous consent that the senate proceed to consider the measure or 2 broader unanimous consent agreement that either specifies when the measure shall come before the senate or authorizes the majority leader to call it up at some subsequent point and also sets terms for its consideration if senator objects to such request especially simple unanimous consent request the httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21255 majority leader may then offer motion to proceed also if the leadership is aware that unanimous consent request would meet objection the motion to proceed may be offered without first making such request in contemporary senate practice requests for unanimous consent to consider measure especially broad unanimous consent agreements are most often propounded by the majority leader personally sometimes however especially in the case of simple consent requests they are offered by the majority whip or by another senator acting in coordination with and as the designee of the majority leader finally such request also may be offered by senator not acting in coordination with the majority leader but in that case the leader or senator acting for him will normally object to it thereby protecting majority party control of the floor agenda similarly motions to proceed to consider measures are most often offered by the majority leader personally but they also may be offered by the majority whip or another senator acting for the majority leader in addition senators have occasionally offered motions to proceed in the absence of direction or even consent from the majority leader the table on the following page displays the number of motions to proceed to consider offered by the majority leader the majority whip other

to be acting as designees of the majority leader unless the record of proceedings afforded positive evidence to the contrary in most such cases the proceedings offered positive evidence that the motion was offered by direction of the majority leader sometimes for example senators offering these motions stated explicitly that they were doing so on behalf of the majority leader in other cases the senator offering the motion also submitted petition for cloture on the motion that was signed among others by the majority leader on other occasions the senator offering the motion did so in the course of series of actions normally carried out by the majority leader or his designee senators offering motions to proceed to consider measures 96th107th congresses offered by congress majority

congress onward the motions to proceed accounted for in the table were identified through an electronic search of legislative status information in the congressional legislative information system for earlier congresses this database contains only limited legislative status information and motions to proceed in the 96th congress were identified instead through examination of crs4 the journal of the senate for all congresses information about who offered the motions was obtained from the congressional record and the journal of the senate sometimes more than one motion to proceed was offered on single measure this may occur if the senate fails to adopt the first motion or returns the measure to the calendar after some consideration and later takes it up again the table treats each motion to proceed separately in other words it shows the number of motions to proceed actually offered on bills and resolutions not the number of bills and resolutions on which motions to proceed were offered also the table includes motions to proceed not only to the initial consideration of measures but also to consider conference reports4 motions not offered by direction of the majority leader summary and context by the criteria noted during the 12 congresses studied only eight motions to proceed to consider could be identified as offered other than by direction of the majority leader of these eight motions four were offered by the minority leader and three by other minority party senators also seven of the eight motions were offered under the general rules of the senate while the eighth was offered pursuant to httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21255 statute establishing an expedited procedure that makes privileged the consideration by the senate of specified measure such as resolution of approval or disapproval5 only one of these eight motions ultimately succeeded in bringing about consideration of the measure in question three of the eight were tabled two were ruled out of order and one received further action after the senate voted not to invoke cloture on it the one offered by majority party senator was adopted but this action was immediately afterwards vitiated by unanimous consent the one offered pursuant to an expedited procedure was adopted and the senate proceeded to final disposition of the measure comparable data on the dispositions of motions to proceed offered by or in coordination with the majority leader have not been comprehensively compiled normally however few motions to proceed are defeated outright because motion unlikely to command majority support would not likely be offered in the first place instead most of those not adopted never reach final vote some fail to reach vote because the senate ultimately agrees to take up the measure by unanimous consent in other cases for example filibuster prevents vote from occurring or the motion is either displaced by subsequent action or withdrawn 4 the motion to proceed to consider measure is normally debatable except under certain special circumstances the motion to proceed to consider conference report an item of executive business measure subject to an expedited procedure or another privileged matter is generally not debatable this report does not consider which of the motions to proceed it examines were debatable or nondebatable 5 motion to proceed may also be offered pursuant to statute that establishes procedures for expedited consideration of specific measure such as resolution of approval or disapproval in general these statutes too place formal restriction on who may offer the motion to proceed for information on these expedited procedures see crs report 98888 fasttrack or expedited procedures their purposes elements and implications by christopher m davis crs5 similarly this report does not attempt to present data on unanimous consent requests to consider measures or the frequency with which different senators propound them motions not offered by direction of the majority leader the following paragraphs describe the eight motions to proceed to consider that were not offered by direction of the majority leader each description identifies the measure number and subject the congress and date of action and the disposition of the motion to proceed with citation to the congressional record and where available senate journal each description also notes any special circumstances surrounding the motion to proceed and any subsequent action on the measure this additional information was drawn principally from the record and the legislative status database of the legislative information system of congress sconres 119 96th congress on september 25 1980 the senate minority leader moved to proceed to consider sconres 119 revising the congressional budget

already been called up pursuant to action by the senate majority leader two cloture motions had been offered on it and the first cloture motion had been rejected subsequently the senate rejected the second cloture motion on the conference report and the cloture motion on the motion to proceed to consider it thereafter the senate did not further consider either the conference report or motion to proceed to consider it crs6 s 2944 101st congress on october 27 1990 majority party senator moved to proceed to consider s 2944 for aid to democratization in eastern europe the senate agreed to the

section 115 of the nuclear waste policy act of 1982 pl 97425 42 usc 10135 and the motion to proceed was offered as privileged under that act although the act explicitly provides that any member of the senate may move to proceed to consider resolution of repository siting approval opponents of the measure had argued that the same deference should be granted to the majority leader in making this motion as in making motions to proceed under the standing rules although the act provides that this motion to proceed be privileged and nondebatable unanimous consent agreement was reached that 1 the motion be debatable for four hours and thirty minutes and 2 if the motion were agreed to the senate would immediately vote without further debate or amendment on the companion measure already passed by the house hjres 876 following the debate on the motion to proceed the senate agreed to it 60 to 39 then adopted hjres 87 by voice vote thereby clearing the measure for presentation to the president congressional record daily ed vol 148 pp s6444s6491 6 this unusual modification of statutory procedure was apparently intended to preclude possible attempt by opponents to disrupt the statutory timetable by amending the joint resolution
