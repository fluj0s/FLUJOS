domesticallymined coal when it is sold by the producer to the first purchaser the producer is liable for the tax but may pass it along to others through an increase in the coals purchase price thus it is possible that the producer does not actually bear the burden of the tax1 the constitutions export clause states that tax or duty shall be laid on articles exported from any state2 nonetheless the coal excise tax was imposed on coal destined for export in 1998 federal district court held that the tax on such coal clearly violated the export clause3 in 2000 the irs acquiesced and stopped imposing the tax on coal that was in the stream of export when sold by the producer and actually exported4

tax may file for refund from the irs the claim must be made within three years from the time the excise tax return was filed or two years from the time the tax was paid whichever is later 5 the producer that paid the tax has first claim to any refund6 exporters may claim refunds only if the person who paid such tax ie the producer waives his claim to such amount7 taxpayer filing refund claim

that reclamation fee imposed by the surface mining control and reclamation act of 1977 on exported coal violates the export clause the reclamation fee is based on each ton of coal produced by surface and underground mining 30 usc 1232a the coal producers and exporters argue that coal produced refers to the process of extracting and selling coal and therefore the imposition of the fee on coal sold to foreign purchasers violates the export clause the government argues that the term only refers to the extraction and not the sale of coal in june 2008 the court of appeals for the federal circuit

brought suits under the export clause seeking damages from the united states in the amount of unconstitutional coal excise taxes they paid they brought the suits in the court of federal claims arguing that it had jurisdiction to hear them under the tucker act that act grants the court jurisdiction over any claim against the united states founded either upon the constitution or any act of congress or any regulation of an executive department or upon any express or implied contract with the united states or for liquidated or unliquidated damages in cases not sounding in tort10 taxpayers used these suits as way to bypass two limitations in the irc refund process first the tucker act has longer statute of limitationssix years from the time the tax is paid11than the irc this allowed taxpayers to seek damages for taxes paid in the several years preceding the years for which they could receive irc refunds cond the tucker act unlike the irc does not give priority to producers claims thus it potentially allowed parties farther down the supply chain eg exporters to bring claims alleging they deserved damages because they bore the economic burden of the tax threshold issue has been whether the court of federal claims could hear these suits the tucker act only confers jurisdictionit does not create any substantive right enforceable against the united states for money damages 12 thus the substantive right must be found in another source of law13 one question has been whether the export clause provides right to monetary damages when the government violates it if the answer is yes related question has been whether such claim could be made indepe ndently of an irc refund claim if not then taxpayers would need to meet the ircs more stringent requirements in cyprus amax coal co v united states 14 the court of appeals for the federal circuit addressed the jurisdictional question the courts holding had two components the first was that the export clause was moneymandating provision as required for tucker act jurisdiction15 the second was that cause of action founded in violation of the export clause was self executing16 this meant the clause provided separate cause of action so that taxpayer could bring suit for damages independent of an irc administrative refund claim in later case the court clarified that the export clause was not moneymandating provision for all parties seeking coal excise tax refunds17 in that case the court held that the tucker act did not provide 9 see irc 7422a 6532a 10 28 usc 1491a1 11 see 28 usc 2501 venture coal sales co v united

alleged it had paid the tax through higher coal prices but did not directly pay the tax to the government after the cyprus amax decision answered the question of its jurisdiction under the tucker act the court of federal claims heard several cases brought by coal brokers and ultimate purchasers that it dismissed due to lack of constitutional standing18 to have standing plaintiff must allege personal injury fairly traceable to the defendants allegedly unlawful conduct and likely to be redressed by the requested relief 19 the parties alleged that they were injured by the governments unconstitutional imposition of the coal excise tax because the burden of the tax was shifted to them by coal producers charging higher prices for coal the court of federal claims found the requisite causal relationship between this injury and the governments action to be lacking this was because it was the independent actions of the producers that determined whether the parties paid any amount of the unconstitutional tax as noted the federal circuit court of appeals also raised barrier to claims by nonproducer parties by holding there was tucker act jurisdiction to hear the claim of an ultimate purchaser who did not actually pay the tax to the government 20

states v clintwood elkhorn mining co 21 the supreme court held that taxpayers seeking refunds for the unconstitutionally imposed coal excise tax must comply with the irc refund process the taxpayers in that case had filed administrative refund claims for the three tax years open under the ircs statute of limitations and filed suit in the court of federal claims seeking the amount of taxes paid for th three previous years that were open only under the tucker acts longer limitations period the court of appeals for the federal circuit had allowed their suit and denied the governments request to reverse its cyprus amax holding22 the appeals court said that the issue of whether taxpayers could bring suit under the export clause without complying with the irc refund scheme had been fully aired in cyprus amax and it could discern basis for reopening this question23 the supreme court in unanimous decision held that the plain language of the relevant irc provisions 7422 and 651124

limitations was simply an outside limit which congress could shorten in situations requiring special considerations such as tax refunds because suits against the united states for the recovery of taxes impeded effective administration of the revenue laws26 the court noted that it had explained in that case that the ircs refund provisions would have meaning whatever if taxpayers who did not comply with those provisions could still bring refund suits under the tucker act27 the court did not address whether the export clause provided cause of action that could be brought under the tucker act finding that the irc refund provisions would apply regardless of the answer to that question28 noting that it was clear from its past cases that unconstitutionally collected taxes could be subject to the same administrative requirements as other taxes the court rejected the taxpayers argument that something unique about the export clause required different treatment29 the court explained that while the government may not impose unconstitutional taxes it may create an administrative process to refund such taxes because of its exceedingly strong interest in financial stability regardless of whether the tax violated the export clause or some other provision of the constitution30 the court also rejected the taxpayers claim that the irc refund scheme could not apply to facially unconstitutional taxes finding the plain language of irc 7422 clearly included such taxes31 there appear to be two primary impacts of the courts decision in clintwood elkhorn the first is that taxpayers seeking refunds for the unconstitutionallyimposed coal excise tax must file refund claims with the irs subject to the ircs limitations thus taxpayers are subject to the shorter statute of limitations and nonproducer parties ma only seek refund if the producer who paid the tax has waived its right to the refund second the courts analysis seems broadly applicable to refund claims in general including those based on violations of other constitutional provisions 32

shipment through means other than by an exporter that met the proposals requirements to file claim producer with favorable court judgment related to the ex cise taxs constitutionality would be deemed to meet this requirement an exporter would have to establish that it exported coal to foreign country or shipped it to us possession or ca used such export or shipment additionally the producer or exporter would need to 1 have filed return between october 1 1990 and the date of the acts enactment 34 and 2 file claim for the refund within 30 days of the enactment the treasury secretary would have to determine whether the refund requirements were met within 180 days of claim being filed and pay an refund owed with interest within 180 days of that determination refunds to producers would equal the amount of coal excise tax paid on the exported or shipped coal minus any amount paid pursuant to favorable court judgment mentioned above refunds to exporters would equal 0825 per ton of exported or shipped coal refund claims could only be made for coal exported or shipped between october 1 1990 and the date of the acts enactment refund would be allowed if one had already been made to any taxpayer or there was final settlement between the government and producer party related to the producer or exporter the senate bill states it would not give producers or exporters standing to commence or intervene in each others judicial or administrative refund claim proceedings the house bill does not include such provision it appears the bills proposed refund process would have three significant impacts first taxpayers would be able to seek refunds for taxes paid in years not open under current law the supreme courts holding in clintwood elkhorn makes clear that current law requires that refund claim be filed within three years from the time the excise tax return was filed or two years from the time the tax was paid whichever is later the bills would allow refunds relating to coal exported or shipped as early as october 1990 so long as the taxpayer filed refund claim within 30 days of the provisions enactment and met the other requirements second the bills could expand the opportunity for exporters to claim refunds beyond that available under current law so long as they are able to meet the requirements third the bills would impose short time limits for the taxpayers and irs to act on the refund claims thus they would encourage quick resolution of the claims although administrative issues could arise due to the requirement that refunds not be paid twice on the same coal and their silence on the issue of contestability g3g158g157g145g152g155g561g5g152g151g157g138g140g157g561g11g151g143g152g155g150g138g157g146g152g151g561 erika lunder legislative
