market structure of the video programming industry and emerging public policy issues july 28 2003 charles b goldfarb specialist in industrial organization and telecommunications resources science and industry divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32027market structure of the video programming industry and emerging public policy issues summary the video programming industry has underg one fundamental structural change in the past 15 years about 80 percent of us households subscribe to cable or satellite systems offering multiple channels of programming these alternatives to broadcast television now attract more than half the tota l viewing audience although broadcast television still attracts majo rity of viewers during primetime when popular broadcast network fare is aired another seismic change is that movie producers receive more than twice as much revenue from video stores as they do from movie theaters at the same time there has been widespread vertical and horizontal integration in the video progra mming i ndustry the industry is increasingly dominated by small number of firms that finance the development of new programming through wide variety of arrangements with conten t providers including joint ventures and direct ownership own extensive libraries of existing programming own variety of distribution channels for bringing c ontent to the public and also own retail pipelines such as local broadcast stati ons and video store chains and currently proposed direct broa dcast satellite system these fundamental changes in the mark et structure affect the public policy issues that congress faces today there are more pipelines into the home and more distribution networks than ever before but small number of big media players control large portion of both programming and distribution questions are starting to arise about how well the existing fcc ownership rules which tend to focus on horizontal relationships involving only br oadcast technology address the impact of consolidated ownership of programming and distribution across broadcast cable and satellite technologies on the public interest goals of diversity competition and localism and whether new rules that more directly recognize the new market structure could or should be formulated that woul d better serve those goals the purpose of this report is to provide brief description of the current video industry market structure nd to explain how the various industry segments are interrelated given the successful entr of new technologies and the complex structure of many integrated media companies the relationships across functional and technological segments of the industry ar complex crs report rl32026 explains how and why underlying market forces as well as some governme nt regulations and

industry and emerging public policy issues introduction the video programming industry is majo r force in american society both as an important provider of ne ws information and entertai nment and as an economic engine in itself annual industry revenues exceed 136 b illion1 more than 75 billion of these come from direct paymen ts by households approximately 687 per household per year and the remainder from advertisers as shown in figure 1 the video progra mming industry consists of three major functional segments content providers these are th program producers the major motion picture and television production studios independent studios producers writers and editors and also the programming departments of local television stations and some cable systems that produce their own local news programs these providers also include the film and television program libraries of existing content that offer an alternative to newly created programming program distributors and packagers these are the broadcast and cable networks the syndicators of firstrun and rerun programming the movie distributors that package and distribute films and the distributors of vide cassettes and dvds they often perform marketing and advertising services on national scale that could not be performed as efficiently by th content providers or the retail pipelines retail pipelines these are the br

small players with minimal market impact for example multichannel multipoint distribution service mmds systems sometimes referred to as wireless cable transmit video programming and other services to approximately 700000 subscribers through 2ghz microwave frequencies but these systems are losing subscribers primarily serv legacy customers and are not significant competitors 3 horizontal

been introduced in the 108th congress that reflect ra nge of positions on several of these rules20 in addition to the ownership rule s there are federal laws and rules that directly regulate conduct

the rapid and significant technologyinduced market changes that have occurred this past decade some of these ownership nd conduct rules apply to some competitors but not to others or are having

viewers especia lly those who do not want their children to view such programming in addition hb and other premium channels package their hit programs on dvd for sale or rental the differential in

unique success in capturing larger if falling audiences than their cable and satellite competitors from 1990 to 2000 the broadcast television networks were able to increase the quan tity of primetime comme rcials aired by 164 percent from an average of 7 minutes and 47 seconds per hour to an average of 9 minutes and 3 seconds and also to obtai n on average 38 annual increases in the rates cost per thousand they charged advertisers43 however broadcast televi sion suffers one technology driven disadvantage visa vis cable and satellite television because it is not technologically or economically viable to charge viewers directly for broadcast programming broadcasters are entirely dependent on advertis ing revenues but adver tising revenues are far more cyclical subject to downturns in the ec onomy than direct cable or satellite fees on viewers and therefore broadcasters are hurt more by slowing economy44 the four major networks provide their owned stations and affiliates with more than 20 hours of programming per week th smaller networks provide less in exchange networks obtain the right to sell the bulk of the advertising time during the periods when their shows are airing45 most affiliates also receive fee called compensation from the networks that f ee varies significantly depending on the situation in the local market and is the subject of very hard bargaining since network programming attract s much larger audiences than most nonnetwork programming affiliates are able to charge much more for their spot advertising accompanying network programming than they would be able to absent that program this strengthens the networks bargaining hands also where there are more local television stations in the market than netw orks with which to affiliate the networks are in relatively strong negotiating position visavis the local stations and therefore can negotiate low compensation payments or even on occasion require the local station to pay them compensation to affiliate in contrast in markets with few local stations the local stations are in stronger negotiating position than the networks another parameter in the relationship between broadcast networks and affiliates is the degree of discretion affiliates have to preempt the broadcast feed to offer local programming local affiliates may at times prefer to offer local sports or

346 both the profits and the cash flow of commercial television stations were positive for every market size in 2000 and were pecially robust for stations in large markets this is consistent with the testimony at recent senate commerce committee hearings in which representatives of both broadcast networks and local broadcast stations agreed that local stations in medium and large markets enjoy profits as percentage of revenues in the range of 20 to 50 percent47 fcc staff compared the data for 2000 to data for 1990 and concluded that it appears that cash flow margins for the average station have increased over the past decade in every category but one profits and prof it margins are up in 2000 ov er 199048 b contrast both the authors of the fcc study nd the participants in the senate hearing agreed that broadcast television networks are not particularly profitable and the newer networks definitely ar losing money presumably if this differential between station and network profitability continues the networks will attempt to renegotiate their affiliation agreements either to reduce the compensation they pay affiliates or to increase the amount of advertising time they retain for themselves to obtain national adver tising revenues the broadcast networks and broadcast st ations face the same competitive threat from the multichannel systems and share the incentive to continue to create the popular programming needed to retain the large audiences valued by advertisers moreover although the broadcast stations are more profitable than the broadcast networks today all

share from 265 percent of total syndicated revenues in 1992 to 424 percent in 200155 though as cable networks continue their current pattern of producing more original programming cable demand for syndicated programming may decline the local broadcaster or cable network pays for the programming and keeps all the advertising revenues it is able to generate it is very difficult for syndicators to break into the mark et for firstrun programming with the development of fox upn and wb networks there are very few local broadcast stations not affiliated with broadcast network and therefore the size

of the four major networks66 to obtain this must have programming they must negotiate retransmission consent agreement with the local broadcast station in recent years some local broadcast stations have come under the same ownership as many cable networks the parents companies of each broadcast television network also own local television st ations and cable networks and in their negotiations with local cable systems frequently have required those systems to carry all of their cable networks in order to get permission to carry their local broadcast signals67 at the other extreme especially in markets with many local broadcast stations some of the small independent broadcast stations may not have large audience shares and the local cable systems may not want to carry those stations but since more than 65 percent of tv households r eceive their local broadcast signals via cable and therefore are unlikely to have antennas or other equipment needed to receive broadcast signals over the air if these i ndependent stations are not carried on the local cable system they will have very difficult time reaching any audience congress therefore has imposed must carry obligation on local cable systems requiring them to carry the signals of all local stations who make their signals available without charge68 although most local cable and satellite systems now have capacity to carry 80 or more networks with more than 300 existing cable networks it is becoming increasingly difficult for new networks to get onto systems as startups in business with high upfront production cost s they face even more directly than existing networks the need to get onto as many local cable systems as possible as quickly as possible one strategy that ne w networks have used is to offer their programming to msos and local cable syst ems without charging any per subscriber license fee or even paying the cable systems to carry their programming this limits the cable networks revenues to
