unavailable key distinction between mandatory nd discretionary spending involves how these two categories of spending are tr eated in the budget process congress generally controls spending on mandatory programs by setting rules for eligib ility benefit formulas and other parameters rather than pproving specific dollar amounts for these programs each year eligibility fo r mandatory programs is usually written into authorizing law and any individua l or entity that m eets the ligibility requirements is entitled to the benefits authorized by the law spending for discretionary programs is controlled by annual appropr iations acts the thirteen subcommittees of the house and senate appropriations committees originate bills each year which decide how much funding to devote to continuing current activities as well as any new discretionary programs fy2003 agriculture appropriations action administrations request as the first step in the fy2003 appropriations process the bush adminis

finance the spending of ongoing programs such as farm comm odity price and income support activities including annual direct and countercyclical paymen ts and milk income loss contract payments and va rious agricultural conservati on and trade programs the ccc has also been the funding source for large portion of emergency supplemental spending over the years particularly for adhoc farm disaster payments and direct market loss payments to growers of various commodities which have been provided in response to low farm commodity prices the ccc must eventually repay the funds it borrows from the treasury but because the ccc never earns more than it spends its losses must be replenished periodically through cong ressional appropriati on so that its 30 billion borrowing authority debt limit is not depleted which would render the corporation unable to function congress generally provides th is infusion through the regular annual usda appropriation law because of th degree of difficulty in estimating its funding needs which is complicated by crop and weather conditions and other uncontrollable variables the ccc in recent years has received current indefinite appropriation which in effect allows the ccc to receive such sums as are necessary during the fiscal year for previ ous years losses and current years losses indefinite appropriations have become more common for the ccc in
