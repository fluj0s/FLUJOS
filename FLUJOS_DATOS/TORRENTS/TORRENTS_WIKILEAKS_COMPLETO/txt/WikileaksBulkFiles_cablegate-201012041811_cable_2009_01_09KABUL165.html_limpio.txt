petraeus jan 20 meeting with president karzai classified by ambassador william b wood us embassy kabul reasons 14 b and d summary 1s on january 20 centcom commander petraeus accompanied by ambassador wood and centcom staff met with president karzai and his senior national security staff indiapakistan 2s petraeus asked karzai to urge india not to curtail its cooperation with pakistan india would never have more positive pakistani leadership than zardari gailani kiayani and pasha and in spite of the difficulties now was the time to try to make progress in the relationship karzai said the us should urge china to press pakistan over whom they had great influence to cooperate with afghanistan and with india he noted that the indians were prepared to offer afghanistan light attack helicopters short discussion followed highlighting the adverse reaction in pakistan to indian provision of military equipment to afghanistan civilian casualties and afghan participation in special ops 3s president karzai raised the civilian casualty issue petraeus assured him that the us was taking every step to minimize civilian casualties for both humane and policy reasons he noted the importance of the new tactical directive petraeus cited recent reports by the respected afghan independent human rights commission that clearly put the onus on the terrorists for civilian casualties although it also called for more thorough and transparent investigation of allegations by the coalition 4s petraeus noted that the increase of 30000 us troops next year would also increase combat leading to the possibility of increased civilian casualties in the short term president karzai asked if we really knew who we were fighting petraeus was categorical that we had confidence in our intelligence and believed we knew who the enemy was karzai said that afghans were suspicious of the us because of the situation in helmand the tribes must back you8 he said and that does not mean recreating tribal militias 5s petraeus noted that karzai had not acted on our request for 100 afghans to accompany our special operations forces on night raids karzai argued that 100 afghans would not give afghanistan meaningful control over the operation but would force them to take responsibility when mistake was made he promised to study the issue further and called for greater afghan participation in both the selection of targets and the implementation of operations petraeus suggested that on pilot project basis we might consider putting more afghans with one of our special strike forces so that they could in reality conduct the operation he emphasized the importance that the us should remain in position to conduct afteraction site exploitation for intelligence purposes 6s karzai raised the issue of the use of dogs in house raids he said it was unacceptable in the afghan culture and was used by taliban propaganda to undermine support for the coalition and the government interior minister atmar with karzais support argued that if afghans were allowed to be first through the door they we prepared to run the risk of not using dogs in order to respect cultural sensitivities afghan taliban 7s karzai raised the quetta shura he said that afghans didnt understand why the us was making such an effort inside of afghanistan but was failing to go after the taliban in quetta they thought either the us has been deceived by pakistan or there was some secret deal not to go after the quetta shura because pakistan was more important to the us than afghanistan he stressed the need to be able to go back to the afghan people and make it clear that the us was serious about defeating afghanistans enemies 8s petraeus assured karzai that we considered the afghan taliban an important enemy which we were confronting in every way we could he underlined our vital national interest in preventing global terrorism from ever again using afghanistan as launching pad karzai nodded affirmatively throughout the generals presentation and said that the people of afghanistan wanted to see more clearly that the us would not allow afghanistan to be base for terrorism again relations with new administration 9s karzai raised recent critical statements attributed to senator clinton but said he was enthusiastic about his relationship with her karzai stressed the need for us to address frankly our problems with each other and respond seriously to the concerns of each side he praised the visit of secretary gates shortly after the shindand incident in august and said that the visit had served to completely defuse the shindand incident 10s early in the discussion petraeus said that he would be returning to washington for first meeting with president obama and offered to convey message from karzai karzai returned to the message throughout the discussion highlighting the need for mutual respect and cooperation the need to resolve the civilian casualties issue and increase afghan participation in special operations and tougher line on sanctuaries in pakistan 2009 11s in conclusion karzai said that 2009 would be difficult and important year additional troops would make big difference successful elections would be crucial other comments 12s karzai then invited other afghan participants at the table to make comments minister of defense wardak called for increased coordination in the battle space especially with the proliferation of the additional forces and additional players he also argued for the eventual further increase of the national army beyond the planned 134000 13s foreign minister spanta expressed concern about the fragmentation of the international community and urged the us to play more active role in making development assistance more coherent he said that the target should not simply be to rebuild afghanistan but to genuinely increase aid effectiveness 14s minister of interior atmar said that it was important that our two constituencies the afghan public and the us public be able to see the two allies united and able to solve problems between them he said there was still strong support for the american presence he stressed the need 1 to strengthen afghan government institutions including the police 2 to make clear that the us cares for the wellbeing of afghan citizens and 3 to take meaningful action against the sanctuaries against the taliban in pakistan 15s nds director saleh simply noted the need for larger nds and asked for us support wood
