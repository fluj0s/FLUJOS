shortterm budget estimates while critical for program administration and congressional spending decisions provide partial and potentially misleading impression of the federal governments fiscal situation on the other hand longterm measures have their own limitations on the positive side they indicate the magnitude of longterm budget imbalances resulting from the gap between future federal tax revenues and the costs of providing retirement and health care for the babyboom generation however longterm projections are subject to substantial uncertainties for two reasons first statistical theory implies that expected forecasting error is larger for moredistant events because errors accumulate over each period into the future second the structure of the economy changes over time so that assumptions based on the past behavior of the economy may not hold in the future thus shortterm measures which are relatively certain but which ignore future imbalances must be used in conjunction with longterm measures which indicate the size of future imbalances but with more variability in order to gain an accurate picture of the fiscal challenges facing the fede ral government longrun fiscal projections depend on determinants of economic growthsuch as productivity and increases in capital stock and labor forceand the growth of health care costs this report describes and analyzes several meas ures of the longterm fiscal condition of the federal government the strengths and limitations of longterm shortterm and mediumterm fiscal measures are discussed the report then provides an overview of the federal governments longterm fiscal situation most independent analysts believe the federal governments fiscal position is more accurately summarized by projections that modify the congressional budget office baseline by assuming the reach of the alternative minimum tax amt will be capped at present levels that tax cuts slated to expire in 2010 will in fact be extended and that discretionary spending will keep pace with overall economic growth seventyfiveyear projections employing these alternative assumptions put the longterm fiscal gap between revenues and spending at 78 of gross domestic product gdp fiscal gap is defined as the size of the immediate and permanent increase in tax revenues or decrease in noninterest expenditures needed to ensure that the public debt to gdp ratio at the end of the budget window is the same as the initial public debt to gdp ratio these modifiedbaseline projections indicate that putting federal fiscal policy on sustainable path for the next 75 years requires substantial increases in taxes decreases in spending or both changes needed to maintain permanently sustainable fiscal stance would be even greater this report will be updated as events warrant httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33623g14g152g151g144g556g22g142g155g150g561g15g142g138g156g158g155g142g156g561g152g143g561g8g146g156g140g138g149 g561g11g150g139g138g149g138g151g140g142g561

stretch far into the future nevertheless the overwhelming focus of federal fiscal policy is short term in nature discussions of federal fiscal policy typically center on deficits in the current fiscal year or 10year budget windows shortterm accounting or budget measures however provide only partial view of the costs of federal programs and policies and they frequently offer potentially misleading view of the federal governments ability to pay its bills in the long term shortterm measures such as annual budget estimates or mediumterm measures such as the congressional budget office cbo 10year baseline estimates do not reflect longterm fiscal imbalances and in particular they do not reflect the large anticipated costs needed to finance the babyboom generations retirement therefore if short and mediumterm measures are not used in conjunction with long term fiscal measures then longterm fiscal effects of current policy will be understated or hidden budget measures are useful to the extent they permit governments and their citizens to make better decisions economic theory suggests that budget deficits can be useful tool to smooth out shortrun fluctuations so that households are not subjected to sharp fluctuations in taxes and program benefits in the long run however budgets must balance furthermore deficits that persist beyond the short run will redistribute wealth among generations and will thus have important distributional consequences in additi on most economists believe longterm deficits have important negative effects on capital accumulation and economic growth therefore long term budget measures provide valuable information about intergenerational equity and about prospects for longterm economic growth investors use both income statements which show cash flows in given year and balance sheets which show assets and liabilities to understand businesss financial condition similarly understanding governments fiscal position requires more than one set of accounts 1 longterm projections or measures are particularly importa nt for understanding the growth of entitlement programs where the full consequences of policy decisions take decades to emerge government programs and tax law provisions often have effects that stretch well beyond the end of standard budget windows that being said it is also tr ue that shortrun budget estimates have the advantage of providing far more detail furthermore shortterm forecasting which exploits momentum in economic activity to predict future economic indicators gives more reliable estimates than longrun forecasting which depends on the presumption that key economic parameters will match historical values or values considered reasonable by analysts

estimates such as the 10year cbo budget outlook projections another approach has been to develop forwardlooking summary measures of federal fiscal policy while the federal debt is the sum total of all deficits net of surpluses from the beginning of the us government to the present these forwardlooking summary measures reflect aggr egate deficits over the next 50 or 75 years or even over the infinite future 1 for an overview of federal government accounting see government accountability office understanding the primary components of the annual financial report of the us government

traditional macroeconomic analysis has focused on the annual budget deficit as the measure of the governments fiscal stance however the annual budget deficit estimates provide limited and potentially misleading information for several reasons first while the consequences of government spending and tax policies extend well into the future annual deficit numbers only give information about cash flows for single year for example government sale of an incomeproducing asset reduces the deficit in one year and increases deficits in future years deciding whether the sale is penny wise in the short run but pound foolish in the long term or not requires multiyear budget informati on mediumterm budget estimates such as 5year and 10year budget projections can provide more information about future taxes and spending and give better guide to the total effects of changes in fiscal policy than annual deficit estimates 2 however if the effects of policy change extend beyond the end of mediumterm budget window then longerterm measure will be needed mediumterm projections provide an accurate pictur of fiscal policy only when conditions in the years beyond the medium term resemble years within the medium term for this reason medium term budget estimates currently provide misleadingly optimistic impression of the financial condition of entitlement programs such as social security and medicare the babyboom generations retirement and rising costs of medical care signal the federal governments fiscal position will worsen substantially after the next decade unless significant changes are made this deterioration in the federal governments finances does not show up in 10year budget projections such as the cbo baseline projections g22g145g142g561g5g4g17g561g4g138g156g142g149g146g151g142g561 the cbo baseline projections by law section 257 of the balanced budget and emergency deficit control act of 1985 estimate the fiscal consequences of current laws and policies and are meant to serve as neutral benchmark to assess the probable fiscal consequences of new laws or changes in programs the cbo baseline projects 10year trajectory of the future fiscal effects of current law it is not intended to anticipate future policy or legislative responses 3 current law is not the same as the current situation current law may include provisions that take effect many years in the future and which may bring about conditions far different from the current situation current law specifies that some future policies that some analysts consider implausible will be implemented in particular independent analysts focus on three assumptions widely considered to be unrealistic first discretionary spending is assumed to continue at constant inflationadjusted level that does not reflect growth in population and per capita income projected discretionary spending as proportion of gdp falls by the end of the baselines 10year window to levels unprecedented in modern times 4 according to the cbo baseline defense spending will fall from 4 in 2005 to 3 of gdp in 2016 the same as the historical minimum reached in 1999 the baseline nondefense discretionary spending total drops from 38 to 29 2 many would argue that the rules governing cbo baseline forecasts reduce their usefulness as realistic guide to federal fiscal policy this point is discussed in the next section 3 in the words of 19th century english accountant governments fiscal courses will foreshadow certain ends to which if persevered in they must lead but if the courses be departed from the ends will change 4 for details see the cbo brief what is currentlaw economic baseline june 2005

which was the lowest level in the past four decades5 figure 1 shows historical data for 1987 thr ough 2005 and cbo baseline projections for 2006 through 2016 for defense and nondefense discretionary spending nondefense discretionary spending has risen as share of gdp in the years leading up to 2006 defense spending has risen even more sharply according to the cbo baseline discretionary spending will decline after 2006 while the cbo baseline assumption of constant discretionary spending in real terms provides reasonable benchmark for determining what is or what is not spending increase it is not plausible basis for predicting the actual path of spending most independent analysts assume discretionary spending will grow at the same rate as gdp second the current law cbo baseline projects that individual income tax revenues will rise sharply in coming years due to the effects of the alternative minimum tax most independent analysts believe that changes will be enacted to limit revenues collected by the amt to levels far below cbo baseline projections the number of taxpayers subject to the amt has grown in recent years because the amt is not indexed to keep pace with inflation 6 in addition the 2001 economic growth and tax relief reconciliatio n act egtrra pl 10716 and the 2003 jobs and growth tax relief reconciliation act jgtrra pl 10827 reduced taxes under the regular income tax so that many uppermiddleclass households were suddenly subject to amt provisions congress has enacted series of oneyear fixes of the amt that increased exemptions and changed treatment of certain tax credits 7 however the cbo baseline assumes that the amt fix will expire at the end of 2006 so if congress does not act the proportion of taxpayers subject to amt provisions will continue to grow the cbo estimates that about 2 million taxpayers paid higher taxes due to the amt in fiscal year fy 2002 and around 30 million taxpayers will pay more in fy2010 under current law 8 further under current law which assumes the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts expire more than 22 of filers in 2016 will be subject to the amt according to projections9 if the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts are extended about 32 of filers in 2016 will be subject to the amt10 this implies that political pressure to extend amt fixes will be substantial 5 projections were taken from the cbo report the budget and economic outlook

potter 2003 assume in future years 3 of taxpayers will be subject to the amt which was the proportion in 2005 the cbo longterm forecasts which are not constrained by baseline assumptions assume that tax revenues will rise over the next eight years from current levels to 183 of gdp for its lower revenues scenarios whereas in the higher revenues scenarios revenues are calculated using current law assumptions regarding individual income taxes the government accountability office gao makes explicit assumption about the amt but assumes tax revenues will be limited to 197 of gdp beginning in 2016 as practical matter without radical changes in the income tax system this would be possible only with some cap on the amt third most independent analysts have assumed th bush tax cuts and other tax provisions with minor exceptions will not expire as scheduled under current law 11 the 2001 2002 2003 and 2004 tax cuts according to current law are scheduled to expire by the beginning of 201112 the bush administration has sought to make these provisions permanent and many analysts therefore believe fiscal projections should reflect that intention several other provisions of the tax law

impact of revenue and mandatory spending during the 10year period used for cost estimates and pays less attention to the longerrange costs of such legislation the budgetary impact of revenue and mandatory spending legislation considered in the house and senate generally is assessed for period encompassing the fiscal year in progress the current year and 10 future fiscal yearsthe upcoming fiscal year the budget year and th nine fiscal years after the budget year the outyears for years cbo has provided the house and senate with 10year cost estimates of mandatory spending measures and the joint tax committee has provided both chambers with 10year estimates of revenue measures in some cases legislation can be crafted so that the budgetary costs of policies that congress intends to establish over the longer term or even permanently may be accommodated in revenue and mandatory spending legislation despite budget enforcement procedures specific revenue or spending policies in legislation may be adjusted so that the budgetary impact of the legislation complies with the applicable budget enforcement procedures techniques used to ensure compliance include among others phasein and sunset dates and offsets these techniques may allow congress to include in legislation longter m revenue or spending policies that otherwise might not comply with budget enforcement procedures phasein dates ie future dates when policy first takes effect may be used to delay the implementation of policy beyond the effective date generally applicable to the legislation such as the date of enactment thereby helping to keep the overall cost of the measure within the appropriate limits delaying the implementation of policy that costs 300 million per year for four years for example would save 12 billion over the life of 10year bill similarly sunset dates ie future dates when policy terminates could be used for the same purpose sunsetting policy that costs 300 million per year after eight years for example would save 600 million over the life of 10year bill further sunset dates may be used to terminate costs altogether for periods when net costs are allowed eg after the budget window applicable to reconciliation legislation revenue reconciliation legislation enacted in 2001 and 2003 employed mix of phasein dates and sunset dates to keep the overall revenue reduction in the measures within the limits set by the budget resolutions for those years further the legislation used sunset dates so that the net revenue losses would not extend beyond the 10year window used by reconciliation in those instances offsets may be used to counter costs so that the net budgetary effect of the legislation is neutral or otherwise complies with budget enforcement requirements in 2005 and 2006 for example congress considered and enacted revenue reconciliation legislation that complied with the budget resolution requirement that the revenue reductions not exceed 70 billion over fiveyear window the legislation included changes in capital gains and dividends policy among other 13 for comprehensive list see crs report rs22117 list of temporary tax provisions extenders expiring

was scored as incurring sign ificant revenue losses in the remaining five years of the 10year cost estimating period in order to avoid violating procedural prohibition against net revenue losses in those remaining five years the legislation included various revenue increases that kept the net revenue reductions in the measure under 70 billion for the full 10year period legislation allowing otherwise ineligible households to convert regular individual retirement accounts iras provides concrete example of how offsets work converting traditional iras which are funded with pretax dollars

not taxed therefore allowing conversions of regular iras to roth iras creates revenue losses in the longer run by careful choice of the year in which ira conversions are first allowed most estimated revenue gains will fall within 10year baseline window and most of the revenue losses will fall outside if congressional budgetary procedure considers only costs within the 10year window then those revenue losses are ignored even though they constitute deterioration in the federal governments fiscal condition the tax policy center estimates that provisions in the tax increase prevention and reconciliation act of 2005 tipra pl 109222 allowing these conversions loses more than 4 billion in present value even though the provision appears to raise 86 billion in the 10year budget window 14 gravelle discusses budget estimation of the effects of changing ira requirements and gives other examples of changes in the tax code whose shortterm costs as measured using fiveyear budget window are only third or fourth as much as longterm costs beyond that window15 longterm budget estimates can be improved by creating tax increases or spending cuts in distant years while future legislators may be likely to reverse those actions before they take effect the improvements in longterm budget measures will appear now those measures will then provide an overly optimistic picture of the longterm fiscal situation16 g22g145g142g561g515g15g152g159g146g151g144g561g25g146g151g141g152g160g516g561g18g155g152g139g149g142g150g561 multiyear estimates of federal deficits will increase over time when the gap between revenues and spending is widening 17 when new fiscal year arrives the previous years deficit is replaced with much larger deficit from the first fiscal year beyond the old budget window therefore 10year or 75year budget deficit estimate may appear to deteriorate in each successive year even if nothing in the real economy changes even if the present 10year deficit were eliminated 14

and medicare trustees report suffer from the same moving window problem and therefore provide an overly optimistic view of the longterm financial condition of social security medicare and other entitlement programs for example the 1983 social security reforms instituted in the wake of the greenspan commission were projected to balance benefits and revenues over the next 75 years the 2004 trustees report however projected 37 trillion shortfall this change was largely the effect of shifting the window for projections 20 the projection window in 1983 ended in 2057 while the projection window in 2004 ended in 2078 because large deficits are forecast for the mid21st century and beyond shifting the projection window forward made it appear as if social securitys financial situation had worsened over time this is mostly the result of an insufficiently long horizon rather than bad news21 in recent years the social security trustees reports have resumed the calculation of infinite horizon forecasts which do not share this problem the social security administration reported infinite horizon estimates until 1965 estimated shortfalls over the infinite horizon may change over time as result of unexpected changes in the streams of revenues and costs or due to unexpected changes in the path of interest rates however infinite horizon estimates change due to bad news or good news not because of the moving window problem the difference between 75year and infinite horizon estimates of social securitys sustainability is substantial the 2006 social security trustees report estimates the infinite horizon unfunded liability 37 of future payroll or 13 of fu ture gdp is nearly twice the 75year estimate 19 of future payroll or 07 of future gdp independent analysts believe

vary in the technical details of their construction shortterm budget forecasts have several technical advantages first shortterm forecasts generated by sophisticated macroeconomic models exploit the predictability of the momentum that determines most shortrun economic movements to forecast growth unemployment and interest rates the reliability of forecasts from these models worsens for time periods farther in the future for two reasons first the state of the economy in distant year will be determined by longer sequence of random shocks than the state of the economy in the near future which creates more variability in forecasts that extend farther forward in time 23 second the structure of the economy changes 20 see ronald lee and hisashi yamagata sustainable social security what

of experience 25 finally shortrun budget accounting using the cash accounting approach provides congress with strong tools to control spending of government agencies and to provide incentives which reinforce oversight powers26 keeping federal spending on short leash requires budget numbers with short horizon by contrast longterm models lack much of the detail and sophistication of shortrun models longterm models rely upon assumptions about longrun averages for annual growth interest rates and other key parameters longterm forecasting models are much simpler than those used for shortterm forecasting the interaction of macroeconomic variables in longterm forecasting models is much less sophisticated than that incorporated in shortterm models afterthefact evaluation is easy for shortterm forecasts and difficult for longterm forecasts less research has been done on longterm forecasting because it is harder and less financially rewarding than shortterm forecasting the longterm imbalances in the federal budget complicate building of longterm models that forecast the path of the federal governments finances standard macroeconomic models are built on the presumption that over time individuals and governments balance their budgets and so these models are not easily applied when it is not clear how government will balance its budget models can be built that assume federal deficits crowd out private investment in which case the nations projected capital stock eventually collapses otherwise models can assume that in the future the government will impose large tax increases or spending cuts or that it will reduce the real value of the debt by printing money and sparking rapid inflation in the latter case the model must predict or assume when and how policy makers take these actions models may also assume the government can borrow indefinitely from the rest of the world at set interest rate which continued armstrong kluwer apr 2001 24 some longterm

possibility is that households respond to tax cuts that are not offset by spending reductions by increasing their savings in order to pay the future taxes that will needed to restore fiscal balance

longterm models assume real interest rates will follow historical longterm averages for small changes in borrowing the small open economy assumption that interest rates are constant is reasonable recent research suggests that 10 increase in the ratio of federal debt to gdp raises longterm interest rates by 030630 although this effect is small and imprecisely estimated small changes in the interest rate can have large effects on the capital stock and longterm economic growth 31 the united states is currently borrowing heavily from the rest of the world and all projections show that this borrowing will increase unless major changes are made in 2006 borrowing by the federal government will absorb slightly more than 3 of the global flow of new investment funds32 by 2050 however this proportion is projected to more than triple so that new federal borrowing could soak up ninth of the entire global capital market the international monetary funds 2006 world economic outlook estimates

oneninth of all new capital flowing into the world market at that scale of federal borrowing it is hard to imagine that capital markets would not react by raising interest rates and thus further increase federal interest payments making the interest rate sensitive to the level of borrowing creates serious technical problems the scale of imbalances caused by projected scale of persistent federal deficits would require economic adjustments outside the range of historical experience which are difficult to forecast in closed economy models federal deficits are financed by private savings

decelerate to rate below the average over the past few decades of 3 per year because the growing number of retirees and higher life expectancy means smaller fraction of population will work in the future for example longrun cbo projections assume gdp growth rate of 22 per year and smetters and gokhales 2003 study uses 17 yearly growth rate after the initial decade40 according to cbo projections social security spending will increase from 42 to 64 of gdp even though shift of an additional 22 of the economys resources to social security represents significant amount of new spending this is less than quarter of the projected increase in medicare and medicaid thus the cost growth in federal health programs driven by combination of demographic changes and health care cost inflation is much more serious problem than demographicsdriven increase in social security costs g10g142g138g149g157g145g561g5g138g155g142g561g22g155g142g151g141g156g561 rising spending on federallyfinanced health care is the major cause for projected increases in government expenditures and accounts for the largest part of longterm fiscal imbalances health care costs trends therefore play central role in fiscal analysis figure 3 breaks down federal spending projections from cbos intermediate spending scenario by category these projections assume that health care costs will increase only 1 year faster than general inflation 41 federal spending on medicare and medicaid is projected to grow from 35 of gdp in 2006 to 126 of gdp in 2050 as figure 3 shows even with optimistic assumptions about future growth in health costs medical and h ealth costs are by far the fastest growing major component of federal spending g10g142g138g149g157g145g561g5g138g155g142g561g18g155g146g140g142g156g561 by definition health care expenditures equal health care price times the quantity of health care consumed per head times the number of beneficiaries in the past decades all three have increased and are expected to increase in the future although the number of people eligible for federal health insurance benefits in future decades can be forecast reasonably accurately using demographic methods forecasting health care prices and the intensity of health care use is speculative future health care prices play key role in longterm budget forecasts prices for medical care rose on average 21 faster than the rate of inflation over the past four decades at that rate real health care costs double every 33 years prices for medical care have increased less rapidly than general inflation only during periods when the health care system was threatened with comprehensive reform42 after reform proposals died medical care prices accelerated 40 gokhale jagadeesh and kent smetters fiscal and generational imbalances new budget measures for new budget priorities washington dc the aei press 2003 41 this projection also assumes social security benefits will not be cut that other mandatory programs will remain at their 2005 proportion of gdp and that nondefense discretionary spending declines to 36 of gdp by 2007 and remains at that level thereafter 42 the two sharp drops in the growth of medical care costs in the 1970s were due to wage and price controls during the nixon administration and the american hospital associations voluntary costcontrol plan instituted in response to the carter administrations plans

estimate the relative incr ease in health care prices and quantity of health care consumed per beneficiary separately most analysts focus on growth in real costs per beneficiary the 2000 and 2004 medicare technical review panels judged that the assumption that medical costs per beneficiary will rise 1 year above the gdp growth rate was reasonable medicare part costs per beneficiary grew on average 466 year between 1970 and 2005 and part b costs grew on average 876 year over the same period 45 while in 2004 and 2005 prices for medical care rose only about 1 year faster than inflation there are few concrete reasons to think that health care prices will moderate in the future because the underlying structural causes of the rapid rise in health care costs remain one argument in favor of the gdp growth plus 1 assumption was that if health costs grew at faster rates then health care spending would account for an implausibly large proportion of the economy the 2000 medicare technical review panel estimated that if health care spending grew 2 year faster than gdp then health care spending would reach 79 of gdp by 2075 46 in other words health care which now accounts for one of every six dollars spent in the us economy would by 2075 account for four dollars of every five dollars spent 44 for further details see testimony of cbo director douglas holtzeakin in us congress

intermediate spending scenarios assume defense expenditures will fall from 493 billion in 2005 to 406 billion in 2005 dollars by 2024 and then stay constant in real terms defense spending is projected to shrink from 39 of gdp to 15 of gdp and all other federal spending ie not including defense social security medicare medicaid or interest payments will decline from 59 of gdp to 49 of gdp changes in patterns of international security and foreign relations and international trade could all affect the governments fiscal situation predicting future defense expenditures is complicated by many factors including the difficulty in forecasting the costs and extent of new weapons procurement health care costs for active service personnel and veterans and the costs of current and future overseas operations however unless future defense spending trends depart substantially from historical averages social security medicare and medicaid costs will play much larger role in determining the longterm fiscal condition of the federal government httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33623g14g152g151g144g556g22g142g155g150g561g15g142g138g156g158g155g142g156g561g152g143g561g8g146g156g140g138g149

measures of longterm fiscal conditions have been proposed each has some advantages and some drawbacks these measures relate closely to one another although each illustrates different aspects of the governments fiscal situation

perhaps the most direct method of showing the magnitude of future fiscal challenges is to present figures depicting the projected path of deficits or the divergence between federal spending and revenues the wedge between federal spending and revenues or between the path of deficits and the horizontal axis gives an informal visual measure of the overall size of future deficits the advantages of this type of graphical presentation is that audiences can quickly grasp the severity of the problem and can easily see when fiscal imbalances are expected to worsen in addition analysts need make assumptions beyond those needed to generate the yearbyyear projections themselves therefore graphical presentations are natural starting point for discussions of fiscal imbalances graphical presentations have limitations as well the wedge between federal spending and revenues gives striking visual impression of th scale of the problem but is imprecise decision makers in financial markets typically treat future dollars as less valuable than current dollars because of the time value of money this type of adjustment is not easily performed with deficit data in graphical form finally having single number in hand is often useful in describing the size of fiscal imbalances or in considering what measures would suffice to address those imbalances therefore analysts often calculate and use summary measures of fiscal imbalances g21g158g150g150g138g155g162g561g15g142g138g156g158g155g142g156g561 summary measures assign single number or set of numbers on the value of future deficits and so provide convenient means of discussing the scale of future fiscal challenges longterm summary measures depend critically upon assumptions about how to compare future dollars with current dollars future dollars are typically considered less valuable than current dollars and so are discounted summary measures add up deficits in each future year within given time horizon after applying discount for dollars in particular future year for instance the present value of the deficit in t years into the future is re 1tt t tspending venue spv deficit r where the subscript t denotes quantities t years ahead and r is discount rate summary measure then adds up the present value of each future year within the budget window along with any current assets or liabilities measures of longterm fiscal balance or imbalance are highly sensitive to the choice of discount rate which reflects th relative value of buying power in the future relative to now higher discount rates which imply future dollars are less valuable will reduce the scale of fiscal imbalances while lower discount rates which put greater weight on the future will increase them

utility which describes ones overall wellbeing typically economic models assume that unit of utility enjoyed today is more valuable than unit of utility enjoyed in th future the relative value of current and future utility is governed by subjective rate of discount which depends on persons patience or impatience summing discounted utilities is the basis of the benefit approach which is described below g5g145g152g146g140g142g561g152g143g561g6g146g156g140g152g158g151g157g561g20g138g157g142g561 choosing an appropriate discount or interest rate depends on what is being measured budget analysis is an example of the cost approach which computes how much is spent to deliver governmentprovided services public finance economists usually take into account the costs of raising revenue and how public programs affect c itizens wellbeing which is an example of the benefit approach or costbenefit analysis the benefit approach takes into account individuals own choices and preferences in evaluating the effects of government policies 47 g22g145g142g561g5g152g156g157g561g3g153g153g155g152g138g140g145g561 budgets and budget projections use cost approach looking at the level of resources needed to fund government goods and services in the cost approach the interest rate for government borrowing is the appropriate discount rate for computing present values because that rate is the price the government faces when shifting resources available to it backward in time by issuing treasury bonds which lets the government have more money now and less later or shifting resources forward by buying back bonds which lets the government have less money now and more later g22g145g142g561g4g142g151g142g143g146g157g561g3g153g153g155g152g138g140g145g561 traditional public finance analysis usually uses costbenefit analysis or utilitybased models which are examples of the benefit approach the benefit approach analyses give different answers than cost approach when benefits of public programs exceed or fall short of their costs for example social security benefits are paid in the form of an annuity not lump sum because annuities provide protection against the risk of life spans lasting longer than resources people are willing to pay more than the present value of an annuity costbased analysis would ignore the insurance benefit of this protection while costbenefit analysis would include it the same point applies on the revenue side collecting taxes creates economic losses greater than the amount of resources collected because taxes distort price signals these excess burdens also are not reflected in budget numbers costbenefit analysis provides more comprehensive picture of the costs and benefits of government programs and therefore requires collecting and processing much more information than budget analysis the benefit approach also calls on policymakers to make distributional choices among generations making distributional choices which assign costs and benefits to various competing 47 discussions of generational accounting which is described below sometimes confuse cost and benefit approach concepts generational accounting which uses the budget constraint for an average member of c ohort can be tied more easily to the framework of individual maximization that is the core of economic analysis however published estimates of generational accounts were calculated on cost basis httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33623g14g152g151g144g556g22g142g155g150g561g15g142g138g156g158g155g142g156g561g152g143g561g8g146g156g140g138g149

to the political process longterm budgeting introduces another dimension to these choices by looking at financial effects of policy on future generations who are obviously not at the table of political discussion in particular policy that reduces deficits by cutting spending or raising taxes shifts buying power from older currently living generations to younger or unborn generations many have said that fiscal policy should not leave the children and grandchildren of current generations worse off normative view that fits naturally into the benefit view but which cannot be incorporated into the cost approach on the other hand future generation may enjoy higher incomes due to economic growth and therefore can afford to pay some portion of the cost of government that benefitted previous generations in turn the following generation would pay some portion of the costs of government benefitting that future generation thus longterm deficits shift resources to older generations allowing each generation to enjoy higher standard of living than if the government always balanced its budget of course if deficits are too high some generation may repudiate public debts breaking this chain of generational transfers g20g146g156g148g561g3g141g147g158g156g157g150g142g151g157g156g561 more sophisticated analysis would take risk into account future taxes and future benefits from government programs will be risky for various reasons the proper degree of risk adjustment also depends on how risks in government programs correla to private risks such as uncertainty in wage growth determining the appropriate riskadjusted discount factor requires matching these streams of payments or benefits with income streams such as bond income with similar risk characteristics however risks due to uncertainty in the flow of benefits from government programs or to unforeseen changes in taxes are not easy to evaluate or compare to publicly traded assets 48

question of the proper discount rate becomes even more complicated some behavioral economists argue that consumers are biased toward current consumption because they are unable to imagine fully the benefits of future consumption and so save too little the english economist ac pigou argued that preferring present satisfactions to future ones resulted from defective telescopic faculty which would mean that individuals would save too little for the future 49 large body of evidence in economics and finance suggests that many households do poor job of financial planning saving too little and failing to accumulate sufficient resources for retirement such individuals act as if they had high discount rates when young but upon becoming old may wish they had had lower discount rates50 indeed the social security program was intended to counteract such financial myopia caplin and leahy argue that if individuals lack consistent or coherent notions about the relative value of current versus future buying power then an optimal social policy would use lower social discount rate so that the government should take measures to raise savings and to 48 for discussion of riskadjustment of

benefit approach in the short term the cost approach relies on harder numbers which are typically auditable whereas longterm cost estimates depend on the technical quality of the forecasting models they employ the benefit approach is not practical as replacement for estimates based on the cost approach however the benefit approach recognizes that only by improving individuals wellbeing and minimizing their burdens can good policy be made g17g153g142g151g556g561g138g151g141g561g5g149g152g156g142g141g556g9g155g152g158g153g561g15g142g138g156g158g155g142g156g561 longterm budget deficit estimates covering given time period include tax and spending transactions that affect three distinct groups those born before the start of the time period those born after the start of the time period but who die before the end of the time period and those born after the start of the time period but who live beyond the end of the time period also the group of people covered at the beginning of the time period differs from the group of people at the end of the time period because of births and deaths this is considered an open measure because the estimate is based on transactions occurring over only part of the life spans of some people closedgroup measures aggregate the government benefits for specific cohort or set of cohorts as measured on cost basis minus taxes they paid to produce net tax measure projection of net tax payments for all people born in one year over the course their lifetimes is closedgroup estimate groups can be defined broadly such as the whole of future generations or narrowly such as the group of all people born in 1965 generational accounting discussed below is prominent example of closedgroup accounting closedgroup estimates have important advantages compared to opengroup estimates first closedgroup estimate can indicate whether the costs of providing government benefits to given group can be financed by the taxes paid by that group otherwise crosssubsidies from other groups would be necessary to finance those benefits second closedgroup estimates do not suffer from the movingwindow problem because the size and characteristics of the group are constant longterm fiscal policy in which net tax payments of each group sum to zero is not the only form of sustainable policy in growing economy older generations may capture some of the higher incomes of younger generations without making them poorer than their parents generation also in an economy with steady population growth each generation can receive more in benefits than it paid in taxes because each cohort of workers is proportionately larger than each cohort of retirees on the other hand if the number of retirees increases faster than the number of workers as is happening in the united states and many other advanced economies then financing retirement programs becomes more difficult 51 andrew caplin and john leahy the social discount rate journal of political

basis measuring revenue inflows from taxes royalties and fees and spending outflows on goods services benefit checks and salaries for given year or other time period cash flow accounting records monetary transactions when they occur however other changes which affect the governments financial position but do not involve current payments or receipts are not recognized for example budget computed according to cash accounting principles would not reflect the financial liability created if government created new benefit which would come into effect in the future only when the benefits are actually paid would the budget accounting start to recognize its cost the accrual accounting approach records changes in economic value or cost when they occur whether or not they are associated with cash transactions in the current period accrual accounting recognizes government liabilities when they are incurred rather than when checks are actually sent in the previous example accrual accounting would record the financial liabilities associated with new government benefit when it was enacted pension funds must use accrual accounting to ensure that current income streams are sufficient to pay liabilities in the future some analysts note that businesses with longrange liabilities such as insurers and pension funds are required by law to use accrual accounting methods and argue that by the same logic governments should be required to use the same methods while wider use of accrual accounting concepts in federal budgeting would provide more complete picture of the governments fiscal position fundamental differences between private business and the federal government require different accounting approaches businesses can become bankrupt and disappear but governments do not disappear if bankrupt govern ments can compel tax collections businesses cannot compel sales furthermore promises to pay social security or medicare benefits are not contractual obligations and can be altered by legislation because solvency for governments is essentially different from solvency for private concerns accounting concepts for businesses cannot be directly applied to governments the federal accounting standards advisory board fasab developed set of principles for governments including the guideline that federal financial reports should show whether future budgetary resources will likely be sufficient to sustain public services and to meet obligations as they come due 52 the fy 2005 us government financial statements and the analytic perspectives volume accompanying the presidents budget proposals present federal financial data intended to satisfy the fasab principles53 australia introduced accrual accounting into official government budgeting procedures in the 1990s54 proponents of accrual accounting note that information from cash flow accounts provides little or information about whether the governments fiscal position is sustainable or

funds whether the promises made to beneficiaries can be fulfilled depends on the economic value of future social security revenues compared to the costs of future social security benefits cash flow accounting that focuses on the shortterm and neglects longrun effects is fundamentally unsuited for analyzing such questions jackson provides detailed assessment of the potential for applying accrual accounting principles to social security jackson argues accrual accounting provides better framework for debates over the future of social security 55 policy makers according to jackson would accept reforms with painful shortrun consequences more willingly because accrual accounting would reveal the benefits of avoiding or mitigating even more painful longterm consequences which cashflow approaches hide one limitation of accrual accounting is that current payments and receipts are much less uncertain than payments and receipts in the remote future calculations of the economic value of government obligations in the long term are necessarily imprecise and accrual accounting then aggregates items which are known and certain with other items which are speculative

kotlikoff in the early 1990s in order to highlight the imbalance between the large net benefits enjoyed by cohorts currently retired or about to retire and the large net costs which will be borne by future generations caused by the interaction of payasyougo financing of entitlements demographic changes and rising health care costs 56 over 16 governments have used generational accounting in official budget documents to assess the effects of government taxes and spending on different generations academic studies have applied generational accounting to many more countries57 generational accounts are computed by imputing stream of government transfers and stream of tax payments for agespecific or ageandsex specific cohorts for living generations the present value of government transfers minus taxes is said to be that cohorts generational account which indicates whether members of cohort on average paid more in taxes than they received in transfer benefits for unborn generations prorata share of accumulated government liabilities and costs of nontransfer programs is added to the present value of government transfers minus taxes 58 this approach assumes that living generations will receive benefits and pay taxes according to current law but that future generati ons will enact and pay for fiscal reforms which prevent government default 55 howell jackson

understanding the effects of large deficits across generations it has been criticized on several grounds most of these criticisms are matters of interpretation or improving the accuracy of generation accounts and do not dispute the basic value or validity of the generational accounting approach however the claim by more enthusiastic proponents that generational accounting should replace traditional budget estimates has met with skepticism the more modest view that generational accounts or some other type of longterm estimate of the sustainability of current fiscal policy represent useful addition to government fiscal reports is uncontroversial 59 some economists criticize generational accountings assumption that future generations will bear the whole burden of adjustment away from an unsustainable fiscal path and that living generations will bear none this results from the traditional budgetary practice of assuming current policy will continue in order to avoid having to predict future policy along with the presumption that future generations will act in some unspecified way to avoid government default this approach treats the justborn cohort in radically different way than unborn cohorts more substantive concern is the allocation of the costs and benefits of government programs across cohorts computing transfer payments to each cohort based on demographic data from the social security administration or related sources is straightforward but complicated portioning the benefits of other government programs presents more difficult questions for example educational expenditures in given year benefit younger generations who are accumulating human capital those expenditures also benefit teachers and depending on how labor markets work may also benefit employers most generational accounting estimates sidestep these questions by assuming nontransfer spending benefits living generations equally although this assumption is unlikely to be correct it may not ma tter much for two reasons first if the pattern of nontransfer benefits is stable over time then those types of government expenditures are not likely to expand generational imbalances second nontransfer government spending plays relatively small role in the medium and long term deficits compared to the role of transfer payments such as social security and medicare

the size of longterm fiscal imbalances fiscal gap is defi ned as the size of the immediate and permanent increase in tax revenues or decrease in noninterest expenditures needed to ensure that the public debt to gdp ratio at the end of the budget window is the same as the initial public debt to gdp ratio fiscal gap can be calculated for longt erm budget window such as 50 or 75 years or for an infinite horizon avoiding the moving window pr oblem the fiscal gap measures the difference between projected government revenues and spending in present value terms fiscal gap estimates therefore provide single number for each set of assumptions which expresses long term fiscal obligations in current dollar terms alternatively fiscal gap estimates can be presented in terms of familiar magnitude such as percentage of gdp thus fiscal gap estimates provide simple way of measuring fiscal imbalances at the cost of requiring some assumptions about how to compare current and future dollars 59 the generational accounting approach is examined in more detail in 1995 cbo report who pays and when an assessment of generational accounting

federal governments fiscal condition have advantages and disadvantages shortterm measures provide far more detail than longterm measures and almost certainly will be more accurate in what they measure however shortterm measures may provide misleading impression of the governments fiscal condition because of the revenues and spending in the years beyond the budget window which they do not meas ure longterm measures give longer view of fiscal conditions but were not desi gned for budgetary control and oversight60 further long term measures are by construction subject to greater variability however this does not detract from longterm measures value as earlywarning signals of future fiscal problems for instance longterm measures indicate that entitlement spending associated with the babyboom generations retirement will create large fiscal problems that the exact size of those problems is not precisely estimated is not critical driver need not see exactly where cracks in the bark lie to avoid hitting the tree the question of how best to incorporate longterm measures into congressional budgetary procedures is thorny one in the past decade congressional budgetary procedures have shifted to assessing legislation using 10year estimates in part that shift was motivated by desire to use measure that would give more accurate assessment of the economic impact of specific proposals however for various reasons discussed above 10year estimates can also provide misleading picture of fiscal effects and condit ions extending the budget window beyond 10 years would introduce greater variability into budg etary assessments and would increase the importance of assumptions about key economic parameters such as the path of future interest rates and the rate of productivity growth some budgetary procedures such as the senates byrd rule and certain points of order in the house force consideration of longterm effects 61 however those procedures have yet to bring about solutions to the challenges presented by long term imbalances g10g152g160g561g4g146g144g561g3g155g142g561g8g142g141g142g155g138g149g561g8g146g156g140g138g149g561g11g150g139g138g149g138g151g140g142g156g501g561

as discussed above provides measure of generational equity and of the size of federal fiscal imbalances generational account calculations for the us show large net benefits for retirement age cohorts and very large net liabilities for young and unborn generations suggesting that older cohorts are paying disproportionately small share of the burden of government finances and younger cohorts will pay disproportionately large share calculations from gokhale et alia are presented in table 2 64 generational accounting assumes that future generations will bear the full brunt of cost of adjustments needed to bring federal finances to sustainable fiscal condition as noted above this creates sharp difference between justborn and the unborn cohorts for example as shown in table 2 gokhale et estimate newborn male faces net liability of 122100 but notyet born male would face net liability of 142500 this difference stems from generational accounting conventions rather than any real difference in the fiscal burden each will likely bear these estimates do not imply that future generations will necessarily be worse off than current generations as economic growth will continue to raise living standards transferring some of the gains of future economic growth to currently living generations can be sensible public policy although whether the current scale of transfers represents fair balance of fiscal burdens among generations is another question g8g146g156g140g138g149g561g9g138g153g561g7g156g157g146g150g138g157g142g156g561 many recent discussions of longterm fiscal issues have used fiscal gap or related measures most analysts compute two estimates one using cbo baselinelike assumptions and second with an alternative set of assumptions typically these alternative

in t he ga simulations these longterm projections which present an ominous view of future federal finances still may be overly optimistic first as noted above the historic rate of medical inflation above general inflation far exceeds the 1 per year growth assumed in the models second these models assume that as new federal borrowing marches into multitrillion dollar territory also noted above interest rates will not respond if interest rates rise as federal borrowing takes up larger and larger share of world flows of capital then economic growth will slow and federal interest costs will

interest rate responses due to large future deficits cbo ran two such simulations one highrevenue scenario and one lowrevenue scenario the highrevenuehighspending scenario like the cbo baseline assumes that provisions of the tax law such as the 10 income tax bracket higher child tax credits lower top tax rates and repeal of the estate tax all expire at the end of 2010 and that the alternative minimum tax remains unaltered marginal labor taxes in the highrevenuehigh spending scenario increase from 306 in 2006 to 388 in 2050 the size of the federal government would increase by 62 of gdp in the same period bringing the us taxgdp ratio up to canadian level but still well below the taxgdp ratios of the major european economies

however that analysis is beyond the scope of this report68 table 5 shows estimates of the financial shortfalls for social security and medicare as well as estimates of other federal liabilities69 social security and medicare liabilities are computed as the present value of expenditures net of tax premium and state transfer revenue from the intermediate cost projections from the 2005 social security and medicare trustees report these estimates are similar to comparable estimates of fiscal gap under alternative assumptions calculations in table 4 in large part this is because future social security and medicare liabilities and the accumulated federal debt account for nearly 90 of longterm federal fiscal shortfalls however estimates in table 4 and table 5 differ in their treatment of other items the fiscal gap calculations in table 4 include costs of future discretionary spending which are not included in estimates presented in table 5 on the other hand fiscal gap calculations in table 4 do not explicitly include federal employee and veterans benefits or items comprising other liabilities commitments and contingencies although such expenses are included in other ways for

security beneficiaries received far more in benefits than they paid in oasdi taxes an inevitable consequence of starting payasyougo pension system however future generations will pay more in taxes than they will receive in benefits which was not inevitable in the design of the social security program generational consequences of social securitys financial problems are shown in table 6 table 6 indicates that the cost of benefits and taxes for future participants will essentially balance with discrepancy of less than onetwent ieth of 1 of gdp this simply presumes that future generations will neither receive nor pay subsidies past and current participants however enjoyed bonus of 133 trillion in present value representing the benefits they received above and beyond the taxes they paid eliminating social securitys financial imbalance either means that living generations must reduce benefits or increase taxes or future generations must pay this above and beyond the costs of their own retirement the monetary magnitudes needed to solve social securitys financial problems are large however the infinite horizon estimate of the oasdi fiscal gap of 14 of gdp is smaller than shifts of

the presidents council of economic advisers recently noted the federal governments current budget deficit is in sense only the tip of the iceberg of the fiscal problems to come the federal budget is on an unsustainable path when the babyboom generation retires and becomes eligible for social security and medicare all hell is going to break loose the policy options arent prettyeither large cuts in promised benefits or taxes vastly higher than anything ever experienced in us history 71 if the yearly budget deficit is the tip of the iceberg then finding way to measure the iceberg itself that is the magnitude of the imbalance in longterm revenues and spending obligations becomes important as with icebergs the largest and most dangerous parts of longterm fiscal imbalances are less visible although all serious fiscal analysts acknowledge the magnitude of future fiscal imbalances major legislative changes of the scale necessary to address these imbalances have not been enactedor yet proposed the political choices needed to reduce these imbalances in significant way will be painful which explains some of the reluctance of policy makers to tackle this issue other reasons for the delay in confronting the issue of fiscal im balances include the belief that economic growth will solve these problems avoiding the need for difficult allocational decisions and belief that the costs of delay are relatively small g25g146g149g149g561g22g145g142g561g7g140g152g151g152g150g162g561g17g158g157g144g155g152g160g561g157g145g142g561g6g142g143g146g140g146g157g156g501g561 some journalists assert that accelerated economic growth will allow the us economy to outgrow fiscal imbalances72 the consensus of professional economists is that the economy is unlikely to outgrow the current looming fiscal imbalance cbo concludes there is essentially chance that growth in total factor productivity will be high enough to avoid large future shortfalls73 auerbach gale and orszag conduct simulation

of gdp the deficits excluding social security and other trust funds would be 51 trillion or 30 of gdp 74 large budget deficits can slow economic growth in the long term government borrowing will push

reduce the capital stock or induce foreign investors to own larger share of the capital stock reducing the future stream of profits and interest payments to domestic investors reducing large future deficits or paying off existing public debts requires either substantial cuts in entitlement benefits or higher taxes which also reduce incentives to work cutting the real value of debt by rapid inflation hinders the ability of consumers and businesses to respond to price signals thus reducing economic efficiency moreover bringing inflation to heel after large and rapid monetary expansion requires large reductions in growth for at least few years g25g145g138g157g561g146g156g561g157g145g142g561g5g152g156g157g561g152g143g561g6g142g149g138g162g501g561 spending cuts or tax increases large enough to address future fiscal imbalances will be painful which may provide policymakers with incentive to delay attempts to address those imbalances delaying policy changes that address major fiscal imbalances has four major costs first as time passes the opportunity to address generational imbalances by reducing the burden on younger cohorts by increasing taxes or lowering benefits of older cohorts is lost not cutting benefits or increasing taxes for older cohorts now means imposing larger benefit cuts or tax increases on younger cohorts later second gradual adjustments are less costly because individuals have more time to adapt their consumption and retirement plans third delaying reform measures increases the political risk associated with social security and medicare that is delay increases the probability that retirees incomes will be disrupted because of major financial problems in entitlement programs enacting reforms now reduces the chance that promised benefits will be cut in the future fourth delay increases the average excess burden caused by federal taxes excess burden is the social cost of raising tax revenue minus the amount of taxes collected and is measure of economic distortions caused by taxes to the extent that tax increases will be needed to reach fiscal sustainability delaying tax increases means that the future tax increases will be higher than if those measures were enacted earlier having period of low taxes followed by period of high taxes imposes greater burden on the economy than tax at an intermediate level that raises the same amount of revenue this is because marginal excess burden of taxes increases at an increasing rate with the tax rate marginal excess burden is the cost of economic distortions caused by raising an extra dollar of tax revenue maintaining steady tax rate minimizes excess burden over time 75 thus delaying reform increases the overall cost of economic distortions caused by the tax system in addition having period of low taxes followed by period of high taxes will also have general equilibrium effects on asset markets which will have significant distributional effects among different classes of taxpayers as compared to steady tax rate at an intermediate level76 75 for discussion of marginal excess burden see ek browning on the marginal welfare cost of taxation american economic review vol 77 1 mar

forecasts are not useful tools in understanding the nature and magnitude of the federal governments longterm financial imbalances although they are essential tools for managing federal operations and for effective congressional oversight several measures of longterm financial fiscal stance developed in the recent past have become increasingly influential among budgeting experts although so far they have had limited influence on wider public debates any single summary indicator of the federal budgetary situation provides too little information so combination of short and longterm measures is needed to understand the federal governments fiscal stance recent estimates of future federal imbalances that were not constrained by cbo baseline assumptions and which were computed using different technical models fall in narrow range estimates of the 75year imbalance run roughly from 7 to 8 of gdp and estimates of the infinite horizon imbalance are around 10 the similarity of these estimates does not imply lack of substantial uncertainty about the exact size of longrun imbalances that similarity does imply consensus among analysts that these imbalances are not mere computational artefacts but are real and by historical standards large the international monetary fund 77 the comptroller general leading academics and prominent policy analysts among others have stated that the us government fiscal policy is proceeding on an unsustainable path other advanced countries such as belgium italy and japan face fiscal problems which are even more severe than those of the united states many other major european countries are also running sizeable deficits and face severe demographic challenges citizens and policy makers in the united states and in these countries will face unpleasant choices involving either sharp cuts in benefits or major tax increases wider use of longterm fiscal measures along with more commonly used short and mediumterm measures may help focus attention on these important issues the federal government has run large deficits during major wars as well as during the reagan administration and past generations of policy makers have managed to steer fiscal policy back towards sustainable path debts accumulated during world war ii were in large part paid off in the 1950s and 1960s more recently large reaganera deficits in the 1980s were eventually tamed during the 1990s through the discipline of gr ammrudmanhollings pa ygo and other budget processes the 1983 greenspan commission introduced several important reforms which if they did not fix social securitys problems at least extended its viable life by decades many analysts however conclude that financing the retirement and health care of the babyboom generation presents financial challenges of larger magnitude 77 see point 10 of the united states of america2006 article iv consultation concluding statement of the imf mission may 31 2006 available at
