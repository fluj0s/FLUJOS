valences circuits lecture given on 18 october 1961 yeah you see thats all for mary sue thats good thats good all right this is what the 18th of october ad 11 now today you are dealing with problems intensives and so forth and the modus operandi which we are following very ordinarily can be considered to be finding somebodys goal finding somebodys terminal giving them problems intensive giving them runs on the prehav scale on the found goal flattening off twothree levels spotting and assessing some engrams that have been turned up during that period running those flattening some more levels on the prehav scale and then probably giving whole track problems intensive and then flattening off few more levels on the prehav scale if theyre not clear by that time run few more engrams and then run some more levels now the truth be told they had barnyard one time and they had an election i thought that would wake you up and they had decided that all animals were equal and this is perfectly fine but they had decided all animals were equal and theyre having an election and the pigs were finally elected as chairmans and governors of the barnyard so life went on along the barnyard way very nicely and smoothly and everything was going along fine except most of the animals began to notice that the bulk of the feed was going into the pig trough and so they complained about it and were overruled by point of order and then they noticed that the pig quarters had been moved to the warmest part of the barn oh by this time it got little bit rough and finally it got to point where there wasnt anything to eat anyplace but in the pig trough so they had big meeting and the animals wanted to know why if all animals were equal and all had equal rights the pigs should be living in the warmest part of the barn and should be getting practically all the food in the barnyard so the pigs had considerable meeting amongst themselves as an executive committee and finally came up with this conclusion which they published that some animals are more equal than others this thing about equality comes up amongst preclears are some thetans tougher than other thetans are thetans all of 611 grasshopper power or you see and so on that is by the way an unanswered question but the basics of the thing are that some people are certainly all cases are rough but some cases are more rougher than others and in this particular wise all cases will now be found to respond to what we know but some require more of it than others and regardless of the equality of thetans and how some thetans might be equal to some thetans and all thetans are more equal than other thetans in spite of these problems which are unanswered youll find that all thetans who are here at this time on this particular time track in this universe you must qualify it in that wise are suffering from exactly the same levels of aberration the difference is magnitude and that is the only difference now this is an important conclusion because it doesnt give you kraepelins i think its probably pronounced differently but i prefer the pronunciation of craplins index of insanity now his index of insanity goes on for some pages and its all the different kinds of insanity that people have and its very interesting and it was developed many many decades ago in germany and then was exported and arrived almost simultaneously on park avenue and madison avenue on park avenue it was applied to the rich and on madison avenue it was applied to the advertising world and they expanded it and in most insane asylums in america i prefer that too i prefer that derogation of insane asylums i think theyre insane dont you and they have expanded this believe it or not theyve expanded this almost unexpandable list well it begins to look like kraepelins list originally was quite simple compared to the list which they now have of the numbers of types of insanity well these different types are only manifestational its how does the basic aberration manifest itself and that is the only question which is answered by long classification of types of insanity or aberration manifestational they manifest themselves differently they are the same aberrations so you have different manifestations and different orders of magnitude and you have difference of insanity in other words this is what we have been working for for some time in dianetics and scientology is to understand all of these various types and responses but basically you have the condition of all aberration arising from the same causes but manifesting itself differently and manifesting itself to greater degrees of magnitude or lesser degrees of magnitude its the same thing you understand but it can look different and it can be greater or lesser and what are these manifestations well weve talked about them for many many years there have been many points of address to them but the reason why we are clearing people broadly today and the reason why you can clear people is because you are taking people out by the same process that they went in at the beginning of book one dianetics modern science of mental health actually its third volume not its i think it is not its first volume its the third book of the first book it says if you can just parallel what the mind is doing why you can lick most anything so you have to parallel what the mind is doing thats one of the fundamentals actually the fundamentals with which we operate are expressed in that book and also many of them of research are expressed in dianetics evolution of science and dianetics evolution of science as little short essay is basically more important than it looks because these are the various indexes which are used in sorting out data and its the only place theyve ever been expressed but here today we have process in routine 3 of becoming aberrated the process of becoming aberrated and we in routine 3 you see reverse the process of becoming aberrated and it sort of works like this it does work like this thetan doing and acting in this universe loses confidence or conviction of his own strength independence or power thetan loses confidence basically in himself he loses confidence in his ability to do and to survive having lost that confidence he then assumes an identity which he considers will stand instead of self he himself goes down into degradation now what he is overwhelmed by or what he has overwhelmed consistently is adopted by him as full package of behavior and that stands in lieu of self and that is valence and thats technical terminology for that is valence valence is substitute for self taken on after the fact of lost confidence in self now as thetan sinks into degradation lost confidence in self he goes down into personal oblivion so that he himself has further memory of self but has only memory as valence now having having taken on this valence he then carries it on as mechanism of survival this is the thing that is surviving he is doing life continuum actually of what he has overwhelmed or what has overwhelmed him this is valence now at the point of degradation you will find it backtracking this way now just before he assumed the valence he had problem concerning his own survival which he himself could not solve he could not solve it as himself now just before that problem there was tremendous confusion in which by processes of overts and withholds he became enturbulated as himself usually these overts and withholds were well always these overts and withholds were against the various dynamics now that was the route by which he went in he missed his way and he had some overts and some withholds particularly against the mores of the group in which he was operating and then he lost confidence in himself completely he felt he couldnt go on as himself and this gave him some tremendous problem relating to survival he felt he couldnt solve this problem and he adopted valence to solve this problem he adopted an identity he thought would stand as solution to this problem and then he went on as that identity now that identity in turn as the millennia progressed submerged by the same cycle as the identity while member of group the thetan committed overts and had withholds from other members of the group and this finally mounted up into tremendous unsolvable problem and this problem of course was solved by him by actually the acceptance usually not of another valence but the acceptance of change or different status now there are several ways with which he can face up to this situation now ive described the most basic one the most basic one is represented by routine 3 which is to say he had certain goal line of some kind or another he did not succeed in this particular goal line while part of group he accumulated overts and withholds and this amounted to tremendous problem this problem was solved by him by the acceptance of an identity now he is in trouble because he himself has gone into oblivion and the identity knows the identity knows but he doesnt all right thats the most fundamental but how many ways can this then work out thereafter now having committed that basic error how many ways can this work out thereafter fortunately for us there are not very many of them but the cycle is always the same while member of group having certain goals he commits overts and has withholds from other group members from which arises confusion which summates into problem which he then solves by now you name it see and theres the only variable is what does he use to solve the problem now he has always used valence early on the track to solve the problem he always has done that that were sure of so that you always have thetan that youre processing who has adopted valence thats for sure see you know that and you can take look at any person any human being anybody walking around and you know that hes had some goals and hes as member of group hes had overts and withholds and this has amounted to tremendousproblem and that he has solved this by assuming valence and that this valence is greater than himself and that he himself has disappeared into an oblivion while the valence is dominant and paramount this we know about every human being we meet who is not clear thats fundamental but remember now as this valence with certain goals while member of group he has developed overts and withholds which have culminated in problem which he then solved by and weve got the next variation weve got the next thing he did well now the common denominator of it all is change and of course hes always solved the problem by changing by changing what see we dont have to say what we just say he solved the problem by changing there change came about in his lifetime now that is equally true of the first assumption of valence you see that was change of identity and life after life as hes gone along hes shucked the old identity the dead body and he left it lying there in the coffin with the relatives weeping about or left it stashed up underneath the dashboard rather poorly preserved meat hes done something with this body and hes gone ahead and hes picked up new body now the whole of the buddhist concern was the lifereath cycle the birthreath cycle of buddhism is their total fixation and actually is probably the greatest wisdom that earth had up until we came along it wasnt much they ran it kind of backwards but nevertheless it was lamp burning now here an interesting thing the whole goal of the buddhist is to escape this cycle of birthdeath birthdeath birthdeath and hes very afraid of making change the buddhist is afraid of causing something and he is afraid of making any change in life because he might then change somebody else and he might then become responsible for broader changes you see now actually hes doing all this on the basis of if i shirk enough responsibility why i will somehow or another float out of my ead well unfortunately it doesnt work very well if buddha did it sitting under the bodhi tree he didnt write it down on rock he wrote it on mens minds and that is writing as upon quicksand because theres something something missing now it is true that occasionally accidentally thetan can sit down and be very quiet and go out of his ead bong you know how he does it hes so concerned about escaping from dead bodies that he will actually set up an ejector mechanism like fighter plane ejects the cockpit and all at the press of button you see the fighter pilot in these modern jet planes the better governments build them this way at least presses button and the whole cockpit flies out into space on shot and parachute bangs open and he floats to earth now youll find every once in while while youre processing thetan youll find one of these things and youll know when you find it because he got an awful start something happened he exteriorized its all very mysterious its exactly what happened we are hard put to find out unless we know that we have simply run into one of these ejector mechanisms accidentally weve pushed the button well now they dont work usually theyre most of them are broken and they havent been functional for ages and theyre quite silly actually now one fellow was so afraid you see they get all mixed up if they got into severe pain they should be able to die and get out of their heads see so they will set up some kind of mechanism like guillotine right above their foreheads actually its mocked up heavy energy guillotine and at certain time when they experience enough pain they feel they wont be able to think while theyre doing this so they trigger this to respond to pain and they get enough pain and this guillotine will go clank and its supposed to knock off the body and nearly everybody has wound up at this stage of the track with the belief that you have to kill the body before you can get out of it that is very interesting you have to kill body before you can get out of it and people will just work like mad trying to kill body so they can get out of it and of course it has nothing to do with it it is via if you didnt have that many overts against on the body you would float out of it anyway youd have hard time sticking with it unless you had few overts on it so in trying to get out of the body they try to kill the body and theyre theyre just all mixed up and this is silliness they theyre doing the exact thing they shouldnt be doing all right you find people are gimping around being ill and that sort of thing they very often have triggered some of these ejector mechanisms mysterious how these things occurred here they are twenty years after they triggered something that was supposed to blow them out of their heads or knock off the body or something like this and theyre still in their heads and it didnt blow them out and this is big defeat and its wow its problem the solution of which failed its failed solution do you see now there is the birthdeath cycle and the buddhist believed that he could escape this cycle he could leave this vale of tears and woe now its one of the mechanisms of that particular series of truths that they believed that the world was horrible and povertystricken and that it was pretty well all bad over there now the basic truths which they were putting out are so interlarded with these other exaggerations overts and unkind thoughts criticisms alterises and so on that it operates as selftrapping mechanism if you get guy to be still long enough you will key him in like crazy all motions of the past will come in and kick him in the head well why do you find your pc sitting in the middle of problem or why do you find him sitting there with that solution and why is it such still solution well its still point on the track and every time the pc has tried to rest hes practically been overwhelmed and then as soon as you get the problem out of the way and you look back for the motion and the confusion the motion and confusion runs and the still spot disappears in other words the still spot is held there because of the pressure and duress of an active spot behind or earlier than the still spot do you see that so therefore every time the man tries to rest the motion threatens to overwhelm him you see the still spot is there to hold back the motion earlier so every time he goes still of course he restimulates the earlier motion you run into somebody he cant rest he cant rest he cant rest he cant rest he doesnt dare he walks down the street he doesnt even dare stop in the middle of the block to look in shop window all of sudden something goes merrrrmmmmm he knows better and traffic light stops him as hes driving the car he hasnt got any place to go as matter of fact hes sitting alongside of pretty girl he would just love to have moment to chinchin youd think you know and theres the traffic light perfectly good excuse to stop you know does he talk to the pretty girl he says well damn the police department rrrrrr and these traffic lights and so on and look at it theres nobody on the side streets anyhow rrrrmm and so on you know and he finally throws it in gear and jumps the last instant of the light and goes roaring across the thing why why because its upsetting to him to be still because the second he goes still he starts getting overwhelmed by all the former motion the former motion restimulates on still and this is an oddity the still is there to prevent former motion so of course then the still becomes the restimulator for former motion every thetan is subject to this the buddhist he wanted to go out of his bloomin ead did and sail around in the sky now the last time i was sailing around in the sky do you know i was bored stiff interesting i was just bored stiff interesting there was nothing to do there was very little to look at there was nothing to participate in but of course theres enough former motion to make feel like maybe i ought to be in motion or ought to be doing something thats all beside the point the point is that there was nothing to do so the basic goal of the buddhist must have been do nothing that is the defeatist goal whenever you have people in defeat they are telling you that they wish to do nothing now they will gauge it in many many ways and they will say it in innumerable ways and justify it in thousand thousand ways but it still adds up to the fact that they want to do nothing thats what they think they should be doing now of course the nothingness is the point of overwhelm so people who yearn for nothing inadvertently yearn to be overwhelmed inadvertently by mechanism they get overwhelmed and so you have every great culture working hard to achieve peace and they achieve more peace and more peace and more peace and it gets terribly peaceful its awfully peaceful everywhere and then up jumps one barbarian with busted slingshot and knocks over the whole ruddy lot they finally achieve motion and of course that is synonymous with death so thetans ambitions can often be contrary to his best interests but this is not surprising in view of the fact that there are real liabilities to being thetan except the liability of inaction of interest the liability of nothing to do the liability of nothing to have place to go nothing to be those are all liabilities and when you see people around preaching these you are seeing people in the finest possible games condition that is the ne plus ultra of all games conditions when you see somebody preaching to everybody that they must be very still that they must be very good that they must be very very peaceful that they mustnt move around much that they should settle down on the farm and never again do anything else that they should content themselves with that little swivel chair in front of the desk that they must not do anything else whenever you see somebody preaching this or what you need now mr doakes is long rest the fellow strokes his bloodstained lapel and gives you the business you know what finer finer way to kill man there isnt thats the medico his advice is always in this direction you see but when you see these people talking about peace peace peace quiet still stay in one place dont move the best life in the world is for you is to stand there like lamppost look at the wonderful life lamppost leads especially with dogs anyway youre ask youre seeing somebody there who is in games condition he is playing game in which he wants the other fellow to get overwhelmed and hes using basically and fundamentally the mechanisms of the track which will best overwhelm the other person it is not at all in the interests of helping somebody out that is all part of the game the best way we can possibly help you out is to give you long rest now the proofs of this are quite interesting the proofs of this are all over the place you take soldier wounded on the firing line and you put him in the firstaid shop which is right hard beside the 155s that are slamming away and you would think offhand that that would be the worst place in the world because you see the propaganda is otherwise for him to recover from his wounds but what do you know the death rate in the first aid station alongside the guns is much lower for the same wounds than the death rate in the base hospital why thats fantastic they move the guy back to the base hospital and they say peace peace rest rest now you take long rest and poof there he goes they got rid of that one right now yeah but what kind of care does he get in the firstaid station up alongside the guns is this one gonna live or is he gonna kick the bucket oh well tie him up little bit move him over there we got three more in the tent how you doing joe all right you know just not you poor dear fellow how are we possibly going to save you you know people practically walking on them with hobnail boots and the characters get well because nobody up to that moment has introduced the idea of quiet nobody has introduced the idea of motionlessness now theyve attributed it the psyrologists of yesteryear attributed it to the fact that he did this they had explanation except perhaps he felt he was still participating or something but this is one of the great puzzles because the medical figures are so directly contrary to what the medical doctor does if you leave him in the firstaid station between couple of slamming guns he gets well and if you send him to the rear he dies same wounds same type of case they know this so they keep sending him to the rear now there are many instances of this you take old mr doakes well hes worked hammer and tongs in that lumberyard for the last fortyfive years man and boy and he built it up himself he did splinters in all ten fingers and here he is hes working on the thing and truth of the matter is he does know more about the lumberyard than the other people around there and hes going around just having time and one day he gets gallbladder trouble or something one of the splinters got in his gallbladder and he finally has to go down and he unluckily lands in the middle of peace peace you see and he gets bit sicker and he keep first few days hes there he keeps fretting away you know and hes saying i wonder if that damn foreman is going to load that pine up on the wrong truck again and do you suppose they remembered to get the oak out of the rain you know and worry worry fuss and every time he starts worrying about it what operation is run on him is theyll get along all right be quiet now and dont fret yourself cant you just hear it running off well its an operation it doesnt do him any good the best possible thing that could happen to him is for the telephone call actually to come in and the foreman has left the oak out in the rain and they loaded the pine not only on the wrong truck but sent it to the wrong continent peace going on next thing you know he says well hell with this gallbladder and goes back to work well now you see examples that are pointed out to you as fellows who are dying from overwork these are examples of fellows that are killing themselves with work and the whole society subscribes to this you see how thetan lays the red herrings he doesnt throw red herrings across the track he throws flats of red herrings across the track dumps truckloads of them because the evidence isnt there hes dying from stills he is never dying from motions how does thetan how does thetan get sick you know yourself that the moment that you release the still that he is stuck in hell get well what is an engram but still you see hell get well if you can release that still now you hes lying there with broken leg and its going to take him six weeks for the leg to get squared around well all right how about this this is wh weve done this so many times its just routine practically if you go in we go in and we get rid of the engram of breaking the leg and we get all holds out of the thing and all resistances out of the thing and so forth hes out of there in about week or so and the doctors are flabbergasted they cant believe it youve been around if youve been around where theyve given lots of these assists or if youve given some yourself well you recognize that youve run out what was holding him in the accident now thats well within your own reality well now he was suffering from broken leg because he was held in the accident not because there was too much motion but because there was too much still its this motion before the still dont you see which is crowding the still into being still and you could release it better by getting the motion before it but what has happened to him that he is not any longer in this condition that he falls off motorbike hits the pavement several limbs bend the wrong way to he picks up the body puts it back on the motorcycle and rides home the punctures close in the flesh and the bones go instantly back together again what has happened to him that he cannot do this hes been leading too quiet life thats all thats all thats happened to him now you get around you get around very active people you will see them taking fall well get around circus thats not too good an example because theyre on display another factor is entered into it if theyre giving other people mockups all the time but youll see these fellows take falls and flops and so on that would kill you and they just pick themselves up again and they never think twice about it you know of course every once in while their the bull elephant or something like that will lean into an elephant man and he will lean until the elephant man is pasteboard but thats not the type of accidents im talking about but i also could add whats the matter with the elephant man that having become pasteboard he now doesnt resume his former shape why is it that when you hit body and knock it out of shape whats the matter here that it doesnt come back to shape again instantly well we say immediately well its broken well its like toy or its like piece of wood or something like that its broken toys and pieces of wood are not alive why doesnt the body come back to shape because we know the body comes back to shape slowly why doesnt the body come back to shape rapidly because of stills because it is held out of shape and that should be well within your reality as an auditor that if there is something wrong it is being held that way with considerable magnitude of force those things that are wrong with people are held wrong at the expense of considerable energy how man can stay crazy has often been great deal of mystery to the effort it must take to stay crazy must be fantastic and true enough if you get the exact unknown spot in persons craziness you undo him utterly he goes zooom and he goes sane ive seen it happen time and again the most fruitful source of these sudden recoveries of course are withholds withholds best overcome stills because theyre the motion before the still the motion before the still was going on while the person was not participating with the motion see the person was withholding himself from the motion already so while in motion he was being slightly still in that he was withholding himself from the motion get the idea hes practicing withholds so hes already dragged himself back out of the motion and eventually he drags himself back so hard and so thoroughly out of the motion and he makes so many overts against the rest of the participating elements of the motion that he is longer part of the motion and what is there left for him to be but still when you havent any right to longer be part of motion you have only one other choice if you are cannot be part of all available motion you can only then be still if the only motion available to you in group is motion b c d f you know and yet youve withheld yourself from the group and have overts against the motion of the group one way or the other of course where can you go but still theres place else to go if thats all the available motion there is is the motion of this group and you withhold yourself from that you go still and of course that is the basic mechanism by which you get confusion overts and withholds winding up in problem well the problem is the still its postulatecounterpostulate its ideacounteridea it is held and timeless mechanism now everything ive been talking about problems this past summer is totally applicable we havent gone astray bit what weve done in problems intensive is find just better way to handle the same mechanisms there have been couple of new discoveries on the exact anatomy of those mechanisms exactly how do how does problem hang up thats whats been found very closely stated that the confusion comes before the stable datum on time plot the confusion and the stable datum are not in the same instant of time its the confusion and then time lapse and then the stable datum the stable datum is always after the fact of the confusion and that the overt and the withhold eventually culminate in still and of course that still can say its problem it can say its this it can say its that but immediately after the problem is solution to the problem now because the problem is held motionless in time of course the solution becomes continuous in time so you have thetan with terrible problem how to get some motion how to have some excitement how to do something how to stop sitting on this condemned cloud now you could say earlier well he must have had motion earlier that prompts him into this we have to accept the fact that although moving is quite aberrative obviously thetans like to do it and we sort of have to accept the nature of the piece that thetans will move around and that they are happiest when in motion although motion is apparently very foreign and to them and very bad for them its something on the order of child gets sick every time he eats ice cream but he does and will eat ice cream you can say well motion is very bad for thetan thetan likes to move you c the buddhist adds it up of course and these other people who are practicing this games condition are saying that motion is very bad that is their first lesson motion is evil evil is motion so we get the concept of the devil of course is fire and the concept of god is nothing but the devil is at least something and the devil is always up to something and the devil is always in motion and the devil will find something to do for idle hands and nearly every and nearly every phrase that we associate around around lucifer has to do with doingness and motion so the lesson which we should of course gain out of this is that if we want to be godly well stop deadstill and do nothing and that is the penalty and of course the second you stop deadstill and do nothing everything you have been doing then overwhumps you thats the way it is you see if you hadnt been going at taking regs new car if you hadnt been going at 165 miles an hour having your bumper up against another cars bumper nothing wrong with that is there youve got bumper against another cars bumper but if you add to that just prior to it that you were doing 165 reg would have to get new jag you get what im talking about see its the motion before the fact that makes the impact and there you have the the mechanics of existence you have the motion and the still well now theres nothing wrong with still actually if there hasnt been some motion and theres actually nothing wrong with motion if if still doesnt occur but like oil and water alcohol and petrol these things dont mix motion is motion and stills are stills and if youre going to live life as priest for heavens sakes live life as priest but if youre going to live life if youre going to live life as an alpineer or an airplane pilot or something of the sort well for heavens sakes live life as an alpineer or an airplane pilot you got the idea unless you can adjust now if you can tolerate motion and if you can tolerate still you never get into any of this trouble but those are the two things that thetan cannot do there are certain motions he cannot tolerate and there are certain stills he cannot tolerate do you know that if you just put huge boulder in the middle of courtyard in an insane asylum and just let this boulder sit there and put lot of seats around and the patients could go out and sit and look at the boulder doesnt have to have any further significance than that you could blow this up and make it temple you see you could have you could have an idol there or you could have piece of architecture or something of this sort there but just as long as its big massive still and they go out and they could sit and look at this still well some of them would at once be sort of overwhelmed and some of them at once get terribly enturbulated but i assure you that if they were permitted to do this day after day after day after day after day after day after few years in the wildest state why theyd all of sudden go more or less sane youre familiarizing themselves with massive still you see just familiarize them with still familiarize them with still familiarize them with still you could do that and youd blow youd blow them up the track youd move them around and so forth without ever processing them its something to do but you say never process still all right thats perfectly correct dont process still directly but that hasnt anything to do with familiarizing somebody with an actual still processing still in the bank and making somebody observe still in the physical universe are two different actions now observing still in the physical universe can be quite therapeutic and observing stills in the bank without blowing them can really louse thetan up his bank has limited quantity and he loses havingness and other things happen when he observes bank stills now if we look carefully over how thetan got aberrated we will see that he went through cycle of action confusion confusion is caused by overts and withholds against the people hes in action with or the things hes in action with and of course he was in action because he wanted to do something the mores of the group his goal the goal of the group and so forth this is all part of motion and action its goingnessdoingness proposition that is followed by overts and withholds and that culminates in problem which is stop and the problem which is stop is then followed by change which is solution to the problem now we get that anatomy repetitive it goes over and over and over and over and over and over and over and its been going on for the last two hundred trillion years thetan wanted to do something and he was in motion and then while in motion along with others he developed overts and withholds from the others and this culminated in problem which problem he then solved by changing in some fashion and having changed in some fashion he of course went off and set himself all up for new cycle and he always set himself up for new cycle and every cycle is like every other cycle and this is the this is the sameness which runs as the woof and warp of life that is the cycle of action of thetans aberration and thetans doingness and so forth but basically the cycle of action of his aberration and it doesnt matter what aberration he winds up with or how that aberration manifests itself it all goes back to the same anatomy theres difference of the anatomy at all all right early in the game he adopted valence that was the change which solved the problem he had goal and that was basic goal and that has been going on ever since and then he got problem across this goals line and then this valence came along and this valence solved this goal and here he is now hes now somebody else now while being this somebody else ever since he still picks up new bodies who are somebody else oh well this masked the whole show this really made it complicated the thetan already is not himself hes valence and as valence he then picks up new bodies each one of which is an identity so he apparently would just stack up endless and endless and endless valences on top of his basic valence funny part of it is he doesnt thats whats amazing the basic valence is in there so solid that transient valences from lifetime to lifetime dont overwhelm it thats whats going on so while living these lifetimes he could subscribe to the identity which he had in the lifetime but it still was underlaid by his valence the see key central valence which was motivated by basic key central goal and although he gets other goals and these goals come and go he still has that valence he still has that basic goal well that is the biggest single shift that is the biggest single change that takes place in lifetime that is available to the auditor now that is big one and it is available on anyone with whom you can communicate thats available on anyone with whom you can communicate that is requisite because you wouldnt have much chance getting the basic valence of chinee while you were speaking portuguese and he was speaking japanese i mean this is get rather adrift so some communication is necessary to the resolution of this situation given that communication youd be able to do something about it now to limited degree you would be able to process the chinee with the cchs without the benefit of communication so you have whole strata of processes which one way or the other will work out things for somebody called the cchs which are without much benefit of communication those things will work on those things will work on animals you probably could process insects this way maybe you could even process stalk of corn or something this way who knows but it would be cch proposition and weve got that whole band pretty well taped and its an important series of process because it means processing in the absence of communication that is what that gives us and that is really what the cchs are used for is processing in the absence of communication if you can communicate to somebody or with somebody and get that person to answer your questions even somewhat laboriously and so forth you have business using the cchs thats about what that amounts to and the cchs can be categorized in that fashion now only because we can get rid of hidden standards now until 1a came along 1a did little bit and until prior confusion came along which did it much much more we had only one method of getting rid of hidden standard and that was the cchs now in view of the fact that we have problems intensives you can relegate the cchs back to where they came from which is processing in the absence of verbal communication you can process somebody you cant talk with and thats where the cchs belong well therefore they are important but now what else could happen to this thetan remember hes still going to go on this same cycle going to have goal to get something done hes going to be part of group and then hes going to get overts and hes going to get withholds from this group and then hes going to get big problem and then hes going to change well what other changes are available asides from valences well the first and foremost one that you run into as far as body line is concerned is he can pick up new bodies he runs into an awful problem in life so he decides to die the solution to that of course the change of that is new body and you have the buddhist cycle of birth and death and that is the buddhist cycle of of birth and death is simply the problem of how do we keep going after the fact of an unsolvable problem you could say that every death is accompanied by preceded by that every new life is preceded by an unsolvable problem somewhere in the vicinity of that death is an unsolvable problem death was solution to the problem and then new life was the solution to the death because in between the life and the death he ran into the brandnew problem is that is being an unemployed thetan so he solves that problem and he goes ahead then by his action desire for action and accomplishment culminates in overts withholds which produces problem which he then resolves and then were talking now about specifically about the resolution point well it can be solved by death couldnt it and all illness all illness of whatever kind derives from unsolved problems all illnesses dissolve resolve or or evolve from unsolved problems that you must know pretty well because that is the key to illness there is illness in the absence of wish to live illness is always gradient scale of dying illness is always gradient scale of dying it is expresses resentment against life it can be traced back to that the person is so overwhelmed by it he can longer tangle it out and we say well that person is ill because he wants to die well its rather careless statement of it because youre saying that only reactively does he wish to die its reactive problem and therefore not exposed to his analytical consultation so the person gets ill he wins football pool and they come around and after the governments had its cut why they stuff his pockets full of five pound notes and shovel them into his living room and say well you won the football pool and he gets very ill in spite of the medicos the medicos occasionally have written essays showing that every time you win football pool you get well well that is not doesnt follow its too much change there this fellows goal line long ago was set up that you were safe as long as you were poor and if you could just be good and poor then nobody would want anything you had and so you wouldnt get stood up in the corner of the basement and hung up on raw ice tongs and be bled to death which was the last time he had anything what happened to him you see so he solved this problem by saying i should be good and poor and hes gone along being poor and hes been very successful poor man i have i feel like shaking beggars hand sometime and when hes really hes really mess you see and congratulating him you know on being such successful beggar youd be amazed if if you congratulate somebody who is pretending to be victim congratulate them on being such an excellent victim you suddenly do something bwww of course because they are doing that reactively its intentional reactively so where you have this beggar being very proud reactively because of accomplishing the act of beggary youd have somebody who was being very proud of being poor man and then somebody fills his living par living room up full of five pound notes ooooh oh boy this is the one thing this is the one thing that he shouldnt have we are had case case here i seldom quote cases out loud but this this this fellow came into possession of something and has been sick ever since but most everybody would consider that it was good luck to have come into this possession and medically and by all other rules this should have made him well but it didnt it made him good and sick because of course it made him unsafe he felt unsafe somehow or another the possession of these things threatened his survival all right so havingness is also the consideration of how much havingness should you have in order to survive and of course you have lots of fellows that if you just filled their pockets full of gold they would be terrified that is too much havingness to survive and although they might say id like to have million dollars hand them million dollars and they go duhuh ohoh umhmm just hand them million dollars in onepound notes you see or onedollar bills whew the guy well preferably do it about dusk five or six miles from the fellows home and he doesnt have car just do that to somebody you see oooh why the fellow wouldnt be fifty fifty yards from the house before hed have nervous collapse why every sparrow in every tree would be lining up its beak on him to drill him dead you know its unsafe i just give you that as an exaggerated aspect of what normally happens some child suddenly finds itself part of rich family and is terrified how did he get there family wasnt rich when they were born into it but got rich afterwards and now the childs nervous wreck its too much havingness now theyll solve the problem some other way by dying by getting poor by wasting things by by trying to make everybody else poor im sure that edsel ford over in america considers himself utterly overwhelmed by the magnitude of the ford motor company because ever since hes had anything to do with the ford motor company hes done nothing but boob hes complete idiot theyve got mercury so he builds another more expensive mercury and calls it an edsel hes torn up every textbook and policy of the ford motor company wherever he operates so as to do exactly the wrong things you see it is not safe for him to be in that position so he cant destroy himself thats bad so hes got to destroy the position in some kind of fashion how else would you account for the fellow the whole country is starved for cheap car the compact is on the way up so he builds clunk that is exactly like another ford motor company car and calls it the edsel and sells it for too much money and the dealers all go broke and he goes broke and everything goes broke in all directions now these thetans arent stupid thats the other thing you must recognize about thetans one of their aberrations may be stupidity but according to the computation on which they are living what they are doing is very clever and you will always always find inevitably that the very stupid have the most fantastic belief in their great cunning and you often find somebody who is very bright who has great belief in his own stupidity but these are mostly survival mechanisms of one kind or another these are ways of getting along ways of surviving ways of living all right not to be torturously longwinded about it how many changes could occur how many things or ways of change could occur at that point just after problem you know problem exclamation point now how many types of changes could there be well you could think of billions of them in life but how many mental changes could there be well actually very few they could suppress or enhance certain characteristics or they could get rid of or adopt certain manifestations and youve just more or less got the whole package in those two things you could get rid of or adopt certain manifestations characteristics manifestations there arent even two see theres just two of them you could get some kind of manifestation or you could get rid of some kind of manifestation and thats about all thetan could do mentally and whats the earliest step of this well he takes on valence he takes on his valence and that of course is manifestation valence both limits and exaggerates persons own skills exaggerates some limits some others anything thetan has thetan can do anything thetan is doing thetan can do you can put it down to that thetan can be stupid it isnt thetans are always smart but they get aberrated and get stupid thetans can be stupid thetans can be bright if thetan can fix up circuit of stupidity therefore thetan can be stupid you see he can only set up what he can do he only can do that thats all he can do thats his basic limitation thetan can never do any more than he can do and thetan can always do as much as he is doing fellow comes in and he lifts thousandpound weight by his little finger on the stage and twirls it around his head couple of times and drops it on the on his toe and flexes his muscles and walks off and so forth and well thats very interesting you say well he can do that because he has such strong body the body is just via that is just via thetan can walk on stage and pick up thousandpound weight and twirl it around and drop it that is all there is to that but he is so dedicated to the idea that it requires strongmans body to do that that he only walks on the stage and does it when he has strongmans body you see that all right now your next little step on the thing is he only walks on the stage and does that in strongmans body when he is feeling when he when he is in training see strongman body has to be in training then he can lift the thousandpound weight you get the conditions hes adding on to these things all right now he can only do that when he is in strongmans body when he is in condition when he is well get the additional conditions that are added on to this all right now we get this additional condition he can only walk on the stage and do this when he has strongmans body when he is employed to do it when his agent has permitted it when the billing has been perfectly okay for him to do this when he is in condition when he does not have any problems with the manager or the family when you see he believes in himself hes got now got new circuit you see he feels powerful tonight but on another night he doesnt feel powerful so you see he only picks up fivehundred pound weight you see and he gets very prima donnaish about all this you know and this gets wilder and wilder but these are all vias and in actual fact the basic truth of the matter is that thetan can walk on stage pick up thousandpound weight twirl it around in circle and put it down on the stage thats what this all basically comes down to thetan can do this but these conditions limiters limiters limiters are each one of them the solution to problem he couldnt otherwise solve so limitations or exaggerations are always solutions to problems which are otherwise relatively unsolvable and which are hanging up and the problem got there because of they wanted to get something done as part of group and in that motion had overts had withholds and these resolved in problem and that whole story goes back of each one of these problems which results in solution like has to have strongarmed body see has to have strongmans body all of these things are just more and more complicated more and more complicated but its just summation of problems and each time that whole cycle has had to take place for him to wind up at the other end with some kind of wild solution now the solutions you are interested in as an auditor are not very many you are not particularly concerned that he is in body because hes been in bodies before and hes gotten out of bodies before or he wouldnt be here so there cant be very much wrong with him in this particular department but what is he doing with this body now that gets very interesting in the first place he isnt being the body he is in he basically and fundamentally way back when is being valence which is in body ah he is not thetan in body hes valence in body he is thetan who is failed thetan who is valence which is failed valence which is in body you get where this goes all right now lets move ahead just little bit further and recognize that there are new things that enter in which put you out of communication with him now up to this point wed find it very easy to communicate with him thered be difficulty in communicating with him but these new problems and solutions with their changes that come after interpose such things as constant somatics constant somatic is solution to some problem and youre auditing him through the problem youve got constant somatic so there youve got problem and youre auditing him through the constant somatic because his attention is on the constant somatic because its on the problem and his attention is not on valences so you cant run routine 3 oh you could find his goal and you can find his terminal but i fully expect there are some people that youd actually have to run problems intensive on before you could find the goal and terminal you will not find them in scientology or able to do any kind of job of auditing or anything else theyre really badoff people but you could find that condition now theyre just total circuit you know and the valence just wouldnt be available nothing else you see you wont find those i repeat in somebody who can walk up to the front door and say here i am now he could be in circuit well whats circuit well circuit is kind of subsidiary valence circuit is mechanism which modifies valence circuit is solution to the realization that the valence can often be wrong so therefore needs dictation to or needs things hidden from it so youve got circuit and you set up valence that can think allegedly and then you set up circuit to modify the thinking of the valence all of which happens of course when the the thetan as valence has run into problem where the valence has failed do you see what could happen here you see after the fact of the thetan failing now everything he adopts after that is susceptible to failure and each one of them becomes barrier to processing and circuit is something which modifies the thinkingness and doingness of the valence its dictational machine its like you set up tailors dummy or something in window and the tailors dummy is animated and its supposed to be able to turn its head backwards and forwards and shake its finger at the people who are looking outside and its doing this all the time and now you set up circuit to keep it from turning its head quite so fast see its already built in so that it will turn its head at certain speed and will raise its hand at certain speed now well put an entirely new machine over here we will modify this dummy see with an entirely new machine over here and wire it in to slow down the turn of the head see of course this is rather uncomfortable because the machinery in the thing is to speed the turn of the head at certain speed and then you put another machine on top of it to turn it at slower speed see now theres another machine there that because it is turning its head so slowly this new machine is fixed to turn the head up rapidly so while while it is turning its head at this speed its got machine which turns the head at this speed but this machine over here turns the head this speed and after while the dummy starts wearing out you see what these circuitry things are you see theyre things to slow down or speed up theyre things to show or to hide things theyre occlusion circuits or demonstration circuits theyre picture circuits they are all kinds of wild things theyre secondary thinkingness apparati that modify the basic thinkingness which is built into the valence now if those circuits get too wild and theres too many of those and its all too complicated one way or the other then the person can modify the circuit with somatic in some fashion and do something there so that frankly if he gets some kind of circuit that goes operative he gets somatic and that sort of makes him turn the circuit off soon as circuit gets operative and the somatic comes on and off goes the circuit and its all kinds of this weird via via via via speed it up slow it down hide it show it do this with it and do that with it now you get somebody that has this amount of of bricabrac additives and subtractives you get this amount of bricabrac which is modifying the modifier you see youve got something that modifies and then something that modifies that and then something that modifies that and something that modifies that somewhere down along the line about the level of the somatic i mentioned moment or two ago or any one of these circuits you would have hidden standard you could have hidden standard it knows more than the valence which of course knows more than the thetan of course the valence itself could be crudely classified as hidden standard but we dont so classify it because it is whole package of thinkingness doingness beingness that is valence its whole package its complete you see that package when you get profile and when you dont move off that package you dont get profile change thats all there is to that now the modifications can be many without becoming hidden standards hidden standard is only qualified this way its what knows better to which the thetan is paying attention see fellow could have hidden standard to which he was paying attention therefore it wouldnt be hidden standard you see you could have circuit that he never gave any attention to well it has all the qualifications of modifying his thinkingness but it would not slow up processing at all unless he paid some attention to it hey if he paid some attention to it then it would have modifying characteristic on processing now the difficulty is this concentration on this item whether it is circuit or somatic or anything else the concentration on this item can be so heavy so thoroughly concentrated and the dependency on that particular circuit or item could be so tremendously heavy that the thetan only knew if it knew and if it tells him its true but if it doesnt tell him it isnt true and that is what we exactly mean by hidden standard must be very heavy concentration on it and it must be what tells him now when youre auditing him he goes into the cycle of only consulting it he does not see you really he does not hear you really he its all set up on vias to such degree that youre really processing some kind of piece of circuitry it knows he doesnt this produces some of the greatest oddities you ever saw i mean an individual could he could be standing in the auditing room as you often see newspaper reporter do and hell see some demonstration and not even see it but such person could be standing in the room person comes in sits down in the chair you take two passes with your hand and they grow two legs that they didnt have before you see and they walk out of the room and the person would ask you what was the price of you expect him to say an intensive or something like that he wants to know the price of the cigarettes you smoke this used to absolutely drive daffy you know id give some kind of demonstration itd be fantastic demonstration some wild thing would happen or another and some newspaper reporter would ask you know very searchingly and so forth what what what state was i born in you see hed say like it just had nothing whatsoever to do with anything observed and it was non sequitur to anything he had observed and seeing this originally got onto the track of this sort of thing not because i was not getting proper recognition from such people i began i began to wonder if they could see anything to some degree everybodys attention is absorbed in various parts of the bank to some degree to some degree theyre absorbed but where persons total overwhelm exists attention is so absorbed that only it knows so they walk into room the person who is in the room sets somebody down in chair they throw sheet over the body the person who threw the sheet over the body picks up the sheet and nothing change has occurred and says there you are and the person walks out and you turn around to this person with hidden standard and you say isnt that wonderful and he says yeah i guess it is and so on its probably very wonderful he doesnt even know what hes seen that is how you can fool such vast numbers of people you can fool people you dont really ever do anything why because they dont see now this is more real to you in this wise if you had any difficulties with your parents of any kind whatsoever you had them because you were assuming they knew you you were assuming they observed what you were doing you assumed they heard what you said they you assumed that the basis of their judgment was based upon the actual fact of your activities and after while you became very confused because if you were having very much trouble with their parents your parents they never observed anything you ever did and they didnt know anything about you at all they had somebody else there entirely different if you had asked them for recount of what you had done in any given year of your life you would have gotten the doggonedest potpourri you ever heard of it would have had nothing to do with any part of the fact not because you didnt have different memory but because they didnt observe anything you ever did now their adjudications of what you did do should do in life are usually based on not having observed anything you could do in life so you get into hell of lot if youll excuse the french get into an awful lot of confusion youve demonstrated conclusively that you cant dig ditches and your parents absolutely insist that that is the very career for you and you assume then that they have observed that you cannot dig ditches and the joker in the deck is is theyve never observed this they have not seen you they have never met you what have they met they are running on social circuit of some kind or another theyre running on whole series of nowimsupposedto that is dictated by some kind of circuitry and it runs this way if i have or if i have daughter why that person should go to certain kind of school and they should do this and they should do that and in life they ought to do this and the best way for them to survive is that and so forth and if you dont compare with all these imsupposedtos the pity of it is you see you dont even know what these imsupposedtos are if you dont compare exactly with these of course youre great disappointment to your parents youre an enormous disappointment to your parents of course you get baffled in that you might be quite successful in doing what you are doing you might be going along fine and be driven half out of your mind all the time because they keep telling you youre not doing well child goes out wins contest of some kind or another comes home just overjoyed you see covered with laurels and so forth and mama says you know your feet are muddy and the little girl looks at her feet and by george she doesnt have any mud on her feet and she what is going on and she gets kind of confused along about this point you see the truth of the matter is mama has circuit that says children have mud on their feet see it just happens that you should take care of childs appearance at all times or child should always be polite or theres something some imsupposedto circuit operating like this you see hasnt anything to do with it and you could sometimes appear you see in total dishabille never word the next time you appear youre neat as pin you see and you get all all scolded why because what the circuit protests against of course activates the circuit now child is supposed to have good appearance so any child who has good appearance gets criticized you the circuits are idiotic see theyre set up on the basis that the thetan didnt know so what is set in its place is usually pure idiocy childs appearance should be very good so child has very good appearance and hes criticized but if his appearance is very bad hes ignored see its an aa you know its not the reverse and this confuses children and they dont understand what theyre doing right and when theyre doing wrong you trace it back and youll find out that its just the awfullest mishmash of 8c you ever heard its all reversed 8c and so forth little johnnys sitting in chair and he hasnt made noise for an hour and all of sudden his mother comes in and says johnny be quiet now well what have i been doing you see big protest injustice betrayal all of these things follow immediately in the wake of this sort of thing but circuit is most likely to go into activation on the thing it is trying to achieve so circuit most ordinarily protests when it has won itll protest its own end product at any time the basis of this is most circuits are set up on overts and withholds resulting in problem and going over into then change of some kind or another and of course the circuit will dramatize the problem or dramatize the overt and the withhold most things that are protested against the person will do we call it hypocrisy this fellow goes around hes always on the platform hes always beating the drum hes always screaming at people hes always jawing about secret drinkers well hes got circuit about secret drinking he drinks secretly see its all aaaa it defies logic because it isnt logical because circuitry is an escape from knowing it is knowingness in substitute for lack of knowing when thetan escapes from knowing he sets up circuit when he longer wishes to confront life he interposes circuits between himself and life or valences between himself and life or identities between himself and life get the idea he makes an interposition of some sort he has thinkingness done for him he has beingness and doingness done for him he wishes to divorce himself just little bit from life so he sets up an interposition of some kind or another and when you start to audit him this gets terribly important because you are part of life arent you youre right there in the room arent you as the auditor and if you were there in the room as the auditor of course anything you are saying or doing is liable to get an interposition so he sets up the interposition between you the auditor and himself the case and you are auditing circuit from there on and that is why you cannot do pure routine 3 that is why only few people go clear on straight routine 3 without preparation now by getting off his present time problems his arc breaks by accustoming him to the room and getting his rudiments in of course he is less susceptible to this particular phenomenon of an interposition between himself and life you cut those things down and you can talk to him for while and that is the most powerful general and common mechanism to make it possible to talk to the pc not circuit because circuits go into action on pt problems and arc breaks withholds that sort of thing pop circuit into view so youre talking to the circuit youre not auditing the pc when the rudiments are out you get the rudiments in and for short time youll be talking to the pc but people have problems of such magnitude on the immediate backtrack that it sets up as permanent circuit and youre always auditing at the circuit and you are making very slow progress well you now have tool or weapon with which to get this out of the road understanding the exact cycle that circuit comes into being on you can then get circuit out you find any selfdetermined change trace the problem immediately behind it flatten that get the confusion the withholds and the overts out of the confused area immediately ahead of it and you will find out that circuit will disappear if done right and that is problems intensive now all problems intensive does is pave the way so that you can at least audit the pc out of the valence he is in it keeps scraping the top off so that you can actually pull the bottom out okay that is the system of aberration which has been operative on the whole track and that is how it works and that is what it is and you have the tools that get rid of it and its never any other cycle but you have of course different tools that are effective on it okay thank you audience thank you
