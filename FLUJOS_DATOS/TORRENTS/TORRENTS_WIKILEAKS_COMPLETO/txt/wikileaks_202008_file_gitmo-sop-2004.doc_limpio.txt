it can trap the oc do not rub or spray directly into the eyes or mouth you will see it start to drip and change color as it lifts off the oc 2 use the nose to bisect the face blot out from the bridge of the nose toward the ears do not rub as this will exfoliate the skin use soft absorbent paper towels this will speed up the process 3 flush the eyes with running cool water after cleansing the affected area if possible blink the eyes under running water to flush them clean it may be necessary to do this mechanically using your fingers on lids to open the eyes make sure you get the entire area thats been affected to avoid recontamination all you need to do is to get drop back in the eye to be at square one 4 if available use baby shampoo and rinse with cool water to finish off repeat steps 1 2 and 3 as needed 5 it takes time for the inflammation to subside do not use salves oils or creams as they may trap the oc against the skin 6 for inhalation effects move out of the area blow

arrival unless common sense and circumstances dictate earlier action unless the scene is still being created eg fire burning offense still in progress etc do not just take out camera and start shooting instead stop and think about what youre going to do get good and accurate concept of the scene and its history such as how did the scene or crime unfold what are its boundaries why is the detainee out of his cell is there more than one detainee involved etc f make written notes in an official notebook showing 1 time date of arrival 2 location details 3 victim details name etc 4 names of other team members 5 times of new events 6 brief details of these events g plan how you will record your evidence using systematic approach 1 is it safe to enter scene is it booby trapped etc etc 2 am i appropriately dressed kevlar bdus boots glove etc 3 which way in and out liaise with oic forensic 4 always use the agreed safety route into and out of the scene h at the scene watch for and take care not to disturb 1 shoe impressions 2 blood 3 fibers 4 fingerprints 5 clothing 6 bedding 7 debris 8 objects with potential evidential value i do not be sidetracked into other tasks by investigators

following are some camera techniques to use 1 check lighting is it daylight artificial or mixture 2 should the scene be lit if so how 3 every shot is important shoot it as if it is the most important of the series 4 take your time and plan your pan dont chase focus or the subject 5 dont scrub the scene by panning side to side or up and down one clean sweep is much more professional 6 before zooming to close up during take zoom focus and pull back first and then do the take this will avoid the awful spectacle of zooming out of focus 7 always take an exterior general view gv or establisher shot of the block building exercise yard etc this will leave doubt as to where the scene is located 8 before or after showing big close up of an object do long shot or mid shot of it to establish its location in relation to other parts of the scene 9 when covering long narrow section of scene such as hallway or the walkway of tier consider slow zoom from single location and pulling focus if necessary rather than clumsily walking along it dolly shot with the inevitable disconcerting sway and judder 10 if perspective has to change ie you have to see behind objects or demonstrate their separation from each other then use of dolly shot may be unavoidable in this case use the lens at its widest possible angle to minimize sway and judder and move as smoothly as possible again plan your shot route focusing points etc before moving off 11 in small rooms or spaces toilets bathrooms caves etc use of high camera angle from corner will give the maximum coverage of the area 12 high camera angles are also useful when separation of objects on similar plains is required 13 aim for quality not quantity lot of ground can be covered with few wellplanned shots unnecessarily repeating or prolonging shots will only bore or confuse and wont enhance the evidential value of the video 14 think like an editor as you shoot let technique master technology dont let technology become your master the best equipment in the world will never replace creativity and reasoning 516a combat camera combat camera will have full access to all camp delta facilities both inside and outside the wire

of jdog personnel as to the importance of maintaining professional appropriate communication to prevent opsec violations b some of our biggest opsec violations are things that do not increase our probability of attack from an external enemy but instead make it more difficult for guards interrogators linguist and medical personnel to complete our missions these infractions will be addressed with increasing severity if corrections are not made c you are responsible to hold yourself and your fellow service members to use opsec in your mission more so than anyone else in jtf we have the ability to hurt the intelligencegathering mission do not 1 discuss current world events or history with detainees or within earshot of detainees that could upset or influence detainee actions or attitudes such as the situation in the middle east the destruction of the space shuttle or information concerning terrorist groups or personnel 2 discuss company operational or personal information that will lead the detainees to spread rumors stir up other detainees or attempt to use the information for manipulative purposes 3 share opinions or initiate discussions with detainees regarding information that is not relevant to the carrying out of essential duties this includes teaching detainees songs phrases in english spanish or other languages 4 discuss future missions inbound or outbound missions additional missions such as camp echo or the generals cottage etc unless specifically directed to do so by jdog through coordination with jig personnel 5 attempt to listen in on or influence interrogation activities on the block or in one of the jiif buildings if you are requested to be present by the interrogator or linguist please accommodate them appropriately however unless authorized to do so do not participate in an active manner only monitor and conduct security as ordered do not monitor the audio of the interrogation unless specifically requested to do so 6 allow detainees or other unauthorized personnel to see the uncovered signin roster at brown and yellow jiif building entrance use cover sheet or turn face down when not actively using this has led to detainee knowing names of several us personnel 7 conduct conversations critical of another unit the chain of command or other soldiers with detainees this also has happened and will not be tolerated 8 talk with other guards or us personnel not assigned to special missions such as camp echo dmo operations bus escort generals cottage etc about specific incidents or actions at those sites d these opsec limitations do not preclude you from talking to detainees in the conduct of your daily assignment maintain your professionalism be firm but fair and you will be able to build rapport with detainees opsec does not preclude guard from asking detainee how he is doing telling the detainee what actions need to be conducted being directive with your commands or answering routine questions being firm but polite will not compromise opsec and will promote detainee compliance general order 2 has been disseminated to all company commanders and sections and all soldiers are responsible to be

many troops we have what our defense plans are or when we are redeploying many jdog jig and jmg service members have information that could be detrimental to our mission if the media knew of it or detainees became aware of it dont be the one who sparks something that makes it difficult for the next shift another company the interrogators or any other fellow soldier to accomplish our mission if you see or hear fellow service member guard linguist medical or other violate opsec make the correction if the persons refuses and it occurs within camp delta call the jdog s3 asap it will be investigated if outside of delta report it to the assistant s3 and opsec coordinator for jdog more importantly though be aware of what you and your coworkers are saying and doing we would much rather

chapter 305 delta behavioral healthcare block 1 overview delta behavioral health block is constructed in two sections the front nonacute section has 22 cells that have been modified with additional safety considerations to house detainees on behavioral healthcare service that are clinically stable but because of their mental illness andor limited coping skills are at increased risk of selfharm and are more difficult to manage in the general population the rear section delta acute houses detainees who are at imminent risk of serious selfharm suicide or require seclusion or restraint to regain internal control under medical supervision the section has nine acute cells four restraint cells and two seclusion cells nurses station two secure restraint monitoring rooms and two secure interview areas have also been constructed video monitoring is available for all cells in the delta acute section and in the passageway lockable sally port style door covered with thick plexiglass divides the block this door can be closed to control the flow of traffic to reduce noise level and control communication between acute and nonacute detainees this door will be locked only in the most extreme of emergencies ramp was constructed on the side of the facility for the ease of removing detainee by litter this ramp slopes both the front and rear of the block and accesses side door the side door is lockable and is used as general accessegress point from the nonacute section near the middle of the facility the facility is also equipped with rear sally port this gate accesses the deadzone around delta mhf and allows access to the block via sally port 4 the rear gate is intended for ranking officers and dignitaries to minimize detainee contact while still allowing access to the facility this gate is for emergency dignitary and ranking officers only and general daytoday operational use would take away for its intended purpose the green wind screening has been doubled to reduce the ability of detainee to see into the deadzone camp delta sop will guide all delta behavioral health block operations unless specifically expressed otherwise in this chapter 302 staffing behavioral healthcare service manager in conjunction with the delta block ncoic will have overall responsibility for the daily operations of delta block accountability will be to cjdog and to the chief behavioral healthcare services the behavioral healthcare service chief is credentialed provider who is responsible for mental healthcare operations and resource management b delta behavioral healthcare block staffing 1 psychiatric registered nurse 34 behavioral healthcare technicians on days and 2 technicians on nights 247 coverage 12 hour shifts c the facility is manned 247 by permanent guard force gf of 27 mps 1 senior nco ncoic 4 junior ncos block sergeants and 22 enlisted mps the mps work 12hour shifts mps assigned to delta behavioral healthcare block will not be assigned to camp delta irf teams due to the high acuity of the detainees housed here because of this high acuity and higher risk of acting out behavior consistency in staffing levels is paramount gf personnel are all volunteers and are selected by the delta behavioral healthcare providers and the delta behavioral healthcare block ncoic from list provided by their chain of command through jdog s3 f the mps assigned to delta behavioral healthcare block will be expected to manage most routine situations of acting out behavior the delta block nco will determine when additional staff support is indicated and will notify the doc and onduty co as per camp delta sop g jdog s3 will identify candidates for permanent nco mp staff assignment to delta block candidates will be interviewed and recommendations for assignment made by behavioral healthcare staff to the jdog s3 h the delta behavioral healthcare block nco is the supervisor for all mps assigned to the block the unit nurse will brief the oncoming block nco on relevant behavioral and safety issues and any special behavioral treatment plans in effect the nco will be responsible for briefing all oncoming shifts prior to the start of the shift on the operational specifics of the delta behavioral healthcare block and normal guard mount information any significant changes in treatment plans or detainees mental health condition will be briefed to the block nco as they arise 303 watch there will be minimum of one behavioral health staff present on the block at all times the guard force should direct all questions regarding the behavior or status of detainee to them b credentialed mental health provider will be designated daily for on call purposes after normal working hours 304 crisismass casualty response mass casualty situations can arise at any time and are rarely foreseen the primary consideration in any crisis or mass casualty situation is security and safety b during mass casualty situation not involving delta block detainees one psychiatric technician will remain on the block and the remainder of unit behavioral healthcare personnel will respond to their assigned positions per the mass casualty plan the guard staff and remaining psychiatric technician will exercise additional vigilance in detainee observation during this time c while mass suicide attempt may occur anywhere in the camp detainees housed in the delta unit may be at higher risk due to the potential severity of their illness eg psychosis or the reckless or planned actions due to severe personality disorder the immediate action plan for mass suicide attempt will be to sweep from one end of the unit to the other and secure the extremities of detainees engaged in imminent self harm behaviors with flexi cuff restraints to points of their cells that would prevent acute acts of suicide this is done as quickly as possible however the safety of the guard and medical staff is paramount as these coordinated behaviors may also indicate clandestine plan to overpower staff the jdog s3 will ensure that adequate flexi cuff restraints are readily available for this contingency d in the event of crisismass casualty on delta block the following immediate action plan will be followed 1 the video monitoring mp will issue the brevity code to alert doc and the onduty co 2 the block nco will organize the mps into 23 soldier teams 3 the spare keys from behind the monitoring room door radios and spare trauma sheers in nurses office will be secured to aid in entering cells 4 video monitoring mp will contact the doc via landline to ensure proper response is in route 5 the block nco coordinates operations on the block in sweeping motion from one end of the tier to the other prioritizing the detainees by the level of distress then directing mp teams to the appropriate detainee cell 6 the block nco utilizes oc to stop detainees engaged in imminent selfharm behavior 7 mp team enters the cell with flexicuff restraints and the detainees will be secured to the inside of the cell on the floor laying on their back with flexi cuffs to at least 2 points of the cell 8 the minimum amount of force will be used to maintain complete control over the detainee 9 in the event detainee is cut down one mp will stabilize the detainees head while he is cut down then the detainee will be lowered to the floor and placed on his back then secured 10 the door to the detainees cell must be locked remember the primary concern is soldier safety 11 if additional manning is required the on duty co will call camp one irf teams if the onduty co is not on the block the doc will be notified to call for the irf teams 12 the block nco coordinates all activities on the block ensuring unnecessary personnel and observers are not allowed on the tier and required personnel are being properly directed 13 the behavioral healthcare service manager and delta mhf ncoic will be notified as soon as possible 14 all personnel must be vigilant to clandestine plan to overpower the guard and psych staff 15 all gf personnel file da 2823 original with doc copy to gf ncoic 305 nonacute section the nonacute section is for detainees with severe mental illnesses that require an increased level of monitoringcare detainees at increased risk for selfinjurious behavior and those detainees whose behavior is so maladaptive as to create significant disturbance if housed in the general or segregated housing units b the sections guard force provides security and first line observation of detainees with ready back up of behavioral health staff detainees who are at particularly high risk of selfharm eg detainees who have had repeated suicide attempts or detainees who have just returned from the acute section will have their cells marked with red tag the purpose of the red tag is to alert guard and behavioral health staff of detainees to be particularly observant of and have lower threshold for further inquiry these individuals can or have demonstrated propensity to be very secretive or resourceful in their attempts to do selfharm during times of crisis or other times of potential distraction particular attention to cells marked with red tags is paramount during these times of crisis the delta block nco will verbally and immediately assign either guard to assume the responsibility of monitoring cells with red tags or task the unit nurse or unit psychiatric technician to immediately assign behavioral healthcare staff member to this task c cells with red tags will not have sheets large shower type towels will be provided only for shower purposes and will under circumstances be allowed inside any cells detainees assigned to delta mhf both acute and nonacute are issued small hand towels for use in their cells these restrictions should help guard and behavioral health staff to quickly identify highrisk detainees who have these unauthorized and potentially dangerous items in their cell d behavioral health staff will conduct visual check of detainees housed with red tags every two hours and document the detainees activity utilizing the high risk observation form when the guard force is not able to redirect detainee from behavior that is potentially selfinjurious eg head banging or scratching or creating significant disturbance the guard force will contact the unit psychiatric technician or unit nurse if the unit psychiatric technician is unable to redirect the detainee from potentially selfinjurious behavior the unit nurse will be notified 306 delta acute section and selfharm precautions the acute section is for those detainees at very high risk for selfharm and who require selfharm precautions detainee on selfharm precautions is at high risk for suicide or other selfinjury they may suffer from poor selfcontrol or lack of coping abilities they often deal poorly with anger and stress many try to manipulate others and their environment by threats of suicide and selfharm they often engage in threats or actual selfinjurious behavior threats or actual harm toward others anti social and aggressive behaviors and inappropriate sexual behaviors their behavior can be dramatic and highly unpredictable the risk with these detainees is varying degrees of selfinjurious behaviors including suicide only behavioral healthcare providers nurses and psychiatric technicians or another credentialed medical provider can order selfharm precautions only credentialed behavioral healthcare providers can discontinue selfharm precautions b detainees placed on selfharm precautions will be transferred into an acute cell on the delta acute unit if space is not available the detainee will be placed into restraint cell if restraint cell is not available the detainee will be placed on constant observation in cell 1 or 22 of the delta nonacute section c selfharm precautions will be in effect until the detainee is clinically stable as determined by credentialed provider and safe to return to less restrictive environment d detainees who are on selfharm precautions that are scheduled for interrogation will have their clinical status and risk assessment verified by the licensed behavioral health staff prior to leaving the block detainees on selfharm precautions are generally not clinically stable enough to leave the block all items are normally removed from the cell exceptions may be made by the behavioral health staff on casebycase basis these exceptions will be documented on the selfharm guidelines form f detainee is to be given items at any time that may be used for self harm such as razors sharp objects pens pencils nail cutters etc g detainee will not be placed in the segregation unit h return nothing to the detainee unless directed by behavioral health staff i serve meals on styrofoam plate with plastic spoon j mp staff on delta behavioral healthcare block will maintain 1 staff to 3detainee ratio while observing detainees on selfharm precautions the mp assigned to the video monitoring room on the observation of self injurious behavior form every 15 minutes will complete documentation of the detainees behavior k unless actively aggressive detainees may shower per normal routine selfharm precautions guidelines 1 behavioral health staff may recommend the removal of jumpsuit tops and pants depending on the nature of the selfharm behavior 2 items may be given if approved by behavioral health staff and in accordance with the authorized items for detainee possession item level initials regular blanket 14 ribbon iso mat 14 orange jumpsuit top 14 orange jumpsuit pants 14 orange shorts 14 flipflops 14 camp rules 14 finger toothbrush 14 toothpaste 14 mattress 13 koran 13 religious books 13 styrofoam cups 13 prayer cap 13 washcloths 13 prayer beads 13 perfumeoil from 13 chaplain 307 interview cells 1 these cells were designed to provide security increased monitoring and improved privacy they allow detainees from the acute unit nonacute unit or general population to be transported and turned over to delta block acute unit and behavioral healthcare staff for new or ongoing mental health evaluations 2 detainees will be locked inside the cell but not shackled while in the cell 3 the unit nurse will coordinate the use of escort teams with escort control the escort teams will report to the unit nurse to ensure the teams understand any standing limitations on the block and that local and camp sops are followed 4 detainees from delta block mhf will be escorted to the interview rooms by way of the rear sally gate the escort team will remain with the detainee and ensure his safety and welfare 5 the video monitoring room mp will make the appropriate journal entry and monitor the interview cells to alert the block nco and escort teams to any possible problem the video monitoring room is not substitute for vigilance on the part of the escort team 308 restraints and seclusion i purpose to publish policy and guidelines for use of medical restraint and seclusion as means of assisting detainee in regaining control of his behavior to protect self other detainees guards and other staff ii background it is the policy of detention hospital jtf gtmo to deliver proper and humane patient care to all detainees while observing basic human rights use of restraint temporarily restricts these rights restraint is used only for detainees who are at imminent risk of harming themselves or others restraint is to be used only after other less restrictive interventions have proven unsuccessful in efforts to control behavior b restraint cannot be ordered prn as needed c when healthcare staff notes what they consider to be improper use of restraints jeopardizing the health of detainee they communicate their concerns as soon as possible to the detention hospital officer in charge and the detention operations center d the chief of behavioral health services is to be notifiedpaged immediately any time detainee is restrained in order to obtain formal order for restraints iii definitions restraint any method of physically restricting persons movement physical activity or normal access to his or her body restraint is considered involuntary and is used as part of an approved protocol or as indicated by an individuals orders 1 clinicallyordered restraints refer to measures taken as part of medical or mental health treatment which are designed to confine patients bodily movements such as the use of leather cuffs and anklets 2 custodyordered restraints are to be used only by custody staff for security reasons the health care staff does not participate in the restraint of detainees ordered by custody staff except for monitoring their health status b seclusion refers to the placement by health workers of patient in bare room for the purpose of containing clinical situation eg extreme agitation threatening behavior assaultive behavior that may result in harm to self or others c observation 1 close observation staff should observe such detainee at staggered intervals not to exceed every 15 minutes 2 constant observation staff should observe such detainee on continuous uninterrupted basis closedcircuit television can be used as supplement to but never substitute for such observation d the standards do not apply to restraints imposed for correctional reasons or seclusion used for involuntary confinement for legally mandated but nonclinical purposes such as confining person facing serious criminal charges or serving criminal sentence in locked room licensed independent practitioner lip for the purposes of this directive clinician that is permitted by law and by the hospital to provide detainee care services without direction or supervision within the scope of the individuals license and consistent with individually granted clinical privileges iv indications restraint is indicated in the following situations 1 when detainee is in imminent risk of injuring self or others 2 setting where the actions of such detainee impede timely and adequate delivery of necessary or vital medical treatment b efforts must be made to determine and treat the cause of the patients behavior necessitating restraint restraint is not to be used as substitute for direct care observation or medical intervention restraint or seclusion is not form of discipline c prior to application of restraint appropriate alternatives or less restrictive means must be considered or attempted less restrictive measures may include increasing detaineetostaff interaction special watches closer supervision distraction medications negotiation problem solving redirection removal from the area and social conversation at time will less restrictive measures justify endangering other detainees staff guards or delay timely medical treatment d removal of restraints is done in an orderly sequence 4 point 3 point 2 point release which allows the detainee opportunity to regain and maintain internal control at time will detainee be restrained by only one limb behavior to be evaluated for release from restraints may include 1 the detainee is able to listen and follow directions 2 the detainee agrees not to harm self or others 3 there is further verbal abuse or profanity 4 the detainee exhibits calm behavior with attempts to fight or pull restraints 5 there is clinical evidence that sedation has taken effect 6 there are visible and verbal signs that demonstrate that agitation is resolved or greatly diminished when restraint is terminated early and the same behavior reemerges restraint may be reapplied under the original order within the time limits of the order if alternative means are not effective in controlling the behavior v practice authority licensed independent practitioner orders the use of medical restraints or seclusion when the lip is not immediately available psychiatric nurse registered nurse or psychiatric technician may initiate the use of restraint or seclusion before an order is obtained from the lip as soon as possible but longer than one hour after the initiation of restraint or seclusion qualified registered nurse notifies and obtains an order verbal or written from the lip and consults with the lip about the patients physical and psychological condition attending physicianpsychologist the lip who is primarily responsible for the patients ongoing care or another lip when the primary lip is not available conducts an inperson evaluation of the patient within 4 hours of the initiation of restraint or seclusion for patients ages 16 and older and within 2 hours of initiation for adolescents ages 15 and under at the time of the inperson evaluation the lip 1 works with the patient and staff to identify ways to help the patient regain control 2 makes any necessary revisions to the patients treatment plan and 3 if necessary provides new written order the lip conducts an inperson evaluation of the patient within 24 hours of the initiation of restraint or seclusion if the patient is longer in restraint or seclusion when an original verbal order expires b registered nurse responsible for ongoing observation of restrained or secluded detainee assessment of the physical and emotional needs of the detainee reevaluation of the need for continuation of restraint or seclusion documentation and supervision of hospital corps staff vi critical elements assessment of the detainee before during and after application of restraint must include the following 1 behavioral factors contrast observed behavior to previous behavior compare to baseline if known b evaluate for specific behaviors such as impulsiveness high energy levels and selfneglect 2 mental status factors look for cognitive impairments such as deficits in attention memory or ability to follow simple one two or threestep commands b evaluate comprehension and ability to follow instructions and treatment plan c consider ability to interpret the environment accurately and the level of perceptual or sensory distortion d assess for the presence of psychotic symptoms such as hallucinations or delusions assess judgment to determine if it is adequate limited or impaired 3 biological factors consider medication b consider the potential side effects or potentiation of adverse effects when medications are combined c consider electrolyte disturbances hematological deficits hypoxia dehydration liver or kidney failure thyroid dysfunction or other metabolic disturbances d consider extreme physical debilitation with age or illness 4 environmental factors consider noise level inadequate or excessive light over stimulation from multiple strangers in the patients environment and changes in diet b application of restraint is done in humane manner that affords the detainee as much dignity and safety as possible guard staff applying the restraint will be knowledgeable in the use of this intervention familiar with the equipment and trained in the application monitoring and release protocols detainees will be restrained for medical purposes in specially designed cells located on the delta behavioral healthcare service unit when these are not available for example if all available safety cells are occupied then detainees requiring restraint or seclusion will be restrained in other cells located in the bhs unit if in extreme circumstances cells are available on the bhs unit detainees will be restrained in cells 1 and 48 of the closest available cellblocks all detainees who are in restraints will be placed on constant observation by medical personnel who have been trained on restraint monitoring procedures medical personnel will document the detainees behavior every 15 minutes all detainees placed in seclusion will be placed on close observation and observed by medical personnel after the first hour guard personnel using video equipment may continuously monitor detainee in seclusion when considering restraints always 1 attempt less restrictive measures first 2 if less restrictive measures are ineffective assemble adequate staff and guards to complete the restraint 3 restraints will be used per manufacturers instructions 4 apply restraint to the appropriate body part do not apply restraint to only the lower limbs or to only one limb due to risk of injury allow whatever freedom of movement is possible while achieving the desired effect maintain proper body alignment and ensure patient comfort 5 when placing compliantcooperative detainee in 4point restraints the following plan will be closely adhered to the detainee is escorted to the restraint room in threepiece suit the detainee is placed in the prone position on the restraint table soft restraints are applied to the legs first the legs are restrained to the end of the restraint table not the sides this limits the detainees ability to injure himself or others do not remove the shackles yet the left hand is restrained next the detainee is rolled on his right side and the hand is unshackled soft restraint is applied and the hand is secured to the restraint table at the detainees waist level the right hand is restrained next the detainee is rolled slightly on his left side and the shackle removed the soft restraint is applied and the right hand is secured to the restraint table above the detainees headshoulder level the restraints are double locked leg shackles are then removed the belly chain is unlocked and then removed behavior healthcare staff must evaluate the detainee to ensure proper circulation and correct detainee body alignment prior to securing the restraint room door if the detainee continues to act out or continues to be danger to himself fifthpoint can be applied the canvas belt is run under the restraint table and under the left arm of the detainee then through hard point on the table the wide canvas portion of the fifthpoint is aligned over the detainees shoulder blades and then snugged be very cautious not to restrict the detainees breathing the fifthpoint functions to stop the detainee from striking his head on the restraint table it is understood that an uncooperative detainee will be placed in restraints in the most expeditious and safety conscious manner soldier safety is paramount but the above listed steps should be followed as closely as possible while restraining combative detainee c monitoring and patient care 1 the monitoring process addresses physical and emotional needs of the detainee this monitoring includes simple observation vital signs circulation checks observation of the extremities range of motion emotional and physical response to restraint food hydration and toileting needs other monitoring will be done as needed based on individual needs 2 detainee care minimum intervals constant observation medical personnel will constantly observe detainee in restraints b every 15 minutes medical personnel will monitor detainees in seclusion every 15 minutes for the first hour of seclusion thereafter if clinically indicated the detainee in medical seclusion can be monitored via video by guard personnel c every one hour circulation checks of each restrained limb d every two hours fluids must be offered or more frequently as requested restroom use must be offered or more frequently as indicated if the detainee is combative or unpredictable plastic bedpan andor urinal must be provided for use restraints must be removed from each limb one at time to perform range of motion exercises at least this frequently for detainees in seclusion medical personnel will physically observe the detainee every four hours vital signs meals must be served at regular meal times using paper and plastic products f detainees will not be removed from restraints to go to shower and exercise call do to the unique nature and dynamic situation taking detainee out of restraints for shower and exercise then returning to restraints is counter productive the intent of restraining the detainee is to secure him from further selfinjurious behavior or until he can gain control of himself placing detainee in shower or exercise yard would only serve to further exacerbate the situation g other interventions extra staff and security can be called to assist with detainee care as needed to maintain detainee and staff safety an rn or psychiatric technician will assess the detainees behavior for release from restraint as soon as the detainee demonstrates that internal control has been regained the oic detention hospital will be notified when detainees are restrained or secluded for longer than 12 hours thereafter the oic will be notified every 24 hours if the restraint or seclusion continues detainees remaining in restraint or seclusion for 72 continuous hours or more than four times in any sevenday period will be monitored through meeting of the responsible lip nursing and corps staff to consider alternative approaches such as changing clinical treatment plan changing medications or doses andor utilizing different behavioral interventions d documentation 1 the documentation requirement for detainee requiring restraint must incorporate the critical elements of assessment application and monitoring and reflect concern for the detainees human needs and preservation of dignity 2 each time restraint is applied or seclusion initiated the following will be documented by an rn or corpsman time and date restraint is applied b the detainees behavior verbalization or actions that lead to the need for external control c the types of less restrictive intervention that were attempted before restraint was applied and the detainees response to these less restrictive measures d the detainees response to the restraint the name and rankrate of the staff member who placed the detainee into restraint or seclusion 3 note by an rn or corpsman must be documented every 2 hours containing the following the detainees condition and continued need for restraint or seclusion b the plan for assisting the detainee to regain control and move to less restrictive environment c the detainee status of hygiene nutrition and safety maintenance vii doctors order the use of prn orders whether individual or as part of protocol for detainees with primary behavioral health needs is prohibited b doctors order for restraint or seclusion must be written or verbally obtained from the lip within one hour of initiating restraint and if verbal must be signed within 4 hours all orders for restraint are time limited the lip who is primarily responsible for the patients ongoing care or another lip when the primary lip is not available conducts an in person evaluation of the patient within 4 hours of the initiation of restraint or seclusion for patients ages 16 and older and within 2 hours of initiation for adolescents ages 15 and under 1 restraint and seclusion orders for detainees with primary behavioral health needs are valid for 4 hours for patients 16 and older 2 hours for adolescents 15 or under 2 reevaluation of the patient in restraint or seclusion by the time the order for restraint or seclusion expires the patient receives an in person reevaluation conducted by the lip primarily responsible for the patient another lip when the primary lip is not readily available or registered nurse in conjunction with the reevaluation of the patient new written or verbal order is given by the lip and is time limited per paragraph vii b 1 lip conducts an inperson reevaluation at least every 8 hours for patients 16 and older and every 4 hours for adolescents 15 and under 3 the initial doctors note detailing the use of restraints can reflect the behavior the detainee displayed necessitating restraint b all lower level interventions attempted prior to the detainee being restrained c the detainees response to restraint d plans for assisting the detainee to regain control viii training initial and ongoing training on restraint and seclusion for block personnel will be conducted as needed by the behavioral healthcare service and block ncoic ix performance improvement seclusion and restraint is difficult highrisk patient care intervention review of policies and procedures should occur less than annually after each incident an after action review will take place this is the ideal forum to address issues and resolve shortcomings 309 video monitoring station the video monitoring station will be manned by one guard at all times when there is least one detainee on the acute section of delta block this includes detainees in the acute restraint seclusion or interview cells b the guard on video monitoring duty will not be given any other tasks nor distracted from his or her primary duty of video observation c the guard on video monitoring will have means of communication eg radio readily available to contact the guards standing duty or watch on the acute section floor regarding any concerning behavior d documentation of behavior for those detainees on selfharm precautions will be completed by the guard assigned to the video monitoring station every 15 minutes guards on video monitoring will be rotated at an interval not to exceed every two hours they must be taken off monitoring duty for minimum of 30 minutes before being allowed to return to duty at the monitoring station f the video monitoring position will not be used as place to employ soldiers on profile or those otherwise unable to perform the regular duties of block guard 3010 detainee behavioral management matrix detainees with mental illnesses often present behaviors that are very difficult to manage they often have poor impulse control ineffective coping skills and may be at an increased risk for selfinjurious behaviors the delta behavioral healthcare block behavior management matrix takes this into consideration the matrix is intended to assist the detainee in maintaining appropriate behavior and to facilitate consistency between the mps and behavioral healthcare service staff when detainee assigned to delta block commits camp rule infraction or an offense listed in delta block behavior management matrix the block nco and the behavioral healthcare staff will be notified b the block nco in conjunction with behavioral healthcare staff will 1 review delta block behavior management matrix and locate the offense on the list if the offense is not listed attempt to categorize similar offense or an offense of comparable severity to the offense committed by the detainee 2 review the discipline record of the detainee to determine the detainees previous discipline history 3 behavioral healthcare service staff will review the detainees medical and psych history 4 general population behavioral management once detainee has been accessed by psych personnel and the behavior is determined to be manuptilutive andor malingering in nature psych personnel may or may not transfer the detainee to delta block in the event the detainee remains in general population psych personnel will make the determination to remove items specified in mfr for minimum of 5 days b if comfort items andor basic issue items are removed and the detainee remains in general population psych personnel will submit an mfr through the doc in order to track the date for return of it in dims c psych personnel will monitor detainees condition during the basic issue andor comfort item removal period 5 block nco in conjunction with behavioral healthcare service staff will formulate plan of corrective action based on the delta behavioral healthcare block behavior management matrix that addresses the detainees behavior mental health considerations will be taken into account when the detainees clinical state has affected the detainees judgment to the extent that disciplinary measures would be felt inappropriate or would be contradictory to the detainees written clinical treatment plan if several offenses were committed at the same time do not add all discipline measures together to determine the discipline instead use the severity level of the highest severity level offense committed to determine the discipline number on the grid b when behavior management measure is applied to detainee he will be notified of the reason for the measure the type of behavior management measure and the length of time this is to be in effect c the block nco is responsible for updating the
