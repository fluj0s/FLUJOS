failed to find core infla tion to be good forecaster of future inflation casting doubt on the very rationale for relying on it introduction inflation the general rise in the prices of goods and services is important to policymakers for several reasons1 first rising inflation is unpopular with the public in part because some households are more adve rsely affected by inflation than others second high or rising inflati on can reduce productivity by distorting price signals so that it is hard for businesses to tell if prices are changing in relative terms and by individuals wasting resources in order to maintain the purchasing power of their wealth finally inflation plays key role in macroeonomic stabilization policy changes in inflation often indicate changes in the business cycle rising inflation is often sign that the economy is overheating and falling inflation is sign that the economy is sluggish the federalhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22705crs2 2 for more information see

has focused attention on the core rate of inflation measure of inflation that excludes food and energy pri ces in explanations of its policy decisions for example in july 2007 the third senten ce of the 10sentence federal open market committee statement summarizing the committees policy decision read readings on core inflation have improved modestly in recent months in fed chairman ben bernankes july 2007 testimony to congress he stated that food and energy prices tend to be quite volatile so that looking forwar d core inflationmay be better gauge than overall inflation of underlying in flation trends when core inflation approached 3 in 2006 chairman bernanke said that it had reach ed level that if sustained would be at or above the upper end of the range that many economists including myself would consider consistent with price stability3 this report defines core inflation reviews recent trends and analyzes the advantages and drawbacks of using core inflation definition official measure of inflation exists inflation is measured as the percent change in price index several indices track price changes with each data series measuring something different the most commonly cited measure of inflation is the percent change in the consumer price index cpi 4 this index measures the price of basket of consumer goods and services that is represen tative of overall consumer purchases in urban areas when food and energy prices are mitted from the cpi the remaining basket is commonly referred to as the core cpi the overall measure of cpi which includes food and energy is often referred to as the headline cpi another common measure of inflation is the percent change in the gdp gross domestic product price deflator which is used to transform nominal gdp into real gdp since the gdp deflator is based on the prices of all goods and services in the econom it is broader measure of inflation than the cpi subset of the gdp deflator that is conceptually similar to the cpi but includes more items and areas is the personal consumption expend itures pce price deflator for technical reasons the fed sometimes prefers th is measure to the cpi in their analyses core measures of the gdp and pce deflators are also available conceptually core inflation could be any measure of inflation that attempts to strip out price volatility but the most common finition of core strips out only two particularly volatile categories of goods food and energy the four most volatile items in the cpi are all food or energy products5 the standard deviation of energy prices ishttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22705crs3 5 continued economic review 20022 p 5 the four most volatile items are fuel oil motor fuel meats and dairy products and fruits and vegetables 6 seamus smyth why care about core goldman sachs us daily financial market comment september 7 2006 7 william gavin and rachel mandal predicting inflation food for thought federal reserve bank of st louis regional economist january 2002estimated to be 12 times higher than overall inflation6 omitting food and energy prices from the cpi is not trivial modification food and beverages accounted for 15 of the headline cpi basket and energy acc ounted for an additional 9 in 2006 while excluding food from core inflation has become conventi onal it may longer be warranted the volatility of food has decreased significantly since the 1970s7 until 2007 the r ecent divergence between headline and core inflation was driven by energy prices in 2007 food prices rose rapidly it is too soon to tell whether this development marks renewed period of pers istent volatility if food pri ces are longer volatile then policymakers may be losing useful information by omitting them recent inflation trends in recent years headline inflation has typi cally outpaced core inflation as seen in figure 1 because of the rapid rise in energy prices in 2007 headline inflation was also driven up by 39 increase in food prices the difference between core and headline has not always been trivial from 2003 to 2006 core inflation was 09 percentage points lower than headline considering that the fed judges 2 inflation to be on the low side and 3 inflation on the high side the defin ition used in these years would have arguably strongly colored their policy stance the difference between core and headline inflation over this period was overwhelmingly the result of energy prices which rose by an average of 128 year as measured by the cpi source bureau of labor statistics01234 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 headline corefigure 1 inflation rate 19982007httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22705crs4 8 of course volatility is lower over longer time horizons so policymakers also judge inflationary pressures by looking at say the 12month change in inflation rather than the onemonth change in 2006 the 12month change in headline infla tion varied between 13 to 43 and 12month core inflation varied between 21 and 29when should headline inflation be used when comparing purchasing power over two time periods headline inflation is the relevant measure comparisons over time of wages wealth rates of return government transfers such as social security payments and so on should all use headline measure of inflation because all of these concepts depend on broad measure of inflation for example adjusting household income by core inflation would not be useful since food and energy consumption account for about one quarter of average household expenditures similarly government programs and parts of the tax code that are adjusted for inflation are based on headline inflation economic grow th is also calculated by first adjusting gdp by headline inflation when should core inflation be used core inflation is used by policymakers fo r the reason offered by chairman bernanke in the introduction policymakers are most cerned about the future path of inflation and current core inflation data may give better information than current headline data about future headline inflation headline in flation often does not have good predictive power over shorttime periods because food nd energy prices are so volatile for example the monthly headlin inflation rate varied be tween 63 and 75 in 2006 at annualized rates whereas the core rate varied between 12 and 368 policymakers are concerned with future inflation because of lags between change in policy and its effect on the economy in essence it is already too late for policy to influence current inflation policy change today can only affect future inflation theoretically shortterm changes in infl ation can be caused by the supplyside or demandside of the economy when rising inflation is demand driven it means that spending is growing too quickly in the overall economy and production cannot keep pace this phenomenon is captured in the famous saying too much money chasing too few goods the feds task is to counteract this by raising interest rates in order to reduce the growth rate of interestsensitive spending likewise if spending is rising too slowly inflation will fall which the fed can c ounteract by reducing interest rates in the short run the overall inflation rate can also be affected by sharp price changes of individual goods caused by supply shocks for example bad weather can drive up food prices or reduction in the oil supply can drive up energy prices since these supply shocks are temporary they should not have any lasting effect on inflation holding aggregate spending constant in which case they can be ignored by policymakers in the long run price shocks on the supply side s hould cancel each other out since across all goods there will be an equal number of pos itive and negative surprises and average inflation should be comp letely demand driven ideally policymakers would like to be able to identify whether any change in inflation was demanddriven or supplydriven unfortunately there is straightforwardhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22705crs5 9 brian motley should monetary policy focus on core inflation federal reserve bank of san francisco economic letter 9711 april 1997 10 frederic mishkin headline versus core infl ation in the conduct of monetary policy speech at the business cycles international transm ission and macroeconomic policies conference montreal canada october 20 2007way to do this so they have commonly used core inflation as proxy for demanddriven inflation reasoning that food and energy ar two sectors of the economy that are most susceptible to supply shocks furthermore policymakers are partic ularly concerned with inflationary expectations and rising core rate may be better sign than rising headline that inflationary exp ectations have risen relying on core inflation for policymaking has its drawbacks however there is inherent reason that changes in food and ergy prices cannot be caused by changes in aggregate demand for example rapid spendi ng growth could push up energy prices if supply does not rise in response in fact an argument has been made that change in aggregate demand would first show up in pr ice changes of goods that have flexible pricing such as commodities that are trad ed on financial markets where prices change continually to clear the market9 both energy and basic foods tuffs are traded on financial markets although the cpi measures fi nal food and energy products not basic commodities furthermore rise in the price of any one good need not lead to change in inflation if the prices of other goods fall to offset it technically if rise in one price leads to rise in overall inflation it must be becau of some accommodation on the feds part because it did not raise interest rates enoug h to induce other prices to fall most economists believe that some accommodation to relative price changes is desirable because it reduces the volatility of economic growth whereas zero accommodation could lead to needless disruptions in economic ac tivity for example fed governor frederic mishkin used the feds macro model of the us economy to show that when the fed reacts to changes in headline inflation instead of core inflation future inflation will be slightly less volatile but unemployment will be significantly more volatile10 but if the fed accommodates rise in the price of one good too much then the price of all goods could start rising in other words rise in headline inflation could feed through to higher core inflation this scenario occurred in th 1970s where rising energy prices resulted in rise in total inflation in scenarios like this one focus on core inflation could forestall needed policy change until it is too late indeed case can be made today that more of focus on headline inflation would have avoided the pers istent upward trend in core inflation that has occurred from 2003 to 2007 and brought core inflation above the feds selfdefined comfort zone the weakness with the focus on core inflation is that when energy prices rise continually for period of several ears they longer represent random price fluctuations that offer usef ul information about future in flation as result too much monetary policy accommodation may have taken place recently causing the economy to overheat future events will reveal if this is the case or if the rise in core inflation can be painlessly reversed without recessionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22705crs6 11 robert rich and charles steindel review of core inflation and an evaluation of its measures federal reserve bank of new york

measures of core infla tion federal reserve bank of kansas city economic review 20022 p 5in the end the question of what measure of inflation is best for policymaking is an empirical one one study found that core measure does an outstanding job forecasting headline cpi inflationwe find st rong evidence to suggest that selected core measure will be able to re tain its usefulness as tool to forecast inflation for any given period11 another study did not find st atistically significant relationship between core inflation and future headline inflation although the relationship becomes significant when limited to more recent time period12 two other studies found that headline inflation is better predictor of future headline inflation than core inflation13 an explanation for this finding is that during the past 10 years changes in core inflation have tended to lag behind changes in headline inflation as illustrated in figure 1 one study found that core measur that excludes only energy was better predictor of future inflation from 1983 to 2001 than measure excludi ng food and energy in fact that study found food prices to be better predictor of future inflation than any other measure including core inflation14 some studies suggest that there may be more sophisticated measurements that are better gauges of underlyi ng inflationary pressures than the standard definition of core inflation15 core inflation has the adva ntage from policy perspective however of being transparent whereas the more sophisticated measurements could be hard for the public to understand and open to accusations of data min ing or manipulation while this advantage may make core inflati on useful tool for communicating fed policy to the public the empirical evidence suggests it to be by itself an inadequate tool for policymaking
