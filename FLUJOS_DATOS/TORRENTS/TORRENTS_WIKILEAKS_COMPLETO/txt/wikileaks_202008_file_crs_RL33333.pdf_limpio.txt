behind act jeﬀrey j kuenzi domestic social policy division january 28 2008 abstract this report examines implementation of nclb requirement and estimates the extent to which schools will achieve the goal of placing highly qualiﬁed teacher in every classroom after describing the highly qualiﬁed teacher requirement in detail the report analyzes data from national survey of schools that provide information on teacher qualiﬁcations and subjects taught these data suggest that more than four out of ﬁve teachers would have met nclb deﬁnition of highly qualiﬁed teacher prior to the date of enactment the analysis also reveals diﬀerences between highly qualiﬁed and underqualiﬁed teachers both in terms of the teachers characteristics and the characteristics of the schools in which they teach the ﬁndings have important implications for future policymaking in the area of teacher quality the report concludes with discussion of issues that may be considered as the elementary and secondary education act reauthorization process unfolds these provisions along with the rest of the elementary and secondary education act will likely be considered for reauthorization by the 110th

act of 2001 nclb is to raise the achievement of students who currently fail to meet gradelevel proficiency standards since student achievement is believed by many to depend in large part on effective teaching the law also contains provisions designed to improve teacher quality these provisions establish minimum teacher quality requirements and charge states and school districts with developing plans to meet them these plans are to ensure that all schools have highly qualified teacher in every classroom by the end of the 20052006 school year to be deemed highly qualified nclb requires that teachers possess baccalaureate degree and state teaching certificate and that teachers also demonstrate subjectmatter knowledge for their teaching level elementary school teachers must show knowledge of basic elementary school curricular areas middle and secondary school teachers must demonstrate high level of competency in all subject areas taught demonstration of subjectmatter knowledge and competency may be shown by passing state certification exam or licensing test in the relevant subjects this report examines implementation of nclb requirement and estimates the extent to which schools will achieve the goal of placing highly qualified teacher in every classroom after describing the highly qualified teacher requirement in detail the report analyzes data from national survey of schools that provide information on teacher qualifications and subjects taught these data suggest that more than four out of five teachers would have met nclb definition of highly qualified teacher

g343g561g11g151g157g155g152g141g158g140g157g146g152g151g561 it is widely believed that good teachers are critical to student learning large body of academic research has produced strong evidence that teacher quality is positively related to student performance however the strength of this research finding depends on the measure used to indicate quality studies that use credentials such as degree attainment or teacher certification show weaker impacts on student performance than studies that use direct measures of teachers pedagogical and subjectmatter knowledge 1 nevertheless credentials are more readily available to local school administrators that hire teachers and more easily incorporated into state and federal policy in recent years education policy governing the attainment of teaching credentials has evolved to incorporate pedagogy and subject expertise general state certification exams have been replaced or enhanced with testing for k nowledge of subject matter some states have developed multitiered knowledgebased certification systems teacher preparation programs in some states have begun requiring that candidates obtain major or minor in subject as prerequisite for or in conjunction with an education degree2 teaching credential reforms that incorporate subjectmatter knowledge have also been enacted in federal education policy most recently the elementary and secondary education act of 1965 esea as amended by the child left be hind act of 2001 nclb pl 107110 requires that all public school teachers in states participating in the esea title ia program for education of the disadvantaged be highly qualified by demonstrating subject knowledge for their teaching level elementary school teachers must show knowledge of basic elementary school curricular areas middle and secondary school teachers must demonstrate high level of competency in all subject areas taught subjectmatter knowledge and competency may be demonstrated by passing state certification exam or licensing test in the relevant subjects 3 one of the major goals of nclb is to raise the achievement of students who currently fail to meet gradelevel proficiency standards since student achievement has been shown to be dependent in large part on teacher quality the law seeks to improve achievement by setting higher minimum teacher quality requirements in complying with the law schools are prevented from hiring substandard teachers such as those with emergency or provisional certification those without baccalaureate degree or those with limited subject knowledge for some time it was thought that schools hired substandard teachers because shortage existed in the overall supply of qualified teachers that idea has been challenged in recent years by 1 michael b allen

g344g561research that revealed the shortage is in fact distribution problem some socalled hardto staff schools find it difficult to maintain staff of qualified teachers while other schools have an adequate supply and in some cases an oversupply of quality teachers4 the reasons for the uneven distribution in the teacher supply are still matter of debate some argue that rules providing priority in reassignment options to teachers with seniority and the late decision deadline given to resigning teachers relegates the leastqualified teachers to less desirable schools others point to working conditions and other factors that make these schools less desirable to quality teachers in the first place whatever the reasons for the uneven distribution of quality teachers the persistence of hardtostaff schools may undermine the impact of nclb teacher quality standards in reducing the student achievement gap this report examines implementation of nclb requirement of highly qualified teacher in every public school classroom the first section of the report describes the hqt requirement and how it has been specified through regulation guidance and policy statements issued by the education department ed in the second section the report analyzes data from national survey of schools to assess the extent to which they are meeting the nclb challenge finally the report discusses issues regarding these requirements that may be considered as the esea reauthorization process unfolds during the 110 th congress

definition of an hqt has two basic components first to be deemed highly qualified teacher must possess full state teaching certification ie must not have had any certification requirements waived on an emergency temporary or provisional basis as well as baccalaureate degree the second component of the definition is that an hqt must demonstrate subjectmatter knowledge in the areas that she or he teaches the manner in which teachers satisfy the second component depends on the extent of their teaching experience and the level at which they teach these subject knowledge requirements are as follows new elementary school teachers must pass rigorous state test demonstrating subject knowledge and teaching skills in reading writing math and other basic elementary school curricular areas 4

hqt definition through regulation nonregulatory guidance and other means in general these policy statements address concerns about the scope and application of the hqt requirem ents among wide variety of implementation issues ed has sought to clarify what constitutes core subject matter how states should develop and apply housse how the hqt requirements may be differentially applied to different types of teachers and in different types of educational settings and when various aspects of the requirement must be completed g21g158g139g147g142g140g157g561g15g138g157g157g142g155g561 early in the implementation of these provisions some asked whether they apply to all teachers including vocational education teachers special education teachers or others not teaching core academic subjects according to esea section 910111 the term core academic subjects means english reading or language arts mathematics science foreign languages civics and government economics arts history and geography final regulations for the title i program published on december 2 2002 in the federal register apply these requirements only to core academic subject teachers ed noted that these requirements would apply to vocational education teacher or special education teacher providing instruction in core academic subject 5 ed addressed other subject matter issues in subsequent guidance and policy letters march 2004 policy announcement modified earlier nonregulatory guidance issued in january 2004 which stated that science teachers teaching more than one field of science eg biology and 5 the

g346g561chemistry would have to be highly qualified in each of the fields taught under the new flexibility states determine whether science teachers need to be highly qualified in each science field they teach or highly qualified in science in general based on how the state currently certifies teachers in these subject areas this new flexibility along with other changes was incorporated into the latest revised non regulatory guidance issued on august 3 20056 the guidance clarifies that social studies is not considered core subject and that certification in social studies or possession of composite social studies degree does not necessarily indicate that teacher is highly qualified to teach related subjects eg economics and history states are to determine whether social science teacher is qualified to teach the specific subject he or she is assigned to teach

according to nclb teacher who is not new to the teaching profession may demonstrate subject matter knowledge through the states housse method in defining its housse the sea must set standards for both grade appropriate academic subject knowledge and teaching skills that are aligned with challenging state academic and student achievement standards the housse must provide objective information about teachers content knowledge in all subjects taught and be applied uniformly statewide to all teachers in the same subjects and grade levels finally the statute states that the housse may use multiple measures of teacher competency and may consider but not be based primarily on time teaching the relevant subjects nonregulatory guidance published on september 12 2003 included suggestions on the development of housse procedures according to the guidance states should consider several factors when developing their housse procedures including whether the proposed housse measures provide an objective way of determining whether teacher has adequate subject matter knowledge the latest august 2005 guidance defines new teachers as those with less than one year of teaching experience and teachers who are not new as those with more than one year of experience however the guidance indicates that states have the authority to determine who is new to the profession and who is not states ma also design their housse procedures to allow teacher to go through the process single time to demonstrate competency in multiple subjects

2002 final regulations indicated that teachers who were participating in an alternative certification program will be considered highly qualified on provisional basis such teachers have maximum of three years in which to become fully certified without being in violation of the highly qualified requirements regarding certification this allowance is made only for teacher in an alternative certification program who is receiving highquality professional development intensive supervision and is making satisfactory progress toward full certification 6 the most recently revised esea title

participation in international teacher exchange programs in policy letter issued on march 24 2003 the secretary addressed these concerns by indicating how teachers from other countries could be considered highly qualified in the state in which they teach the secretary pointed out that each state has the full authority to define and enforce its own requirements for certification and licensure and make accommodations for foreign teachers accommodations could also be made in developing tests and other ways of demonstrating subjectmatter expertise in making this point the secretary clarified that one such demonstration provided in the law is coursework equivalent to an academic major these changes were included in the september 2003 updated guidance along with clarification on the issue of middle school teachers when determining whether teachers of core academic subjects in grades 6 through 8 should meet co mpetency requirements for elementary or middle school teachers the guidance advises states to examine the degree of rigor and technicality of the subject matter that teacher will need to know in relation to the states content standards and academic achievement standards for the subjects in those grade levels in addition states may choose to consider teachers with middle school certification to be highly qualified and states may approve tests that are specifically developed for middle school teachers if the tests are rigorous contentarea assessments that are developed specifically for middle school teachers and aligned with middle school content and academic standards g6g146g143g143g142g155g142g151g157g561g21g142g157g157g146g151g144g156g561 in march 31 2004 policy letter the secretary announced that additional flexibility could be applied in the implementation of the hqt requirem ents with regard to teachers in small rural school districts 7 in small rural districts ed provided that teachers teaching core academic subjects who meet the highly qualified requirements in at least one of the subject areas they teach may have an additional three years to meet these requirements in the other subjects they might teach for current teachers this

rural teachers may have until the end of the 2006 2007 school year for newly hired teachers full threeyear grace period can be provided from the date of hiring but those newly hired teachers will have to be highly qualified in one of their core subject areas when hired states decide whether to offer this flexibility to eligible rural districts section 910123 states that charter school teachers must meet the requirements set forth in the states public charter school law eds guidance clarifies that this only refers to the requirements for certification and indicates that such teachers must meet all other hqt requirements the guidance also states that teachers in juvenile nd correctional institutions or other alternative settings must meet hqt standards only if such settings are considered

letter to chief state school officers dated october 21 2005 the letter also announced additional flexibility in meeting the hqt deadline the secretary stated that the letters purpose was to assure you that states that do not quite reach the 100 goal by the end of the 20052006 school year will not lose federal funds if they are implementing the law and making goodfaith effort to reach the hqt goal in nclb as soon as possible10 instead states that meet the laws requirements and the departments expectations in these areas but fall short of having highly qualified teac hers in every classroom

aforementioned problems with state hqt data systems the only source of reliable information on teacher quality comes from survey data the schools and staffing survey sass conducted by eds national center for education statistics collects data on teacher school and district characteristics from very large representative sample of schools throughout the country11 this analysis uses sass data collected during the 19992000 school year12 the survey asked teachers who taught during that school year series of questions about their teaching experience assignments education and certification the sass survey estimates that just under 3 million teachers were employed during the 1999 2000 school year13 that was the first year of teaching for roughly 173000 58 of the 3 million teachers virtually all teachers 993 held baccalaureate degree at the time of the survey the large majority 959 also held some form of state teaching certification most teachers 914 were employed fulltime in 19992000 of the remainder 30 worked part time 35 split time between more than one school and 22 were nonregular teachers consisting mostly of administrators and librarians who also taught class that year the latter group are omitted from the analysis in this report 14 some teachers teach more than one grade level and school districts vary in how they combine grade levels however ed has developed scheme to uniformly classify teachers across the country as either elementary middle or secondary 15 in 19992000 43 of teachers were classified as elementary 26 as middle 30 as secondary and 1 as other nearly onethird of all teachers 297 did not teach core academic subject during the 19992000 school year16 these noncore teachers are not subject to the hqt requirement and are omitted from this analysis17 11 the sample is drawn from eds common core of data which contains virtually every school in the country 12 data from the 20032004 survey are currently being analyzed and will be incorporated in forthcoming update of this report 13 this figure does not include those employed as teacher aides or paraprofessionals although nclb does contain separate series of requirements for professional quality individuals employed to assist teachers were not included in the sass sample 14 since the use of longterm substitutes has received some atte ntion it is worth noting that 043 or 12826 of all 3 million teachers were employed as longterm substitutes ed guidance recommends that substitutes meet hqt requirements however states need only notify parents if their child has been taught by nonhqt substitute for more than four consecutive months 15 teachers were assigned by sass programmers in manner consistent with the assignment of sc hools to elementary middle and secondary levels developed

kindergartenelementary art mathematics social studies english or language arts foreign languages and science although social studies is not contained in the statutory language it is used in this analysis because it encompasses subjects that are in the statute namely economics history and geography 17 special education teachers who teach core subject are required to be hqt however most were omitted from this analysis due to the sass instrument design one in ten 114 of all teachers reported special education as one of their subjects taught but only 11 of all teachers reported teaching

subject and 339000 164 taught two subjects18 nine in ten single subject teachers 914 reported that they held full state certification in the subject they taught19 half of all twosubject teachers 499 reported that they held full state certification in both of their subjects taken together 845 of all single and twosubject teachers held baccalaureate degree and reported being certified in the subjects they teach since nclb considers state certification in all fields taught adequate demonstration of subjectmatter knowledge these data suggest that prior to the passage of nclb more than eight out of ten teachers met the hqt requirement table 1 presents the qualifications of core subject teachers for the 19992000 school year an additional 31 of all teachers were participating in an alternative certification program at the time of the survey such teachers have three years to complete their program and become fully certified another 61 of all teachers taught two subjects but only held certification in one about one in 10 of these teachers were located in leas eligible for participation in the small rural school achievement srsa program esea title vib 20 according to the guidance discussed above these teachers have additional time to demonstrate subjectmatter knowledge in the field in which they are not highly qualifiedone year in the case of veteran teachers and three years for new teachers thus total of 35 of all 19992000 teachers would have been temporarily deemed highly qualified teachers combining those in alternative certification programs and those in

included in this analysis 18 additional analysis of sass data reveal that only small fraction less that 2 of these teachers taught more than two subjects in 19992000 therefore the analysis in this report only considers teachers first two teaching assignments 19 it is important to note that the sass data are selfreported the responding teachers were simply asked whether they were certified in the subjects they taught at the time of the survey handful of states did not include subjectmatter testing as part of their certification ex ams and several other states only recently instituted subjectmatter testing thus it is difficult to determine how many of these teachers have demonstrated subjectmatter knowledge through testing the proportion meeting the hqt requirement may be lower than the sass data predict however review of preliminary hqt data made available on states report cards suggest that the sass overestimation will not be substantial this assessment was also corroborated by anecdotal evidence from ed monitoring visits according to february 27 2006 phone conversation with an ed official 20 as mentioned earlier multiplesubject teachers in srsa sc hools who are hqt in one subject have up to three years to become highly qualified in the other subjects they teach

administrator others have regular peer evaluations in addition to an administrators evaluation some states allow for consideration of past performance evaluations those receiving an acceptable level of performance are considered to meet the highly qualified requirement g18g155g152g143g142g156g156g146g152g151g138g149g561g3g140g157g146g159g146g157g146g142g156g561 most state housse plans include three major categories of activities that count toward achieving hqt status coursework teaching experience and professional development in many states collegelevel coursework in the area in which the teacher is assigned can be counted toward meeting all or part of the requirement in states using point system points are often awarded in relation to the number of credit hours fulfilled possession of baccalaureate major and the attainment of an advanced degree in the subject taught usually carries additional weight most states also give teachers credit toward meeting the hqt standard for their years of teaching experience some states require that performance evaluations accompany documentation of this experience and only give credit for years taught with positive evaluations points may be awarded for years or groups of years and are usually capped finally states usually count professional development activities toward meeting their hou sse requirement these activities may include participation in workshops on teaching content work toward national board certification and involvement in schoolteacher leadership

amend the esea along with the hqt requirements will likely occur during the 110th congress numerous proposals have already been forwarded that cover number of important issues likely to be raised during the reauthorization process most of these proposals would amend the hqt definition or make exceptions for certain teachers or schools many of the proposals make changes similar to the waivers and increased flexibility already announced by ed g15g158g149g157g146g153g149g142g561g21g158g139g147g142g140g157g561g22g142g138g140g145g142g155g156g561 although the analysis in this report indicates that less than one in five teachers teaches more than one subject those who did teach more than one subject were much less likely to be hqt among multiple subject teachers in this analysis half did not meet the hqt standard this small group fewer than six percent of all teachersmay present large problem for schools and states attempting to meet the 100 hqt requirement solutions have been proposed for certain kinds of schools such as rural and hardtostaff schools discussed below however some proposals seek to address the problem for teachers in all schools generally these amendments would allow teachers teaching multiple subjects to demonstrate knowledge in one subject area using the existing methods and provide second method for other subjects taught for example multiple subject teachers who are hqt in one of their subjects could be given certain amount of time to accumulate coursework equivalent to an academic minor in the subjects for which they lack sufficient knowledge 22

of subject matter in nclb specifically section 910111 of the statute states that the term core academic subjects means english reading and language arts mathematics science foreign languages civics and government economics arts history and geography as mentioned earlier ed addressed issues related to science and social studies teachers in its nonregulatory guidance states were given the authority to determine whether teachers qualified to teach in one field of science or social studies were qualified in other fields in those areas some have proposed legislative solutions that would recognize generalist certificates in these and other areas as proof of subjectmatter knowledge g15g146g141g141g149g142g561g21g140g145g152g152g149g561g22g142g138g140g145g142g155g156g561 many of the teachers found not to meet the hqt standard in this analysis were teaching middle school students the problem posed by this group of teachers is that some have duties similar to elementary teachers while others are more like secondary school teachers that is some middle school teachers work in socalled selfcontained classroom settings where they are responsible for teaching multiple subjects to the same group of students meanwhile other middle school teachers work in departmental settings in which they teach the same subject to different groups of students over the course of single day acco rding to nclb middle school teachers are to be treated like secondary school teachers with regard to demonstration of subjectmatter expertise thus those teaching multiple subjects in selfcontained classrooms must be certified to teach in several subjectsor prove subject knowledge in each area by the other permitted means the proposals to recognize generalist certification mentioned above would remedy this problem other proposals include expanding the allowable types of experience and forms of evaluation permitted in state housse methods for veteran middle school teachers

schools are largely defined as those located in areas classified as rural according to the us census bureau locale codes however other evidence suggests that rural schools are among the socalled hardtostaff schools which will have an especially difficult time meeting the 100 hqt requirement 23 part of the explanation for the disparity between these two conclusions rests in the definition of rurality specifically ed analysis has found the census locale code classifications of rural areas to be at best crude and in some cases grossly inaccurate24 one proposal would give rural schools until the 20092010 school year to meet the hqt deadline however the proposal would provide this option only to srsa schools another proposal would give the secretary the authority to waive the hqt requirement for any rural school that could demonstrate that the requirement would impose an undue hardship on the school because of population and geographic constraints 23 based on anecdotal

g343g348g561this analysis revealed that central city schools have the highest rates of uqts additional analysis has shown that schools in poor ne ighborhoods also have higher rates of uqts25 although legislative amendments have been proposed to address issues regarding urban or poor schools some of the proposals presented here that concern hardtostaff schools could be adopted to relieve the burden imposed by the hqt requirement however given the high turnover rates at these schools shortterm waivers and deadline extensions may not provide sufficient relief at the same time such flex ibility might weaken nclbs emphasis on improving instructional qualityespecially for disadvantaged pupils attending schools in high poverty areas
