the financial services regulatory relief ac t of 2006 pl 109351 new financial services regulatory relief measures were introduced in the 110th congress1 reducing the regulatory burde n on financial service provi ders has been an ongoinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22924crs2 concern since the passage of the economic growth and regulatory paperwork reduction act egrpra 110 stat 3009394 mandating that financial regulators review their regulations at least once every 10 years in an effort to eliminate any regulatory requirements that are outda ted unnecessary or unduly burd ensome in addition the intended purpose of regulatory relief is to enhance the services provided by depository institutions and to contain the growing costs of regulatory compliance the experience of prior congresses has shown that bills incorporating provisions that would reduce regulatory requirements on banks thrifts and credit unions tend to receive stronger support or less opposition than legislative proposal s that address the i ndustries separately hr 6312 is viewed as co mpromise bill drafted to attract support from advocates for both the bankingthrift and the credit union i ndustries the legislation like pl 109351 provides some but not all of the change s sought separately by advocates for the bankingthrift and the credit union industries therefore even if hr 6312 is enacted the industries interests in regulatory relief are likely to continue an overview of hr 6312 the credit union bank and thrift regula tory relief act of 2008 hr 6312 was introduced on june 19 2008 by representativ kanjorski and

depository institutions paying interest on checking accounts by walter w eubanks pp 1 7a biennial survey of retail banking fees rvices and products provi ded by insured banks thrifts and credit unions the proposal details certain information that must be included in the survey the proposal includes the require ment for biennial report to congress it would also amend the financial institutions reform recovery and enforcement act of 1989 and the riegleneal interstate banking and branching efficiency act of 1994 to repeal certain re porting requirements reactions to hr 6312 the proposed credit union bank and thrift regulatory relief act of 2008 is viewed by many as compromise between the positions taken by credit union and the banking industries this compromise was reached af ter the banking industry launched an intense lobbying effort against the credit union regu latory relief act hr 5519 and the credit union regulatory improvement act hr 1537 which would have expanded the definition of the field of membership allowing more credit unions to provide financial services in unserved areas increased the cap on member business lending allowing credit unions to make more business loans and instituted riskbased system of prompt corrective action which would allow credit unions use their capital more efficiently and increase their capacity to make more loans the banking industry saw these provisions as making credit unions more competitive with banks in addition to the tax exemption they already possess the compromise was reached after the cred it union industry modified its definition of underserved areas by reducing them in ddition hr 6312 would lift the cap on member business loans less than it was lifted in the ear lier legislation and would drop the riskbased system perhaps what was most important was that the compromise added the provisions of the bank regulatory relief act of 2008 hr 5841 the banki ng industrys own regulatory relief bill that d already passed the house the resulting hr 6312 has the support of the credit union national associa tion the independent community bankers of america and the american bankers association2 one provision in hr 6312 that was opposed in the past by some small banking institutions is the provision to pay interest on business checking accounts as mentioned above current law prohibits the payment of interest on checking account because banks are required to keep higher reserve balance on transaction accounts as these deposits can be withdrawn at anytime smaller depository institutions that are failing at higher rate than larger ones are likely to be even less profitable if they are required to pay interest on business checking accounts3
