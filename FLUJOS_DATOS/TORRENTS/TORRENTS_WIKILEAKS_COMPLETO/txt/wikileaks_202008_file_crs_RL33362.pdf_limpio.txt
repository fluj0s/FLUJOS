federal unemployment tax act futa and by state payroll taxes under the state unemployment tax acts suta the uc program has direct impact on almost every business in the united states as most businesses are subject to state and federal unemployment taxes an estimated 73 billion in federal unemployment taxes and 322 billion in state unemployment taxes were collected in fy2008 approximately 1334 million jobs are covered by the uc program in december 2008 51 million unemployed workers received uc benefits in given week and the average weekly uc benefit amount was 297 in fy2008 states spent an estimated 381 billion on regular uc benefits and an additional 41 million on eb payments in fy2008 the federal appropriation for administration of the uc program was 27 billion originally the intent of the uc program among other things was to help counter economic fluctuations such as recessions 3 this intent is reflected in the current uc programs funding and benefit structure when the economy grows uc program revenue rises through increased tax revenues while uc program spending falls as fewer workers are unemployed the effect of collecting more taxes than are spent dampens demand in the economy this also creates surplus of funds or cushion of available funds for the uc program to draw upon during recession in recession uc tax revenue falls and uc program spending rises as more workers lose their jobs and receive uc benefits the increased am ount of uc payments to unemployed workers dampens the economic effect of earnings losses by injecting additional funds into the economy

federal laws and regulations provide broad guidelines on uc benefit coverage eligibility and benefit determination the specifics of regular uc benefits are determined by each state this results in essentially 53 different programs states determine uc benefit eligibility payments and duration through state laws and program regulations generally uc eligibility is based on attaining qualified wages and employment in covered work over 12month period called base period g4g138g156g142g561g18g142g155g146g152g141g561 the base period is the time period during which wages earned andor hoursweeks worked are examined to determine workers monetary entitlement to uc almost all states use the first 4 of the last 5 completed calendar quarters preceding the filing of the claim as their base period because base period employment andor earnin gs are an imperfect proxy for labor market attachment there are some instances when workers with substantial labor market attachment are ineligible for uc benefits federal law allows states to develop expanded definitions of the base period g3g149g157g142g155g151g138g157g146g159g142g561g4g138g156g142g561g18g142g155g146g152g141g561g507g3g4g18g508g561 base period consisting of the first 4 of the last 5 completed calendar quarters results in lag of up to five months between the end of the base period and the date worker becomes unemployed as result the workers most recent work history is not used when making an eligibility determination thus several states use an abp for workers failing to qualify under the regular base period for example if the worker fails to qualify using wages and employment in the first 4 of the last 5 completed calendar quarters then the state might use wages and employment in the last 4 completed calendar quarters

employment under certain conditions these conditions typically involve illness or injury for example worker who was injured on the job and who has collected workers compensation benefits may use wages and employment preceding the date of the workers injury to establish eligibility

have worked for certain period of time or both within the base pe riod to be monetarily eligible to receive any uc benefits the methods that states use to determine monetary eligibility vary greatly multiple of highquarter wages under this method workers must earn certain dollar amount in the quarter with the highest earnings of their base period workers must also earn total base period wages that are multipletypically 15of the highquarter wages for example if worker earns 5000 in the high quarter the worker must earn at least another 2500 in the rest of the base period states require earnings in more than one quarter to minimize the likelihood that workers with high earnings in only one quarter receive benefits although the worker might be monetarily eligible through the earnings accrued in one quarter these multiple of high quarter wages states do not deem those workers to be substantially attached to the labor market multiple of weekly benefit amount under this method the state first computes the workers weekly benefit amount the worker must have earned multipleoften 40of this amount during the base period for example if workers weekly benefit amount equals 100 then the worker will need base period earnings of 40 mes 100 or 4000 before any uc would be paid most states also require wages in at least two quarters some states have weighted schedules that require varying multiples for varying weekly benefits flat qualifying amount states using this method require certain dollar amount of total wages to be earned during the base period this method is used by most states with an annualwage requirement for determining the weekly benefit and by some states with highquarter wageweekly benefit requirement weekshours of employment under this method the worker

wide variation seen in state uc program laws and regulations also exists among the states data collections all states collect information on earnings by quarter for each worker handful of states collect information on the number of weeks worked during the base period even fewer states collect information on the numbers of hours worked during quarter as result most states use information on quarters worked quarterly earnings and cumulative earnings in determining eligibility and the amount of benefit 4 it does not appear that any state measures both hours of work and weeks of work in the

established by the federalstate extended unemployment compensation act of 1970 euca pl 91373 26 usc 3304 note euca may extend receipt of unemployment benefits extended benefits at the state level if certain economic situations exist within the state the eb program is currently active only in alaska north carolina oregon all up to 13 weeks and rhode island up to 20 weeks the eb program is triggered when states insured unemployment rate iur 11 or total unemployment rate tur12 reaches certain levels all states must pay up to 13 weeks of eb if the iur for the previous 13 weeks is at least 5 and is 120 of the average of the rates for the same 13week period in each of the 2 previous ears there are two other optional thresholds that states may choose states may chose one two or none if the state has chosen the option they would provide the following option 1 an additional 13 weeks of benefits if the states iur is at least 6 regardless of previous years averages option 2 an additional 13 weeks of benefits if the states tur is at least 65 and is at least 110 of the states average tur for the same 13weeks in either of the previous two years an additional 20 weeks of benefits if the tur is at least 8 and is at least 110 of the states average tur for the same 13weeks in either of the previous two years each states iur and tur are determined by the state of residence agent state of the unemployed worker rather than by the state of employment liable state g7g4g561g7g149g146g144g146g139g146g149g146g157g162g561 eb program imposes additional federal restrictions on individual eligibility for benefits beyond the state requirements for regular uc the eb program requires that worker be actively searching and available for work furthermore the worker may not receive benefits if the worker refused an offer of suitable work finally pl 9735 among other items amended the euca to require that claimants work at least 20 weeks of fulltime insured employment or equivalent in insured wages during their base period 11 the iur is the ratio of uc claimants divided by individuals in uccovered jobs the iur is substantially different than the tur because it excludes several important groups selfemployed workers unpaid family workers workers in certain notforprofit organizations and several other primarily seasonal categories of workers in addition to those unemployed workers whose last jobs were in the excluded employment the insured unemployed rate excludes the following those who have exhausted their uc benefits new entrants or reentrants to the labor force disqualified workers whose unemployment is considered to have resulted from their own actions rather than from economic conditions and eligible unemployed persons who do not file for benefits 12 the tur is the ratio of unemployed workers to all work ers in the labor market the tur is essentially weekly version of the unemployment rate published by the bureau of labor statistics that is the ratio of the total number of unemployed persons divided by the total number of employed and unemployed persons

states use one two or three different methods for determining an equivalent to 20 weeks of fulltime insured employment these methods are described in both law section 202a5 of the euca and regulation 20 cfr 6154b in practi ce states that require any of these three requirements for receipt of regular uc benefits and do not allow for exceptions to those requirements do not need to establish that the worker met the 20 weeks fulltime insured employment13 the three methods are listed below earnings in the base period equal to at least 15 times the highquarter wages or earnings in the base period of at least 40 times the most recent weekly benefit amount and if this alternative is adopted it shall use the weekly benefit amount including dependents allowances payable for week of total unemployment before any reduction because of earnings pensions or other requirements that applied to the most recent week of regular benefits or earnings in the base period equal to at least 20 weeks of fulltime insured employment and if this alternative is adopted the term fulltime shall have the meaning provided by the state law the base period may be the regular base period or if applicable in the state the period may be the alternative base period or the extended base period if that determined the regular uc benefit the underlying reasoning behind the requirements seems to be the following because there are 13 weeks in quarter 15 times the highquarter wage is roughly equivalent to 15 times 13 weeks of wages or about 20 weeks of wages many states require high quarterly earnings of under 2000 which works out to less than 4hour under fulltime assumptions this is less than the federal minimum wage of 585hour similarly because the weekly benefit amount is roughly equivalent to half the average weekly wage 40 times the weekly benefit amount is roughly equivalent to 20 weeks of wages g7g4g561g4g142g151g142g143g146g157g156g561g138g151g141g561g6g158g155g138g157g146g152g151g561 the eb

applicants must have been eligible for regular uc benefits and have exhausted their rights to regular uc compensation with respect to benefit year that expired during or after the week of may 6 200719 for most states this would apply to indi viduals who had filed uc claims with an effective date of may 7 2006 or later for the state of new york this would apply to original claims filed with an

must be exhausted to be eligible for euc08 benefits although federal laws and regulations provide broad guidelines on regular uc benefit coverage and eligibility determination the specifics of regular uc benefits are determined by each state this results in 53 different programs21 in particular states determine uc benefit eligibility amount and duration through state laws and program regulations generally regular uc eligibility is based on attaining qualified wages and employment in covered work over 12month period called base period conditional on earnings amounts and number of quarters worked in the base period an individual may qualify for as little as one week of uc benefits in some states or as ma ny as 26 weeks in other states individuals with higher earnings and multiple quarters of work history will generally receive higher uc benefits for longer period of time22

in addition to all state requirements for regula r uc eligibility the euc08 program requires claimants to have at least 20 weeks of fulltime insured employment or the equivalent in insured wages in their base period the definition of 20 weeks is discussed earlier in the extended benefit eb program portion of this report 19 arkansas has unique approach to calculating benefit year in arkansas the benefit year begins the first day of the quarter in which an individual files valid uc claim thus it is unlikely that many individuals in arkansas who filed uc claims before july 2006 would be eligible to r eceive euc08 benefits 20 note that the effective date is not necessarily the actual date when an individual filed for uc claim filed on may 10 2006 may have had an earlier effective date if state allows retroactive claims 21 the 50 states the district of columbia puerto rico and the virgin islands provide uc benefits to their workers 22 individuals in the massachusetts and montana uc programs may have regular uc durations that exceed 26 weeks those additional weeks are not used to calculate euc08 duration

temporary and tier 1 of euc08 applies to all states the eb program is permanently authorized and applies only to certain states on the basis of state economic conditions specified in law the euc08 program allows states to determine which benefit is paid first thus states may choose to pay euc08 before eb or vice versa states balance the decision of which benefit to pay first by comparing the potential cost savings to the state to the potential loss of unemployment benefits for unemployed individuals in the state it may be less costly for the state to choose to pay for the euc08 benefit first as the euc08 benefit is 100 fe derally financed whereas the eb benefit is 50 state financed 23 however if the state opts to pay euc08 first individuals in 23 some recipients may find jobs before

be eligible for uc benefits except for injuries directly resulting from the disaster that make them unavailable for work would receive dua benefits in an amount quivalent to what they would have received under the uc system if they were not injured and available to work in all cases workers will receive dua benefit that is at least half of the average uc benefit for that state and cannot
