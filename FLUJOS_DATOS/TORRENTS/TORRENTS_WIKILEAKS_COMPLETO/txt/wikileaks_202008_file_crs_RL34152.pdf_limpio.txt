imports have been increasing significantly raising questions about whether us safegu ards generally established at time when most americans obtained thei r foods domestically sufficiently protect

combined efforts of the food industry and the regulatory agencies often are credited with making the us food supply among the safest in the world nonetheless public health officials have estimated that each year in the united states 76 million people become sick 325000 are hospitalized and 5000 die from foodborne illnesses caused by contamination from any one of number of microbial pathogens1 food safetyrelated incident s frequently heighten pub lic and media scrutiny of the us food safety system in general as number of developments in 2006 and 2007 have illustrated for example more than 200 confirmed illne sses and three deaths were linked in the autumn of 2006 to the consumption of bagged fresh spinach grown in california and carrying the bacterium coli o157h7 the incident raised public concerns about the sa fety of all fresh leafy pr oduce and stimulated number of industry and government initiatives to limit future c ontamination large recalls of various meat and poultry pr oducts due to findings of coli o157h7 listeria and other problems occurred throughout 2007 in february of that year the us food and drug administrati on fda announced nationwide recall of peter pan and great value brands peanut butter pr oduced in georgia conagra plant due to salmonella contamination after hundr eds of illnesses dating back to august 2006 and linked to the bacterium were reported by public health officials at issue is whether the current food safe ty system has the resources authority and structural organization to safeguard the health of american consumers who spend more than 1 trillion on food each year2 also at issue is whether federal food safety laws first enacted in the early 1900s have kept pace with the significant changes that have occurred in the food pr oduction processing nd marketing sectors since then attention shifted to the safety of food imports in early 2007 when pet food ingredients imported from china sickened or killed an unknown number of

affecting the national agriculture or food infrastructure and s additional routine f ood safety inspection responsibilities at us borders8 congressional jurisdiction congressional oversight of the diverse fe deral food safety system is further complicated because of the number of co mmittees that have jurisdiction over one or more aspects for example the congressional authorizing committees that direct fda activities are those with jurisdicti on over public health issues the senate committee on health education labor nd pensions and the house committee on energy and commerce other committees that exercise oversight roles regarding fda include the house committee on oversight and government reform and the senate committees on aging homeland security and the judiciary with regard to fsis authorization and oversight the house and senate agriculture committees have primary jurisdiction annual funding decisions originate in the house and nate appropriations subcommittees on agriculture rural development fda and related agencies which have jurisdiction not only over fs is usda agency but also over fdas appropriations this latter arrangement reflects in part the agencys origin within the department of agriculture as the bureau of chemistry in 1862 since 1940 however fda has been administratively part of federal public health agencies specifically hhs and its predecessors administration food safety strategy the administration released on novemb er 6 2007 two separa but related reports with an impact on food safety the broader of the two c overs the safety

health education labor nd pensions hearing developing comprehensive response to food safety also fda week november 9 2007recommendations for food imports that gene rally parallel those in the broader report10 both plans are oriented toward assessing and prioritizing risks regardless of where they occur starting at products poi nt of origin and preventing rather than waiting for problems to occur number of the recommendations such as mandatory recall authority for fdaregula ted products but not fsis electronic certification of imports and ne w user fees if products must be reinspected would require congressional author ization among other recommended statutory changes are more explicit authority to require additional preventive haccplike controls for highrisk foods authority some believe fda already has and authority for fda accreditation of qualified thir d parties to conduct some types of inspections haccp is the acronym for hazard analysis and critical control point whereby production system is analyzed to dete rmine its potential risks and hazards and where they are most likely to occur prev entive controls are then instituted at the appropriate points and continually monitored to ensure they are effective each meat and poultry plant must have developed and must conti nue to follow its own haccp plan which fsis inspectors then review on an ongoing basis to ensure it is in place and effective currently only few ty pes of fdaregulate d food products must follow haccp rules many other changes are to be implemented through administrative action or cooperative activities with fore ign countries and industry stakeholders most cite fda as the lead agency few would app ear to involve fsisregulated products many of the changes are expected to necessitate more spending which neither report quantified the lack of specific funding requests was among th criticisms leveled against the administration strategy by some members of congress administration officials stated that they would seek additional funds to help pay for these initiatives as part of the upcoming fy2009 budget request other perceived shortcomings in the strategy were cited by critics including some members of congress consumer advocacy groups and several food safety experts several observed for example that the plan is not comprehensive because it did not propose any specific food safety improvements on farms or at the retail level where problems often occur that it relies too much on voluntary cooperation with industry when stronger mandatory cont rols are called for and that it fails to emphasize badly needed improveme nts in information technology11httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34152crs8 12 high risk series an update 13 the omnibus fy2008 appropriation measure h r 2764 which the president signed into law on december 26 2007 also contains number of directives to usda and fda to study and recommend changes in the food safety system see the next section of this report funding and resourcesselected issues reorganize food safety responsibilities issue critics have argued for decades that us f ood safety ac tivities are dispersed over too many agencies and ar poorly coordinated gao has been among these critics in its nnual january 2007 re port gao designated food safety oversight as one of 29 high risk federa l program areas the report concluded that the current federal safety system is fragmented resulting in inconsistent oversight ineffective coor dination and inefficient use of resources gao has recommended that congress consider fundamental reexamination of the system and other improvements to help ensure the rapid detection of and response to any accidental or deliber ate contamination of food before public health and safety is compromised12 opponents of major food safety system ch anges including some in the food and agricultural industries assert that the system already is scientifi cally based that the statutes are adequate and that food co mpanies already produce and distribute safe food making the us system m odel for food safety around the world legislation the senatepassed version of the omnibus farm bill hr 2419 would establish congressional bipartis an food safety commission to recommend statutory changes to modernize the food sa fety system and ways to harmonize food safety requirements across agencies th language provides extensive guidance on commission membership and on the programs to be examined sets timelines for completion and provides 3 million annually in funding13 if the commission language is maintained in the final farm bill the house version lacks it this initiative could sideline further action in this congress on companion bills hr 1148s 654 to reorgani ze the federal agencies responsible for food safety as well as to overh aul the safeguards themselves these two comprehensive companion bills would consolidate federal food safety responsibilities under new food safety administra tion fsa the new fsa would be responsible for administering all the major food safety laws agencies and their functions to be transferred include fsis and aphis from usda as well as the departments food safety re search activities the fdas center for food safety and applied nutrition cfsan and center for veterinary medicine cvm as well as portions of other fda offices that support these centers resources of the epa that regulate pesticide re sidues in food nmfs seafood in spection and any other offices or services designated by the presidenthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34152crs9 hr 1148s 654 also would authorize ne w food safety system to be based on comprehensive analysis of food hazards they would require the registration and regular inspections of all establishments except farms fishing vessels that do not process food and retail establishments which would ve to follow process controls tied to science and healthbased regu lations including performance standards inspection fundamentals and frequencies also are spelled out in the bills among other provisions the bills specify prohibited acts provide authority to detain seize condemn andor recall foods suspected of being unsafe or misbranded see page 14 for details and include w histleblower protection fo r public and private employees who report safety problems they also in clude certification system for imports and mandatory national system for tracing food and food animals from their point of origin to retail sale which are described elsewhere in this crs report another comprehensive bill hr 3624 proposes major changes in how the current system is administered by the f da although it would not establish new single food agency the bill would require establishment of new national food safety program to be ba sed on comprehensive analysis of food safety hazards throughout the production and marketing chai n the analysis would consider the distinctive characteristics of food produc tion and processing the proposed bill would mandate process cont rol regulations require quarterly inspections of processors and importers except those that have negligible risk or meet exceptional standards and spell out pr ocedures for detaining nd condemning adulterated or misbranded products the bill also would require among other things tolerances for contaminants in food tied to healthbased standards and comprehensive public health assessment system that includes active foodborne illn ess surveillance nd sampling of food products to test for contaminants the bills import inspecti on and recall provisions are described elsewher in this crs report increase funding and staffing issue some critics argue that irrespective of the need if any to reform food safety statutes and organization the primary problem is the lack of sufficient funding and staff to carry out congressi onally mandated respons ibilities to ensure safe food supply from time to time in the past fsis has had di fficulty in adequately staffing its service obligations to the meat and poultry industries usually combination of factors causes these shortage s such as new technologies that increase plant production speeds and volume or in sufficient funds to hire additional inspectors at times of unexpected increases in demand for inspections for example according to report released in early december 2007 by the fda science board the fda commissioners expert adviso ry panel critical lack of resources has seriously weakened the fdas scientific basis generally and its mission to protect the food supply particularly the repor t prepared by board subcommittee concluded in part the agency suffers from serious scientific deficiencies and is not positioned to meet current or emer ging regulatory responsibilities the subcommittee report tied these deficiencies to two sources 1 demands on fda have soared due in part to major advances in science and in the complexity of new products and to the globalization of the i ndustries the agency regulates and 2httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34152crs10 14 fda science and mission at risk report of the subcommittee on science and technology prepared for the fda science board november 2007 15 ibid the report cited an estimate by an advocacy group the coalition for stronger fda that more than 130 million is needed to devise and implement new food import system alone 16 statement of william k hubbard former fda associate commissioner before the house energy and commerce subcommittee on oversight and investigations july 17 2007 17 see for example house members grill fda chief over produce safety increased inspections food chemical news march 5 2007 fda chief pressed on belowinflation budget hike for food safety cq budget tracker news march 1 2007 the more recent hhs and fda remarks were made at cember 4 2007 hearing on imported food safety before the senate committee on hea lth education labor and pensionsresources have not increased in proporti on to the demands such demands include an accumulation of unfunded legislative ma ndates imposed by congress the report stated14 the report singled out the fdas two food safety centers cfsan and cvm where crisis management has drawn ttention and resources away from fdas ability to develop the science base and infrastructure needed to efficiently s upport innovation in the food industry provide ffective routine surv eillance and conduct emergency outbreak investigation activities to protect the food s upply also it noted that an appallingly low inspection rate leaves fda unable to sufficiently monitor either the trem endous volume of products manufactured domestically or the exponential growth of imported products during the past 35 years the decrease in fda funding for inspection of our food supply has forced fda to impose 78 percent reduction in food inspections at time when the food industry has been rapidly expandi ng and food importation has exponentially increased15 the fda food safety budget has declined fro m almost half of the agencys total spending in 1971 to about onefourth of th budget currently partly because the drug budget has expanded due to collection of dr ug approval user fees fda staffing in programs not funded by user fees incl uding but not limited to food safety has decreased significantly according to former highlevel official16 this has occurred at time when fda faces new challenges such as rising food imports due to globalization of the us food supply although it requested modest increases for both fda and fsis in its fy2008 budget the administration stressed that it could meet these challenges by strengthening the scientific basis of its programs improving riskbased targeting of inspection resources and developing str onger partnerships with domestic and international stakeholders at 2007 hearin gs some members of congress expressed skepticism that these efforts could succeed without additional funds more recently the hhs secretary and fda officials said that they had asked the white house to include significant increases as part of the presidents fy2009 budget request17httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34152crs11 fsis and fda receive most of their funding through the annual agriculture rural development food and drug administration and related agencies appropriations act some funds also ar provided through user fees in fy2007 for example more than 12 130 million of the fsis budget of approximately 1 billion was from user fees charged to establishments mostly for inspections conducte d after regularly scheduled shifts as noted th 457 million fda food safety budget fy2007 was virtua lly all from appr opriated funds proposed increases in program spending raise variety of policy issues requests for higher appropria tions must compete with other priorities throughout the federal discretionary budget the programs do not operate like farm support programs for example as mandatory authorizations efforts to fill perceived shortfalls through new user fees on the food industry always meet with resistance both from the companies that would have to absorb such costs and from consumer advocates who have long argued that indus try funds might taint programs that are first and foremost public health programs nonetheless number of pending food safety bills discussed in this report include proposed user fees to pay for such various new activities as certification of food imports reinspecti on of products initially kept out of

july 1 2008 through september 30 2009 for implementation of detailed plan for comprehensive overhaul of fdas food safety operations accompanying report language further directs that nearly 327 million of the agency appropriation be sp ent for foodrelated field activities and that fda make at least 183 million available immediately to hire additional domestic and import inspectors including 8

what many believe have been insu fficient funds are not new however they have gained wider attention in recent years as us f ood imports log significant increases fueled by the globalization of production and proce ssing and by consumers desire for wider variety of nutritious and inexpens ive foods yearround the value of total imports of agricultural and seafood pr oducts increased from 39 billion in fy1996 to 837 billion in fy2007 115 increase at issue is whether us safeguards which generally were created at time wh most foods were supplied domestically can protect public health in global marketplace the bush administrations food safety nd import safety strategies see pages 67 assert that imported f oods generally do not pose greater food safety risk than domestic foods however the increase in import volume along with the changing makeup from largely unprocessed bulk ingr edients for subsequent processing by domestic establishments to an increasin g variety of readytoeat products fresh produce and seafood have taxed fdas ab ility to monitor them for safety the administration reports said among legislative changes recommended in the administration food safety and import strategies is the authority for fda to require electronic import certificates for shipments of products deemed to be of high risk for such products fda would have to negotiate and implement governme nttogovernment agreements whereby an importer would obtain certificates from either the appropriate foreign agency or an accredited third party this new certifica tion system which appears to be based at least in part on the concept of the fs is foreign equivale ncy determinations presumably would have to be consistent with international trade obligations and likely would be one of the initiatives requiring additional resources18 the strategies also entail new authority for fda to bl ock entry of foods imported from foreign firms that impede entry by fda inspectors to their facilitieshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34152crs13 19 ibid 20 fda had initially proposed to consolidate its 13 labs into six but backed away from that plan due in part to strong opposition by some key members of congress the consolidated appropriations act 2008 prohibits the agency from closing or consolidating these labs 21 see for example the testimony on hr 3610 by the food marketing institute and by the american association of xporters and importers september 26 2007 before the house energy and commerce committee subcommittee on health the imports issue was explored at number of congressional hearings in 2007 and several bills have been offered to change the current system those who oppose major changes assert that imported foods already are subject to the same safety standards as andor pose greater zards than domestically produced foods they also contend that smarter alloca tion of existing resources and the food industrys own controls can and should be capable of addressing any problems that arise19 legislation as of late 2007 at least doz food safety bills were pending that contain provisions addressing some as pect of food import sa fety about half of them

which they are locate d first receive formal certification from us authorities that their food safety syst ems demonstrably provide at least the same level of safety assurances as the us system some would direct that certifications be denied or revoked if foreign safeguar ds are found to be insufficient unsafe imports are discovered andor foodborne illnesses are linke d to such products hr 2997 takes somewhat different tack by re quiring that food imports both fda and fsisregulated be certified by the gove rnment of their country of origin number of the bills also propose the co llection of user fees for example up to 20 per ship ment in one bill up to 50 per shipment in another from importers to cover the costs of inspecting foreign products at the borders some of the bills seek to require more physical inspections and testing by fda at the border or within other countries to authorize mo re research into inspection and testing technologies or to restrict imports to specific ports controversial provision in hr 3610 introduced by house energy and commerce committee chairman dingell would restrict imports of all fda regulated foods to ports of entry located in metropolitan areas that have one of the 13 fda laboratories although waivers could be granted under some circumstances20 at july 17 2007 hearing before the house energy and commerce subcommittee on oversight and investigati ons the panels investigator s testified that fda border inspectors currently had to cover 326 ports of entry greatly straining the existing workforce those opposed to the port restrictions

neither fda nor fsis has explicit statutory authority to order recall of adulterated foods require company to notify them when it has distributed such foods or impose penaltie s if recall requirements are violated fda can order such recalls for one food infant formula and for unsafe medical devices such as pacemakers as can other agencies for uns afe toys or automobiles these gaps increase the possibility that unsafe food will not be recovered nd will be consumed gao has concluded22 defenders of the current system counter th at the agencies alr eady have sufficient authorities to keep such products from r eaching consumers fsiss statutory authority enables it to detain meat and pou ltry products of concern for up to 20 days and fdas authority enables it to detain the foods it regula tes for up to 30 days both agencies can with courts permission seize condemn and destroy unsafe food23 finally private companies rarely if ever fail to order voluntary recall when problems arise these are frequently nnounced by the government and become widely publicized it is argu ed nonetheless number of members of congress support gaos recommendation that legisla tion be considered to strengthen notification and recall authorities some argue that improved notification and traceability capabilities would enable either fsis in the case of meat and pou ltry products or fda in the case of other foods to determine more quickly produc ts source and whereabouts to prevent or contain foodborne illness outbreaks the tr aceability issue has also been debated in connection with protecting against

inspection progra ms from shipping their products across state lines many of the states and small plants want to overturn that ban limiting stateinspected products to intrastate co mmerce is unfair these states and plants argue because their programs must be and are at least equal to the federal system foreign plants operating under fsisappr oved foreign programs which must be equivalent to the us program can ex port meat and poultry pr oducts into and sell them anywhere in the united states those who oppose allowing stateinspected products into in terstate commerce argue that state programs
