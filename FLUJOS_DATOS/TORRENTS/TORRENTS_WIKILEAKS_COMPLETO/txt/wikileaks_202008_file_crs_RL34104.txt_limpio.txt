mcloughlin 77073 who served as the project officers and editors for this report at the congressional research service state egovernment strategies identifying best practices and applications introduction this report state egovernment strategies identifying best practices and applications is based on research conducted in 20052006 under contract by the lyndon b johnson school of public affairs as policy research project prp prps are designed to give students realistic policy research experience culminating in final research product for client this prp involved nine students from the masters of public affairs program professor sherri greenberg served as the faculty director electronic government egovernment is currently one of the leading approaches to government reform with initiatives being carried out at the local tribal state national and international levels however frequently there is little meaningful coordination or communication between various egovernment initiatives as result of independently maturing technologies there is risk of creating more socalled islands of automation and stovepipes within and between levels of government these problems are further exacerbated by human and financial resource constraints to address these issues congress is actively overseeing egovernment initiatives and is attempting to work with omb and state governments to identify best practices common standards and successful strategies due to their variation in geography demographics and infrastructure states serve as laboratories of experimentation for egovernment federal policymakers may find aspects of state egovernment planning and implementation useful examples for future decisions regarding the integration of federal information and services to that end graduate students from the lbj school of public affairs at the university of texas at austin undertook two semester research program to identify some of the best practices in egovernment strategies and management being carried out by state governments for the purposes of this report electronic government is defined as the use of information technology it to integrate government information and services for citizen business government and other institutional uses many consider egovernment as part of the evolution and extension of traditional governance just as in earlier times when the telephone and fax machine were innovations for government transactions so is egovernment today overview increasingly egovernment is an important component in the study of governance its role in providing services in quick efficient manner to people who may not have had direct connection to governing institutions in the past makes crs2 it ripe subject for study in addition federal and state egovernment programs have evolved considerably since their inception in the early 1990s and are now much more prevalent these changes parallel the everchanging technological environment and shifts in attitudes regarding the relationships between government and citizens and business in this report the students identified several critical factors that influence state egovernment programs they are summarized below strategies are essential to egovernment formulation because they provide objectives for state agencies and governments the report identifies and analyzes numerous types of strategies outsourcing is controversial issue in many states the students research revealed that state governments develop spectrum of outsourcing policies from balancing inhouse projects with outsourced projects to prohibiting outsourcing to promoting outsourcing funding is an important egovernment issue because it projects are costly and their success is uncertain legislatures must choose between multiple programs during the budget process and in many cases egovernment competes with other needs for funding state politics and culture can impede or support egovernment development public agencies are often averse to it changes because they can alter employee and agency functions however it enhancements do not typically cause agencies to be eliminated strong leadership can support egovernment programs and drive it improvements by encouraging and promoting new projects among civil servants and citizens the degree of centralization or decentralization is key component in egovernment management because it determines the level of interaction between administrative agencies involved in it projects web portal centralization is common trend among many states and it is often separate from agency organization and decision making egovernment performance measures are essential in evaluating the success of programs identifying challenges and addressing specific formulation and implementation challenges surveys and site visits can provide valuable information regarding egovernment management and strategies the students at the lbj school of public affairs created the survey by researching similar surveys contacting egovernment experts and consulting with crs specialists they sent 51 surveys to all 50 states and the district of columbia and received back 38 completed surveys they conducted site visits in six case study states california kentucky massachusetts texas utah and washington set of core questions was used for each case study interview along with statespecific questions crs3 the survey results also provide general understanding of egovernment differences among the states the survey trends indicate that most egovernment leaders have access to the state governor as needed questions about outsourcing show that most states either outsource the majority of their projects 75 100 or outsource very little 0 25 the most frequent leader in state egovernment initiatives is the state chief information officer cio however there are multiple departments involved in egovernment including finance and accounting offices it departments and information resources departments states finance egovernment from variety of sources including operating budgets federal funds and grants user fees and capital funds the majority of states use at least these four funding mechanisms in addition to secondary sources some states voice egovernment security concerns for citizens and agency employees survey results show that many states are aware of legal restrictions on certain eservices whereas other states are unaware states use multiple performance measures to track programs the most popular methods are customer satisfaction surveys and web tracking using specified metrics for evaluating site and service use online the types of strategy documents used by states vary widely documents named in the survey include it plans information management plans and it business plans among others the case study site visits elicited insightful information about interagency management strategies and decisionmaking processes states vary in how they conduct egovernment initiatives some governments such as texas prefer to outsource software and applications development to consulting firms while other states such as massachusetts emphasize inhouse development some states such as kentucky encourage publicprivate partnerships and work closely with community leaders while others use only intraagency methods to create egovernment programs each case study in the report includes state specific information on leadership strategy documents implementation outsourcing funding centralization and state politics and culture in addition this report contains best practices section for each state case study that discusses successful program attributes such as effective communication on all levels pilot projects for specific applications and diversified methods of funding the findings section of the report discusses the importance of strong leadership in furthering egovernment initiatives devising strategy is important but not all states follow the same process state egovernment strategies vary significantly through the survey results and site visits it was found that multiple entities are involved in the egovernment implementation process ranging from educational institutions to government agencies in addition survey respondents contend that there is trend towards creating centralized systems and procedures for citizens to obtain information through state web portals and other forms of enterprise architecture survey evidence also found that funding sources in many states are diverse while egovernment is often implemented as measure to provide efficiencies and to save costs eg reducing the need for employees to perform some routine tasks such as customer service actual dollar savings are not always realized by the states however egovernment presents management challenges and cost crs4 savings typically do not occur until the later phases of egovernment implementation when at least 30 adoption rate is realized1 identifying egovernment planning and management concepts can facilitate comparative analysis of state programs in addition strategies and management at the state level may provide important lessons learned for potential federal egovernment initiatives president george w bush has described new goals and policies for government reform that include citizencentric online governance and the establishment of the egovernment fund2 this federal mandate proposes to shift power from handful of leaders in washington to individual citizens by increasing interagency cooperation and reducing redundant applications and procedures chief among the federal government changes is the establishment of usagov formerly firstgovgov this portal acts as the official gateway to federal government information and services and facilitates citizen interaction with the federal government3 furthermore egovernment is one of the primary oversight jurisdictions of both the us house committee on government reform and the us senate committee on homeland security and governmental affairs members of congress will continue to propose and contemplate legislation regarding egovernment future legislation could address number of egovernment issues such as citizen privacy and safety national security intergovernmental coordination funding and management innovation in addition to federal transformation states also have implemented changes in governance many state governments started instituting egovernment programs nearly decade ago to improve interactions with citizens and customers this report examines the egovernment policies and strategies of state governments to provide effective practices and processes while the public face of egovernment tends to be web page the larger focus of this report is on management and strategies although service provision and site design are critical for effective egovernment implementation management structures and government culture define the direction of the egovernment development process methodology this report includes an examination of existing egovernment research to determine critical factors for state egovernment evaluation the students at the lbj school of public policy devised survey to obtain information on government practices which was sent to state chief information officers cios or equivalent positions in addition the report provides detailed review of the six case 1 val oveson cgiams consultant and former cio of the state of utah presentation at the government technology conference austin tx

california kentucky massachusetts texas utah and washington the students reviewed other surveys related to egovernment management service provision and policy implementation the research team communicated with university professors and crs policy specialists to develop and refine survey questions that met the objectives of this study the students discussed among themselves and with crs specialists different methods for determining case study states and researched which criteria would be the most helpful in identifying potential egovernment best practices and applications they used the following factors based on agreed upon categories for evaluation eservices integration centralized versus decentralized systems edemocracy and online help they assigned number from 1 5 1 being poor 5 being excellent for each criterion and calculated the sums of each state the states in different regions were chosen based on evaluation results and crs guidance in addition they considered geographic dispersion population and demographics in selecting the case study states they conducted interviews with public officials and contractors using core set of questions with additional questions particular to each case study state finally they devised case study outline format for the final report which was presented to crs in july 2006 critical factors for state egovernment evaluation number of factors contributed to the functioning of state egovernment programs identifying the factors and using them to evaluate programs helped to draw distinctions and make comparisons although state egovernment programs are markedly different from one another the factors below are essential in understanding the egovernment formulation and implementation process strategies states utilize different techniques in designing strategies to accomplish their egovernment goals case studies and research in this report convey broad spectrum of formal and informal strategies the documents collected from states include intraagency communication documents it plans and other documents which do not appear to be egovernment specific plans but have egovernment goals and strategies embedded in them some states may adopt formal published documents while others may use fluid guidelines or flexible plans which may be augmented as needed still other states do not distinguish between egovernment and government the diverse set of strategies among states indicates that there is single successful formula while vision is critical to any program defined processes strategies and performance measures also are necessary to achieve egovernment goals4 4 schedler et managing the electronic government from vision to practice information age publishing inc 2004 p 9 katherine barrett and richard greene powering up how public managers can take control of information technology congressional quarterly press 2001 p 66 crs6 outsourcing the process of outsourcing or contracting with an outside firm to develop it projects is often contentious5 the decision to outsource may depend on the complexity of new program programs that are simple to develop can be administered inhouse or within the public agency however if the system is complex governments generally have to rely on expertise from the private and nonprofit sectors this involves some loss of control and decline in autonomy on the part of the bureaucratic agency6 some public officials may choose outsourcing over inhouse development because they believe outsourcing reduces the government payroll and improves accountability in the public sector7 for some public officials the incentive to outsource is financial since many technology tasks are now routinely administered they are commoditized and inexpensive8 at times outsourcing is necessary because governments may lack sufficient funding or expertise to complete projects inhouse9 technology companies that have already developed software applications may be less expensive to use because they do not incur the initial research and development costs that an inhouse it department would incur10 also agencies may lack jurisdiction to provide particular services that are deemed outside of their legal bounds11 additionally there are guarantees that outsourcing projects will lead to successful applications and programs although many observers believe egovernment will yield high savings the upfront investment costs of new technology are substantial and costs savings do not emerge until enough users start taking advantage of electronic delivery systems that government can save money through traditional bricksandmortar delivery systems eg traditional office functions associated with service provision12 moreover due to the immense costs of many egovernment projects the competitive bidding process and competition among private vendors in the awarding of contracts outsourcing has become highly politicized13 contracting problems associated with certain governors and public agencies often revealed through critical media sources can undermine the original goals of egovernment programs and change the publics perception about the 5 darrell

eservices14 thus outsourcing and the publicity associated with failed egovernment programs can create controversy within administrations and among citizens funding governments fund their egovernment programs in variety of ways these include user fees financing through general fund and publicprivate partnerships the financing options may rely on single funding stream or combination of multiple funding streams according to darrell m west leading expert on digital government when economic times are good and governments have abundant resources tax revenues are popular way to pay for egovernment15 however when resources are limited spending on egovernment must compete with expenditures for education health care and welfare16 as result proponents of egovernment may find it difficult to prioritize egovernment over basic social services and other public goods that may be considered more important state culture and politics public officials can enable or hinder the development of state egovernment programs the organizational culture of public agency often can resist dramatic change within short amount of time in addition to organizational factors the technology field changes very quickly creating challenges for the public sector to keep pace with innovations hence public agencies are sometimes reluctant to change course and alter their way of doing things17 while state legislatures may mandate specific missions and technology sometimes can facilitate these objectives it often is difficult to use new programs and retrain staff in the alternative techniques of new system18 even with comprehensive strategy document lack of agency approval and enthusiasm for new it programs presents challenge for executing egovernment objectives19 leadership execution of egovernment objectives requires strong leadership that champions egovernment and works to increase buyin among stakeholders20 adoption of it reforms is possible when leader in the management chain has the power in terms of political will and capacity to impose change on the current system21 public officials must operate with longterm vision overcome implementation challenges and reinforce the agencys mission22 they must mitigate the immediate challenges of agency buyin and potential resistance leaders must 14 barrett and greene op cit p 93 west op cit p 40 15 west op cit

and advocate the benefits of egovernment and its programs the difficulty for leaders lies in changing the status quo within the office and encouraging employees to think outside the box in how they provide services to the public and businesses23 centralizeddecentralized technology management the degree of centralization in egovernment refers to the administrative structure that manages egovernment as well as to the specific infrastructure and presentation of information the concept of centralization of egovernment programs is best understood as continuum where system may have both centralized and decentralized processes for implementing and executing agency egovernment goals but may lean more toward one end of the spectrum the pendulum may swing back and forth and programs may be more centralized or decentralized depending on state culture politics and agency cultures neither system guarantees success of egovernment programs rather both systems have advantages and disadvantages usually centralized administrative systems can allow it requests to be filtered through one agency or private firm reducing the variation and duplication in egovernment systems in terms of presentation of eservices and information states with centralized systems often use web portal or onestopshop as way to promote fully integrated userfriendly system arguably states with decentralized egovernment systems allow individual agencies more control over egovernment administration and content agencies can choose which firms to use when they outsource eservices some agencies also share the view that decentralized information is considered more accurate because it is provided as close to the source as possible24 decentralized systems arguably can provide agencies with sense of ownership that can encourage better site management and design25 the decision to develop centralized or decentralized egovernment system depends on the economic and political circumstances within state and the objectives stated in egovernment strategies performance measures applying performance measures is essential to evaluate whether egovernment is cost efficient is serving stakeholders and is being used effectively by government agencies staff citizens and businesses26 depending on the mode of egovernment service delivery agencies can use various quantitative and qualitative output measures to evaluate their egovernment programs including the number of hits on site user contact sessions number of downloads amount of time spent on site information accessed most frequently and number of times forms 23 west op cit p 31 24 franzel and coursey government web portals management issues and the approaches of five states in david g garson and alexei pavlichev

agencies can evaluate cost savings related to overhead and operating costs such as paper use postage and transportation costs that are incurred through traditional modes of communication they can also evaluate how employees manage caseloads through facetoface interaction in contrast to egovernment interaction performance measures need to be implemented on regular basis to allow for comprehensive evaluation28 agencies may develop detailed performance measures or they may choose to develop broad measures that can be transferred within the agency among multiple departments these critical factors are fundamental to egovernment program development and implementation the survey analysis and case study sections describe differences in them on state level and elaborate on their specific affect in managing egovernment future egovernment programs must take these factors into account while considering economic and political constraints that inevitably shape egovernment programs phases of egovernment development the evolution of egovernment programs can be conceptualized in number of ways given states political and economic circumstances programs can develop and change quickly sometimes skipping developmental phase in contrast programs may remain in particular phase for longer period due to funding constraints or political pressure to maintain the status quo gartner group report from 2000 identified four phases of egovernment development that considered the level of information technology used by the government to relay information online see table 129 the gartner group report identified key development stages for egovernment programs describing the level of technological advancement information and communication abilities and the kinds of services offered in each phase the report also noted that there are few countries in the final stages transformation for number of economic and political reasons contrasting and comparing different programs on this level may help researchers and policymakers understand what the next step is for their particular program it may also enable them to guide the development process toward more integrative egovernment program that allows for more communication and interaction between agencies and citizens and businesses30 27 stowers genie nl issues in ecommerce and egovernment service delivery in pavlichev and garson

documents and survey results in this section the report addresses number of issues related to identifying recurring themes in egovernment implementation these issues include leadership outsourcing influence of federal egovernment initiatives strategy development and management funding legal and security issues usage and performance measures and written strategy documents information about these issues was collected by the lbj students from review of state government documents and surveys that were 30 continued member states as cited in pavlichev and garson op cit pp 3839 crs11 mailed and emailed to each states office of the chief information officer cio or equivalent roughly 75 37 states and the district of columbia completed and returned the survey leadership leadership is defined as the will of political leaders management and line staff to support egovernment implementation as strategy to provide electronically government services to states clients these leaders may include the governor lieutenant governor house and senate leaders cio agency secretaries governors cabinet agency managers and it staff leadership may take different forms such as governors it council it boards it agencies or information systems departments among others as leadership factor the survey asked does your state have an egovernment strategy sixtythree percent of respondents indicated that their states have written egovernment strategy documents thirtyfour percent reported not having document while leadership may come from different government positions the following questions focused on the state cios interactions with their governors the survey asked do you have direct access to your governor and if yes how often do you have access to the governor nearly 60 of the responses affirmed direct access to the governor while 38 indicated they did not have direct access regarding contact frequency with the governor 21 reported meeting weekly with the governor 13 reported meeting monthly and 21 reported other meaning that these states have different meeting schedule approximately 80 of the respondents reported meeting with the governor regularly outsourcing it outsourcing is defined as the use by state governments of contracts with private sector companies to provide host of itrelated services these services may include website maintenance database maintenance state portal website design where visual representation of information is consistent purchasing or help desk functions the survey asked what percentage of your egovernment services are outsourced thirty percent of the responding states reported that none of their government services were outsourced thirtyfour percent of the responding states reported outsourcing up to 25 of egovernment services over 20 reported outsourcing from 75 to 100 of egovernment services another 5 reported outsourcing levels somewhere between 25 and 75 see figure 1 crs12 figure 1 percentage of outsourced state portal content what

to large extent in outsourcing or use little to outsourcing additional research could provide greater understanding of outsourcing issues specifically it may be useful for congressional policymakers to know which egovernment services states outsource and the reasons that these services are outsourced when considering federal initiatives influence of federal egovernment initiatives in 2001 president bush initiated the presidents management agenda pma collection of five government reform efforts with the goal of making the federal government more resultsoriented efficient and citizencentered31 one of the five pma key elements deals with expanding egovernment in an effort to use it investments for improving government response time to citizens and businesses in light of these developments the survey explored the potential effect of federal egovernment initiatives on state egovernment formulation and implementation look at the relationship between the two could show what kind of influence if any the federal government has on state egovernment programs question 4 asked whether the survey respondent was familiar with the federal governments egovernment strategy thirty of the 38 survey respondents answered this question respondents were given the option to skip to question 8 if they did not have written egovernment strategic document even though not all respondents were state cios many were still seniorlevel authorities in it offices eg deputy secretary of information technology state portal manager it manager etc out of 30 respondents to this question ten of them 30 were not familiar with the federal governments strategy 31 ibid crs13 figure 2 federal government relevance in egovernment initiatives how important is the role of the federal government in your egovernment intiatives 3 14 14 17 52 extremely important very important important somewhat important not important of the 29 states that responded to question 5 the 15 states 52 responded that the federal government was only somewhat important and 4 states said not important of those 19 states that responded either somewhat important or not important 10 states did not know what the federal governments egovernment initiatives entailed from question 4 thus even though response of somewhat important is open to interpretation and could vary from state to state the survey results strongly suggested that the role of the federal government is not significant for many states see figure 2 based on these two questions the results suggest that federal egovernment formulation and implementation has been important to relatively few states egovernment planning and execution strategy development and management there are many different players involved in the establishment of egovernment strategy which is represented by question 7 of the survey some states have one person draft the strategy some states form it councils other states have multiple departments working together the most common model is shared by only 5 states thus most states have their own unique model six out of the 38 respondents had one actor establishing egovernment strategy in five states that actor is the cio and in the sixth state the governor established the strategy it is interesting to note that this particular state is also the only state that reported the role of the federal government to be extremely important and has the most daily unique site visits to its state portal other entities involved in egovernment strategy include the department of finance the state legislature or crs14 executive branch the council on electronic commerce and the state treasurers office similarly question 8 asked about the players involved in the daytoday management of state egovernment with wide range of actors being reported again the most frequent manager is the state cio but for many the management of egovernment is carried out by someone other than the cio the range of responses included private contracted businesses the comptroller the department of accounting and general services the department of administration and the department of budget and management despite the presence of many unique models there was still clear representation of two heavily involved departments in egovernment strategy and activities information technology and financeaccounting the two departments or offices nearly rival each other in their roles in egovernment such close relationship to financial departments indicates that perhaps egovernment is generally still in the stage of providing online services and transactions such as renewing drivers licenses or filing taxes funding transforming and streamlining egovernment services and applications for citizens businesses and public agencies can be an expensive enterprise as cited earlier it projects often are overlooked when more pressing social concerns such as health care and social welfare are at hand question 11 of the survey asked how egovernment initiatives are funded the survey focused only on methods of funding and did not ask for the dollar amounts spent on each service or application limitation of this survey question is the inseparable nature of it programs for example egovernment necessitates acquiring equipment such as computers for departments to carry out projects this report is not concerned with how much funding is secured for computer hardware supplies such as replacement keyboards or new lcd monitors but instead is directed toward egovernment initiatives and implementation however the nature of it requires large expenditure of time and resources in maintaining and upgrading computerrelated supplies so it equipment acquisitions and egovernment initiatives are most likely combined in many governments financial statements crs15 figure 3 funding for egovernment initiatives how are egovernment initiatives funded 35 30 number of states 25 20 15 10 5 0 pr u fe st pr ca th pe iva at iva

fundoperating budget is the most common source of funding 32 out of 38 respondents and that numerous states use two or more types of funding out of the six states that do not draw resources from the general fund four of them have completely different funding models one is categorized as businesstype activity since it is selffunding model that generates revenue through convenience transaction and subscription fees another states financing structure is completely decentralized since it does not have state it agency hence individual agency it departments are forced to fund their own initiatives see figure 3 an unconventional funding model reported by one state relies on data sales such as licensing data to private industries texas the second most common funding source is the federal government 26 out of 38 respondents federal egovernment initiatives may not substantially influence state egovernment programs but federal funding certainly has large impact on state resources as evidenced by the survey results another significant funding model relies on user fees employed by 22 out of 38 respondents user fees are the simplest way of generating revenue and with an increasing trend of citizen and business adoption rates user fee only model arguably could support most egovernment transactions however only little over half of the respondents utilize user fees to finance their egovernment initiatives and in some cases instigating user fees may cause shortterm decrease in adoption rates legal issues and security security concerns regarding personal information have increased as people rely increasingly upon the internet for transporting sensitive and personal data for state governments this is an important issue because many egovernment services require the entry of personal information to complete the transaction almost onefourth of the respondents stated that 50100 of their portal management is outsourced thus there is potential need to know who is storing the personal information and where it is stored some states crs16 require legislative action to address this concern while others have left the decision to state cios or their equivalents the survey included question regarding the actions states have taken to ensure the privacy and security of citizen information almost every state reported employee training and encryption among their top security measures furthermore although there is recognized universal standard for digital signatures 50 of respondents say they currently use digital signatures over 40 of the respondents did not have or were unaware of legal restrictions on online egovernment activities however there are certain states that do have statutes specifically limiting what they are able to offer online for example the state of iowa describes the hurdles to providing certain services online the ramifications of signature requirements provide legal hurdle for the adoption of more online services the practices of the credit card industry and their requirements in relation to general financial practices of state government also provide impairments privacy security and identity issues are always addressed by state governments in online services and can provide obstacles for government to implement certain services online32 in stark contrast idaho states currently none of our planned services are restricted due to legal barriers there are however number of documents and applications that are not made available online due to privacy or security considerations additionally statute currently requests handwritten or notarized signature for certain filings33 connecticut said that in the past its primary barrier to online services had been financial fees for services are set by statute therefore agencies would be required to assume the costs of credit card transactions and may not have the funds available to do so34 although many states do not require legislative authority the key legal barrier reported in the survey results was providing eservices through secure channels especially for documents that require signatures legislation has typically dealt with the financial structures of egovernment with some limiting what an agency is allowed to charge for online services because of costs associated with credit card transactions usage and performance measures this section of the survey focused on how states market their web presence and how they measure performance measuring the value of the return on investment in egovernment is difficult without knowing the usage and adoption rates for online services and applications states 32 state of iowa survey response 33 state of idaho survey response 34 state of connecticut survey response crs17 attempt to promote their online existence and measure their performance in number of ways promoting an online presence is essential for state governments to accomplish goals of increased usage by citizens businesses and public agencies according to survey results the majority of respondent states use print advertising and email announcements over half of the survey respondents still use radio television and direct mail to increase awareness of state web portals alternative methods include printing the portal web address on license plates and using billboard advertisements to promote the state portals marketing specific applications towards target groups appears to be an effective marketing strategy for example kentucky interactive educates lawyer associations doctors and other groups about renewing their licenses online35 figure 4 egovernment utilization and performance measures which performance measures do you use percentage of utilization 100 8684 7368 80 5526 5526 60 40 3158 20 0 cost benefit return on other financial egovernment customer analysis investment metrics specific web satisfaction traffic metrics surveyfeedback performance measures states used multiple performance measures eightysix percent of the respondents used customer satisfaction surveys and feedback as performance measure almost 74 reported using egovernment specific web traffic metrics which are defined as tools used by those who manage and implement web portals to gather data on the amount or type of traffic on website or web portal see figure 4 such tracking may include most visited sites and the frequency and duration of visits about half of the respondents reported using cost benefit analyses and looking at return on investments it appears that tracking which pages are visited the most and actually listening to customer feedback using exit surveys and citizen requests are the most beneficial means for continuous improvement because they allow government to address citizen needs more effectively oregon is state that publicly monitors its online presence it has specific web page for web traffic metrics showing the number of visitors by week number of visits the amount of time spent per visit top five entry and exit pages and the top five downloads knowing this information allows oregon to adjust its web portal to 35 lee thompson interview by renaetta nance and lewis leff january 26 2006 crs18 citizens needs and measure citizen response to different forms of advertising and marketing36 another important performance measure is adoption rates adoption rates measure the usage of online services by comparing the number of transactions processed via the online service with the total number of transactions processed through the phone web mail and at the counter during the same time period the percentage completed online is the adoption rate for the service tracking adoption rates is important to ensure that the egovernment service is meeting customer expectations marketing plan can drive up adoption rates however states must ensure feedback on the service and functionality of online applications37 written strategy documents key question in this study is how states use strategy documents to plan and implement egovernment initiatives after researching all 50 states websites and conducting interviews with highlevel state officials in the case study states it was determined that there is wide range of beliefs regarding the importance and usefulness of strategy documents over 60 of the responding states have comprehensive it strategic plans and policy documents some of these plans provide insight to specific egovernment goals and strategies but the majority of the plans are general it strategies wide variety of plan authors exist including technology councils offices of ctocio governors offices and even private businesses information technology strategic plans enterprise it plans egovernment strategic plans statewide it policies information management plans and it business plans are among the types of documents received from states or found on state websites these documents are used to track progress by defining the it plan and continually monitoring government agencies to ensure the plan is on track this report reviews documents available from state websites and the documents received with our survey responses most states have annual or biennial update periods but some states have strategy documents that are currently more than two years old see figure 5 36 oregon egovernment program web traffic metrics december 8 2005

how often does your state update its strategic documents monthly quarterly 000 263 other 3158 annually 3421 monthly quarterly annually other few of the individuals interviewed during the case study site visits said that the strategy documents were not able to keep up with the speed of technology development one kentucky official said that it is not worth the time and effort required to write and maintain glossy strategy documents when considering the quickness of new program innovation and implementation in realtime38 utah officials said it is not guiding principle but the documents do help to keep the agencies better coordinated other states clearly put great deal of effort into their strategy documents because they believe that it helps to measure progress and meet goals based on survey responses and case study interviews there is universal strategy document or planning process for egovernment programs while strategy documents may be variable in planning success also depends on effective implementation state culture and state egovernment stakeholders 38 former commissioner mike inman interview by renaetta nance and lewis leff commonwealth office of technology kentucky january 26 2006 crs20 state case studies california our goal is simple one we want to do it right39 leadership despite recent it procurement problems in california the state has never stopped planning and implementing egovernment initiatives on may 31 2001 the california department of technology services doit contracted with oracle to provide costly software for all state employee computers however the 95 million oracle contract was awarded as nobid contract without conducting departmental needs assessment and problems ensued as result the governor suspended the state cio on may 2 2002 the california legislature eliminated the doit on june 30 2002 and the state of california canceled the oracle contract the following news report relays the gravity of the offense and the demise of the doit the oracle computer software scandal claimed another casualty friday when the department of information technology bowed out of state government closing its doors for the last time the demise of the technology oversight body represents rare if not unique case of the sun actually setting on state department this is unprecedented definitely said assemblyman dean florez dshafter40 as result of the oracle situation and the california legislatures termination of the doit the governor of california drafted an executive order on july 1 2002 reassigning duties from the doit to other state agencies in 2003 the state legislature and the office of the governor began reconfiguring it in california support from the office of the governor legislature and cabinet secretaries is important for the successful implementation of egovernment services the office of the governor following the oracle problems appointed cio on september 20 2002 currently the state cio does not head an agency and does not have budgetary authority or formal policy authority there was consensus among those interviewed that the state cio should have it budget and policy authority otherwise the cio has limited control over implementation of the states egovernment plan strategy document planning for it programs in california resumed in 2003 at that time most itrelated documents were reports created by the state cio the first strategic plan was released in 2004 and included six goals make services more accessible to citizens and state clients 39 clark kelso california state information technology

collective research and judgement of literally hundreds of the states it and program leaders as part of the effort to accomplish the six strategic goals number of other objectives are also outlined some of these objectives include promoting interagency and intergovernmental data sharing leveraging the states geospatial information assets promoting the development of health information exchange expanding broadband access developing an integrated financial management system instituting processes to preserve digital materials adopting statewide information security and privacy standards adopting statewide enterprise architecture providing for succession planning investing in personnel and implementing performance measures the 2006 strategic plan provides specific dates by which action items are to be initiated or completed and claims to demonstrate that california has transitioned from planning to execution43 implementation the it council makes recommendations for implementation of statewide it initiatives membership on this council consists of information officers and other representatives from number of state agencies after projects are reviewed by the it council each representative returns to his or her respective agency to commence implementation however uniformity of implementation is difficult to assess because of california governments high level of decentralization california offers variety of online services such as filing of income tax returns payment of income taxes filing of sales and use tax returns setting of department of motor vehicles dmv appointments and settling of traffic citations before the dmv offered online appointmentsetting californians stood in long lines to complete dmv transactions in general californians

the cerrito office many times but could not get through when i called here sacramento i got through right away on the first call rankin said at the 24th street headquarters office tuesday44 one of the goals of the state cio is to reduce the amount of time constituents spend completing government transactions at the time that the interviews were conducted 100 of vital records were provided online while rough estimates of the percentage of transactions customers can complete online range from low of about 25 to high of about 60 to 70 most of these services are transactional for example customer may apply and pay for drivers license online while also checking the status of the applications the department of education provides another example explaining why state agencies implement electronic systems the department has special reporting and performance requirements for example the federal child left behind law requires tracking of academic achievement for individual students therefore the department developed system to track this data enacted in september 2002 senate bill 1453 established the california longitudinal pupil achievement data system calpads which calls for unique student identification numbers for all students the longitudinal data collected via this program is linked to achievement standards reports are provided to public schools districts elected officials and the general public as well as to comply with federal reporting requirements outsourcing laws and collective bargaining contracts limit the states ability to outsource the california state employees union cseu is significant force the cseu successfully negotiated with the state to ensure that outsourcing is utilized minimally45 interviewees indicated that collective bargaining unit contracts are obstacles to outsourcing it projects policy and process modifications are suggested to give the state more outsourcing flexibility the current process for outsourcing involves the department of finance department of personnel the cseu and the department recommending outsourcing the collective bargaining unit contracts delineate specific timelines and require consensus before final action may be taken this process can take up to two years to complete and advocates for changing the approval process indicate that newer technologies which are better suited for the project may become available before approval occurs 44 dmv appointments boon to some drivers the sacramento bee august 15 1984 p b3 45 california state employees union seiu local 1000 unit 01 contract 20032005

appropriately done by unit 1 4 11 14 15 and 20 employees and that said contracting results in unnecessary additional costs to the state crs23 funding financing it projects in california is similar to other states projects are funded by state agency through the states budget process and finance department prior to its elimination the doit reviewed most statewide information technology initiatives however since the departments demise this responsibility is now delegated to each state agency thus funding is very decentralized to continue implementing it plans and raising support for it ongoing collaborative research is conducted by subgroups of department cios these subgroups forward their recommendations to the full it council if approved by the it council each department is responsible for implementation of the subgroups recommendations an important note here is that the it councils decisions are advisory in nature however the lead person for each agency serves on this council and has decision authority in their agency once the it council agrees that project should move forward the department of finance dof the state legislature and governor approve funding through the budget process the department of general services dgs does the procurement for state it services however technology changes at rapid pace and the dof must screen new programs through lengthy benefitcost analysis process this process may take up to two to three years before technology can be purchased by this time prices may increase or newer and better technology may become available egovernment initiatives also are financed by means other than state funding in the case of the department of education some programs are funded with federal formula assistance or through competitive grant programs for example the california longitudinal pupil achievement data system is funded with title vi federal formula assistance additional funding was received through competitive grant programs centralizeddecentralized technology management in its current configuration californias it system is highly decentralized one interviewee indicated that centralization may be an appropriate it governance structure in smaller states but not for california however to develop similar website look and feel each agency has cio who is member of the it council the it councils mission is to provide guidance to the state cio make it recommendations for implementation by executive agency departments and consider issues initiated by the state cio it issues are presented to the it council for its consideration all agency cios then work on completion of the approved it initiatives this is one manner in which the state cio is able to effect change without formal budgetary or policy authority best practices planning california state leaders identify planning as the first step of egovernment development after consensus is built around plan implementation is focused on accomplishing the goals set out in the plan crs24 buyin strategies in promoting the plan within the state legislature egovernment leaders in california argue that it is important that it remain nonpartisan issue collaboration due to the decentralized nature of egovernance in california there is strong intraagency collaboration that successfully implements egovernment strategies by acknowledging different agency goals and circumstances46 it council collaboration is exemplified in the it council that includes highranking agency officials and agency cios from variety of different areas in the public sector the it council allows california agencies to develop common language for conveying expectations and goals in online service provision and intraagency communication highlevel leadership the governor supports egovernment leaders enabling the state to advocate and promote initiatives within different levels of government with strong backing from the top garnering the governors support bolsters it and egovernmentfriendly legislation and prioritizes it initiatives consolidation consolidation of californias two largest data centers has been one of the top issues for the governor and state cio in recent years47 despite the historical independence of the two data centers consolidation is underway with the support of the current governor and state cio kentucky though kentuckys recent progress has been swift there remains much to be accomplished if we do not act on our dreams we are destined to remain at the bottom of most technology rankings48 leadership enterprise portal

does not have single statewide egovernmentspecific strategy document however the governors prescription for innovation in conjunction with the individual county strategic plans facilitated by connectkentucky appears to many to be an appropriate overall strategy for the commonwealth kentucky interactive connectkentucky and the cot may have different responsibilities and internal strategies but they are interconnected through the governors prescription for innovation mike inman the cot commissioner until august 2006 explained that his overarching strategy for better government was guided by four it factors improving security improving services to citizens and government reducing the cost of it while enhancing value to business and government and the governors prescription for innovation50 connectkentucky also refers to the governors plan to develop egovernment strategy prior to drafting the prescription for innovation the governor met with brian mefford ceopresident of connectkentucky to discuss connectkentuckys role in facilitating the plan from the grassroots level to the commissioner of technology groups work together to implement the prescription for innovation the governors plan stands as framework or living document that is used as guide by all planning groups it establishes aggressive goals for broadband deployment and technology adoption including making broadband available to all citizens businesses and local governments by 2007 dramatically improving adoption of computers and the internet developing meaningful online applications for local

egovernment leaders has been to increase the availability of broadband and develop stronger government presence online the governors plan has proven to be successful according to recently released report from the fcc kentucky leads the nation in its rate of broadband adoption growth over the past two years in 2003 approximately 60 of kentucky households had the ability to subscribe to broadband at the end of 2005 an estimated 77 of households could access broadband52 this is an increase of more than 240000 households over twoyear time period53 during this same time actual home broadband usage increased from 22 to 3254 governor fletchers prescription for innovation is being implemented through connectkentucky in partnership with local community leaders the individual county strategic plans developed by the local technology leadership teams complement the recent surge in broadband adoption these documents serve as roadmaps for technologybased growth and economic development connectkentucky assists community leaders with the development of county plans by engaging in many strategic activities including benchmarking current uses of technology recommending strategic approach to adopting appropriate applications researching applications that will enhance the economic vitality of the community providing project management to ensure successful implementation and encouraging investment from providers such as cable or telecommunications companies and municipalities55 implementation kentuckys approach is based on the collaborative efforts of government citizens businesses educational institutions and the private sector however the core of this relationship is threetiered it is comprised of the cot kentucky interactive llc and connectkentucky the cot is kentuckys primary technology organization for providing leadership and governance of all aspects of information technology the commissioners priorities are for an efficient effective and economical

organizes and manages the infrastructure of egovernment while granting large amount of autonomy in the area of portal management to the states private partner kentucky interactive for example if state agency wants to develop particular service online it has two channels it can file request through the cot or it can go to kentucky interactivekentuckygov directly if it goes directly to kentucky interactive the portal manager must share that information with cot however the portal manager will prioritize the project under the oversight of the commissioners office and begin to develop it with lot of independence from the cot when it is project that will require backend modifications or mainframe integration there is collaborative approach between the cot and kentucky interactive56 kentucky interactive is whollyowned subsidiary of nic inc publicly held company that builds and manages official government websites and egovernment services kentucky interactive is responsible for the development management hosting and marketing of the state portal on behalf of the commonwealth of kentucky awarded the contract in february 2003 kentucky interactives goals are to expand the base of

kentucky with other states when governor fletcher came into office connectkentucky was asked to lead his prescription for innovation one of his main policy initiatives today connectkentucky serves as unified effort to drive technology policy and egovernment initiatives notable feature of connectkentuckys methodology is the grassroots nature of its approach whereas many states develop top down approaches to egovernment strategy kentucky starts at the bottom to generate vision and support for the larger state plan the governors state it plan becomes increasingly effective as more citizens on the county and local levels develop sense of ownership at the local level the process of building an online presence for local government normally begins with kickoff event in each county

county outsourcing brian mefford the president and ceo of connectkentucky believes that independence and the publicprivate partnership model are critical to the success of egovernment in kentucky the main state portal kentuckygov is government service administered for the good of the public that also benefits from the entrepreneurial spirit and efficiencies found in private business it exemplifies true publicprivate partnership between the commonwealth and kentucky interactive llc60 benefit of this particular private partnership derives from the fact that kentucky interactive is subsidiary of larger company nic which works in 17 other states across the united states61 thus kentucky interactive can share knowledge about application development and execution this works to the advantage of the state because kentuckygov is able to integrate proven applications in shorter time frame than those states that must finance their own research and development of new applications funding during the bidding process one of the most important factors was the nocost selffunding financial component primary funding for the portal comes from the assessment of enhanced access fees for select set of commercially valuable services without the use of any tax dollar appropriations leveraging enhanced access fees for small number of services that are traditionally coupled with fees primarily highvolume business applications allows kentucky interactive to develop tremendous range of free services that provide public good62 according to kentucky interactive the selffunding model encourages the private partner and the commonwealth to build online services that the constituents want works efficiently to identify and create new online services and invests in marketing activities to drive egovernment adoption63 increased online service adoption is essential to the private partner because fees drive the return on investment however 99 of all information and services available on kentuckygov are free to the public64 in february 2005 the commonwealth renewed its egovernment services contract with kentucky interactive for two more years under the procurement and budget process

crossjurisdiction horizontal coordination most notable in this endeavor is the establishment of open standards in its open standards policy the government must ensure that its investments in it result

uniformity in technology and decisionmaking across agencies in the it acquisition policy the commonwealth notes responsibility to provide it solutions based on best value after careful consideration of all possible alternatives including proprietary public sector code sharing and open source solutions74 thus the commonwealth recognizes that certain solutions may not be available or costeffective from private vendors at such point the commonwealth may explore open source solutions open source refers to software built upon the principle that end users should be given source code and should be

outsourced approaches to it project implementation and management depending on the size and scope of the project for instance the commonwealth recently established an office within the application services group which can take on small to midsized development efforts using team of individuals with various opensource and proprietary skill sets however there are many other instances where the commonwealth does not possess the necessary resources or skill sets to implement particular it solution in those situations the commonwealth engages the services of it vendors who are chosen through preestablished competitive procurement guidelines however the commonwealth does not outsource jobs that can be done by state employees pursuant to the 1993 privatization law sometimes referred to as the pacheco law in reference to state senator marc pacheco who introduced the legislation76 funding another concern for egovernment is adequate funding the chief concern of government and it agencies is demographic change massachusetts has an aging population with approximately 185 million citizens 62 years or older77 this population comprises roughly 30 of the commonwealths estimated 63 million

creative methods to adequately provide services to citizens with the possibility of receiving smaller budget allotments currently itd finances its projects through combination of direct legislative appropriations it bonds and chargeback fees the itd is constantly researching and implementing strategies to more efficiently meet the it needs of its agencies one recent initiative is the development of framework of guidelines and open standards aimed at longterm interoperability centralizeddecentralized technology management in massachusetts the branches of government have little crossagency interaction and conformity this type of government leads to an entrenched agency or branch identity and makes it difficult to integrate egovernment services under uniform standard in order to obtain the desired interoperability agencies need to understand the mission of egovernment and in particular the concept of open standards the implementation of egovernment is decentralized however it is moving toward greater integration similarly egovernment management also is decentralized while the cio and the itd strive to coordinate agencies they have yet to convince all agencies to get on board

can leverage the purchasing power of all state agencies when negotiating contracts with the vendor community92 aggregating the states commodity purchases through common contract vehicles is intended to 1 reduce it costs 2 decrease administrative costs 3 maximize value 4 develop common it procurement processes and 5 create an advocate on an enterprise level the legislation is costeffective measure because it also requires all state agencies to procure necessary and related items only through dir centrallynegotiated contracts in fact the texas legislative budget board estimates that hb1516 will have twoyear net positive impact of 15436963 towards the states general revenue centralizeddecentralized technology management the public face of texas state government is the states online portal however the portal is collaborative effort stemming from the partnership of public and private enterprise based on the state constitution the state of texas has highly decentralized governance system since the governor does not have cabinet unlike other governments where agencies are integrated within branches and are accountable to cabinet authorities texas agencies have great autonomy and personal accountability this governance style has created roadblocks in coordinating state technological initiatives for the last year and half the dir has been able to gather different bodies under shared applications while maintaining individual agency selfdetermination prior to that point overcoming strong bureaucratic identities made integration of technology very difficult93 90 department of

property rights although the dir outsources some of the labor the department maintains control over intellectual property rights limited control of other agencies the dir allows state agencies to pursue their core mission objectives by providing adequate technical support for those mission objectives understanding of cost savings in egovernment texas has completed number of studies of online services that identify how much the state could save if citizen adoption rates were to reach different levels for example for online tax services the state could save up to 19 million if they achieved 30 percent takeup rate but fully 63 million if the adoption rate was 100 percent94 additionally the texas department of agriculture has studied adoption rates in relation to cost savings95 thus texas

industry and technology trends our goal is to maintain an it strategic plan that optimizes both statewide needs and the priority local needs of state agencies96 leadership former utah governor mike leavitt championed the incorporation of egovernment in state governance as early as 1993 under his direction the utah information technology commission itc was created to include the three branches of government as well as citizens and businesses the commission was established to review and propose legislation enabling transparent efficient and accessible government over time this group has been adjusted to form the utah technology commission utc with similar agenda an executive branch committee referred to as the product management council is collection of product managers from state agencies these managers are dedicated to facilitating crossagency collaboration offering input to the cio regarding agency egovernment initiatives and providing recommendations to the cio and business on egovernment directions some of the most relevant actors in the egovernment strategy development process are the product management council business leaders and the cio currently the cio coordinates with the product management council in developing the states overall egovernment strategic process together they take recommendations from agencies and make suggestions to agencies on implementation the cio and product management council monitor state services from the centralized department of technology services dts and agency perspectives in 2005 house bill 109 established the dts as centralized it agency state agencies are responsible for developing their own egovernment strategies and using those strategies to drive product delivery in their business models strategy and execution of the egovernment process is managed by experienced individuals with history of government work information technology is critical in executing the egovernment process technological infrastructure is necessary to offer services utah adheres to management and planning processes with the goal of improving governance to drive its egovernment strategy actors within the dts the governors office and an integration partner utah interactive are committed to managing utahgov and its domains to the best of their abilities making the site userfriendly and relevant to constituents strategy document utah has several egovernment strategic documents that define its operating parameters and guide the progress of egovernment initiatives including it strategy and enterprise

transitioning away from this system and creating an optimized it department the dts to consolidate all of the state agencies it functions into single department97 the goal of the optimization is to increase the number and quality of services offered without increasing the costs of providing them implementation utahs successful egovernment program is largely the result of sound leadership and decentralized agency strategy execution former governor mike leavitt sponsored the grama government records access and management act98 this legislation mandated requirements for the digitization of records and the use of online communication both tools were essential for transforming government into more transparent entity by 1995 utah pioneered an early web presence and soon after began winning awards recognizing its homepage99 in 1999 the state contracted with utah interactive subsidiary of nic inc to privately manage the web portal and centralize utahs major online operations and applications agencies which are responsible for executing their services negotiate with utah interactive in developing their services since 1999 over 400 services have been brought online to the onestop shopping portal the states egovernment actors emphasize customer service in the egovernment strategy development process utah uses performance measures including returnsoninvestment increasing services but not budgets egovernment web trafficking matrices and customer satisfaction and feedback each agency utilizes additional agencyspecific performance measures to evaluate its business models these measures include tracking repeat usage adoption and efficiency compared to private markets utahs overall egovernment strategy is framed with agencies business goals in mind each agency has input into what applications and services are offered to best serve its customers new agency portals accessed through utahgov undergo extensive testing by new and old users to measure ease of navigation and

are responsible for their own egovernment initiatives agency budgets cover expenses for new online projects supported by the dts an internal service fund finances the central it department eliminating the need to increase taxes or request more funding from the legislature since the creation of the dts involves the reorganization and streamlining of existing positions the state should not incur new costs centralizeddecentralized technology management as of january 2006 the state was undergoing transition whereby roughly 1000 its employees would be converted into dts employees and given the option to convert from merit career civilservice status to atwill status relocating it staff from individual agencies to centralized structure while simultaneously altering individuals employment status caused early concern for some employees which was offset by incentives for those wishing to convert the difficulty of altering 1000 job descriptions retraining employees and eliminating positions was compounded by the lack of additional funding house bill 109 outlined the structure for it in the state but did not allocate new dollars to the process the financial burden rests on agencies to develop contracts with the new state agency the dts100 many state actors anticipate this strategy will be cost effective because it services are provided by employees from one department rather than individual agencies the product management council encourages collaboration between agency product managers on egovernment initiatives101 for example product manager at the dmv can execute the departments mission statement by collaborating with sister agencies and utah interactive to develop online applications with the technical assistance of the dts cooperation between the cios office

strategies to ensure that customers are receiving the service that they need in convenient manner the digital properties and interactive technologies staff conducts focus groups and surveys of users to constantly collect and use feedback to improve service delivery rather than assuming or guessing how customers are using services or what improvements they need they use data to strategize and make changes as needed customer service provides faqs selfguided online help and live chat assistance which is outsourced through this process the state has determined that it has 64 satisfaction rate among citizens but lower scores in the 50s among business users113 this disparity has led to renewed focus on improving provision of services to businesses business portal initiative is underway to address this deficit and better serve the business community in washington washington uses benchmarking extensively against firstgov the american cancer society and certain government websites washington strives for customer satisfaction rate of 68 or above114 to improve citizen and business usage of onlineprovided services washington conducted large media campaign in 2005 the media campaign lasted two months and included bus ads radio spots web ads and local tv commercial spots digital properties staff attends trade shows and crossadvertises with agency websites crossadvertising

that utilize government services the consolidation of services and data as well as the provision of services in new ways has allowed agencies to better serve citizens improvements for egovernment users and traditional users occur because employee time is freed up thus employees can offer better service to all customers122 an interesting process used by washington is the digital academy wherein representatives from numerous agencies are brought together to solve an agencyspecific problem the problems are chosen so that the solution may be used by other agencies in similar situations the representatives then work together over period of days or weeks to develop solution that can be packaged and shared among other agencies the cooperation between agencies allows for greater buyin to cooperative solutions and for more creative problem solving agencies feel sense of ownership and participation that can potentially increase utilization of enterprisewide solutions this level of cooperation and sharing of solutions is hallmark of washingtons egovernment strategy123 best practices leadership washington has strong leadership at the executive and agency level that places

comparison to other cabinetlevel positions it should be noted that many states experience frequent turnover in the cio position which may make consistent strategizing and implementation difficult throughout numerous transitions strategy documents based on survey results and interviews there are many innovative ways to accomplish strategic vision for egovernment that do not involve the distribution of one key strategic plan for example kentuckys prescription for innovation in conjunction with the individual county strategic plans facilitated by connectkentucky could arguably be better overall strategy for the commonwealth and other similar states in addition the type of strategic document relied upon by different states varies widely from it plans to enterprise architecture plans and express egovernment strategies although egovernment program strategy and planning is essential for performance measurement and benchmarking the type of strategy or planning process varies and does not appear to affect the success failure or advancement of state egovernment strategy and implementation thus as evidenced in this study states can develop range of documents that span from traditional formal documents to variety of other strategies and still plan egovernment effectively and efficiently implementation cooperation communication and collaboration are vital to the egovernment program implementation process performance measures and constant evaluation of egovernment programs and services are essential to the planning and implementation process regardless of state leadership there needs to be constant focus on the implementation of the states egovernment plan the collaborative efforts of government leadership citizens businesses educational institutions and the private sector are ideal but not always feasible some states find crs49 that the sheer size of their constituencies and decentralization of agencies impede collaboration in egovernment initiatives depending on statespecific situations risktaking can be very beneficial states such as washington that are willing to take risks and start trends tend to be at the forefront of technology and in the transformational egovernment phase other states that are more riskaverse are more likely to wait until egovernment technologies are proven and thereby safer to implement many states agree that marketing specific services to targeted constituency is the most efficient and effective form of increasing the adoption rate of online services in terms of egovernment development most states are in the transactional phase of egovernment as mentioned in the research and methodology section of the report however states are moving toward the transformative phase as evidenced in the increased desire to have onestopshopping operations on primary state portals and enterprise architecture development strategies outsourcing the trend in outsourcing tends to be toward all or nothing with states either contracting out the majority of their services to private vendor or providing all egovernment and web portal services inhouse outsourcing and contracting out egovernment and portal services are becoming more commonplace along with the attendant benefits and risks some states could find themselves tied to contractors who retain ownership of the systems they produce other states such as texas maintain more flexibility in their contracting arrangements and ensure that the state has ownership of all web properties the contracting field is narrow with few major players establishing presence in many states and in some ways centralizing or standardizing portal development with only few providers of egovernment contracting services state egovernment services could approach greater uniformity as additional states contract with the same providers outsourcing can be controversial due to the high costs of it projects related to egovernment programs and contracting issues problems with contracting and purchasing processes can influence the publics perception of it investment and strip power from responsible parties such as state cios and it directors who initiate egovernment programs costly unsuccessful programs can influence cios ability to maintain consistent funding because state legislatures may be more skeptical in supporting future egovernment projects funding financing is of primary concern to most states and the issue is dealt with in number of ways including revolving accounts transaction fees general operating funds capital funds and federal funds many states rely on combination of general funds capital funds and user fees contracting agreements for egovernment services can provide alternative methods for financing by reducing implementation costs and startup costs some of these methods allow for revenue sharing in the implementation phase of the egovernment process many respondents report that state budget or finance divisions have direct control over egovernment daytoday management egovernment oversight and management involves multiple entities including budget and finance offices while egovernment is considered costsaving measure reducing the need for employees to perform some customer service tasks actual dollar savings or cuts are often not realized however egovernment may allow state to do more with the same amount of resources customers who do not take advantage of egovernment crs50 services need the services of employees for their inperson or mail utilization of services these customers still realize gains from egovernment as employees are better able to serve their needs some states find that egovernment allows them to slow employment growth because workloads are shifted and reduced other states realize savings from reductions in staffing as evidenced in various agencies in texas adoption rates that cross the 30 threshold often indicate cost savings from online service provision as adoption rates increase savings can occur in many areas such as more staff time for new projects decrease in transportation and postage costs and greater capacity to manage high caseloads egovernment web portals may not increase revenues but they are increasingly viewed as necessary mechanism of information delivery to respond to public and private sectors that demand information and services centralizeddecentralized technology management the institutionalization of enterprise architecture planning seems to be the goal of many states often leading to some form of centralization in terms of management of egovernment programs and web portals that offer many services through one site centralization may be in the form of data sharing application sharing or even data consolidation moving toward centralized structure works to benefit many states by avoiding overlap allowing for cooperation and data sharing and streamlining processes in some large states centralization is not always possible or desirable in these states enterprise orientation can still be part of the thinking and planning process the silo mentality of agencies desire to be independent and to resist change is major obstacle for many states that desire greater centralization enterprise architecture planning is becoming more widespread and can be beneficial to egovernment efforts crs51 bibliography
