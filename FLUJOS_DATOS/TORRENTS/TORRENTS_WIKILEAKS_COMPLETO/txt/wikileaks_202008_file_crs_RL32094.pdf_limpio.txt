of the various legislative proposals mentioned below especially th real id act of 2005 domestic policy questions about acceptance of the matrícula consular fall mainly in the overlapping areas of immigration public sa fety and law enforcement and homeland security immigration in important respects the debate over the matrícula c onsular is debate about how to address the issue of unauthorized immigration to the united states those who support domestic acceptance of the matríc ula consular emphasize that the card is issued solely for identification purposes and does not confer any type of legal immigration status on the bearer they maintain that acceptance of the card is necessary in postsept ember 11 2001 america in which photo identification is required to conduct daily busin ess and that such acceptance is beneficial not only for the holders but for the banks and other ins titutions as well so supporters address the unauthorized immigration issue more directly arguing that it is time to acknowledge that there are millions of unauthor ized aliens living and working in the united states and to take steps to more fully integrate them into society they argue that it is better for these individuals to have an identity and to participate openly in the financial institutions where their transactions can be monitored rather than to engage in surreptitious actions that encourages the acquisition of fraudulent documents opponents of domestic acceptance of the ma trícula consular argue that the card is needed only by aliens who are illegally present in the united states and do not possess other acceptable identification documents they maintain that the matrícula consular helps unauthorized mexicans live and conduct business in the united states by for example enabling them to open bank accounts in so aiding illegal aliens opponents charge the card effectively c onfers quasilegal status on them in subversion of us immigration law th ey view efforts to gain widespread acceptance of the card as part of larger strategy to legalize the status of unauthorized mexicans in the united stat more broadly opponents argue that acceptance of the matrícula consular s negative implications for the countrys ability to set future immigration policy public safety and law enforcement public safety and law enforcement figu re prominently in the debate surrounding domestic acceptance of the matrícula consular supporters argue that the card is secure fraudresistant document that reliably identifies the bearer mexican officials maintain that the documents presented to obtain the card are properly authenticated with respect to verifying birth certificat the primary document used to obtain matrícula consular mexican officials assert that consular staff work closely withhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32094crs6 document registries in mexico when they have any doubts about the legitimacy of birth certificate these officials also argue that mexico has developed comprehensive database that would prev ent the issuance of duplicate and fraudulent cards and that it has the ability to check the applicants identity against the large mexican voter registration database and against stop list of nonacceptable persons they note that the matrícula cons ular cards are as secure as if not more secure than many us documents includi ng birth certificates and social security cards and some states drivers licenses supporters take the position that acceptan ce of the matrícula consular by law enforcement agencies improves public safety by for example helping police officers identify witnesses victims and suspects if individuals do not possess acceptable identificati on they explain law enforcement agencies must expend time and resources to try to identify them suppor ters also maintain that aliens with identification are more likely to report crime s and cooperate in po lice investigations supporters further argue that acceptance of the matrícula consular by entities other than law enforcement agencies has public safety benefits as an example they cite acceptance of the card by financia l institutions to open bank accounts and participate in various economic activities usually at reduced cost they maintain that individuals who are able to deposit their money in banks do not have to carry around large amounts of cash or keep large sums in their homes and thus are less likely to become crime victims opponents of domestic acceptance of the matrícula consular challenge the assertion that the card is secure document they argue that despite its fraud resistant features the card is not secure because the underlying documentation used to obtain it is not properly authenticated they express particul ar concern about the mexican birth certificate which they say is easily forged opponents of domestic acceptance of the matrícula consular assert that the authentication process relies on visual inspection of documents by mexican consular personnel which they claim is inadequate they also argue that there are inadequate mechanisms to prevent the issuance of multiple cards to the same pers on they cite cases in which single individual has been found with multiple cards each containing the individuals photograph but different name opponents argue that acceptance of the ma trícula consular by law enforcement agencies threatens public safety they maintain that in cases of minor infractions police departments that recognize the card are not conducting background checks or taking fingerprints of card holders gi ven this practice opponents argue the card helps conceal past criminal activity they further speculate that the acceptance of the matrícula consular by the police will encourage drug traffickers and other criminals to obtain the cards the potential use of the matrícula consular to establish false identities is of great concern to opponents they argue that cards issued to individuals under false names can be and have been used to obtain driv ers licenses and other documents in those names to create multiple identities acco rding to opponents individuals can use these false identities to fac ilitate criminal acts such as money laundering and alien smuggling and to avoid detection by authoritieshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32094crs7 10 see house judiciary the federal governments response hearing testimony of steven mccraw assistant director of the fbis office of intelligence 11 in his testimony steven mccraw mentioned the arrest of an iranian man attempting to enter the united states from mexico who was carrying matrícula consular card identifying him as mexican citizenhomeland security supporters of domestic acceptance of the ma trícula consular argue that the card improves homeland security by enabling the authorities to easily and accurately identify mexican nationals in the united states they maintain that individuals who are isolated and marginalized pose greater potential security threat than those who are known they emphasize that mexico is not terroristsupporting country and that mexicans come to the united states to work not to commit terrorist acts opponents argue that domestic acceptan ce of the card threatens homeland security according to june 2003 congressi onal testimony by the federal bureau of investigation fbi the ability of foreign nationals to use the matricula consular to create welldocumented but fictitious identity in the united states provides an opportunity for terrorists to move freely in the united states without triggering name based watch lists the fbi also expressed concern about the possible use of false identities to transfer funds to support terrorist acts10 in arguing against acceptance of the matrícula consular on security grounds opponents state that the lax issuance procedures have enabled nonmexicans in cluding at least one known individual of middle eastern descent to obtain valid cards11 they further contend that accepting the mexican consular card sets dangerous precedent since other less friendly countries may decide to issu consular identification cards to their nationals in the united states foreign policy implications the foreign policy implications of the ma trícula consular may be viewed under three main headings the usmexico bila teral relationship reciprocity of treatment of citizens abroad and consular notification in law enforcement situations bilateral relations during the 2000 mexican presidential campaign the major candidates discovered that the status of mexican migra nts in the united states was one of the top concerns among the mexican people large portion of the population has relative in the united states and there is widespread concern about the plight of migrants who die enroute or are exploite d in some way in the united states as result when president fox of the conservative national action party pan was elected in july 2000 and inaugurated in december 2000 he began

in other areas including trade drug control and foreign policy cooperation at two major presiden tial meetings in 2001 the two presidents launched cabinetlevel negotiations to address migration and labor issues between the countries however following the sept ember 2001 terrorist attacks the migration talks stalled and legislation was enacted despite several legislative initiatives and an immigration proposal by president bush in january 2004 during the 2004 presidential campaig n both major candidates called for immigration reform and since president bu shs reelection in november 2004 and his reinauguration in january 2005 he s asserted that immigration reform will be priority in his second term he calle d again for immigration reform that would provide temporary legal status for foreign guest workers in his state of the union address on february 2 200512 given the lack of progress so far on the bilateral migration talks some observers have argued that the mexican governments campaign to issue consular identification cards was way to provide limited benefits to the migra nt population in the united states giving them access to banking serv ices permitting them to transfer money to mexico at cheaper rates through established institutions and permitting them to have more normal access to regula r activities in the united st ates supporters of the matrícula consular argue that by improving the lives of mexican citizens the card has improved the relationship between the united states and mexico despite falling short of the desired migration agreement they cite improved bilateral cooperation in many areas most notably in enhanced mexican efforts to control drug trafficking activities to cooperate on border control plans and to deploy soldiers to secure access points to the united states during th war in iraq although mexico favored more multilateral approach to that problem these supporters argue that restricting the issuance and acceptance of the identity car ds might have an adverse effect on the bilateral relationship between the countries and mexican officials did criticize the passage of the real id act of 2005 as part of the fy2005 emergency supplemental in may 2005 opponents of the matrícula consular may acknowledge that the card has improved bilateral relations to some extent but they argue that regulations covering issuance and acceptance are necessary to achieve the more important us goals of control of immigration policy and defense against possible threat of terrorism they argue that mexican officials have b een inappropriately involved in the domestic affairs of the united states when they have promoted acceptance of the cardshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32094crs9 13 for further information on this subject see crs report rs21627

testimony of roberta s jacobson acting deputy assistant secret ary of state for the bureau of western hemisphere affairsreciprocal treatment as indicated above it is traditional pr actice for

under international law through the vie nna convention on consular relations of 1963 which provides that states will accord this right to each other on reciprocal basis13 in addition it is traditional practice for many institutions in one country to accept the official documents of another country for va riety of transactions such as accepting us drivers license for driving automobiles in mexico according to roberta jacobson the actin g deputy assistant secretary of state for western hemisphere affairs in stimony at june 2003 house immigration subcommittee hearing on consular identification cards the department of state issues documentation other than passport for us citizens abroad and at times occasionally issues similar identity cards or travel documents s hould foreign country decide

identification cards abroad and mexico and any other foreign state will recognize the documents of us citizens fo r variety of activities critics of the matrícula consular rarely comment on this aspect but may argue that us documents would continue to be recognized by foreign states even if us acceptance of the matrícula consular were to be restricted because they facilitate t ourism and the transaction of highlydesired business consular notification in her june 2003 testimony state depa rtment official jacobson mentioned another benefit of consular identification cards namely that they

detainee of his or her right to request that the relevant consular officials be notified of the detention without delay consular notification is relatively easy when the detainee is carrying card that

justice on behalf of mexican citizens sentenced to death in the united states charging that us official s have violated the vienna convention on consular relations by systematically failing to inform mexicans of their right to consular assistance under the treaty af ter several preliminar decisions on march 31 2004 the international court found that the united states had breached its obligations under the vienna convention by failing to notify and enable mexican consular officials to assist 51 mexican suspects who are now on death row and it ordered the united states to review the convictions

dismissed the appeal to permit the lower courts to resolve the issue under president bushs directive proponents of the matrícula consular argue that cons ular identification cards make it easier for us law enforcement officials to notify consulates of the detention of foreign nationals and thereby improve the likelihood that us citizens under arrest abroad will have the be nefit of consular notification and protection in the case of mexico achieving better record on c onsular notification would remove major irritant in the bilateral re lationship opponents of consul ar identification cards would argue that there should be other means and other indications of identity that would permit law enforcement officials to adhere to the consular notification obligations without establishing

administration opponents of the amendmen t argued that the treasury regulations were too lax in that they permitted the use of documents that are easily forged that might be used by terrorists and that are largely used by persons who are illegally in the united states after consideration of other amendments the overall measure was passed by the house on september 22 2004 th ereby restoring

mission had violated these regulations and that such violation threatened national security or facilitated fraudulent or criminal acts th secretary would notify the relevant government that the mission must suspend issuance of consular identification cards until it was in compliance if the foreign mission failed to suspend issuance of the cards the state department would cease issuance of immigra nt or nonimmigrant visas or both to nationals of that country until the mission was in compliance with the regulations19 supporters of these proposed restrictions argued that foreign governments have been issuing consular identification cards in the united states for purposes other than those intended by the vienna conven tion on consular relations namely to circumvent us immigration law and that the issuance of the car ds should be subject to us regulation they argued that the car ds are not reliable form of identification because the mexican government has automated and secure system to assure that the cards are not forged or shared or i ssued to more than one individual or to individuals relying on fraudulent documents they further argued that the cards are susceptible to being used to establish false identities that may facilitate money laundering alien smuggling and terrorist activity opponents of the proposed restrictions argu ed that the restri ctions are directed against consular identification cards in general the mexican matrícula consular in particular and persons of hispanic herita ge they argued that the requirements especially the requirements that the records be given to the united states and be subject to audit by the united states pose unreasonable restrictions on foreign governments right under the vienna conven tion to register and monitor its nationals abroad they further argued that the penalties for noncompliance were extremely onerous to the extent that the issuance of the matrícula consular has been viewed as improving mexicous bi lateral relations the house passed restrictions would likely be seen as harming the bilateral relationship the restrictions would also be viewed by opponents as making consular tification more difficult and raising the possibility that reciprocal action by other nations might harm the us governments ability to register and monitor us nationals abroad measures on acceptance

federal employee an alien in the united states could present 1 any document issued by the us attorney general or the secretary of homeland secu rity under the authority of an immigration law 2 domestically issued document that the secretary of homeland security had designated as reliable and that could not be issued to an alien unlawfully present in the united states or 3 any unexpire d lawfully issued foreign passport as determined by the secretary of state this provision would likely have precluded the presentation of the mexican consular id as an identity document to federal officials section 3052 would have barre d federal agencies three years after enactment from accepting drivers licenses or other identification unless such licenses satisfied standards set by the secretary of homela nd security including verification of the authenticity of the documents and proof that the person possesses or is ineligible for social security account it would also have

amended by the house on october 8 2004 after which the text wa s incorporated into s 2845 and was considered passed by the house on oc tober 16 2004 proponents of the specified immigration provisions argued that they were necessary to prevent the acquisition by possible terrorists of identity documents that would permit entry to airplanes and federal buildings where they could cause harm opponents argued mostly that the measures were not central to the main pur pose of the legislation namely reform of the intelligence services and that the measures had not been adequately considered some of the mentioned pr ovisions were among the most difficult to resolve in conference however eventually after lengthy negotiations and an agreement to consider the left out matters early in the 109th congress
