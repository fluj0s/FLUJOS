with additional warheads in storage deployed in the peoples liberation army plas second artillery the nucleararmed ballistic missiles currently launch single warheads chinas nuclear armed missile force is deployed with about 25 launchers for the limitedrange df4 intercontinental ballistic missile icbm about 25 launchers for the longrange df 5a icbm about 40 launchers for the older df3a mediumrange ballistic missile mrbm and about 50 launchers for the mobile solidfuel df21 mrbm there may be multiple missiles that could be reloaded to some of the launchers most of the plas icbms are believed to be targeted at us cities as part of the prcs secondstrike countervalue minimum deterrence doctrine officially declared as the first use policy in april 1999 president clinton stated that the prc has fewer than two dozen longrange nuclear weapons compared to 6000 in the us arsenal chinas program to deploy the jl1 submarinelaunched ballistic missile slbm on xiaclass nuclear ballistic missile submarine ssbn is not yet successful in the future the pla plans to deploy after 2000 or 2005 the new more survivable and reliable df31 icbm with lighter warhead and the jl2 slbm on the new type 094 ssbn the df31 chinas first landmobile solidfuel icbm was first tested in august 1999 in addition china plans to deploy the landmobile longerrange df 41 icbm perhaps after 2010 there are also hundreds of increasingly accurate and mobile df21a mrbms and m9 m11 and m7 shortrange ballistic missiles for theater operations likely armed with conventional warheads since the mid1990s the plas dramatic build up and launches in 199596 of theater missiles have already spurred calls for meeting taiwans missile defense needs in march 2000 admiral dennis blair commander inchief of the pacific command publicly confirmed that the pla has deployed about 200 ballistic missiles against taiwan and is adding 50 more year the plas cruise missiles have ranges up to 200 km 125 and of these the hy3 and the ssn22 sunburn that russia supplied in 2000 are supersonic anti ship cruise missiles however china is reportedly developing longerrange land attack cruise missiles lacms in 1997 the department of defense reported that china has placed priority on developing lacms for theater warfighting and strategic attack chinas emphasis on its own lacm programs reportedly has been influenced by the us militarys success in using tomahawk missiles for precision strikes during the 1991 persian gulf war and in conflicts since that war while clearly modernizing and expanding its ballistic and cruise missile forces however it is uncertain whether china will substantially build up its currently limited strategic icbm forces in 1999 the intelligence community predicted that by 2015 the pla is likely to have few tens of missiles with smaller nuclear warheads partly benefitti ng from stolen us technology that are capable of targeting the united states the question remains whether the prc would further expand its strategic force to dozens hundreds or even thousands of nuclear warheadshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97391contents introduction 1 prc ballistic missiles 3 growing missile threat 3 phase 1

nuclear test site in the northwester n xinjiang region4 the prc deployed about 90 df2s through the 1970s by the 1990s the prc made progress in the continued modernization of its ballistic missile force in 1997 undersecretary of defense for acquisition and technology paul kaminski testified that chinas strategic ballistic missile capability is limited today but it is emerging and growing5 the peoples liberation army pla6 is believed to have deployed nuclear armed missile force of over 100 nuclear warheads with additional warheads in storage7 nongovernmental experts estimate the plas total nuclear stockpile at roughly 400 nuclear warheads including perhaps 150 aircraftdelivered bombs and 120 tactical nuclear weapons8 in 1999 the prc first publicly confirmed that it has the neutron bomb

df21 mrbm there may be multiple missiles that could be re loaded to some of the launchers also there are hundreds of increasingly accurate mrbm s and srbms for theater operations likely armed with various types of conventional warheads some to defeat missile defenses including runway penetrators submunition dispensing warheads minelaying warheads electromagnetic pulse warheads penetration warheads10 china demonstrated its potential use of srbms by testfiring m9s toward taiwan in 1995 and 1996 aside from diplomatic efforts to reduce tensions in the taiwan strait and urge for prc restraint in its missile buildup some have called for the development and deployment of theater missile defense tmd systems in the region and national missile defense nmd ballistic missiles are deployed in the plas second artillery the strategic missile corps most of the plas icbms are believed to be targeted at us cities as part of the prcs seconds trike countervalue minimum deterrence doctrine officially declared as the first use policy some have suggested that since the late 1980s the situation where the prc had choice but to use minimum deterrence has been changing and that some in the pla may have been thinking of limited deterrence concept if applied in the future limited deterrence would employ tactical theater and strategic nuclear forces in counterforce and countervalue strategies to deter or control the escalation of conventional or nuclear war such strategy may incorporate elements of preemption11 observers are monitoring whether actual deployments by the second artillery reflect such thinking the plas ballistic missile programs are summarized in table 1 pla ballistic missiles these programs can be divided into four phases of development and deployment after developing landbased nucleararmed mrbm and limited range icbm in the first phase china sought greater reach diversity and reliability in the second phase china added longrange icbm mobile and solidfuel mrbm with nuclear and conventionallyarmed versions and srbms to its ballistic missile force however its program to deploy submarinelaunched ballistic missile slbm on nuclear ballistic missile submarine ssbn has not been successful in the third phase china plans to deploy after 2000 or 2005 new landmobile solidfuel icbmhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97391crs5 12 news conference by

submarine for the fourth phase china plans to deploy landmobile longerrange icbm perhaps after 2010 at the june 1998 summit in beijing president clinton and prc president jiang zemin declared that the two countries will not target the strategic nuclear weapons under their respective control at each other president jiang also reiterated the prcs first use policy stating that since the very first day when china came into possession of nuclear weapons china has undertaken not to be the first to use nuclear weapons under any circumstances12 it is not clear how this agreement has been implemented respectively by both sides but pentagon spokesperson said that us nuclear forces have been detargeted since 1994 and are not aimed at any country13 some say that the prcs decision was major concession since china has long advocated first use to counter the us proposal for detargeting others downplay the significance of detargeting agreement due to the difficulty of verification nonetheless there are concerns in the united states about the continued modernization quality and buildup quantity of the prcs missile force first china may deploy icbms with multiple independently targetable reentry vehicles mirvs in the future china first decided to develop mirvs for deployment in 1970 development was in part stalled however by lack of capability to miniaturize warheads14 the priority for the project on mirvs was lowered in march 1980 but research and development on mirvs resumed on november 10 1983 as part of the df5 modification program in april 1999 director of central intelligence dci george tenet released an unclassified damage assessment completed by the intelligence community on chinas suspected acquisition of us nuclear secrets the study confirmed that the prc already has the technical capability to develop mirv system for the currently deployed icbm but has not done so nonetheless the dci reported that us information acquired by the chinese could help them develop mirv for future mobile missile15 in 1999 the bipartisan house select committee on us national security and militarycommercial concerns with the peoples republic of china popularly known as the cox committee judged that by 2015 the pla could deploy up to 100 icbms with as many as 1000 thermonuclear warhead s there had been concerns that motorolas use of prcdeveloped multisatellite dispenser called smart dispenser to launch two iridium satellites at time on long march rockets helped the prc to develop mirv capability however the cox committee concluded that motorola did not provide the prc with information on how to design the smarthttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97391crs6 16 cox committees declassified report released on may 25 1999 see crs report rl30220 chinas technology acquisitions cox

the prc built the smart dispenser indigenously to motorolas specifications16 second in 1998 congress examined heightened concerns that china may have acquired us missile technology from us satellite manufacturers at hearing of the senate committee on commerce science and transportation on september 17 1998 principal deputy assistant secretary of defense franklin miller testified that prc commercial space launch activities have not improved the guidance systems of the current generation of chinese icbms there are questions nevertheless about whether any us missile technology transfers have applications for chinas future missiles17 third concerns have increased with suspicions since 1995 publicly reported in 1999 that the prc may have acquired us nuclear weapon secrets including that on the w88 the newest us miniature nuclear warhead18 the dcis april 1999 damage assessment cited above reported that china obtained by espionage classified us nuclear weapons information that probably accelerated its program to develop future nuclear weapons according to the study china obtained basic design information on several modern us nuclear reentry vehicles including the trident ii that delivers the w88 warhead as well as variety of us weapon design concepts and weaponization features including those of the neutron bomb president clinton has pointed out that us nuclear forces still maintain decisive superiority over the prcs relatively limited strategic nuclear forces saying that china has fewer than two dozen longrange nuclear weapons today we have over 600019 fourth the pla is continuing to build up its missile force especially theater ballistic missiles in 1997 the secretary of defense reported to congress that the prc could produce though not necessarily plan to produce as many as 1000 new more accurate missiles within ten years most of those new missiles would be srbms and mrbms that are roadmobile use solid fuel and armed with conventional warheads20 as for strategic missiles the intelligence community predicted that by 2015 china is likely to have tens of missiles capable of targeting the united states including few tens of more survivable land and

became the plas primary foreign supplier in the early 1990s russia andor the ukraine may have provided some ss 18 missile technology to china in 199622 russia continues to sell broad military technologies to the pla which is increasingly choosing to modernize more rapidly through foreign acquisitions rather than relying solely on the deficient domestic defense industries sixth some observers are concerned about possible prc nuclear attack on the united states in conflict over taiwan these concerns were heightened by remark made by pla officer in 1995 during tensions in the taiwan strait the officer reportedly told former assistant secretary of defense chas freeman jr that the pla could use military force to prevent taiwans gaining independence without fear of us intervention because american leaders care more about angeles than they do about taiwan23 while confirming this conversation in china which he reported at white house meeting on january 4 1996 freeman says that the plas warning did not imply an offensive threat but was consistent with the prcs first use policy in the context of deterrence against any possible us nuclear threats24 phase 1 df3a df4 the prcs current ballistic missile programs are evolving in four phases the first phase features the prcs older mrbm and limitedrange icbm that can launch nuclear warheads around chinas periphery the missiles use liquid fuel df3a mrbm the prcs df3a mrbm has the us designation of css2 deployed since 1988 the df3a is an improved version of the df3 that was first deployed in 1971 to target the philippines where the united states maintained bases until 1991 the df3a has response time preparation for launch after warning of two to three hours the df3a mrbm can deliver 2150 kg 4750 lb warhead to 2800 km 1750 the missile has also been tested with depressed trajectory for shorter range of 1550 km 960 at an altitude of only 100 km such trajectory would help to attack closer targets while

modernizing pla chinas missiles now have greater mobility use solid instead of liquid propellent onboard computers and gps technology for greater accuracy since 1990 the second artillery has deployed diversified ballistic missile force consisting of shortrange mediumrange and intercontinental ballistic missiles chinas cruise missiles include russian supersonic ssn22 sunburn cruise missiles however china does not have lacms but there are reportedly number of development programs pursued with high priority the purchase of russian sunburn cruise missiles has indicated that the pla is choosing to

relying solely on the deficient domestic defense industries in the future the plas ballistic missiles can be expected to include landmobile solidfuel icbms perhaps with smaller nuclear warheads improved accuracy mirv capability and improved penetration capability and slbms perhaps deployed on an advanced ssbn prc cruise missiles can be expected to have extended ranges and greater accuracy and include lacms since the mid1990s the plas dramatic buildup and launches of theater missiles have already spurred calls for meeting taiwans missile defense requirements and development of tmd112 while clearly modernizing and expanding its ballistic and cruise missile forces however it is uncertain whether china will substantially build up its currently limited strategic icbm forces the intelligence community predicted that by 2015 the pla is likely to have tens of missiles capable of targeting the united states the question remains whether the prc would further expand its strategic force to dozens hundreds or even thousands of nuclear warheads if the pla undertakes to expand its icbm force it could tap the civilian side of the prcs aerospace industry the df4 and df5a missiles have also been produced as boosters for the long march space vehicles that launch satellites for the prc and foreign companies significant increase in chinas strategic nuclear arsenal would send alarms through capitals in asia russia the united states and europe at time when the prc is arguing that it is not threat to any other country as it modernizes the pla such buildup would run counter to the prcs stated priorities of economic development and promotion of international trade and investment to boost development significant increase in chinas strategic missile forces would raise further questions about chinas nuclear doctrine and military intentions as well as the need to deploy nmd and expand arms control agreements to china113 by 2000 us policymakers and advocates have increasingly debated whether the pla would significantly expand its strategic nuclear forces in response to us deployment of nmd because of prc concerns about losing its nuclear deterrence or build up

modernizing its strategic force and expanding it and we anticipate that the prc will do that whether or not we deploy national missile defense system he added that china was in the process of modernizing its strategic force long before the national missile defense became hot political issue in the united states or hot diplomatic issue on the world scene today these are plans that werent started last week or last month theyve been ongoing for some time so i dont think that china is responding to particular concerns about the legitimate defensive plans we have underway to protect our nation from an attack against which were currently unprotected115 however in august 2000 after debates among various intelligence agencies about how china and other countries might respond to us deployment of nmd classified national intelligence estimate nie apparently presented different view the nie the collective assessment of the intelligence community reportedly concluded that china would significantly expand its strategic nuclear missile force beyond current plans in response to us pursuit of an nmd capability the prc would deploy mobile missiles with multiple warheads expanding its force from perhaps 20 to as many as 200 warheads that could hit the united states by 2015 this larger force would be intended to overwhelm the limited nmd system under consideration there would be further implications with india and pakistan responding with their own buildups116httpwikileaksorgwikicrs97391crs26 117 this appendix was prepared by robert shuey specialist in us foreign policy and

the us global positioning system gps transmit signals that are accessible at charge to anyone who has commercially available receiver or more capable military receiver the receiver uses the signals to calculate its threedimensional location on above or below the earths surface russia has similar system the global navigation satellite system glonass the us gps consists of 24 satellites ground control and monitoring stations and receivers that take precise information from four or more satellites on the locations of the satellites and the time the signal was sent commercial receiver can determine the length of time it took the standard positioning service signals to arrive from the satellites and calculate its position to within 100 meters us military receivers receive encrypted precise positioning service signals that establish location within 21 meters the system can be augmented to provide more accurate information the most commonly used augmentation is differential gps dgps which adds signal from base station whose location is precisely known thereby enhancing the standard positioning service to an accuracy of less than one meter118 in mid1996 us company offered for sale unit that receives and compares signals from us and russian satellites to provide more accurate position data on may 1 2000 president clinton improved the civilian gps enabling receivers to be up to ten times more accurate he also assured that national security would not be negatively impacted since the united states has the capability to selectively deny gps signals on regional basis119 if the guidance systems of chinas missiles are supplemented by gps they can compare the actual position of the missile during flight as determined by gps with the planned position along the flight trajectory and send correction signals to the missile control system cruise missiles generally travel in powered aerodynamic flight all the way to the target so they may use their control surfaces and propulsion adjustments to adjust course during the boost phase ballistic missiles can use control vanes or thrust deflectors to adjust course many missiles but not scuds jettison the rocket motor after the boost phase in some sophisticated missiles the reentry vehicles can respond to signals from gpsassisted guidance systems using small thrusters to correct their course ballistic and cruise missiles can also use terminal guidance that will direct them to recognized or designated point in the target area terminal guidance generally employs radar imaging infrared
