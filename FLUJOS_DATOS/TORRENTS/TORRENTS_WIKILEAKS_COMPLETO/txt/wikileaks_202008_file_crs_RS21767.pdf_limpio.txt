the second post columbia flight took place successfully in july 2006 in october 2006 nasa approved shuttle mission to service hubble that missi on is now scheduled for october 8 2008 introduction nasa launched the hubble space telesc ope in 1990 aboard the space shuttle discovery unlike other nasa space telescopes hubble was designed to be serviced regularly by astronauts that design pr oved fortuitous when it was discovered that hubble had defective mirror that produced blurry images astronauts on the first servicing mission in 1993 were able to inst all corrective optics allowing years of scientific accomplishments and generating widespread scientific and public support additional servicing missi ons were conducted in 1997 1999 and 2002 to replace aging hardware and install advanced scientific instruments two more shuttle missions to hubble were scheduled final servic ing mission in 2004 known as sm4 and retrieval mission to bring the telescope back to earth in 2010 following the space shuttle columbia accident in february 2003 however th ennasa administrator sean okeefe decided not to proceed with either flight current nasa administrator michael griffinhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21767crs2 revisited that decision once the shuttle returned to regular flight servicing mission is now scheduled for october 8 2008 re trieval mission is currently planned roughly the size of school bus hubbl was designed to make astronomical observations of the universe in the visible ultraviolet and nearinfrared wavelength bands although groundbase d telescopes can also ma ke visible and infrared observations hubbles location above eart hs atmosphere enha nces image clarity enabling astronomers to look at fainter more distant objects and further back in time hubble is operated for nasa by the space lescope science ins titute ststci near baltimore md websites main tained by stsci httphubblesiteorg and nasa httphubblenasagov provide information about the tele scope and its discoveries hubble was designed to operate for 15 year s milestone that was reached on april 25 2005 nasa had planned to extend the operational period until 2010 at which time the space shuttle would bring hubble back to earth to prevent an uncontrolled reentry that could pose debris risk to populated areas funding constraints however led some nasa officials to conclude that hubbles ope rations should be brought to end earlier than 2010 the funding wedge created by ending the servicing missions would be used to build the new james webb space telescope jwst which is being designed for infrared observations the jwst mission was repla nned in 2006 and is now scheduled for launch in 2013 rather th an 2011 the bate over how long to continue to operate hubble including the linkage with funding for the jwst was under way at the time of the columbia accident servicing missions to hubble during servicing visits to hubble shuttle crews repair or replace aging equipment and install updated scientific instruments hubble has six gyrosc opes for pointing the telescope but two are now nonfunctional and one has degraded performance until august 2005 three were required to achieve the accuracy needed for scientific observations new techniques now allow operation on just tw gyroscopes so that one is kept in reserve solar arrays generate electricity for the telescope the energy is stored in batteries hubble has propulsion syst em relying instead on the space shuttle to boost its orbit so that it does not reenter earths atmosphere the tasks for the sm4 mission included replacing all the gyroscopes and batteries and fine guidance sensor emplacing new thermal protec tion blankets boosting hubbles orbit and installing two new scientific instruments the cosmic origins spectrograph for ultraviolet observations of chemical composition and the wide field camera 3 for observati ons from ultraviolet through nearinfrared all these tasks ar also included in the planned 2008 servicing mission one of hubbles current instruments the advanced camera for surveys malfunctioned in january 2007 and lost most of its capabilities it was installed in march 2002 and was designed for five years of operation astronauts on the 2008 servicing mission will attempt to repa ir this instrument even though nasas plans did not originally call for that because of the difficulty and because the wide field camera 3 will be more capable although it w ill have somewhat smaller fi eld of view the missionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21767crs3 1 nasa announces details of

astronauts board perished the shuttle system was immediately grounded nasa established the columbia accident investigation board caib to determine the causes of the accident and recommend corrective actions for more on the columbia accident see crs report rs21408 nasas space shuttle program the columbia tragedy the discovery mission and the future of the shuttle it was quickly apparent that sm4 would be delayed as the caib deliberated nasa decided that the 2010 hubble retrieval mission was too risky compared to the benefits on january 16 2004 mr okeefe informed workers at stsci and nasas goddard space flight center which built hubble and oversees stsci that he was canceling sm4 according to the director of stsci dr steven beckwith mr okeefe cited several factors the shuttle would not have the iss as safe haven the changes required to meet th caibs recommendations regarding noniss related shuttle missions woul d not have application bey ond the servicing mission making their expense questionable completing i ss construction by 2010 will require all the shuttle flights in that time period hubble s life would be extended for only few years and astronomers have othe r ground and spacebased lescopes they could use2 reaction to the decision two days before mr okeefe announced his decision president bush directed nasa to embark on new exploration initiative requiring shift in program and funding priorities s ee crs re port rs21720 space exploration issues concerning the vision for space exploration funding for the new initiative would come primarily from canceling deferring or delaying ot her nasa programs although mr okeefe stated that the hubble decision was based pr imarily on shuttle safe ty concerns the timing of his announcement led many commentators to conclude that it was linked to the priority shifts required by the presidents initiativ while some media accounts praised the nasa administrator for making difficult decision others calle d hubble the first victim of the presidents initiative and chided nasa for putting the new exploration goals ahead of the astronomical research performed with hubble3httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21767crs4 4 quoted in

telescope national academies press 2005 onlin at httpbooksnapeducatalog111 69htmlservicing options initial opposition to the cancellation of sm4 focused on attempts to reverse mr okeefes decision and proceed with shuttle mission the debate centered on comparing the risk of mission to hubble with the risk of mission to the iss shortly after the cancellation decision nasas thenc hief scientist dr john grunsfeld an astronaut who was member of the 1999 and 2002 hubble servicing crews commented that if shuttle mission to hubble were mount ed it would be necessa ry to have second shuttle ready to launch in case th first one encountered difficulties4 nasa has had backup shuttle available for each of the shuttle launches since the columbia accident but may not for all future missions if safety modifications continue to work well attention soon shifted to robotic servicing options which dominated the public discussion of hubbles future throughout mo st of 2004 at sena appropriations va hudia subcommittee hearing on march 11 2004 mr okeefe agreed with request from senator mikulski to ask the national re search council nrc to study options for extending hubbles life including both shuttle and robotic missions in november 2004 congress passed the fy 2005 consolidated appropriations act pl 108447 which provided 291 million fo r hubble servicing mission the conference report hrept 108792 stated th at successful servicing mission to hubble should be one of nasas highes t priorities the report lang uage did not specify whether the servicing mission should involve th space shuttle or robotic mission the final nrc report on servicing opti ons released on december 8 2004 found it unlikely that nasa will be able to extend the science life of hubble through robotic servicing and that the risk of shuttle missi on to hubble is similar to the risk of single shuttle mission to the iss the report r ecommended shuttle rvicing mission and robotic mission only for deorbiting the telescope at the end of its useful lifetime5 the robotic servicing option was off the table shuttle servicing revisited dr michael griffin was sworn in as nas administrator replacing mr okeefe on april 14 2005 at his nate confirmation hearing on april 12 2005 dr griffin stated that he would revisit the question of whether to use the shuttle to service hubble after the second successful post columbia shuttle flight at which time nasa would be able to assess the risk factors associated with essentially new vehicle the nasa authorization act of 2005 pl 109155 acted in december 2005 called for shuttle servicing mission after the shuttle returned to flight successfully unless such mission would compromise astronaut safety the second post columbia flight took place successfully in july 2006 in

the cradle to grave cost of the servicing mission will be 900 million 500 million to keep the hubble team together from 2004 through 2008 200 million for the gyrosc opes batteries and instruments that will be installed 100 million for external tanks and solidrocket boosters for the additional shuttle flig ht and 100 million for shu ttle launch processing6 hubble operations after servicing nasa expects that if the 2008 servicing mission is successful hubble will continue to operate until 2013 rather than being orbited in 2010 as previously planned according to one nasa official hubbles most impressive accomplishments lie in its future7 the cost of the additional years of operation however may affect funding and scheduling for other astronomy missions for example to offs et the funding that congress provided for hubble in fy2005 nasas may 2005 operating plan postponed two other astronomy missions and reduced fundi ng for mars exploration before the columbia accident the end of h ubble expenditures was expected to be source of funding for the james webb space telescope according to nasas fy2009 congressional budget justifi cation hubble costs are expected to be 115 million in fy2011 95 million in fy2012 and 94 million in fy2013 not including certain indirect costs deorbiting hubble plans for deorbiting hubble rema in uncertain before the columbia accident the space shuttle was to return hubble to earth at the end of its lifetime but there is longer any expectation of retrieval by the shuttle whether or not the servicing mission in 2008 is successful hubble has propulsion syst em of its own however so if it is not retrieved propulsion module would need to be attached to it to permit controlled deorbit that is to ensure that any debris falls in an unpopulated ar ea such as the pacific ocean analysis by nasa in 2005 indicat ed that hubble is unlikely to make an uncontrolled reentry until at least 2020 rather than 2012 as previously believed and the agency now considers the deorbiting issue to be beyond the budget horizon8 boosting hubbles orbit during the 2008 servicing mission will delay the date of reentry even further but at some point deorbiting will be necessary if an uncontrolled reentry is to be avoided
