faced with spring planting decisions and the prospect of having to operate farm programs under outdated permanent agricu ltural statutes b ecause of expiring provisions in the 1990 farm law the house and senate passed omnibus farm legislation in the early months of 1996 following quick resolution of the house senate bill differences the president signed hr 2854 the federal agriculture improvement

loan repayment provisions are largely maintained however the new law ends annual federal acreage reduction and strict planting requirements with respect to the other federally supported farm commodities the new law 1 reauthorizes the dairy price support pr ogram but phases it out by the end of 1999 and requires consolidation of federal milk marketing orders and 2 extends the sugar and

program eep and market access program map formerly the market promotion program or mpp the dairy export incentive program deip export credit guarantees and pl 480 food aid programs the conservation title of the new law builds on conservation initiatives enacted in 1985 and 1990 and in major departur from previous policy converts the majority of conservation spending to entitlements by financing them with commodity credit cor poration ccc funds the new law also authorizes new structure for the delivery of rural development assistance that increases states discretion over the llocation of federal rural development funds and authorizes an annual transfer of 100 million from the us treasury for 3 years to establish fund for rural america extensions of funding authority and revisions to agricu ltural research programs credit and crop insurance are also in the new law the food title of the fair act extends the food stamp program through fy1998 and the commodity donation programs thr

overview background and legislative history congress traditionally modifies and renews many us department of agriculture usda programs through omnibus legislation called farm bill federal programs that suppor t many farmers income nd certain commodity prices have traditionally been the core of omnibus farm bills1 additionally farm bill typically includes modifications to progra ms affecting soil and water conservation forestry domestic and foreign food ssistance export market development agricultural research and education farm cred it and rural development many of the provisions of the previous farm bill th food agriculture conservation and trade act of 1990 pl 101624 expired at the end of fiscal or calendar year 1995 others were due to expire at the end of the 1995 crop or marketing year when the 104th congress began consider ation of new farm bill in 1995 the farm sector by most measures of econo mic performance was fa ring relatively well although some farmers in some regions had suffered producti on disasters due to drought or floods or experienced low mark et prices farm income and farm equity had increased overall in the previous 5 years consumers were also faring well with modest increases in food prices most of wh ich were driven by higher marketing costs rather than higher farm prices nonetheless questions pertaining to us competitiveness perceived inequities in the distribution of program benefits the general economic wellbeing of todays farm households and the comparatively small role of farming in the employment and income base of many rural communities were all forces shaping the commodity program debate in additi on commodity price support programs are always key issue in the farm and budget debates in part because so many farm belt producers rely on them each year to supplement thei r incomes and also because 70 or more of harvested us cropland is planted to these crops over the past decade annual outlays for the grains and cotton programs have averaged about 94 billion or 70 of the average of 135 billion in total annua l outlays for all farm commodity support making grains and cotton prominent targ ets in the search for budgetary savingshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs9769crs2 2 on february 27 1996 house agriculture committee chairman pat roberts introduced separate measure the agricultural and regulatory relief and trade act hr 2973 containing research conservation trade rural development credit and other provisions and said that he only wanted to consider this bill after work on hr 2854s 1541 was finished momentum to consider this legislation was lost when the conferees on hr 2854 acted to continuedthe 104th congress began 1995 with cons ideration of new farm policies to replace the expiring law high on its age nda however the year ended without enactment of major farm bill which was caught up in congressional efforts to balance the budget in 7 years the fy1996 budget resolution that c ongress completed on june 29 1995 had assumed 488 billion reducti on in mandatory usda spending over 7 years when compared with the february 1995 congre ssional budget office cbo baseline 134 b illion for agricultural programs nearly 20 reduction 304 billion for food stamps approximately 10 re duction and 46 billion nearly 6 reduction for child nutrition programs in late november 1995 congress cleared for the president reconciliation measure hr 2491 intending to save 123 billion in farm commodity and other agricu ltural programs and 391 billion for food stamps child feeding and other domestic nutrition programs sweeping savings and structural changes in domestic nutrition pr ograms also were included in massive welfare reform bill hr 4 that was vetoed by the president subsequent welfare reform bill which was enacted contained somewhat moderated but still substantial changes in domestic feeding programs shortly after the president vetoed the 7year budget bill on december 6 1995 and before subsequent wh ite housecongressional budg et talks faltered cbo updated its baseline to december 1995 projecting usda commodity credit corporation ccc spending under current services at about 487 billion over 7 years compared with 566 billion in its previous february baseline the 8 billion lower agriculture spending numbe r reflected economists assumption that higher than expected grain and cotton prices would necessitate smaller federal farm payments which were directly tied to market prices under the expiring law thus many agricultural interests began arguing that farm program cuts should be scaled back to fit the lower baseline projections or that the higher than needed savings be redirected to increases in such areas as conservation or rural development in the wake of the budget impasse cong ressional farm leaders returned to work on freestanding farm bill the first action came in the house agriculture committee which reported freestanding bill the agricultural market transition act hr 2854 on january 30 1996 on fe bruary 7 the full senate bypassing agriculture committee action cleared 6432 its own farm bill the agricultural reform and improvement act s 1541 later readopted as hr 2854 to satisfy procedural requirements which contained essentially the same commodity provisions but dairy title as in the house bill like the house bill the senate legislation included major conservation and international tr ade and aid titles in addition to new commodity price support m easures however it was more wide ranging than the house committee bill with additional titles adopted during floor debate covering research agricultural credit rural velopment and food stamps among others2 httpwikileaksorgwikicrs9769crs3 2 continued expand the conference bill to match the scope of the senateapproved farm bill s 1541 on february 29 1996 the full hous passed 270155 hr 2854 containing commodity and related provisi ons that paralleled those in the vetoed balanced budget act key and controversial element of the plan called for replacing farm income support for grains and cotton with 7 years of fixed but declining payments disconnected both from actual market prices for commodities and from most usda planting requirements other provisions of hr 2854 would have extended but modified the sugar peanut and dairy programs major amendments were adopted on the h ouse floor that significantly altered the agriculture committee version adopted on january 30 1996 this included major changes to the dairy title and expansion of the conservation and agricultural trade and aid titles of the committee versi on other major floor amendments were not successful including those to 1 phase out the peanut and sugar programs and traditional grains and cotton programs 2 mandate 35 billion in additional spending for rural development 3 di vert 19 billion from commodity program subsidies into research and 4 substitute farm bill similar to the senate version after hr 2854 was reported by the house agriculture committee the congressional budget office cbo estimated that the overall bill would achieve 7 year savings of about 54 billion below th current services spending baseline projected in december 1995 however th various floor amendments notably conservation would have reduced this savings estimate possibly by as much as 3 billion or more the entire senatepassed bill would have resulted in 7year savings of just under 1 billion according to cbo estimates once the house approved its farm bill on february 29 1996 efforts began immediately to work out the differences between the two chambers versions members of congress were under pressure from farmers facing spring planting in only few weeks furthermore the lack of new farm law would have placed the usda in the position of having to imple ment wheat and feed grain programs mandated by the permanent authority of the agricultural act of 1949 the policy mechanisms of the permanent law are generally considered to be inappropriate in the current economic environment as they can cause significant budget exposure on march 21 1996 conferees completed action on the substantial differences between the senate and house bills among the differences that proved most difficult to resolve were dairy policy ru ral development programs and whether or not to preserve the 1949 permanent manda tory support authority the conference agreement which passed the senate by vote of 7426 and the house by vote of 31889 ended up looking more like the nate bill but w ith some important differences the president signed the bill the federal agriculture improvement and reform act fair act or 1996 farm bill into law on april 4 1996 pl 104 127 the fair act is projected to result in outlays of roughly 60 billion over the next 7 years more than 21 billion below baseline spending estimates under previous law as estimated by cbo pproximately 44 billion of these outlays arehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs9769crs4 for the commodity export and other programs funded through ccc mandatory spending in the bill for conservation nd related programs accounts for nearly 13 billion of the estimated outlays these outlays along with additional spending on rural development and several smaller items serve to offset much of the projected commodity program savings in the bill these figures exclude the cost of and any project ed savings in the food stamp program which was reauthorized in the fa ir act with virtually changes for only 2 years and commodity distribution progra ms which the act extended for 7 years savings in the food stamp program were ach ieved later as part of comprehensive welfare reform legislation pl 104193 hr 3734 this law is projected by the cbo to reduce total federal spending fo r food programs by 26 billion over 6 years of which 233 billion will be savings in th food stamp program achieved primarily by placing restrictions on eligibility and by reducing benefits reductions in spending for the child nutrition programs account for the balance of the projected savings for more information see crs reports 96903 the us department of agriculture appropriations for fy1997 and

significant departures from past policy are an nd to usdaimposed annual acreage cutbacks and to strict planting requirements the act also retains the permanent au thority of the agricultural act of 1949 this was in concession to the minority partys concern that eliminating permanent authority would remove the need to rec onsider farm policy when the fair act expires in 2002 and could result in

to high prices than would have been possible under the expiring programs for more information see crs report 96351 wheat feed grains cotton rice and oilseeds provisions of the enacted 1996 farm bill dairy the federal government tr aditionally has used two ma jor policy tools to support milk markets the dairy price support prog ram and federal milk marketing orders usda indirectly supports farm milk prices by its standing offer to purchase surplus dairy products from processors federal milk marketing or ders also administered by usda have permanent legislative authority federal orders regulate processors fluid milk bottlers or manufacturers of da iry products that sell milk or milk prod ucts within an order region by requiring them to pay not less than an established minimum price for the grade milk they purchase from dairy producers the new law reauthorizes the dairy pr ice support program including usda authority to purchase surplus cheese bu tter and nonfat dry milk through december 31 1999 the level of support is main tained at the current level of 1035 per hundredweight cwt for the remainder of 1996 but then drops to 1020 in 1997 1005 in 1998 and 990 in 1999 the progra m will terminate on december 31 1999 and be replaced on january 1 2000 w ith recourse loan program for processors of cheese butter and nonfat dr milk to assist them in managing their inventories of these products in return fo r the lower level of price support and the gradual elimination of the program the deficit reduction asse ssment paid by milk producers to defray the cost of the pr ice support program under previous law is eliminated the new law also requires reduction in the number of milk marketing orders to at least 10 but more than 14 nd gives usda 3 years to administratively achieve this goal if at the end of 3 year s usda has not completed the consolidation the department will lose its current authority of asse ssing producers and processors for the cost of administering milk marketing orders and instead usda will have to absorb the cost in its budget if consolida tion is delayed by legal challenge the 3 year deadline given to usda would be ex tended by the duration of any injunction the structure of federal milk marketing orders has long been the subject of policy debate producer groups in the u pper midwest wisconsin and minnesota contend that federal orders are in need of reform while many dairy processors contend that orders are marketdistortin g and should be gradua lly eliminated milk producer groups in the northeast and sout heast generally support the current orderhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs9769crs6 system and maintain that any changes to the system should be handled administratively by usda the new law also gave the secretary of agriculture the power to grant the six new england states the authority to enter into regional dairy compact for period of time that would end at the same time as the doption of marketing order consolidation on august 9 1996 the secretary announced that he had found compelling public interest in such compact thus allowing the six states to begin implementation prior to the farm bill th legislatures of thos states had already agreed to enter into dairy compact that would create an interstate commission with the power to set minimum price paid by dairy processors to dairy farmers in the six states at level above the federal minimu m price however such compacts must first be approved by congress as requi red by the us constitution the new england states sought approval for the co mpact because dairy farm groups in the region maintain that the minimum milk prices dictated by federal orders have not been sufficient to cover the costs of produc tion of familysized farms thus forcing many farmers out of busine ss opponents maintain that the compact will artificially encourage the production of milk within the northeast region at the expense of other parts of the country that have lower pr oduction costs and can sell at lower prices separate provision in the new law explicitly permits california to keep in place its higher nonfat solids standards for fluid milk and leaves the national standards unchanged the house agriculture committee version of the farm bill would have increased the national minimum nonfat solids standards of fluid milk to the california level the provision was deleted from hr 2854 on the house floor proponents of an increase in the national st andards contend that milk fortified with nonfat solids is better tasting more nut ritious product that would likely increase consumer demand for fluid milk the oppos ition led by dairy pr ocessors and some consumer groups counters that fortifying milk with nonfat solids would be so costly that the higher consumer costs would more than offset any positive effects of the higher standards for more information see crs issue brief 95103 dairy policy issues and crs reports 96419 dairy and the 1996 farm bill legislative history and 96 440 dairy provisions of the enacted 1996 farm bill sugar and peanuts both the sugar and peanut progra ms came under attack during the 104th congress from opponents seeking to take dvantage of changed political climate and broader interest in reforming farm programs sugar and peanut users food manufacturing companies proposed outright re peal or significant changes arguing that market forces and not federal controls should deter mine the availability and price of each commodity some processors ie shellers that prepare peanuts for sale to peanut product manufacturers or export cane sugar refiners that process raw sugar into white sugar ready for human and indus trial use proposed reforms they argued were needed to improve their longterm competitiveness as intermediaries in the food marketing chain producers and initial processors of sugar crops and peanut growers acknowledged the need to tack market orienta tion and program cost issues and proposed changes to address such concernshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs9769crs7 the new law extends the sugar and pea nut programs for 7 years and largely keeps intact their broad program structure however some features initially proposed by the sugar and peanut producin g sectors were modified to partially respond to the marketoriented objectives sought by users of both commodities sugar the enacted 1996 farm bill author izes sugar program through 2002 repeals standby restrictions on the marke ting of domestically produced sugar freezes price support loan rates at 1995 levels 18 cents per pound for raw sugar 229 centslb for refined beet sugar and incr eases by 25 the budget deficit reduction marketing assessment rate paid by processors the programs nocost requirement was repealed perhaps inadvertently in the drafting of the bill two controversial provisi ons responded to sugar user concerns the first authorizes usda to make recourse loan s repayable only in cash to raw cane sugar mills and refined beet sugar refine rs whenever usda nnounces fiscal year import quota level lower than 15 million short tons if the quota announced is equal to or not above this leve l usda will offer nonrecour loans where growers can forfeit or hand over sugar offered as collateral as full payment the second requires usda to impose about 1 centlb penalty on any processor having taken out nonrecourse loan who forfeits gar to the ccc the production sector opposed this provision which was pushed by some sugar users seeking an opening to gain possible access to lower priced sugar in general the three most affected interest groups growers and sugar processors cane refiners and sugar users were somewhat dissatisfied with the final sugar program provisions the sugar pr oduction sector argued that it will face considerable price uncertainty whenever recourse loan policy would come into effect sugar users contended that the proposed program offers little change from current policy and does not lower sugar support levels cane sugar refiners expressed concern that retaining current price support levels means more refineries will close and that us cane sugar refining capacity will continue to shrink during senate floor debate febr uary 7 1996 senator gregg offered an amendment that effectively would have c ontinued the sugar program for only 2 years instead of for 7 years as proposed for th other commodities thereby subjecting it to renewed and separate scrutiny the amendment was defeated 3561 on the house side floor amendment by representatives dan miller and charles schumer to phase out the sugar program over 5 years was defeated by closer vote of 208217 this left the sugar program provisions in both the house and senate farm bills nearly identical peanuts the new law authorizes price support for peanuts through the 2002 crop continues the quota system with some changes and is likely to eliminate all of the peanut programs projected budget co sts the new quota for peanuts limits the amount that all eligible growers can sell fo r domestic food use two levels of price support will continue to be available high level for quota peanuts and much lower rate for peanuts produced in excess of each farms quota referred to as additionals budget savings of ove r 400 million are achieved by eliminating the minimum national quota and undermarketings provisions and requiring growers to pay additional assessments if needed to cover program costs one related change will allow usda to set the quota at vel equal to domestic food demand ratherhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs9769crs8 than above it final provisions also incl ude some features of the peanut growers proposal and compromise between 1995s 678ton quota loan rate and the peanut shellers call for support level around 550ton price support on quota peanuts will be reduced 10 to 610ton starting with the 1996 crop and then be frozen at that level through the 2002 crop growers oppos ed any support reduction manufacturers argued that the reduction was not deep enough to reverse the decline in domestic peanut use during senate debate in early february 1996 sena tor santorum offered an amendment to phase down quota loan rate s and beginning in 2001 to eliminate the quota system altogether the amendment was tabled defeated 5936 on february 7 house floor amendment by repres entative shays to phase out the peanut program over 7 years by making steep annua l reductions in the quota loan rate also was defeated by vote of 209212 on februa ry 28 the main features of the new program were the same in both the house and senate passed farm bills with few differences one final compromise makes producers who effectively sell their crop to the federal government for 2 years rather than to buyer who makes written price offer at the quota support level 610ton in eligible for price support benefits for one year conferees also 1 settled differences reflecting regional

authority for the food stamp act through fy2002 and is projected by cbo to reduce net federal spending under this act by to tal of 233 billion over 6 years primarily through new restrictions on

billion over 6 years the enacted welfare measur also combines the efap and soup kitchen food bank programs and require s that 100 million be used annually from food stamp funds to buy commodities for

welfarebudget law however new food stamp eligibility requirement was included for ablebodied adults wit hout dependents that generally limits them to 3 months of eligibility unless working at least halftime this had been opposed by the administration the administration also opposed the prohibition on food stamp eligibility for most legal aliens and the reduction in benefits for those with high shelter costs both of which were in the enacted measure in signing both the farm and welfare measures the president expressed concern that some of these laws provisions might endanger the safety ne t for farmers and for poor americans and indicated that he would press fo r corrections if this occurred for further information see crs report 96861 federal food programs legislation in the 104th

information see crs report 96381 agricultural marketing and regulatory provisions of the 1996 farm bill title vicredit congress frequently includes credit title in omnibus farm legislation as vehicle for making policy changes to us da credit programs as well as addressing issues that relate to institutional lenders such as commercial banks and the farm credit system fcs the new law contains credit title that directly affects eligibility for usda farm loans and the servicing of its deli nquent accounts among its many provisions the credit title would eliminate requirement that usda provide operating loans to certain farm borrowers even if they are delinquent on previous loans deny new farm loans to any borrower who had delinquent loan on which the debt was forgiven reduce the mandated period usda must wait to notify borrowers that they are delinquent and to inform them of their an servicing options continue the shift in usda lending resources from direct loans to guaranteed loans and expedite the sale of acquired usda farm property the agreement closely resembles the credit title in the senate version of the farm bill the house version of the farm bill did not contain credit title however separate bill hr 2590 introduced by house agriculture committee leadership would have applied more stringent qualifications than the senate bill for new usda farm loans and would have restricted usdas options for servicing delinquent borrowers because consideration of the farm bill was delayed until 1996 some credit issues had already been considered by cong ress in standalone
