specialist in national defense foreign affairs defense and trade division sharing law enforcement and intelligence information the congressional role summary almost all assessments of the attacks of september 11 2001 have concluded that us intelligence and law enforcement agencies had failed to share information that might have provided advance warning of the plot this realization led congress to approve provisions in the usa patriot act pl 10756 and subsequent legislation that removed barriers to information sharing between intelligence and law enforcement agencies and mandated exchanges of information relating to terrorist threats most experts agreed that statutory changes albeit difficult to enact were essential to change the approaches taken by executive branch agencies the barriers that existed prior to september 2001 had long history based on determination to prevent government spying on us persons this had led to the establishment of high statutory barriers to the sharing of law enforcement and intelligence information the statutes laid the foundation of the socalled wall between intelligence and law enforcement that was buttressed by regulations justice department policies and guidance from the judicial branch despite the widespread acceptance of barrier between law enforcement and intelligence by the early 1990s it had become apparent to some that the two communities could mutually support efforts to combat international criminal activities including narcotics smuggling later in the decade dangerous threats to the us posed by international terrorists came into sharper focus nevertheless efforts to adjust laws regulations and practices did not succeed drawing strong opposition from civil libertarians only the tragedy of the 911 attacks overcame earlier concerns and led congress and the executive branch to remove most statutory barriers to information sharing laws and regulations have changed significantly since september 2001 and an information sharing executive ise has been established within the office of the director of national intelligence to design and implement information sharing procedures it is clear however that sustaining the exchange of law enforcement and intelligence information remains challenge in particular there is continued concern about sharing of information that might in some way jeopardize the rights of free speech or association of us persons this opposition has contributed to the difficulty congress has had in addressing legislation in this area and can be expected to continue some argue that given the extent of legislation enacted in recent years extensive oversight of information sharing efforts may be an appropriate way to ensure that the balance between ensuring domestic security and protecting civil liberties can be maintained this report will be updated as additional information becomes available contents the legacy of fisa 2 recognizing the need to share information 3 initial efforts to legislate 6 after 911 congress tears down the wall 10 conclusion 14 sharing law enforcement and intelligence information the congressional role introduction the failure of the us intelligence community to provide better warning of the september 11 2001 attacks has been widely attributed to the existence of walls between intelligence and law enforcement agencies the walls arguably kept analysts from talking to each other and from sharing pieces of information that if they had been viewed in close relationship might have yielded coherent picture of the emerging plot this theory cannot of course be fully proven the overall plot might not have been discerned even if the best analysts had had access to all available information in every agency nevertheless the fact that available data had not in fact been shared focused public and congressional attention on the real or perceived walls that inhibited the exchange of information among agencies consensus emerged that the walls should be torn down in december 2002 the joint inquiry into intelligence community activities before and after the terrorist attacks of september 11 2001 established by the two congressional intelligence committees made factual finding that the important point is that the intelligence community for variety of reasons did not bring together and fully appreciate range of information that could have greatly enhanced its chances of uncovering and preventing usama bin ladins plan to attack the united states on september 11 20011 the inquiry also made systemic finding that within the intelligence community agencies did not adequately share relevant counterterrorism information prior to september 11 this breakdown in communications was the result of number of factors including differences in the agencies missions legal authorities and cultures information was not sufficiently shared not only between different intelligence community agencies but also within individual agencies and between the intelligence and law enforcement agencies2 1 us congress 107th congress senate select committee on intelligence and house of representatives permanent select

report december 2002 p 33 2 ibid p xvii intelligence agencies focus on concerns outside us territory and are sometimes known as foreign intelligence agencies they include the central intelligence agency cia the national security agency nsa the defense intelligence agency dia the national reconnaissance office nro the national geospatialintelligence agency nga the bureau of intelligence and research of the state department the intelligence components of the military services and the department of homeland security continued crs2 similar conclusions were reached in july 2004 by the 911 commission the national commission on terrorist attacks upon the united states carefully documented the failures of pre911 information sharing among agencies and within different offices of the justice department and recommended number of initiatives to encourage unity of effort in sharing information3 the legacy of fisa the failure to share information prior to 911 had not occurred by happenstance law enforcement and intelligence information was not routinely shared and collectors and analysts were walled off from one another through complex arrangement of constitutional principles statutes policies and practices these regulations had their origin in longstanding divisions of labor that reached back far into preworld war ii practices and in the provision of the national security act of 1947 requiring that the central intelligence agency cia have police subpoena or law enforcement powers or internal security functions4 the regulations were significantly strengthened in the 1970s when in reaction to domestic intelligence gathering activities during the vietnam war era congress undertook extensive investigations of intelligence activities and enacted legislation regulating domestic surveillance activities ultimately in response to recommendations derived from this investigation in 1978 congress passed and president jimmy carter signed the foreign intelligence surveillance act fisa pl 955115 fisa provides statutory framework for electronic surveillance in foreign intelligence investigations while electronic surveillance in criminal investigations continues to be governed by title iii of the omnibus crime control act of 1968 usually referred to as title iii6 2 continued law enforcement agencies include the federal bureau of investigation fbi the drug enforcement administration the secret service and the customs service the fbi is considered both foreign intelligence agency and law enforcement agency this is also the case with the coast guard 3 us

rl30465 the foreign intelligence surveillance act an overview of the statutory framework and recent judicial decisions by elizabeth b bazan 5 in 1994 fisa was modified to include physical searches section 807 of the intelligence authorization act for fy1995 pl 103359 6 title iii prohibits all interception of wire or electronic communications unless that interception falls within one of the exceptions to title iii electronic surveillance under fisa is one of the exceptions 18 usc 25112f it is to be noted that foreign intelligence may not involve actual or potential violations of us laws eg intelligence could be acquired in the us regarding plot involving parties outside the us that would not involve activities prohibited by us law such intelligence could be of great interest to national policymakers but there would be justification for relying on title iii surveillance authorities in trying to obtain it as will be noted below there is however significant potential for overlap when intelligence provides evidence of activities that are continued crs3 the implementation of fisa came to have an important influence on the relationship between law enforcement and intelligence fisa required that the purpose of domestic electronic surveillance or physical search had to be the gathering of foreign intelligence information7 fisa permitted the dissemination to the law enforcement community of information relating to criminal activity incidentally acquired during fisa electronic surveillance or physical search when such dissemination was challenged by defense attorneys as running afoul of the fourth amendment8 number of federal courts of appeals had upheld the governments contention in several cases that the primary purpose of an electronic surveillance or physical search had been the collection of foreign intelligence information thus this use of fisa was held to be not inconsistent with fourth amendment requirements for criminal cases9 before 911 considerable body of government practice and justice department policy increasingly reflected an understanding that adhering to the primary purpose standard effectively precluded fourth amendment challenges the concern was to avoid letting aggressive criminal investigators obtain fisa court orders when they were interested in obtaining evidence of criminal activities there was pervasive concern within the justice department that court in criminal trial would suppress information obtained through fisa investigation on the grounds that it was primarily being used not to collect foreign intelligence but to gather criminal evidence or even that fisa itself would be overturned in practice information collected by intelligence agencies including the parts of the federal bureau of investigation fbi dealing with counterterrorism and counterintelligence was kept apart from information collected for the use of prosecutors recognizing the need to share information fisas requirements appear not to have posed major problems until the mid 1990s10 but law enforcement and intelligence agencies tended to function in separate 6 continued illegal under us law 7 50 usc 1804a7b 50 usc 1823a7b sec 218 of the usa patriot act pl 10756 had amended these sections to replace the purpose with significant purpose 8 the fourth amendment to the constitution states the right of the people to be secure in their persons houses papers and effects against unreasonable searches and seizures shall not be violated and warrants shall issue but upon probable cause supported by oath or affirmation and particularly describing the place to be searched and the persons or things to be seized 9 detailed assessment of the various judicial views and rulings on this question lies beyond

historical mists the continued crs4 worlds concern about these divisions did exist and there had been major initiatives largely as result of concerns about the development of barriers between law enforcement and intelligence agencies in the aftermath of the controversy surrounding the illegal activities of the banca nazionale lavoro bnl and the bank of credit and commerce international bcci in the early 1990s the controversy involved complex banking fraud and other criminal activities undertaken by the two foreign banks congressional investigators developed information that the cia had obtained information indicating suspicious activities by the two banks that had not been passed to prosecutors in large measure because channels of communications had not been established between intelligence and law enforcement agencies the senate intelligence committee investigators concluded that the fundamental policy governing the relationship between law enforcement and intelligence needs to be addressed by the attorney general and the dci director of central intelligence in conjunction with the congressional oversight committees confusion is apparent on both sides as to what the proper role and authority of intelligence agencies is in circumstances like those presented in the bnl case11 the reaction to the bnlbcci affairs reflected shift away from emphasis on strict separation of law enforcement and intelligence efforts to an appreciation by congress of the need for closer cooperation as result of congressional concerns the dci and the attorney general directed that review of the intelligencelaw enforcement relationship be conducted the review undertaken by group of senior executive branch officials known as the joint task force on intelligence and law enforcement submitted report in august 1994 the task force described the failure by intelligence and law enforcement agencies to make use of all available information on the activities of the two foreign banks it called for number of bureaucratic mechanisms to ensure greater information exchanges in the future but argued that statutory changes were called for what is required is not new legislation radically altering the relationship between intelligence and law enforcement agencies but rather different approach to the existing relationship one that is more interactive on number of fronts yet maintains the important distinctions between these two communities based on law culture and mission12 10 continued people and events behind the passage of fisa and the creation of the wall

information exchanges and resolve difficulties13 although the task force provided perceptive analysis of the difficulties that then existed and officials assigned to the resultant interagency bodies worked diligently at overcoming obstacles progress was limited14 by the 1990s the threat of new forms of international terrorism was becoming apparent middle eastern terrorists were operating against us forces overseas and occasionally within the us as in the 1993 world trade center attacks observers believed that both intelligence and law enforcement agencies were collecting relevant information on international terrorism members of congress began to seek administrative and statutory changes that could facilitate information sharing in this area pursuant to pl 105277 supplemental appropriations act passed in 1998 the national commission on terrorism headed by former ambassador l paul bremer was established to review the laws regulations directives policies and practices for preventing and punishing international terrorism the bremer commissions june 2000 report highlighted concerns about the inadequate sharing of terrorismrelated information it recommended the elimination of barriers to the aggressive collection of information on terrorists and suggested that the fbi suffered from bureaucratic and cultural obstacles to gathering terrorism information it found that the department of justice applies the statute governing electronic surveillance and physical searches of international terrorists in cumbersome and overly cautious manner15 although it noted that the fisa application process had been recently streamlined it recommended that the justice departments office of intelligence policy review 12 continued april 29 1994 in 2001 however woolsey would write in regard to the 1993 world trade center bombing one other than the prosecutors the clinton justice department and the fbi had access to the materials surrounding the case until

of grand jury proceedings 13 see crs report rl30252 intelligence and law enforcement countering transnational threats to the us by richard best jr 14 key factor appears to have been the potential that litigation over important espionage cases could jeopardize existing practices see for instance the testimony of john gannon former head of the national intelligence council and other senior government positions to the senate judiciary committee may 2 2006 gannon claimed that the early postwar determination to share information and push the wall on information sharing between intelligence and law enforcement was set back by the sensational ames nicholson and hanson espionage cases 15 us national commission on terrorism countering the changing threat of international terrorism june 2000 p 10 crs6 oipr should not require the inclusion of information in excess of that which was actually mandated by fisa it also recommended that oipr be substantially expanded and that it be directed to cooperate with the fbi16 the commission further concluded law enforcement agencies are traditionally reluctant to share information outside of their circles so as not to jeopardize any potential prosecution the fbi does promptly share information warning about specific terrorist threats with the cia and other agencies but the fbi is far less likely to disseminate terrorist information that may not relate to an immediate threat even though this could be of immense longterm or cumulative value to the intelligence community moreover certain laws limit the sharing of law enforcement information such as grand jury or criminal wiretap information with the intelligence community these laws are subject to different interpretations so that in some cases it is unclear whether the restrictions apply17 the commission did not indicate need for immediate statutory changes but recommended that the attorney general should clarify what information can be shared and direct maximum dissemination of terroristrelated information to policymakers and intelligence analysts consistent with the law18 initial efforts to legislate members of congress did propose various approaches to address the lack of information sharing s 2089 as introduced in february 2000 by senator specter would have required that the attorney general prescribe in regulations the circumstances under which information acquired pursuant to fisa shall be disclosed for law enforcement purposes the bill would also have required two reports addressing issues of information sharing first it would have tasked the director of the fbi to submit report on the feasibility of establishing within the bureau comprehensive intelligence reporting function having the responsibility for disseminating among the elements of the intelligence community information collected and assembled by the bureau on international terrorism and other national security matters secondly the bill would have required the president to submit report on the legal authorities that govern the sharing of criminal wiretap information with intelligence agencies and with recommendations to improve the capability of the justice department to share foreign intelligence information or counterintelligence information with elements of the united states intelligence community on matters such as counterterrorism in its report on the bill the senate intelligence committee argued 16 ibid p 12 17 ibid pp 1516 18 ibid p16 crs7 for the intelligence mission of the united states to be successful there must be cooperative and concerted effort among intelligence agencies any information collected by one agency under foreign intelligence authorities that could assist another agency in executing its lawful mission should be shared fully and promptly the committee has been briefed on the recent efforts by the federal bureau of investigation and the central intelligence agency to enhance their ability to share valuable information collected under fisa orders the committee commends these efforts and expects them to continue and to be broadened to include all areas of the foreign intelligence mission19 as reported to the senate in july 2000 s 2089 was modified to include only request for reports from the attorney general on mechanisms for determinations of disclosure of fisaderived information for law enforcement purposes and on actions taken by the department of justice doj to coordinate the dissemination of intelligence information within doj congressional concern about the growing threat of terrorism was also demonstrated in s 3205 introduced in october 2000 and known as the kylfeinstein counterterrorism act of 2000 which was based directly on recommendations of the bremer commission that had been released in august the bill took notice of the attack on the uss cole which had occurred on october 12 2000 and aimed to discourage financial support of terrorist organizations this bill also addressed information sharing issues section 9 would have required report on the feasibility of assigning the fbi responsibility for disseminating among the elements of the intelligence community information collected and assembled by the fbi on international terrorism and other national security matters section 10 of the bill would have required report on the legal authorities that govern the sharing of criminal wiretap information with various law enforcement agencies and intelligence agencies and recommendations if any for legislative language that would improve the justice departments capabilities to share information on matters such as counterterrorism with intelligence agencies with elements of the united states intelligence community on matters such as counterterrorism consideration of the legislation reflected many of the same privacy and civil liberties concerns that had influenced existing procedures in the justice department criticisms of the approach taken by the legislation were voiced by some civil libertarians one group opposed the sharing of information obtained by electronic surveillance conducted under title iii authorities with intelligence agencies such an effort it was argued breaches the wellestablished and constitutionally vital line between law enforcement and intelligence activities20 concern was also expressed about the potential use of such information by the cia and other intelligence 19 us congress 106th congress 2d session senate select committee on intelligence the counterintelligence reform act of 2000 srept 106352 july 20 2000

director center for national security studies reprinted in congressional record october 26 2000 p s11118 crs8 agencies the secretive data gathering storage and retention practices of the intelligence agencies are appropriate only when conducted overseas for national defense and foreign policy purposes and only when directed against people who are not us citizens or permanent residents21 further concern was directed at the potential use of information gathered under counterintelligence authorities presumably fisa in criminal proceedings since the period of the church committee it has been recognized that the rights of americans are better protected and the fbi may be more effective when international terrorism and national security investigations are conducted under the rules for criminal investigations22 such views reflected continuing distrust of intelligence agencies and fear that past practices might be revived in floor debate senator leahy noted that initial drafts of s 3205 had posed serious constitutional problems and risks to important civil liberties we hold dear after modifications however longer does the bill require change in the wiretap statute allowing the permissive disclosure of information obtained in title iii wiretap to the intelligence agencies23 the clinton administration justice department took different approach arguing that thencurrent statutes and regulations provided law enforcement agencies with authority under current law to share title iii information regarding terrorism with intelligence agencies when the information is of overriding importance to the national security any change must accommodate legal constraints such as criminal rule 6e and the need to protect equities relating to ongoing criminal investigations24 accordingly the justice department specifically opposed the provision in the bill that would permit the sharing of foreign intelligence or counterintelligence information collected under title iii by investigative or law enforcement officer with intelligence agencies25 the kylfeinstein bill would not have changed statutory language but only asked for reports on the issue of information even so according to senator leahy 21 ibid 22 ibid p s11119 23 congressional record november 14 2000 p s11540 almost year later during consideration of the usa patriot act senator leahy would note that the justice department had opposed the original kyl legislation because it might have opened sensitive materials to the discovery process and it raised issues about sharing information about us persons congressional record october 25 2001 p s11001 24 letter from robert raben assistant attorney general department of justice reprinted in congressional record october 26 2000 pp s11119 the letter did not elaborate on how rule 6e and the need to protect equities could be balanced against the need to share information apparently precise details of planned assassination plot would meet the overriding importance standard but raben gave recognition that intelligence agencies should have access to ambiguous data that might yield evidence of plot only when combined with other information in other words dots that are innocuous in themselves but which when connected to other information reveal dangerous threat 25 ibid p s11119 crs9 the initial proposal to mandate such changes prompted firestorm of controversy from civil liberties and human rights organizations as well as the department of justice26 even though the house took action on this bill passage of the legislation by the senate reflected concerns at the end of 2000 regarding the possible need to adjust information sharing mechanisms coupled with determination to move cautiously before implementing changes that could affect civil liberties ultimately the legislation was adopted by the senate on november 14 2000 but it was not sent to the house before the adjournment of the 106th congress the fy2001 intelligence authorization act pl 106567 signed on december 27 2000 reflected the concerns that had inspired both s 2089 and s 3205 it included requirement for report from the attorney general on the authorities and procedures utilized by the department of justice for determining whether or not to disclose information acquired under the foreign intelligence surveillance act of 1978 50 usc 1801 et seq for law enforcement purposes27 this act also formalized procedures for authorizing fisa surveillance expanded grounds for establishing probable cause established new procedures for physical searches within fisa and specified mechanisms to facilitate the use of intelligence in counterintelligence investigations it provided increased funding for oipr subsequent to the submission of report indicating efforts taken to streamline and improve the fisa application process it included provision in section 606 derived from s 2089 requiring report from the attorney general on actions taken to coordinate the dissemination of intelligence information within the appropriate components of the justice department and the formulation of policy on national security issues it did not however address the question of making information from law enforcement sources available to the intelligence community clearly the problems created by the existence of the wall had not been unrecognized prior to 911 the justice departments opposition in 2000 to legislative proposals to remove barriers has been noted on the other hand some argue that the primary factor in preventing statutory changes was as one observer has claimed that in most instances both the department of justice and the white house turned down the requests because it was firmly believed by senior members of the executive branch that the united states congress would not allow the ic intelligence community to have broader surveillance powers28 this view would 26 congressional record november 14 2000 p s11540 leahy himself however had earlier that year indicated support for legislation that would promote information sharing and consultation between intelligence agencies in regard to counterintelligence in an area of such

httpwwwlexingtoninstituteorgdocs497pdf crs10 be expressed by former attorney general william barr in testimony to the 911 commission for three decades leading up to 911 congress was at the fore of steady campaign to curtail the bureaus domestic intelligence activities and impose on all its activities the standards and process of the criminal justice system these concerns made it extremely difficult for the bureau to pursue domestic security matters outside the strictures of the criminal justice process prohibitions on sharing grand jury information with intelligence agencies and with using intelligence information in criminal investigations created wall of separation29 it is clear in retrospect that there were those in both the executive branch and congress who realized the need to lower barriers to sharing law enforcement and intelligence information but their views did not prior to 911 reflect consensus in either branch those opposed to greater information sharing did so in large measure because of their awareness of the past history of domestic surveillance and distrust of intelligence organizations the result was number of very tentative steps that in the event proved wholly inadequate to task of gathering information about qaedas plot the fy2001 intelligence authorization act included some minimalist provisions but the wall was left in place neither the clinton administration or the bush administration in the first eight months of 2001 sought to amend the relevant laws30 the problem was recognized but proposed solutions faced strong opposition after 911 congress tears down the wall the attacks of september 11 2001 destroyed the world trade center and portion of the pentagon they also demolished the wall between us law enforcement and intelligence after 911 it was almost immediately accepted that counterterrorism would have to involve all parts of the us government including law enforcement agencies and the intelligence community it was agreed that the counterterrorism effort must be based on sharing information from whatever source the problem for both congress and the executive branch was to establish appropriate mechanisms for information sharing with adequate safeguards for using the information in future criminal trials congress immediately set about to consider the most appropriate legislative response that could be

york knopf 2006 p 195 crs11 writes the 911 attacks occurred on tuesday by saturday we had fullblown legislative proposal part of the reasons we were able to move so quickly was that number of the provisions had been proposed to congress in 1996 and congress had rejected them31 attention focused on various proposals and recommendations of commissions that had looked at international terrorism and related issues and to earlier legislative proposals that had not been adopted32 wide number of proposals came together as the usa patriot act pl 10756 that would be debated in the final weeks of september and early october 200133 the usa patriot act changed the requirement that the purpose of fisa surveillance be to collect foreign intelligence information to require that collecting such information be significant purpose of fisa electronic surveillance or physical search this provided latitude to use fisa authority for electronic surveillance or physical searches where the primary purpose was criminal investigation as long as significant foreign intelligence purpose was also present the usa patriot act also addressed concerns about sharing intelligence and law enforcement information although discussion of all the complex provisions that were included in the usa patriot act lies beyond the scope of this report34 several provisions address the sharing of law enforcement and intelligence information section 203 of the act removed some of the restrictions on federal government attorneys sharing grand jury information subsection 203a authorized federal government attorneys to share matters occurring before the grand jury involving foreign intelligence counterintelligence or foreign intelligence information with federal law enforcement intelligence protective immigration national defense or national security official to assist that official in the performance of his or her duties subsection authorized the sharing of grand jury information when the matters

the 31 ashcroft never again p 154 32 one skeptical observer noted that the great majority of the new surveillance provisions had been discussed within the executive branch or congress in previous years and had not been adopted after the september 11 attacks professional staff in the agencies simply went into their files and pulled out provisions they had been advocating previously in the

reauthorization act of 2005 legal analysis by brian t yeh and charles doyle crs13 the provisions included in the usa patriot act and dojs effort to implement them were farreaching and to some extent were not welcomed by the fisa court in particular the fisa court in in re all matters submitted to the foreign intelligence court found that proposed 2002 procedures issued by the attorney general eliminated the bright line in the 1995 procedures prohibiting direction and control by prosecutors on which the court has relied to moderate the broad acquisition retention and dissemination of fisa information in overlapping intelligence and criminal investigations37 the fisa court thus attempted to reinstate the bright line used in the 1995 procedures on which the court has relied38 concerned that its proposed procedures were rejected the justice department appealed the foreign intelligence surveillance courts granting of request modified in accordance with its earlier ruling in in re all matters submitted to the foreign intelligence surveillance court the appeal went to the foreign intelligence surveillance court of review and was the first appeal to that court in sweeping decision the court of review overruled the limitations imposed by the fisa court along with considerable amount of customary fisa practice the court of review expressed concern that the fisa court had overstepped its role by prescribing the internal procedures for handling surveillances within the justice department the court of review maintained that the fisa court determined an investigation became primarily criminal when the criminal division played lead role this approach has led over time to the quite intrusive organizational and personnel tasking the fisa court adopted putting aside the impropriety of an article iii court imposing such organizational strictures the wall was unstable because it generates dangerous confusion and creates perverse organizational incentives39 the court of review thereby gave the final blow to the legal structure supporting the wall between law enforcement and intelligence information implementation of the informationsharing provisions of the usa patriot act and other legislation is underway the homeland security act of 2002 pl 107296 and the intelligence reform and terrorism prevention act of 2004 pl 108458 required that procedures be established under which federal agencies can share intelligence and law enforcement information about international terrorism the intelligence reform act mandated the creation of an information sharing environment ise that combines policies procedures and technologies to link information collections and users in november 2006 the administration released lengthy implementation plan for the ise the plan sets forth procedures for sharing information among agencies at federal state and local levels and seeks to promote culture of information sharing it also provides procedures for protecting 37 in re all matters submitted to the foreign intelligence surveillance court 218 f supp2d pp 621622 may 17 2002 38 ibid p 625 39 in re sealed case 310 f3d p 743 november 18 2002 crs14 information privacy and civil liberties40 congress may choose to review the implementation of the ise during coming months conclusion fundamental issue that faces both congress and the us public remains the need to balance the advantages to be gained by sharing information from all sources with the possibility that the availability of data accumulations could be used to undermine lawful political or religious activities an unstable balance between these two separate goals often portrayed as competing greatly complicated the counterterrorism and counterintelligence effort prior to 911 the fact that public opinion appeared deeply ambivalent made procedural changes difficult and contributed to the luxuriant growth of complex regulations adopted by doj and endorsed by the fisa court after 911 public opinion shifted dramatically resulting in the rapid passage of the usa patriot act and other legislation the need to encourage the sharing of information and the connection of dots is now unquestioned but there are lingering concerns about the risks that widespread information sharing may jeopardize civil liberties congress will undoubtedly seek to determine whether the new statutes regulations and procedures that have been adopted will prove both effective and sensitive to individual rights the importance of sharing intelligence and law enforcement information is not limited to issues relating to international terrorism but extends to banking fraud narcotics smuggling and variety of international concerns narcotics smuggling for instance can be addressed by encouraging other countries to halt the cultivation of opium poppies or coca as well as by law enforcement in the us terrorism of course is uniquely threatening and in combating terrorists more vigorous nonlaw enforcement approaches are considered more legitimate than is the case with drug smugglers or embezzlers what is advantageous in all cases is assembling the full range of information about the activity and subjecting it to rigorous analysis there is however the possibility that the current consensus may unravel the political controversy surrounding nsas electronic surveillance efforts and other data mining programs may come to focus on the sharing of information that some argue was not lawfully obtained and this concern could lead to efforts to restrict information sharing across the boards there is also possibility that the use of information obtained by surveillance in accordance with fisa might ultimately not be allowed in court cases out of concern that the fourth amendment has been 40 the implementation plan is available at httpwwwisegovdocsiseimpplan 200611pdf for additional background see us government accountability office information sharing the federal government needs to establish policies and processes for sharing terrorismrelated and sensitive but unclassified information gao06385 march 17 2006 many of the initiatives in regard to the ise have been widely criticized see ellen nakashima civil libertarians protest privacy policy new guidelines do little to protect established rights white house board told washington post dec 6 2006 p a11 crs15 bypassed41 despite the widespread acceptance of the need for information sharing concerns that sharing information could lead to governmental abuses persists across the political spectrum these concerns are tenaciously held and have in the past made legislating very controversial there is reason to believe that they will not resurface should the threat from international terrorism seem less menacing the potential threat to civil liberties does not of course represent the full extent of the issues raised by increased information sharing sharing sensitive information inevitably raises the danger that intelligence sources and methods may be compromised either accidentally or purposefully for intelligence professionals in particular the danger to valuable sources that may have taken years to develop is fundamental concern moreover when human source is compromised there is not only danger to particular individual but also potential loss of confidence in us intelligence agencies by other actual or potential sources the role of congress in dealing with information sharing issues is especially important there are delicate questions of liberty and security involved and sensitive balance is crucial air force general michael v hayden who now serves as cia director in the past argued that members of congress are in close touch with their constituents and what i really need you to do is talk to your constituents and find out where the american people want that line between security and liberty to be42 congress also can provide the ongoing oversight to ensure that the sorts of abuses that occurred in the 1960s and 1970s do not recur ultimately an information sharing policy that is largely consistent with public opinion and is held to account by rigorous oversight should enhance the chances that the dots can be connected without jeopardizing the rights of americans observers see danger however that gridlock in both the executive and legislative branches might inhibit the governments ability to find effective and sensible ways to acquire and analyze information on new threats to the national security 41 this possibility was even alluded to by the november 2002 foreign intelligence court of review that maintained that fisa order may not be warrant contemplated by the fourth amendment the government does not actually claim that it is instead noting only that there is authority for the proposition that fisa order is warrant in the constitutional sense the court of review added we do not decide the issue but note that to the extent fisa order comes close to meeting title iii that certainly bears on its reasonableness under the fourth amendment in re sealed case 310 f3d p 742 42 testimony of lt gen michael v hayden usaf us congress 107th congress senate
