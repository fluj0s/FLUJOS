6107c04 shspec27x problems and solutions only lrh could get simplicity on auditing problems usually when one tries to look at them he just gets confused the only mistake psychiatry made about psychosis was to try to understand it since its basically incomprehensible thats its whale character then they have to use heroic measures which fail and leave them place to turn the common denominator of psychosis is problems of course when the problems cant be associated with the solutions any longer you get solutions to noproblems which is psychosis when psychosis has been objectively described theres missing datum what problems is this behavior solution to cf rd laing and j haley the lack of this datum makes the psychosis incomprehensible you cannot cure psychosis by addressing the psychosis or more generally you cant cure an aberration by addressing the aberration this is because in so doing you are running the still in the middle of the motion the stable datum in the middle of the confusion the solution youre trying to cure the solution and not looking at the confusion you are looking at the cure which wont move out unless you get the motion off it the whirlpool wouldnt whirl without the motionless center but the center is motionless only because it has motion around it you should take the whirlpool off the motionless piece not the other way around here you have confusion and the stable datum motion and motion sound and silence absolute location and change if you try to get the motionless points out all you get is new motionless points all that is wrong with thetan is what is wrong at the lower and of the scale at the highest level thetan can be motionless at the lowest level he has to be its matter of determinism at the lower levels motionlessness is not determined by postulate but by the mechanics of motion if you want to see someone stiffen and go still stand fellow up shake your hands in front of his face produce lot of motion and say theres the motion at this point the fellow will sort of freeze as he becomes stable datum but this doesnt work well as demonstration because the observers will also all go still in sort of stupidity they wont confront the motion theyll put barrier up against it and become still so the motion will duplicate them and they will butter themselves all over the universe and become agitated auditing motionlessness just makes more motionlessness in the bank stillnesses identify more rapidly than motion in psychosis the person is being stillness the worst example of this is catatonia there cant be such thing as anaverage individual there can only be someone who is trying to be lot of other individuals and is therefore buttered all over the universe in terms of beingness hell be obsessively still the next step down is going round the bend the operations this universe uses to try to make one assume the average are so numerous that one accents then as normal insanity is the adoption of solution to the exclusion of all other solutions in the absence of problem if person confronts problems takes responsibility for them and goes into being solution all problems go on automatic they just go on all around him there can be million problems but theres only one solution him psychiatrist is being an obsessive solution also he never really cures anything he just persists with his ineffective solutions which just hold the problem in place he isnt aware that psychosis is problem hes handling people who are being obsessive solutions so he becomes one too the psychiatrist is the societys solution just as his solution is shock treatment psychotics dont realize others have problems or that theyre being problems to others psychiatrys research has been search for solutions but they hate solutions and they dont recognize the problem man has made the mistake all along the track of not realizing that if theres solution there must have been problem look at the ten commandments actually theres 162 pages of them these are moral codes and moral codes are series of solutions to problems which are neither confronted nor analyzed almost all the bibles commandments are prompted by the obsessive crimes of the time several are solutions to vd that was problem that descended on them that they knew nothing about so they looked for solutions they already had various areas of nosex they had already prevented true ethicality by inventing immorality with bunch of new morals lot of religions also encourage facing motionlessness eg by getting you to turn inward contemplate the stillness within meditate face mecca etc this is the basic operation of the track i believe its perfectly all right to do anything you want to to people as long as you dont say its something else or try to convince people youre doing something else as long as other people are not completely ploughed under by it the greatest good for the greatest number of dynamics gives lot of lattitude the main crime is the entering in of notknow thats the only real evil there is when person reaches stage of being an obsessive solution with total notknow on what hes being solution to or when one is to being terribly still he doesnt know what motion hes being still to counteract obsessive stillness enters the bug factor here is the notknow in all this where you have someone solving problems you dont have an evil its ok to solve problems but an individual who has put all problems on automatic cant solve problems except with some fantastic liability of cavein terror stomach etc he doesnt dare solve problem there are gradients of this there are people who can salve minor problem but not major one theyll try to protect you from problem by preventing you from solving problem by feeding you extraneous data this is not to confuse you its to protect you eg the pedant who doesnt want to make mistake and doesnt want you to make mistake either when you see someone sitting in the middle of catastrophe one of two things is happening either the stuff is avalanching in faster than he can cope with it but hes trying to cope or he doesnt even know its catastrophe he doesnt even see all the papers all over the floor and the account book being used far doormat thats the condition of the thetan sitting in his bank he feels hes got it all straight and the trouble is all over there since you cant see the clutter you say well hes behaving oddly but thats not the situation hes confronting noly it is all notised when you run something in an orderly fashion you will at once get something done in the first place youre giving the pc an orderliness to confront and he finds out theres some motion that can be confronted where you have individuals who are totally insane you have confront of problems so routine 1a wont work it doesnt go as far south as the cchs but it works on most people including the guy who thinks hes is such good shape that he doesnt need any auditing if you run problems on him hell go hm ridges where did this come from the bank starts going solid somatics turn on hell see there were some problems around their masses start showing up this is the first time weve had good cure for this type of mass it bypasses the liability of curing it were enough on top of the mechanisms of existence to pull the overtmotivator sequence without falling athwart of its consequences similarly with the problemsolution sequence you can thus solve all the pcs problems without squashing him unlike psychiatry which also tried to solve all of his problems
