parenthood of southeastern pennsylvania v casey case that was later heard by the us supreme court this report reviews the third circuits notable abortion opinions during judge alitos tenure and examines his concurring and dissenting opinions in some of those cases judge alito did not author the opinion of the court in any of the four cases discussed in this report1 planned parenthood of southeastern pennsylvania v casey in casey the third circuit considered whether certain sections of the pennsylvania abortion control act of 1982 were unconstitutional2 these sections imposed various consent notification and reporting require ments on individuals either seeking or providing abortions as threshold matter the third circuit sought to determine the appropriate standard of review for abortion regulations in roe v wade and subsequent abortion decisions th supreme court indicated that such regulations would be subject to strict scrutiny that is they would be upheld only if they were necessary to satisfy compelling governmental interest3 however the courts decisions in webster v reproductive health services and hodgson v minnesota two abortion cases from 1989 and 1990 respectively suggested that new standard of review should be used by the lower courts4httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33198crs2 5 430 us 188 1977 6 casey 947 f2d at 693 7 casey 947 f2d at 711 8 casey 947 f2d at 721 9 casey 947 f2d at 722after reviewing webster and hodgson the third circuit concluded that it would be improper to apply strict scrutiny to the state regulations instead the court determined that the appropriate standard of review was one that sought to determine whether an abortion regulation imposes an undue burden on womans ability to have an abortion this so called undue burde n standard had been discussed in justice oconnors opinions in the two cases webster and hodgson produced splintered decisions in which multiple opi nions were written however justice oconnors opinions were controlling because she concurred in the judgment on the narrowest grounds citing marks v united states 5 1977 case involving statute that barred the interstate transportation of obscene materials the third circuit explained marks stands for an important proposition the controlling opinion in splintered decision is that of the justi ce or justices who concur on the narrowest grounds6 applying the undue burden standard to the relevant sections of the pennsylvania statute the third circuit concluded that the provisions requiring informed and parental consent and those imposing reporting requirements on abortion providers and facilities were per missible however the cour t determined that the spousal notification requirement did impose an undue burden on womans ability to have an abortion the third circuit maintained that there was realistic likelihood that spouse could either prevent an abortion or cause serious physical or psychological trauma for the pregnant woma n if notification was required7 in separate opinion judge alito concu rred in the courts judgment except with respect to the spousal consent requirement judge alito agreed with the majoritys conclusion that the undue burden standard was the governing legal standard for evaluating abortion regulati ons however he did not believe that the spousal notification requirement imposed an undue burden on womans ability to have an abortion after examining justice oconnors opinions in webster hodgson and other abortion cases in which she discusse d the undue burden standard judge alito concluded that an undue burde n may not be established simply by showing that law will have heavy impact on few women instead broader inhibiting effect must be shown8 judge alito maintained that the plaintiffs in casey did not prove that the spousal tification requirement would impose an undue burden clearly the plaintiffs did not substantiate the imp act of the requirement with the degree of analytical rigor that should be demanded before striking dow n state statute9httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33198crs3 10 see planned parenthood of southeas tern pennsylvania v casey 505 us 833 1992 for discussion on the us

judges in every state shall be bound thereby any thing in the constitution or laws of any state to the contrary notwithstanding 15 see knoll 61 f3d at 173in 1992 plurality of the supreme court affirmed the third circuits decision with respect to the spousal notification requirement10 in joint opinion justices oconnor kennedy and souter writing fo r the court opined that the spousal notification requirement is likely to prevent significant number of women from obtaining an abortion11 the court emphasized that the requirement does not merely make abortions little more difficult or expensive to obtain for many women it will impose substantial obstacle we must not blind ourselves to the fact that the significant number of women who fear for their safety and the safety of their children are likely to be deterred from procuring an abortion as surely as if the commonwealth had outlawed abortion in all cases12 publiclyfunded abortions in elizabeth blackwell health center for women v knoll the third circuit considered challenge to pennsylvanias reporting and physician certification requirements for publicly funded abortions under the medicaid program13 t h elizabeth blackwell center for women reproductive healthcare facility that provides abortions and two ot her abortion organizations challenged the requirements on the grounds that they were inconsistent with the socalled hyde amendment and thus invalid under the supremacy clause of the us constitution14 the hyde amendment prohibits federal reimbursement for abortions except in limited circumstances such as when pregnancy is the result of rape or incest or when the procedure is necessary to save the life of the mother15 federal regulations and other agency directives for the imple mentation of the medi caid program further explain that federal funds are available for certain abortions as with all other mandatory medical services for which federal funding is available states are required to cover bortions that are medically necessary by definition abortions that are necessary to save the life of the mother are medically necessary in addition congress added abortions for pregnancieshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33198crs4 16 knoll 61 f3d at 174 quoting december 28 1993 di rective to state medicaid directors from the health care financing administration 17 knoll 61 f3d at

from rape and incest to the category of medically necessary abortions for which funding is provided16 pennsylvania law prohibited the use of fede ral or state funds for the termination of pregnancies caused by ra pe or incest unless 1 st atement was obtained from the physician performing the abortion that confirmed that the woman was victim of rape or incest and that she personally reported the crime to the appropriate law enforcement agency together with the name of the offender 2 the womans signed statement to that effect was obtained from the physician and 3 the appropriate state agency verified the reporting of the crime with the law enforcement agency17 these requirements could not be waived in addition in cases where the life of the mother would be jeopardized if an abortion wa s not performed penns ylvania law required an independent physician who would not perform the procedure and who had financial interest in the termination to certify the potential harm to the mother before federal or state funds could be expended18 the third circuit invalidated the reporting and physician certification requirements on the grounds that they were inconsistent with the hyde amendment and the agencys interpretation of the amendment the court observed that the hyde amendment plainly puts participating states on notice of their obligations to fund certain abortions the commonwealth was given clear notice that if it elected to continue to participate in the medicaid pr ogram it was obligated to provide funding for such abortions19 moreover the third circuit stated that any participating state should have realized that reporting require ments could be so onerous as to defeat congresss intent that medicaid funding be provided for the categories of abortions in question20 judge alito joined the majority in knoll claims based on fetal death in alexander v whitman the third circuit upheld th dismissal of complaint challenging the constitutionality of new jerseys wrongful death act and survival action act21 alexander alleged that the two statutes were unconstitutional because they denied recovery on behalf of stillborn fetuses in violation of the equal protection and due process clauses of the fourteenth amendment of the us constitution22 she argued that her stillborn child was person who was deniedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33198crs5 22 continued deprive any person of life liberty or prope rty without due process of law nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws 23 alexander 114 f3d at 1400 quoting roe v wade 410 us 113 158 1973 24 id 25 see alexander 114 f3d at 1402 04 the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment requires that the government follo w appropriate procedures when it seeks to deprive any person of life liberty or propert in addition courts have recognized substantive component of the due process cl ause that guarantees protection for certain rights or interests that have been found to be fundamental when fundamental rights or interests are involved state regulation limiting these rights or interests can be justified only by compelling state interest and only if they are narrowly tailored to satisfying that interest 26 alexander 114 f3d at 1404 27 alexander 114 f3d at 1409equal protection of the law because wrongfu l death and survival actions could not be maintained on behalf of stillborn children under new jersey law however such actions could be brought on behalf of children who were injured prenatally were born and then died as result of the prenatal injury the third circuit refused to recogniz alexanders equal protection claim citing the courts analysis in roe the third circuit reiterated that the word person as used in the fourteenth amendment does not include the unborn23 the court stated since the unborn are not persons within the meaning of the fourteenth amendment claim alleging an equal pr otection violation can be brought on behalf of the stillborn child24 alexanders due process cl aim was premised on the tion that her relationship with her unborn chil d during pregnancy was fundamental interest that would require the application of strict scrutiny to any statute that attempted to impact that relationship25 the court declined to consider whether mothers relationship with her unborn child during pregnancy is funda mental interest b ecause it believed that the statutes at issue did not affect alexanders rela tionship with her unborn child the third circuit explained mothers relationship with her fetus is exactly the same whether or not she can bring wrongful death or survivor action it is not the relationship that is affected here it is the ability to recover for the loss of that relationship26 although the court did not subject the wrongful death and survival action statutes to strict scrutiny it did review the statutes under rationa l basis review less rigorous standard of review that evaluate s whether measure is rationally related to legitimate state interest under that standard the two statutes were easily upheld in separate opinion judge alito concu rred in the courts judgment but made two points first he expressed concern over the possible suggestion that there could be human beings who are not constitutional persons27 second judge alito asserted that the doctrine of substantive due process must be informed by history hehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33198crs6 28 id 29 220 f3d 127 3rd cir 2000 30 id at 130 for discussion on stenberg v carhart see crs report rl30415 partial birth abortion recent developments in the law by jon shimabukuro 31 id 32 nj stat ann 2a65a6e 33 nj stat ann 2a65a6fexplained it is therefore significant that at the time of the adoption of the fourteenth amendment and for many years thereafter the right to recover for injury to stillborn child was not recognized28 partialbir th abortion in planned parenthood of central new jersey v farmer the third circuit considered the constitutionality of the new jersey partialbirth abortion ban act of 199729 at the outset the courts opinion indi cates that it was in final form before stenberg v carhart case involving nebraskas par tialbirth abortion measure was argued before the us supreme court30 the third circuit noted because nothing in the supreme courts carhart opinion is at odds with this courts opinion because in many resp ects that opinion confirms and supports this courts conclusions and in other re spects goes both further than and not as far as this opinion and because we see reason for further delay we issue this opinion without change31 in separate opinion discussed later in this report judge alito concurred in the judgment but addressed the absence of any substantive discussion of carhart in the courts opinion the new jersey statute at issue in farmer prohibited the performance of an abortion in which the person performing th abortion partially vaginally delivers living human fetus before killing the fetus and completing the delivery32 the statute further defined the phrase vagin ally delivers living human fetus before killing the fetus to mean deliberately and intentionally delivering into the vagina living fetus or substantial portion thereof for the purpose of performing procedure the physician or other health care professi onal knows will kill the fetus and the subsequent killing of the human fetus33 the statute included an exception that would have allowed the prohibited procedure to be pe rformed to save the life of the mother but did not include similar exception to preserve the health of the mother the district court invalidated the new jersey statute finding that it was unconstitutionally vague and imposed an undue burden on womans ability to have an abortion the third circuit affi rmed the lower courts decision on s imilar grounds first the third circuit agreed that the statute was unconstitutionally vaguehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33198crs7 34 farmer 220 f3d at 136 35 farmer 220 f3d at 13738 36 farmer 220 f3d at 144 37 farmer 220 f3d at 145 38 farmer 220 f3d at 152 39 farmer 220 f3d at 153 40 farmer 220 f3d at 152the definition for the prohibited procedure was so broad that it encompassed almost all forms of abortion for example the court observed the term partially vaginally delivers could reasonably describe the delivery of an intact fetus partially into the vaginal canal or the delivery of fetal part into the vaginal canal all abortion procedures save the hysterotomy and hysterectomy which are typically not va ginal deliveries could therefore be encompassed within this definition because during each of the procedures fetus may be partially delivered into the vaginal canal and thereafter killed34 the court noted that it is constitutionally impermissible to force physician to guess at the meaning of statutory language nd risk losing professional license and receiving heavy fine if the individual guesses incorrectly35 second the third circuit determined that the new jersey statute was unconstitutional because it imposed an undue burden on womans ability to have an abortion the court stated the ac t erects substantial obstacle because as already discussed in great detail it is so vague as to be easily construed to ban even the safest most common and readily ava ilable conventional pr and postviability abortion procedures36 moreover the court noted that the measure would discourage physicians from performing abortions because they would be unable to determine precisely what kind of abor tion was banned and would f ear license revocation and fines37 thus womans ability to have an abortion would be unduly burdened in his concurring opinion judge alito di scussed the absence of any substantive discussion of carhart in the courts opinion he sserted that the responsibility of lower court is to follow and appl controlling supreme court precedent38 therefore judge alito maintained that carhart compelled affirmance of the decision of the district court39 and contended that th courts opinion is now obsolete40 judge alitos discussion of precedent in his farmer concurrence and his examination and acknowledgme nt of the relevant supr eme court cases in his casey and alexander opinions seem to suggest reco gnition not only of the importance of precedent but the appropriate role of the lower courts with regard to precedent however judge alitos approach in these opinions may not provide an indication of how he might analyze cases as supreme court justice unlike lower courts thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33198crs8 41 garcia v san antonio metropolitan transit authority 469 us 528 546 1985supreme court is free to change the
