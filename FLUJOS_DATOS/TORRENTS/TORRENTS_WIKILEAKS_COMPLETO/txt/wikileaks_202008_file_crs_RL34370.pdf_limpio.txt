approximately 107 million pounds of herbicides in south vietnam for the purpose of defoliation and crop destruction the herbicides sprayed dur ing the vietnam era contained mixtures of 24dichlorophenoxyacetic acid 24d 245trichlorophenox yacetic acid 245t picloram and cacodylic acid the most extensively used defoliant compound 5050 combination of 24d and 245t came to be known as agent orange because of the orangecolored band placed on each chemical storage container one of the chemicals used in agent orange 245t contained small amounts of dioxin other herbicides employed in vietnam such as agent purpleand agent green also were contaminated with dioxin collectively these compounds were referred to as the rainbow defoliants the late 1960s saw decline in the use of these herbicides when dioxin already well know n to be highly toxic in animals was implicated in birth defects seen in mice by 1969 spraying was restricted to remote areas and by 1971 the air force ceased all spraying of agent orange since the 1970s vietnamera veterans have voiced concerns about how exposure to agent orange may have affected their health and caused certain disabilities including birth defects in their children initially the department of defense dod maintained that only limited number of us military personnel such as those operating aircraft or troops engaged in herbicide spraying could be positively linked to agent orange exposur however in 1979 the general accounting office now the government accountability office gao reported that ground troops had also been exposed to agent orange and dod was forced to reconsider its prior statements1 in response to these concerns congress passed legislation to research the longterm health effects on vietnam veterans and to provide benefits and services to those w ho may have been exposed to agent orange health care prior to the 1981 veterans health care training nd small business loan act pl 9772 veterans who complained of

interpretation of 38 cfr 3307a 6iii was that service member had to have actually set foot on vietnamese soil or served on craft in its rivers also known as brown water veterans in or der to be entitled to the presumption of exposure to agent orange the cavc specifically held the following 1 the reference to service in viet nam as used in the statut was ambiguous because there are many definitions of the territory of nation and 2 vas regulation defining vietnam service for purposes of granting th presumption of exposure to herbicides 38 cfr 3307a6iii was ambiguous when viewed together with 38 cfr 3313 which also defines service in vietnam because cavc determined that ambiguity was present it also examined vas adjudication procedur manual m211 the m211 manual20 provision from 1991 which stated th at the receipt of vietnam service medal vsm would be considered proof of vietnam service in the absence of contradictory evidence in 2002 va issued new m211 provision advising va benefit adjudicators that the receipt of the vsm could indicate service on land in vietnam but by itself was not proof of service in vietnam because veteran may have received this medal for service in locations other than vietnam21 the cavc determined the m211 provision to be substantive rule establishing entitlement to the presumption of exposure to herbic ides and held that vas attempted rescissions of that m211 provision were void because they failed to comply with the notice and comment requirements of the administrative procedures act apa22 subsequent actions on september

exposed to herbicides while on board his ship as it traveled near the vietnamese coast however according to the court s opinion he is not entitled to the benefit of presumption related to agent orange

seeking conclusive information on the health risk s of exposure to agent orange below is brief description of epidemiologic res earch conducted by the various agencies centers for disease control and prevention in 1979 the va was authorized to conduct an epidemiologic st udy to determine the association between agent orange and the medical concerns of vietnamera veterans in carrying out the congressional mandate the va was faced with substantial challenges in determining study design and research protocol and in 1982 responsibility for the research was transferred from the va to the cdc the cdc also faced its own obstacles in research design and were delayed by the l ack of exposure data in response to the difficulty in obtaining exposure data the cdc attempted an agent orange validation study to see if indirect estimates of exposure from military records and selfreports could be compared to dioxin serum levels in veterans as met hod of determining true exposure after investigation the cdc re ported that military r ecords and selfreports obtained from the agent orange validation study were inadequate for identifying the exposed individuals necessary for large epidemiologic study of dioxin effects secondary to the problems faced by the va and the cdc group of government panels and advisory board s determined that the congressionally mandated agent orange
