concerns with the convention itself18 these concerns were outlined in 2002 when the senate foreign relations committee held hearings on potential ratification of the convention thensecretary of state colin powell wrote letter to the foreign relations committee stating that the convention was under state and justice departments review due to concerns regarding the vagueness of the text of cedaw and

ongoing debate over us ratification of the convention these issues may continue to play role in the debate if the senate considers the convention during the 110th congress31 the effectiveness of the convention major point of contention among supporters and opponents of ratification is whether the convention is an effective mechanism for addressing womens rights internationally proponents of the convention such as representative woolsey describe the convention as powerful tool for women globally and emphasize that the united states is the only industrialized country that has not ratified the convention32 advocates such as senators joseph biden and barbara boxer argue that the convention empowers women to achieve equality in their own countries and cite specific examples of the conventions success in achieving its purpose33 some 29 hres 101 110th introduced january 24 2007 by representative lynn woolsey referred to the subcommittee on international organizations human rights and

barbara boxer oped senate needs to ratify the treaty for continued crs8 ngos have also recorded the conventions effectiveness in improving womens rights in specific countries and regions34 opponents of ratification recognize that global discrimination against women is problem that should be eliminated but they do not view the convention as the most effective way to achieve this goal some contend that the convention hurts rather than helps women struggling for human rights internationally they argue that the convention serves as facade for continuing atrocities in countries that are state parties to the convention such as china and north korea35 some opponents also contend that when considering treaty ratification the senate should act based on the standard of what is best for the american people36 the convention as an instrument for us foreign policy congressional and noncongressional supporters of the convention contend that us ratification will increase the credibility of the united states abroad and enhance its ability to champion womens rights in other countries37 the 2002 foreign relations committee report stated that the united states should support ratification because among other things it will give our diplomats tool means to press other governments to fulfill their obligations under the convention38 to illustrate this point some ratification supporters cite june 12 2002 letter to the foreign relations committee from dr sima samar thenafghan minister of womens affairs dr samar asks the senate to ratify the convention and says that we will 33

argument emphasize that the united states has the strongest record on opportunities and rights for women in the world40 and maintain the united states does not need to ratify the convention to further its womens rights policies in the minority views of the 2002 foreign relations committee report senators helms brownback and enzi stated that afghan women were relieved of the burden of an oppressive antiwoman government by the personal heroism and sacrifice of american forces and not through multilateral treaty such as cedaw us sovereignty the senate has engaged in considerable debate over the impact of cedaw ratification on us sovereignty and international law the minority views in the 2002 senate foreign relations committee report stated that the convention represents disturbing international trend of favoring international law over us constitutional law and selfgovernment thereby undermining us sovereignty in particular they were concerned that the conventions description of discrimination against women is too broad and that it may apply to private organizations and areas of personal conduct not covered by us law 41 senators supporting the convention maintain that ratification would not affect us sovereignty senator biden stated that the convention will impose minimal burden on the united states given that the us constitution and other existing federal and state laws already meet the obligations of the convention he also emphasized that the united states would file several ruds to ensure that new laws were created to meet the obligations of the convention42 social issues some opponents of ratification are concerned that the convention may catalyze proabortion movement in the united states and interfere with family rights such as marriage and parenting they contend that the convention is an effort to redefine the family43 and argue that cedaw will help lawyers and other proabortion advocates reach the goal of enshrining unrestricted access

things undercut parental rights and lead to gender reeducation homosexual rights and legalized prostitution45 in response to criticism that ratification may impact family planning or abortion policy in the united states some supporters emphasize that the word abortion is never mentioned in the convention text they refer to 1994 state department determination that the convention is abortion neutral and contend that several of the ruds proposed such as the understandings on the cedaw committee and abortion adequately address the concerns of ratification opponents concerned with family abortion and family planning issues46 supporters of ratification also emphasize that countries where abortion is illegal such as ireland and rwanda have ratified the convention47 administration review of the convention opponents of ratification object to senate consideration of the convention without full legal and policy review from the administration in 2002 some members of the senate foreign relations committee argued that the senate should not consider the convention without new review from the state department because eight years of us federal and state jurisprudence had not yet been taken into account48 senators representing the minority view recommended that the senate defer action on the convention until the administrations analysis and views are available49 timetable for the
