essentials of auditing lecture given on 15 october 1963 well im glad to see you back where you been have good trip well its the first of these lectures inwell its the first one of these lectures now in two weeks so whats the date audience 15th of october fifteenth of october ad 13 actually you would see to be all rested up you see from having not lectured for couple of weeks but frankly the lecture weeks are the relaxation weeks we put 900 feet of film in the cans yesterday it took us two days to put 300 feet of 16mm in the cans and yesterday afternoon and evening we put 900 feet in and we just shot it with luck all the way this isof course we are shooting right on top of it and this is the saturday congress in london this is monday and the film hasthis is the monday shoot and the film had to be at the developers and so forth on tuesday and we hope we get it back with print on thursday and we might even have chance to edit it but we shot it with editing i just usedbeing an old hollywoodite on these thingsjust abandoned all movie technology and threw in lot ofjust abandoned it utterlyand threw in tv kinescope technology which is quite different and reg got beautiful auricon 16mm magnetic sound camera from over in the states you can line it up on one of these tv screens and it doesnt get the lines or anything so it does gorgeous job and we can film demonstrations and so forth that will be reduced down to 8mm and 8mm with magnetic soundtrack and then these projectorsput in all organizationsand we can give them some material that will hold the line and of course yesterdays filmwe just put everything in it including the kitchen sink there was students and buildings and we had nicky out here throwing penny in the wishing well and we had the kids saying goodnight and so forth youd be surprised how long half an hour is when youre making it up with shots you know different scenes and shots and that sort of thing and we gagged it up quite bit and itll probablyyoull probably see it next saturday if you go up to the london congress and you undoubtedly will see it at the us eastern congress and the us western congress and so forth youll be seeing this film around and the strain of it however was too great for us the strain was too great we began to crack up toward the end you see working on into all hours and we were just so lucky that its just almost impossible to estimate the amount of luck involved in the thingso wed shoot shot and that was it you see and we werent dropping ashtrays and other things like that for instance we shot model session complete from beginning to end using havingness as the process i dont know what film footage we shot that on but it was very brief only about hundred and twenty feet of film for whole model session from beginning to end with every step in it and it all went off very flawlessly and the only thing i did in error on the thing i thanked the pc for the goals and gains after having gotten both goals and gains which is hardly anything at all because ive been doing that routinely anyhow but the score is that that film can do terrific job of tv demonstration you see because you just give usual routine ordinary tv demonstration and the camera is downstairs there in the lower studio or camera room and it just takes the demonstration and you flick the meter onto the screen you flick the picture on the screen you could flick picture of the pc on the screen you see you could put anything on that screen and then you shoot it off from the screen you say well what happens to the quality and so forth well i think youll see that saturday the quality actually doesnt suffer at all its quite remarkable you dont see the lines of the screen because of the shutterand you just dont see them show up thats all it just looks like picture of something not picture of tv screen your eye can detect more lines and so forth than camera can detect on tv screen you can also set up the contrast so that its much more agreeable to film furthermore tv camera would shoot picture in here now haha try and take one on film now you could set up two or three tv cameras one up there and one up there you wouldnt have to have any operator to it to amount to anything you could shoot picture of this lecture here pick it up over in the lower studio and just by flipping the turret shift from one scene to another scene and the sound is just going right onto the camera directly and so on you got picture of lecture you wouldnt hear any whirring camera noises or anything like that and you dont have to have the fantastic glaring light levels that are required for motion pictures so weve done quite job on that i just thought youd be interested in it and give you little bit there is gag that ill let youill let you be able to whisper to the people reg is going to pull this gag right at the end when we finally broke down why reg and i sat down to themy organ in my office you see and got picture of us going to play tune you see and as we were about to strike the keys and playing on duet you get the first of your end titles you see we just blank out you see and got that and we carry on with beautiful organ piece which plays out through the end titles and ill let you in on little secret it wont be much of secret because you listen to this music its actually the saints come marching in but in actual fact its beingit is the biggest pipe organ in the world its the hub rink organ in chicago you see i think 64 foot pipes the thing has got you know and that sort of thing and here we are sitting down to this little tiny wurlitzer well for sure you see therell be people at the congress though who dont get the gag well we had lot of fun shooting that but it was really highpressure stuff well be able to make training films in other words of the various types and activities and well be using them here now here we have another system going in and that is to say we can put projector down there and put it on and throw switch on the projector down there and you get the picture on the tv sets here in the chapel in other words you dont have to have blackedout cinema in order to see the pictures in other words little 8mm projector sits down there this is all 16mm were shooting this stuff on reduced to 8 you see you can turn on this little projector down there and show session or demonstration or piece of auditing it appears on the tv screen you watch the tv screen and mr skinner doing thathe even figured out when i asked him if it wasnt possible why to fix it up so that it would just shut everything off when it finished the film and therell be small fee to the instructors and so forth for that one in other words you could set up film load it and simply by just press button and youve got theyouve got the thing demonstrated from one end to the other and then when its finished it doesnt even have to have anybody pay any attention to it it simply shuts itself off shuts all the sets off shuts everything off turns out the light sweeps the floor well were getting this geared up communication of scientology materials to the auditor and the student is one of the biggest humps as you could realize that we must have and there are many many thingsim just going to give you talk on that sort of thing and give you some data concerning it that youll find of interest and that is that the tv systems the bulletins the graphs the materials which you have your live demonstrations your live instructors all of this sort of thing is an effort to relay information and the idea of education is simply taking an idea from one mind and putting it in another mind and that is really the totality of education it really doesnt depend on whether the idea is good bad or indifferent true false or otherwise the methods of education are all the same and they are basically the methods of communication so therefore the arc triangle to large degree operates in these mechanisms and one of the things if you can take mest out or take effort out of the communication line you can normally get fast accurate communication line but there is point when the communication line not having any mass in it becomes unstable in other words you cannot hold standard because it isnt down anyplace let give you an idea one of you goes up to london walk through the central organization in london well i dont say stay out of the central organization in london i dont say dont answer questions asked you by all means talk all you please but it is quite ordinarily followed on monday by catastrophe in the hgc now your communication line to the student or the hgc staff member or something like that was probably quite accurate but what did he tell joe in other words standard wasnt held here so that you get weird things which are then attributed to the saint hill students going to london even one time it was contemplated not letting any saint hill students go to londongo into the organization in london see that was once contemplated well i finally put my foot down i said i figured it out they do them much more good than they do them harm because the false communication line does not come actually between the saint hill student and the organization it comes between whatthat the person who has heard the saint hill student ordinarily and who that person was talking to see you get some wild variations for instance you might not know it but you had all london in complete panic just week agojust week ago they had heard that the ta requiredminimum ta for 25hour intensive was 400 and they all had headaches last monday and so forth working at this horrible data see well data like that occurs in the absence of fixed data source it isnt written down in bulletin you see its adrift somewhere on the communication lines and so on now we sometimes to this degree therell be data which is given in tapes which never appears on bulletins and there are little scraps of data of one kind or another that could make all that difference in the auditing session going on in keokuk that have simply never been published well to round up all this data and put it all together is herculean task it would be to marked degree up to to do it but well for instance reg has been working on the last two years of bulletins hes had his secretary working on the last two years of bulletins getting them all together and so forth and they finally did get all of this material together now theyre trying to get the last two years of tape notes complete now if we did that we would have two years of total research but still outside of it would be left the data which i have given you walking down the hall see there is always some data escapes the fixed communication line so you have to be very thorough and you have to sort out what are the fundamentals which should be taught and therefore in order to communicate and in order for anybody to assimilate the information on the other end which is part of the educational act you have to have condition where the data is not in conflict and is not so complicated that it cannot be communicated or cannot be assimilated so therefore you reduce things to their fundamentals and this has two purposes the one purpose is the educational purpose and the other thing of course is things which are reduced to their fundamentals are resolved or far better understood now the purpose were speaking of now however is the relay of it now the relay of that education and of data from mind to mind b is susceptible to many alterations many alterises many omissions many curves and so forth its almost proportional to mind to mind b all right thats one set of alterises mind cwe have now added newthats mind b to mind c thats new set of alterises now we got mind c to mind d and that is new set of alterises and weve got d to and that isnt alteris by this time its unrecognizable now this also occurs on the time stream that datum which was thoroughly understood in 1800 by 1900 has become unrecognizable in actual fact we probably have very little grip on what was actually thought in 1800very little grip on the opinions and activities of the time but i well recall in just this first half of 1900 tremendous change of manners mannerisms and so forth brought about by other communication media such as the motion picture television and we mustnt omit the automobile as communication media it is because its particle that can travel rapidly and independently from to b the telephone is earlier than that but all of these things have influence and they influence culture and they influence what is going on in that culture but this we talk about in terms of an overloaded communication line now and im not going into the five ways you can cut communication line theyre the subject of great many executive bulletins and all this sort of thing but im infringing on that quarter right now you can actually overload the communication line so that it doesnt communicate there is simply too much data on the subject thisyou sometimes feel like that i know see and you wish for heavens sake that you could pick out of it few fundamentals that would sort of sum it all up and you would be able to wrap your wits around it and so forth and that in actual fact is the subject of this lecture that im giving you here is how you do this the situation then of an overloaded communication line is that there is insufficient time to peruse the material you could get into that kind of situation rather easily so you can have too little communication you can have too varied or too variable communication or you can simply have an overloaded communication line for instance i walked into the explorers club one day up in the library up on the mezzanine floor and i wanted to know little bit about ice i think it was or something like that i didntwasnt particularly hepped on it i just wanted little datum about ice the conditions of ice and the temperatures at which ice became rotten so called and so on i just wanted little information i asked the librarian up there wheres some text here on ice wheres some text on ice i want to look up something some stable data about ice and he looked at as though i were mad or id suddenly gone mad or i was about to steal his whole library or something like this and he waved his hand and he said well that cabinet over there is part of the material about ice i looked at that cabinet over there and it contained something on the order of thousand volumes all of them thick and you can frankly shut the door to learning in somebodys face with dull clank needless to say i went down and found an old friend of mine that knew the arctic at the tea table that evening and i pumped him on the subject of ice for short space of time and oh when does it become rotten oh well he said that varies and so forth and he gave the variable edges and he tossed it off it was very easy for him to toss off this datum for the excellent reason that he had tremendous familiarity with the subject but my door was closed in the absence of this boy my door was closed i was to sit up there and read thousand volumes hoping that somewhere in it i would discover something about rotten ice one volume said ice also becomes rotten through mosscertain types of moss and the next thing you know i was reading chapter on biology i dont know how i got off into biology i was just looking for some rotten ice man see you get off into these wild excursions and you feel like somebody who picks up copy of the encyclopaedia britannica and hes going to look up anteaters you know and the next confounded thing you know hes reading with great fascination about aardvarks hes been totally derailed so too much information on subject or too many volumes of information on subject can effectively close the communication lines we actually oddly enough dont happen to be suffering from that in scientology you think we are but we actually arent were actually suffering from lack of text you would be very happy to have text that says arc breaks level i and that gave five six eight even ten page breakdown of all possible sources of them that gave you the crossindex conditions of the pc for each one of them herculean task to do things something like that but nevertheless that would be very welcome volume to you instead of that our material is actually research record and you are looking at research record you are not looking at textbook material and as soon as you realize that youll have much easier time of it at any given instant on research line that which is known is believed to be true and it wouldnt be there unless it had some workability at any given instant but at any given later instance on that research line you will find that that material has been reexamined and that certain data in it which are not important have been dropped and certain data in it which are important have been clarified and added now your main difficulty is looking at time span of development and trying to pick out of time span of development great many fundamentals well the most remarkable thing in the world was how we got along having started with the definition of auditor giving the sweeping ideas here we got the definition of an auditor as one who listens and originally one who listens and computes all right thats great and we come up thirteen years almost fourteen years later with this as resolution of cases well that is certainly different on the research line see theres two different points here fourteen years apart and one it just says well an auditor is somebody who listens and computes and most of the time the auditor thought the compute was more important than the listen then fourteen years later we drop the compute and we put the listen in there for level i wow what difference see what difference this little tiny change of emphasis gives us sweeping difference in auditing so therefore at some period during that fourteen years some of the data concerning the definition of an auditor and his function must have been reevaluated from time to time and sure enough we see that we see different trs we see this we see that we see the other thing coming along the line and we see an enormous number of extraneous and additional data all of which support what an auditor ought to be doing well all of that data concerning what an auditor ought to be doing was of course an effort to clarify and explain to the student or to the potential auditor what his performance should be well it must have been there to this slight degree it must have been there because the basic definition and understanding was not present so the more data in education now you can draw these extrapolations because were not bad model of education if you just remember that you are studying research line and its up to the old man to someday grab it all together and put it together somehow or another and assemble it and so on and my solution to it right now is merely expect you to be geniuses at it see thats all simple solution it saves time funny part of it is you all too often measure up to it but the system now of datasummation gathering of data and so onadds up to very interesting datum in the field of sciences and that is thisthis is an interesting datum its quite pervasive its quite usefulis the more arbitraries or the more arbitrary didactic solutionyou must youve got to you must nots and so forththere are in subject the further that subject is from the actual comprehension of the basics involved in that subject now ill state that another way to make sure you got it the subject itself has arbitrary data in it in direct proportion to its distance from knowing its own fundamentals thats an elementary remark now ill clarify that how about art just how about art i remember old don rogers mentioned this long time ago 1950 how about art man youve got nothing but opinion in art opinion opinion opinion opinion opinion this is good picture because the metropolitan museum hung it oh brother ive met director of the metropolitan museum i wouldnt consider that recommendation this is great picture because it was analyzed by professor joe blow of krapunkin as one of the great pictures of the screemp century thats why you wander through gallery and you see these four dobs of paint there you see running down into mass of wrinkles and theres sign across the bottom of it and it says commerce and ohhhh which wall see well therefore subject can be so way out that it is nothing but opinion and when subject is nothing but opinion then you can safely assume that there is nothing known about the subject thats one you can put in your hip pocket just as snide method of analysis now for instance testing when you have tests which depend upon the opinion of the tester to say whether or not somebody is sane or insane or delirious or something you see and its up to the tester to give an opinion then you must decide two things that little or nothing is known about testing and that fundamentals on the subject of the mind must be known in that quarter otherwise the tests would not be so far out as to require only opinion here once more we have the fact the opinion present is proportional to the unknowns present and you can get then all kinds of weird quote sciences unquote now thats little bit different than looking at developmental line developmental line is simply selfcritical and active and ambitious effort to learn more fundamental materials to clarify and throw away irrelevant materials actually its selfcritical line that is trying to shorten its own volume its trying to reach minimal information it looks to you sometimes in this field of study as though its trying to reach maximal investment of time to understand it but if you will look at the materials you find out that they are condensing condensing condensing the data are getting less per section of the subject but with that lessness comes greater importance because theyre more fundamental previously you can for instance take hindu philosophers textbook krishnamurti or something like this open up the chapter on time scientologist would be very fascinated to read krishnamurti science on the subject of time hed be flabbergasted as matter of factflabbergasted howd he know this well unfortunately theres little hook to it his data about time that are factual data about time are sandwiched in at the same monotone of importance with about five hundred or thousand other data about time which are totally false and to which he has given the hat tip of being fundamental so you can go through any body of writing and you can find certain numbers of truths in it but did the writer find them i used to horrify english professors by sayingabout witticisms and being very clever in writing and that sort of thingi used to horrify these boys you could just see theirthe resistance of iconoclasm item go straight up in smoke you see when i would say oh yes well sir thomas browne anybody that would write that million words couldnt help but say something clever nevertheless this has scientific application you cant write on the subject of time endlessly and take every stray thought that comes in your head on the subject of time and put it down on sheet of paper without having in that mass certain fundamental and sweeping truths about time only now which is the drop in the atlantic ocean which is the important drop reevaluation of information in the direction of arriving at more fundamental conclusions which have greater usefulness is the basic of this progressive research line which you are studying now it isnt true and i am very happy to find out that it isnt trueive been over this ground and over itthat you are necessarily studying rons case as my auditor can tell you occasionally i go pale when we walk in toward fundamental of scientology when im being audited and think for while that that might be the reason why i have called something something dont you see this whole contest has been much more dramatic contest its been the effort of by the bootstraps above the level of ones own case and have at it and when i havent succeeded in rising superior to my own case or items and so on i am the first one to turn slightly pink and it was quite interesting to meits quite interesting to mefor while ago running into survivalto survive as gpm dont you see well obviously this would explain so much if this were the present time gpm it would practically explain all wouldnt it well when i found that in session that i had such gpm i was very very blushing you see and so much so that i pulled it completely out of line in the lines of gpms and put myself in terrible creak because it actually belongs waaaay back on the track lost with lot of other gpms and simply had gotten pulled out by the recognition of the fact that survive was the basic principle of existence and then that had turned around and taken this gpm and hauled it out of the backtrack and carted it up to present time with winches and there it has been sitting putting in gorgeous creak see as soon as i recognized that this had been the action bang it went back into place i havent been troubled with it since the whole contest has been then to see things clearly well knowing that one could not be on this planet researching things without having his opinions colored and yet trying to rise above the coloration of opinion by ones own aberration and associations or even the penchants and enthusiasms of the age these things also tend to color things enormously you see well its beenwe have been successful to the degree that that has been accomplished and has been accomplished to considerable and remarkable degree now every time we ferret out new fundamental you actually lose out of your study data bucketful of items bucketful of data until you begin to wonder well what is stable and what isnt stable in the past thats fascinating what is stable and what isnt stable well actually the axioms are in there in concrete the logics the prelogics the fundamental material of the philadelphia lectures the behavior of thetan the only thing ive seen it necessary to change in that particular line is the idea of exteriorizationis the only thing thats been changed recently what will pc do when you bring him up to point where he does not have to be in body see and we used to think that he would move out of his body and that is not what he will do he will move his body off him because we have changed him up scale to point where he can hold position and if he could exteriorize the first thing he would have in mind if his body was getting in his road in any way would be to move it over there now i think thats an awfully minorminor thing to have shifted in all that body of theoretical information you have the factors you have all sorts ofyouve got all of this what we are now calling scientology one material you know and your arc triangles and all that sort of thing basic materials by the ton these things are all completely accurate see been reason to change those at all theyre in concrete so therefore the working field in which we have been engaged has been the field of applied technology there has been reason under the sun to alter our theoretical technology not even the datum i gave you just now alters the theoretical technology of dianetics and scientologynot hair thats still there theoretical technology dead accurate dead accurate nothing wrong with that well what then are you as student seeing change what do you see change under your nose whats this thats going by its the reevaluation of data as applied technology and youre seeing continuous reevaluation of data as applied technology now because youre studying to be an auditor not theoretician as matter of fact i could confide in you you would be having breeze if you were studying at scientology level five thats the theoretical level out of which you evolve scientology you see if you were only studying at that level what breeze you would have you didnt intend to apply it to any case you didnt intend to do anything for anybody maybe youall you wanted to do was know about the organization of things the principles of things and that sort of thing if you were studying at that data you would say good heavens the unchanging monotony of this stuff is fantastic so where is it shifting applied technology to cases thats where its shifting and thats whats giving you headache as student but lets go just little bit further than that whats giving you headache as student in applying itif you do have headache as student applying itis trying to apply what you know to case sitting in front of you so as to obtain result thats where the data mills around and if you look over your bulletins theyre all addressed to this subject not just because youre student but thats the most of the outflow and information available it is so rare to release any definitions of communication from scientology fiveit was terrible shock to people apparently to release project 80the definitions of scientology there have been several complaints about these well of course theres been tremendous huzzahsmost sensible people have said huzzah and so on but thereve been several complaints too it was great shock its great shock because they contain three words in them that are very upsetting in the united states particularly it says the common peoples science of life and livingness you see i think thats fascinating thats whats wrong with that level i dont think thats whats wrong with that level at all i just think its the derivations or the reinterpretations that you can get into with this particular phrase but the odd part of it is everybody has spotted the lie see in project 80 there is one lie and thats that definition only they dont quite know whats wrong with it and theyre picking on it there have been several letters in complaining about this everything is fine except that one the common peoples science of the mind or something like that whatever it says fascinating they havent realized that theyve spotted lie and they think that theyre complaining about the common people and theyre not complaining about the common people that phrase is not what they are complaining about this dashed off as an exampleyou understand that that project 80 this was an example of what these definitions should be that was all and this one was thrown in thats newspaper toss off see thats newspaper definition toss off to get people to understand it to get people to communicate it one way or the other and that little particular phrase happens to be untruthful because if theres anybody uncommon its scientologist the common people on the subject of the mind left to their own devicesgod elp us because remember this is subject which confounds the wits and creaks the brains of and has the best thinkers and philosophers that have ever been on this planet in its written history and through false modesty and because it communicates better and so forth one backs off that particular point these are the problems that drove socrates round the bend see and were studying them and handling them as an everyday activity oh wow of course you cant say then this is the common peoples you want to know why cant we get more people into scientology see well you can get lot of people into scientology there is doubt about it but if you get them in at level ior at level 0 or at level iyouve got to fairly rapidly make them very uncommon people to bring them on up the line correct so it is lie theyre not common people this is nothingthis is nothing against those people who have been complaining about that theyre dead right that of course that particular phrase was taken out of newspaper handout that i was kicking around and we were putting together and so forth and it just seemed like good offhand definition that was simply put off as an example of how you would define it dont you see well everything else in it is quite truthful and quite factual but that one happens to be lie and there have been several complaints about it all saying we are not common people see and that is not now you could say the average personi just got one from detroit of all placesthe average persons mental science now that would be acceptable but not the common people you see how far that datum is shooting see how far that is missing well that would then become an aberrated stable datum and it would only stick because it contained lie now out of all this other truthful material we find people paying lot of attention to this one that 1 isnt important and 2 happens to be the only inaccurate rundown that we have in scientology one project 80 now what does that have to do with education why is ron going off to this degree the mind tends to fix on those things which contain an alteris from truth and conversely an alteris in the truth of the situation is the most resistant thing to the truth of the situation youve got the cowboys in the white hats and the cowboys in the black hats here see the cowboys in the black hats are aberrated stable data now im very sure that at least one or two of you present if not more have become very worried about absorbing any stable data realizing that gpm is made up exclusively as data which has become very very stable indeed and if the whole source of human aberrationrunning your itsa line and so forth and taking out solutionsthat the whole source of human aberration is actually derived from stable data assumed to hold back confusions and im sure that to some degree youve been shaking in your boots about postulating any new stable data look what it does to you its an aberrated stable datum the common peoples mental science see look at the randomity of that thing and suddenly confusion suddenly started entering into various parts of the country and even detroit see confusion entered in people started batting at this thing they didnt like this this is wrong and so on and so on so any error entered into the line is apt to get battered at but reverse fight also goes on an aberrated stable datum will batter back at the truth but where you have slightly altered truth and you were trying to give it to someone who already has an altered truth on that same subject the two will come into conflict which promotes all sorts of bad applied technology now this is something like saying well an aberrated auditor has hard time auditing youve heard that old saw see i can turn out very nice session i never pretended to be unaberrated i dont believe that see but i will tell you this that guy with some of his aberrations in place some of these aberrated stable data you see the real hangups are the way to get on in life you see is to die oh itll hang you up because its not true it stops it stops proper flow of data all right now if you then are studying material which has any place in its body at all any alteration from the fundamental that should be there and you yourself have an alterationremember its an alterationwhich is contrary to the datumaltered datumyou are trying to assimilate you get dogs breakfast it becomes real mess in other words were trying to drive truck through truck weve got this aberrated slightly aberrated datum and were trying to push it through an aberrated datum theyve both got lies in them to one degree or another or theyre slightly nonbasic or nonfactual and they wont mix so you have this fellow with this slightly aberrated datumall horses sleep in beds you seeregarding the datum all beds are soft you see all beds are soft isnt true and horses sleep in beds that isnt true now how are you going to get these two data together well they just arent going to fit and youll have this fellow going around in circles and hell have every reason under the sun why it isnt true that all beds are soft some beds have got to be hard theyve got toin the first place theyve got to support up to ton of horseflesh now he actually at time looks at what is really wrong with this datum hes trying to assimilate all beds are soft thats not true if youve ever been on an oldtime sailing ship you would know that if youve ever slept under an airplane wing youd know that in fact i could think of some hotels that would tell you that quite rapidly theres some landladies around here that wouldnt agree with that at all they make it completely false so youve gotyouve got this fellow and hes saying all horses sleep in beds well all beds are soft cant be true because if it was true they wouldnt support ton of horseflesh imagine getting percheron to sleep in that bed you see too soft go right straight through the mattress you know the beds got to be stiff stiff see now look at the ridiculousness of this conflict is any part of this conflict going to resolve itself at all hes finding the wrong thing wrong with the datum because he has vested interest in trying to make this datum fit or unfit somehow with another stableunstable erratic aberrated datum see so he cant get these two data together never the twain shall meet he then tries to understand an aberrated datum through another aberrated datum and of course he develops complications now hes liable to get professor sweeney to write paper on the proper softness of beds see hes liable to get all kinds of things but hes actually trying to push home the data all beds should be hard and strong hes actually trying to push into existence as aberrated datum as hes being presented with now out of this conflict and counterposition visàvis and one against the other aberrated stable datum versus aberrated stable datum you get crush of superimposed opinions of one kind or another all of which rise up into fantastic potpourri that is called opinions logic demonstration of this and that and so forth now you have pc who is walking gold mine of aberrated stable data now if any datum which youre using to resolve that ease is the least bit curved that case wont resolve but develop new complications do you see this therefore the mass of technology which grows up in scientology is of course centered around applied technology and you get swelling mass of this data which then will subside and lot of it will be thrown away and you get swelling mass of this data and itll subside and be thrown away but it only subsides and is thrown away when new clarification is given to fundamental so the greatest possible truth in terms of fundamentals has to be used in application so its my contest on research line to leave stone unturned to get at the most fundamental clean clearcut fundamental possible for the resolution of the ease because the cases otherwise will not resolve now weve gone an enormous direction weve gone long long way in this particular direction and we have made some tremendous gains in this particular direction but is there any other zoneis there any other zone now where we get randomity yesthe person who is applying the data now if you in assimilation of data are assimilating to the slightest degree data up against miscomprehension or an allness which youre putting in place of the auditor you dont get an assimilation you have difficulty assimilating the data but you can assimilate the data your trouble comes when you turn around and take the datum youve assimilated and altered in some fashion and then have tried to apply it to the case who is sitting in front of you and the alterises in that data will then bring about nonresolution of the case you are confronted with the only solvent is truth and even though absolutes are unobtainable truthin very refined form the purest possibleis the only thing that will resolve cases all the way because it is the one thing that the aberrated case cannot argue with therefore you as an auditor desiring results have business whatsoever in letting yourself get bent around in circles or riding hobbyhorses with regard to the technology which you are applying because it will get furiously in your road if it has been twisted in some fashion now that looks like an almost insurmountable barrier actually theres considerable tolerance and you get resolution of cases within this zone of tolerance there is zone of tolerance it doesnt have to be quite that perfect to make it work because the technology heretofore was too imperfect ever to work and it has been my task to bring about recognition of fundamentals sufficiently great and technology sufficiently great to overcome lot of this alteris but it is task which is of course thousand times greater than simply presenting the task necessary to resolve case were not just presenting the material necessary to resolve case we have to present it so fundamentally accurate so close to the purest of pure that the auditor in applying it can still alteris it can apply it to pc who isbecause its right up against his casemaybe as person hed be able to override some of this but when its applied to his casebeing that makes something elsewho is going to take that data already twisted and twist it further such as in answering the auditing command and still have resolution of case thats an heroic problem then well now you havent too much to worry about along that problem line but you do have this to worry about the amount of difficulty you have with cases is directly proportional to the amount of aberrated or alterisaberration or alteristhat youre adding to the data that youre using thats directly proportional now of course this also is directly proportional to the purity and assimilability of the material you are given to study i already accept some fault for that dont you see because that is difficult one to bring off but were in there awful close dont you see there isnt too much out that would get by if we didnt have an alteris of an offered datum by the auditor which is then applied to case which is just going to alteris the living daylights out of it the only universal solvent is truth thats the only thing that will solve anything imagine itwe even know that the way you solve solutions is solutions we even know how to cure cures its fantastic you know theres practically field of healing has ever gone in this direction at all these are all undisclosed and unrecognized data this guys got lumbosis reg did the other dayasking what solutions has he had to his back troublehe was asking some pc the pc all of sudden turns up with back trouble whatdid he have back trouble he had solutions of the back trouble well when youve penetrated that deeply into the morass of consciousness and unconsciousness that you know what is cause and effect along this particular line youre dealing with fairly pure information but everywhere i have made the tiniest little mistake or thrown the wrong emphasis on something youre going to have some trouble and you might be able to get by with thatand might not toounless you took that datumor took dataand then alterised it thoroughly and then shoved it at pc and of course by the time it gets to that pc the data is very far from truth and therefore is not case solvent anymore now its my task continuously to look up these holes in the technology find out where they sit find out what misconceptions people have about these things and reevaluate the information and rerelease it again this has been done at level iv to such an appalling degree now that level iv does the impossible it brings about an ot but is actually only workable at level of tightwire walk that doesnt permit variation of an eighteenth of an inch from its procedure ill show you right now how much you can vary routine 4 and smash pc there was hole in it but the hole didnt appear until somebody wasnt asking the exact question there was hole in itive been looking these up rather rapidly latelyand that was simply this there are three goals that will rocket readthree types of goals that will rocket read and we started out with just one type of goal that would rocket read that was old routine 3 way back when and those are an actual goal an actual gpm and an implant gpm there could be another type which is phrase in engram but that will not necessarily rocket read but the other three any one of them will rocket read now as you sit there and look at what youve just written there in your notes when you regard that you say thats not much of discovery well look we used to have one type which was goal we were awful glad to see goal rocket read and then through this last summers work i found out practically all there was to know about implants and implant goals and it was obvious that actual goals and implant goals were getting mixed up and we got at least one case in z unit who does not know it until this moment i start giving this datum just at this instant whos wrapped around telegraph pole actual goal but it hasnt got any gpm connected with it isnt that nasty one any gpm may have in it upwards to hundred actual goals but theres only one goal for that gpm these others are totally superfluous theyre nothing do you realize that the goal pc sets for session is an actual goal pcs actual goal isnt it and do you know that they will every once in while rocket read and they havent got any items attached to them at all they are probably lock on reliable item someplacejust lousy lock and if you take one of these things as the pcs goalgpmand run it the way you would an actual gpm you can find items oh where do you get them well you pull them in from the nearest implants you pull them out of other gpms you pull them off other locks hey you can just find items items items you can make the beautifulest line plot you ever saw in your life but there was gpm there in the first place now the patter i was using in handling routine 4 was exactly as follows is this an actual gpm this is meter questions and these by the way are just dead accurate on the meter youre just shot in the pants with luck because these things are always correct on the meter theres lot of things you can ask meter such as is this pt goal and things like that thats not accurate it wont give you an accurate response but it will give you dead accurate response on this other information first crack off the box and that saves your bacon you can take thisi was asking these on the meter of course find rocket reading goal see and say is this an actual gpm is this an implant gpm is this gpm and that were the three questions i was using ah fascinating because auditors have been asking is this an actual goal is this an implant goal oh my god what is this well its enough to kill somebody you could frankly just wind somebody up in complete bang with it thats what i mean by the eighteenth of an inch off the tightwire but there was piece of technology missing where the pcs actual goals will rocket read and dont have to have any gpm connected with them its only those goals which have gpms connected to them and have formed gpm that you have any interest in of any kind whatsoever and theyre good nice great big smashing masses withfull of ris and tremendous relief and they explain the aberration of the pc and they can be opposed and so forth you take one of these actual goals it hasnt got any gpm connected with it its just some kind of lock on some ri you know to eat candy you know that thing rocket read do goals opposed list on it ooooh were going to get the pc in mess thats fine lets find another one because well never find an actual gpm listing one against so were going to find another actual goal arent we and then were going to oppose that ohhh and were going to oppose that and we re going to finally find present time actual goal such as to not get infraction sheets you see or something and by god we could sit down and find top oppterm for it thats whats frightening where would we get it well wed have to get it from few trillion billion squillion years ago or wed pull it in from some ri someplace or another or pull it out of the actual present time gpm you see just pull in random rianythingbut usually locks on ris we wouldnt really get ris but theyd fire because they sort of fit you see and you would get nice beautiful line plot all on the pcbut theres gpm that goes with it oh you could probably keep this up for sessions and sessions and sessions and sessions and you could probably get tone arm action and tone arm action and tone arm action well everythings going fine and all of sudden the pc goes deooooooooooboom boom tone arm goes clink pcs starting to develop ulcers of the stomach lumbosis frightening isnt it just varied one word instead of asking is this an actual gpm ask is it an actual goal and youll get read and then suppose that therefore if its an actual goal it has gpm attached to it around the telegraph pole so that much variation in technology but there was missing datum there wasnt there that pcs quote actual goal could actually rocket read its good thing kids that im totally indestructible because these things usually happen to first dont you see its gruesome gruesome couple of weeks ago i was ambitiously listing on one of these things but it didnt feel right and it didnt look right and it didnt oppose right and nothing was going right it was mess and light finally dawned on i generally wake up just as i go down for the third time you know i can see this stream of bubbles over my head and decide id better surface i said youre checking an actual goal youre not checking an actual gpm for gods sakes check this thing for an actual gpm read gpm its the only thing that checks out see oh my god see just little little piece of technology see hardly enough to bother with coo and it can throw curve into the works like that you know you could go on auditing somebody for months with this kind of nonsense and wondering why they werent getting any better and they never have any cognitions and life would just sort of be grim and they wouldnt quite be making much case gainta yes oh yesbut fundamental error in the case just taking them down one after the other the reality getting poorer somethingsomething is happening here that is incorrect see pc arc breaky kind of hard to handle you know little datum like that let show you another datum this is spooky one this is very spooky datum i might as well leave you all grayheaded in the next three minutes which im just about to do lets take level i nothing to learn now in level i is there got it all straight havent we theres our whatsit line see theres your c and and heres whatsit very nice and theres your auditor over here of course you see and heres your pc over here and theres the pc as thetan heres your communication line theres the bank and here is the itsa line c theres your itsa right how many communication lines have i just shown you audience one three how many come on audience three three five six well the drawing right here how many do you see on this drawing audience three you see three well how many do you see in your pc when youre sitting in an auditing session what are the three important communication lines and what is their order of importance some of you are going to say this whatsit line thats the most important some of you are going to say the itsa line and youre wrong its this one onefirst importance twosecond importance threethird importance and anybody who doesnt think that that line is important has got the definition of an auditor wrong its this delicate this is scary when you start looking at the delicacies and nuances of definitions willing to talk to the auditor is very easily interpreted along these ways such as talking to the auditor so the auditor cuts this line to get the pc to talk because it is this line the itsa line of course that blows the charge he says and so cuts the pcs communication with his bankcuts the pcs communication with his bank in order to bring about an itsa line and wonders why he gets tone arm action and why the pc arc breaks because the cut communication line is not perceivable to the naked eye not perceivable to the naked eye because its hidden because the pc is thetan unseen by the auditorto the pcs bank unseen by the auditor which causes the auditor then to basicallyan auditor can do this start running on only line three whatsit and itsaing on the meter see itsas on the meter and whatsit on the pc and therefore has this line cut and this line cut now you see the picture ive just drawn you here this picture taken up carefully with any auditor as to just exactly why this isnt true and just exactly what the score is with regard to this will disclose to some some horrifying data horrifying and they wonder why they havent got tone arm action on the pc tone arm action has to be prevented well this is the basic method of preventing it now here we are basically i am to this degree on the research lineim not telling you im in error because you cant take anything out of whole cloth and then prove it and then continue to say youre in error about itbut im in error to this degree as far as the relay of this information it was not all found out and the evaluation of the importance of these three lines was not totally done this line appeared on your early drawings but was not assigned its level of importance now this is communication breakdown as far as im concerned because of course to that would be all auditing was about trying to get the pc to confront his own bank so id simply neglect to say anything about this and then appear to be laying undue stress on just the itsa line and then anybody looking at this and analyzing it and trying to pick it up and learn it with let us say datum of this particular character you cant ever trust pc to answer an auditing question so therefore you shouldnt get him to look at his bank because if he looks at his bank hell overrestimulate himself wont he so therefore the best thing to do is every time he starts to look at his bank attract his attention to the auditor and get the pc talking hehhehhehhuhbloo you got that now theres probably 87509637342 combinations of reasons why this situation cant occur but once its explained this way and you see it clearly and you understand your way through it the auditor is simply there to get the pc to confront his bank you see the charge blows off of it to the degree that its confronted and this is represented by the itsa line and the itsa line is report on what has been asised that gives it its flow now that sounds perhaps to you like an entirely different explanation of the itsa line its the same factors were dealing with i have just weighted it slightly differently to make better communication now the reason that communication could not be accepted or the reason that communication couldnt go through would be the reason why the auditor is having trouble auditing so im giving you all parts of education now research perception an investigatory perception of the actual truth of the situation with regard to the communication lines present in session the communications lines of auditor to pc on the whatsit and then pc to his bank and then pc to auditor giving us the itsa of course includes its most important partpc to bank but because it goes one two three in sequence were liable to take up that number one is the most important or some other aberrated consideration with regard to it and so auditing would not occur but the breakdown is simply my failure to recognize exactly what these factors were in lucid way and then to communicate it and have media by which to communicate it that would bring this through rapidly and then have it received and you have all points of education and you have technical result occurring if that is done if you dont have that being done you dont have technical result and that is about all there is to be said about it now any auditor who cares to reevaluate or look over his considerations concerning this and why these things cant occur and what really exists here instead of this very simple renditionyou actually would be able to sit down and coach fellow very carefully with this little drawing as elementary as it is and get all the reasons why and et cetera and what pc is liable to do if youand you know and so forth and what really blows the charge and where it actually exists and where it doesnt exist take this all up in full youre going to find whole hat full of aberrated data fall out wrong stresses alterises and that sort of thing thats because youre presented here with relatively pure datum therefore that datum would go through and resolve the rest of the way education then is basically successful to technical end only when it is in very pure comprehensible state and is relayed well first it must be conceived very purely and then it must be relayed well if we were not teaching you toward the final devastating result of did it work on the pc or not if we had that horrible test out of the road then we could teach scientology v and you would be sitting there being very happy to learn all the axioms by heart and straighten it all out and have some cognitions on the thing and everything because the data would never actually be subjected to any final result thats what makes scientology different than any other mental study that has ever occurred somebody comes along and says oh i know what scientology is thats just like taoism just like taoism huh whoever got taod clear or taod better nobody thats the answer to that but its beautiful philosophy and theres great deal of truth connected with it but if this truth is never put to the acid test of performance who cares but your technical gains on your pc depends first and foremost to take responsibility for itfor the purity of the datum which you are given for application and then depends upon your ability to perceive that datum and apply it without great deal of alteris so that it arrives in the direction of the aberration in which the pc is involved in sufficiently pure state to asis and knock out of existence the case that is the aberrated condition which he is confronting that sounds terribly elementary that sounds terribly simple actually it is terribly simple its an action which can only be complicated it can only be complicated it cant much go the other direction but theres the acid test of result now pcno pc is going to resolve in minute because youre up against all the reasons he cant get well but in an auditor who is alterising data which comes his way youre up against all the reasons the data cant be relayed so therefore education to this degree lies in clearing the line get the line cleared up so the datum can be applied that becomes highly important activity and i invite you one and all to look at that little plot there as simple as it is look over those three lines and decide for yourself decide for yourself what the relative values of this thing are or how this thing all adds up and all the reasons why it cant be done or wont work and you suddenly will stop cutting the pcs itsa line and your pc will stop arc breaking and so forth because youve laid out for yourself series of cleareyed understandings with regard to exactly what you are doing it is fundamentals of this particular character which make breakthroughs the itsa line itself is tremendous breakthrough now clarification of the itsa line is absolutely necessary we find out the most important part of this particular communication pattern happens to be totally hidden line where your auditor neglects that hidden line where he doesnt understand that hidden line where he cant integrate it or to do anything with it hes going to fail but as i said that long number i gave you is the number of reasons why and the number of methods why these three lines cant exist and they will be voluminous therefore education also carries with it deeducation and when youre studying on research line you have to become very flexible indeed because you have to deeducate yourself by clarification and understanding of materials you thought existedand so did everybody elseexisted in more complicated state five years ago and youll find one of your great difficulties with an auditor is hes glommed onto and made an all out of one of these old data of some kind or another and hes got it standing there in his road but all of this comes down to one other simple fact that i cant forbear to say anything about even though youre going to be able to come fifteen minutes late tonight and that is simply this datum i give you is substitute for you that is the burning thing to remember as an auditor datum i give you is substitute for you you put datum in an auditing chair and tell it to audit pc and it isnt going to it isnt going to the only thing that can be in an auditing chair is live thetan because only that can handle the communications and confusions which arise now if you have very complicated thetanthis thetan starts doing fortyseven and half other things besides just sitting there handling the situation hes riding on bunch of data but what do you have essentially you have some other data sitting in the auditing chair you didnt know was there so the one thing for which theres substituteyouve got to have technology because nobody was ever able to make breakthrough on it or your technology exists and it exists in fairly pure statewell theres one thing for which theres substitute whatsoever and that is live thetan in the auditors chair and amount of textbooks sitting in the space which he occupies will ever audit the pc and i think you see in that purity of truth i notice that i do best as an auditor when i just sit thereoh i use all the routinesbut when i sit there and i handle the pc in the session and im there and im alert and rolling along down the line and rolling with the punches and shifting this way and that my eye on the situation and i audit worst when im trying out theory because theres theory sitting there see theres theory sitting there well let show you this we do know now that successful session moves the tone arm adequately throughout the session and thats the final test now at higher levels not only will it now move the tone arm but is the auditor proceeding along the line which will continue to move the tone arm and not have it break down somewhere up along the line now thatwere describing level iv because he can get tone arm action on level iv that dumps him over cliff and gives him tone arm action week from now see so we have this final criteria not only is there an acid test of the technology in the field of application but there is also an acid test of an auditor does he know his business
