divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34026defense acquisitions overview issues and options for congress summary department of defense dod efforts to acquire goods and services are often complex and controversial these efforts ar referred to as defense acquisitions the structure dod utilizes to plan execute nd oversee those activities is an intricate and multivariate system of systems composed of the requirements resource allocation and acquisition systems this system of systems has evolved over time its foundation being the re port published by the packard commission in 1986 many of whose recommendations became part of the goldwaternichols department of defense reorganization act of 1986 this evolution continued as the requirements system changed from threatbased to capabilitiesbased system the resource allocation system added execution reviews and concurrent prog rambudget reviews and the acquisition system became flexible tailored process the complexity of this system of systems combined with the magnitude of personnel activities and fundi ng involved in its operation can result in problems including inefficient operations fraudwast eabuse and inadequate implementation or enforcement of the laws and regulations that govern it congress has tried to help mitigate these types of problems and accompan ying issues over the years today there are number of challenging issues th at congress could cons ider to improve the defense acquisition structure some of those issues include defense acquisition transformation costschedul eperformance in major fense acquisition programs mdaps outcomes of costreimbursement contracts interagency and services contracting practices and the defense ac quisition workforce to address cost overruns in mdaps for example congress mig ht consider establishing termination criteria if program reaches an unacceptable cost level supporters might argue such criteria would help prevent goldplating requirements and lowball cost estimates since program breach would guarantee rmination opponents might argue that program termination does not terminate the warfighters requireme nt for fielding necessary warfighting capability and could cause harmful delays by beginning new program to deliver the capability congress is considering several pr ovisions for the fy2009 duncan hunter national defense authorization act h r 5658 including 1 establishing program to ensure that the acquisition wo rkforce attracts quality personnel including requiring minimum number of general and flag officers in th workforce 2 establishing configuration steering boards to contain cost and schedule growth for major defense acquisition prog rams 3 developing conf lict of interest policy for contractors akin to the policy in place for dod civilian

options for congress introduction congress has been concerned with th defense acquisition structure the requirements resources nd acquisition system of systems that provides warfighting capability for many years congressional concern has ranged from microlevel practices such as characteristics of particular contract to macro level practices such as dods management and execution of major defense acquisition programs mdaps1 in response to these concerns congress has legislated many changes to improve the defense acquisition structure and its practices despite these changes cerns remain about the structure and its practices one example of stated congressional concern over the structure and its practices was included in the house armed services committees report on the fy2007 defense authorization bill simply put the department of defense dod acqui sition process is broken the ability of the department to conduct the large scale acquisitions required to ensure our future national security is concern of the committee the rising costs and lengthening schedules of major defense acquisition programs lead to more expensive platforms fielded in fewer numbers the committees concerns extend to all three key components of the acquisition process including requirements generation acquisition and contracting and financial management2 dods process for acquiring goods and rvices is highly complex and does not always produce the desired outcomes some of the weaknesses of the acquisition process include defense acquisition tr ansformation costscheduleperformance problems in mdaps

ure evolved over long period of time since the founding of the nation3 during this time the united states has fielded arguably the most technologica lly superior military force in the world fielding such force has been difficult nd costly as evidenced by numerous reports of cost and schedule or performance failu res in acquisition programs and practices along the way these problems occurred despite efforts to mitigate them such as revisions to dods defense acquis ition policy documents reports and recommendations of numerous commissions studies or panels and efforts to simplify and streamline defense acquisition processes such as congress passage of the federal acquisition regulation system in 1980 and deputy secretary of defense frank carluccis set of 32 initiatives introduced in 1981 the ineffectiveness of previous efforts combined with public reports of dod purchasing 600 toilet seats and 400 hammers4 led president reagan to sign executive order 12526 the president s blue ribbon commission on defense management on july 15 1985 this commission became known as the packard commission after the president designated david packard as its chairman the commission was established to analyze and improve defense mana gement practices specifically including acquisitions the president directed that the commissions first task was to devote its attention to the procedures and activities of the department of defense associated with the procurement of military equipment and materiel5 after the packard commissions repor t was released in june of 1986 its recommendations had high degree of policy significance this was because many of the commissions recommendations were included in the goldwaternichols department of defense reorganization ac t of 1986

one of the three milestones depending on factors such as technological maturity when the capability is required and resources available for th acquisition each stage of the framework has different purposes and entrance criteria which can be regulatory or statutory during concept refinement an initial concept developed during jcids efforts is refined an analysis of alternatives aoa is conducted and technology development strategy tds is develope d based on results from the aoa if program receives milestone approval at the end of cept refinement technology risk reduction efforts outlin ed in

defe nse acquisitions has histor ically presented great challenge for both dod and congress th is challenge was apparent when upon review the packard commissions recomme ndations were virtual mirrorimage of the fitzhugh commission report27 of 1970 in 1989 the house armed services committee held oversight hearings to termine what remaining work dod had to fully implement the commissions recomme ndations it was found that important recommendations such as the jrmb joint requirements manage ment board and milestone budge ting were either never implemented or attempted but quickly abandoned28 some believe that the commission and goldwaternichols efforts were very constructive ma king major contributions in reforming dods acquisition structure and practices others argue however that case can be made that goldwaternichols never implemented the packard commission principles29 and that goldwaternichols reforms attempted but ultimately failed to get at the root of dods acquisition execution problems30 today dod acquisition structure and practice challenges continue as do efforts to improve them major reports three major reports were published between 2005 and 2006

potential issues and options for congress some in congress contend that dod can do more to better its acquisition structure and processes which many see as extremely complex taking into account that sometimes there exist c onflicting objectives for example the highly publicized mine resistant ambush protected mrap vehicle program has been accelerated to be able to field as soon as possible f illing an urgent warfighting operational need the tradeoff in executing an acquisition program on highly accelerated basis however is reduced opportunity to minimiz the life cycle costs of the vehicles through reliability maintainability or production line enhancements in the case of the mrap the urgent operational needs of operational commanders took precedence over the need of dod to minimize the life cycle cost of the platform this section examines some major challenges and issues facing dod to improve its acquisition structure and proce sses one such challenge is in making changes through transformation term inclusive of numerous initiatives to address range of acquisition issues others include costscheduleperformance in major defense acquisition programs mdaps outco mes of cost reimbursement contracts interagency and service cont racting practices and the fense acquisition workforce the challenges and issues are examined below along with potential options congress could pursue to address them defense acquisition transformation dods current defense acquisition transfor mation efforts are in their infancy the strategic goals implementation plan sgip was first produced in september 2006 and many of the initiatives are s till underway additionally dod submitted their first section 804 report to congress in february 2007 the infancy of dods acquisition transformation raises three stions congress might consider 1 when is it probable that acquisition transforma tion would succeed 2 how will congress know that acquisition transformation s succeeded 3 what impact will the departure of the usdatl and the vice chairman of the joint chiefs of staff have on acquisition transforma tion to help address those questions congress could consider the following options establish statutor acquisition transformation plan s m analysts point out that dods acquisition reforms lack clear benchmarks against which to m easure success congress could set specific transformation requirements with detailed completion criteria so that dod has define d end state to work towards supporters could argue that such plan would ensure acquis ition transformation is not impeded by changes in senior leadership supporters could also argue th at acquisition transformation can occur more rapidly if an end st ate is known and specific actions can be planned and implemented to achieve defined end state opponents could argue that estab lishing such plan removeshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34026crs20 flexibility from dod and the plan c ould easily become obsolete and ineffective due to unforeseen even ts opponents could also argue that efforts to determine what improvements shoul d be made are ongoing and deciding which one s should be implemented at one point in time risks unintended consequences that could be avoided through current dod efforts establish dates to complete acquisition transformation congress could require that all improvements dod intends to make via its acquisition transformation efforts be accomplished by prescribed dates so that tran sformations effectiveness may be captured and evaluated supporte rs could argue that defining completion date will accelerate the pace of improvements and allow dod to focus more quickly on promising initiatives and cancelling problematic ones supporters c ould also argue that establishing timelines will create benchmarks ag ainst which to measure success opponents could argue that setting date could discourage or inhibit continuous improvement efforts as way to constantly transform opponents could also argue that dod may execute lower number or less effective improvements than would be optimal so that the deadline could be met establish performance criteria for dods entire acquisition structure individual defense acqui sition programs have cost schedule and technical performan ce objectives and thresholds that collectively define program perfo rmance however dods defense acquisition structure does not appear to have similar standard for performance congress could blish such standard which dods acquisition structure must m eet or operate within so that transformation efforts ve defined goals supporters could argue that establishing such criteria or metrics may allo w dod to maintain tradeoff flexibility within the pe rformance parameters supporters could also argue that such parameters could serve as useful link between the defense acquisition structure and the warfighting capabilities of the nation opponents could argue that such parameters would add new and co mplex tracking reporting and management requirements that w ould impair structural performance opponents could also argue that criteria or metrics could either change so frequently or become obsolete due to many factors that dod may never be able to meet targets or if dod did that they would longer be the best ones require dod to develop risk management techniques to help with its acquisition transformation many programs and projects in both government and industry ex perience failure risk is term often used to represent the chances that program or project may fail due to any number of factors dods approach towards acquisition transformation arguably similar to weapon system that attempts to concurrently develop and integrate number of immature technologies may have risks that necessitate the use of riskhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34026crs21 50 the gao submits annual reports of many dod mdaps the most recent report is defense acquisitions assessments of

computer entertainm ent europe regarding the european launch delay at httpwwwsceepresscentrecomcontentdetailaspreleaseid4268news areaid2management to ensure success to date dod has not published risk assessment or risk management plan for its acquisition transformation efforts congress could require dod to use this approach in its acquisition transformation efforts to ensure that mitigation plans exist if and when problems or challenges are encountere d supporters could argue that requiring risk management will ensure that dod develops alternatives to the initiatives currently being pursued in the event one or many of those initiatives fail supporters could also argue that risk management will ensure detailed planning and tracking of initiative and transformation progress opponents could argue that dod must identify risks and obstacles before fully engaging ri sk management practices which is why dod is initially using experiment s and trial initiatives to pursue improvement opponents could also argue that risk management could impair the pace of improveme nt through additional tracking reporting and management activities cost schedule and performance in major defense acquisition programs mdaps cost overruns schedule slips and perfo rmance shortfalls have plagued large weapon system acquisition programs since wo rld war ii despite statutory reporting requirements on regular basi s and when cost or schedule problems occur current mdaps continue to experience overruns s lips and shortfalls during their execution50 observers have identified range of contributing factor s to these problems including requirement and funding in stability less then optimal knowledge at decision points and technology immaturity among others some may argue that some level of each problem is unavoidable due to dods longstanding practice of pursuing technological superiority over all potential threats some could also point out that even private industry experiences similar i ssues such as the well publicized wiring problems with the airbus a380 aircraft or component problem s and shortages with sonys playstation 3 video gaming console51 however others may argue that dod has experienced the same problems for over 50 years and that controls should be in place by now to prevent more occurrences to address the challenges of reduc ing future mdap execution problems congress might consider the following optionshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34026crs22 52 for example data provided by dod indicates that only three programs with nunn mccurdy unit cost breaches not caused by cancellation since 2000 have been cancelled by dod air force b1 defense system upgrade program dsup navy area theater ballistic missile defense tbmd and army tactical missile systembr illiant antiarmor submunition atacmsbat congressional cancellations in general are rare and are usually due to many issues which may or ma not include cost schedule and performance problems examples include the meads pr ogram in 1998 the seawolf submarine program in 1996 and the xm803 main battle tank program in 1971require dod to send more information to congress prior to mdap initiation currently prior to the formal initiation of an mdap dod performs range of analyses prepares related documentation and holds tiered seri of reviews prior to initiation of an mdap dod is not required to deliver that information to congress although program mmary and limited characteristics of the initiated program are outlined in the selected acquisition reports sars congress coul d require dod to propose mdaps to congress in manner that is similar in detail as defense contractors who respond to request s for proposals rfps so that congress could openly discuss impor tant programs early and make any potential necessary changes supporters could argue that such construct would enhance program stability by ensuring program changes in areas such as requirements or funding are only made when necessary supporters could also argue that poorly structured or high risk mdaps would be prevented from initiation or at least monitored more closely pponents could argue that dod best knows what it needs and how to manage it opponents could also argue that the time necessary to initiate an mdap may increase and therefore delay the timely fielding of necessary capability to the warfighter establish congressional mdap termination criteria neither statute nor policy requires the cance llation of an mdap due to cost schedule or performance problems dod is required to certify to congress that program needs to continue if the unit cost of an mdap exceeds certain threshold both dod and congress have the option of terminating programs that experience these problems but have rarely done so52 congress could establish mdap termination criteria such that if cost schedule or performance measure met or breached the criteria the program would automatically cancel supporters coul d argue that such criteria could help prevent requirements gold plating and lowball cost estimates or proposals since program breach would guarantee termination supporters could also argue that fiscal responsibility in dod could be enhanced since movi ng funding around to new or re prioritized programs could cause others to terminate opponents could argue that program ter mination does not terminate the requirement and the fielding of warfighting capability would be delayed due to the cancellation and start of new program to deliver capability httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34026crs23 53 matrix comparing characteristics of each contract type can be found at http wwwacqosdmildpa pcontractpricingvol4chap1htm11 54 the defense federal acquisition regu lation supplement dfars section 235006 permits the use of fixedprice contract types for certain procurement types including those typically associated with mdaps such use requires the approval of the usdatl see httpfarsitehillafmilvfdfarahtm 55 for additional information on the lcs see crs report rl33741 navy littoral combat ship lcs program oversight issues and options for congress by ronald orourke 56 10 usc 2306b an myp is particular type of contract where dod agrees to buy many years of goods or services at once committing future congresses to fund the contract in the agreedupon manner whereas multiple ear contract is where the goods or services may be procured over multiple years but only th first year is guaranteed to be bought an myp guarantees all years will be bought unless the contract is terminatedoutcomes of cost reimbursement contracts the two types of contracts most comm only used for the procurement of goods and services in the federa l government including dod are costreimbursement and fixedprice53 fixedprice contracts are typically used in procurements that are judged to have little or manageable risk whereas costreimbursement contracts are typically used in procurements that are judg ed to have more significant risk history shows that developmental fforts procured for major defense acquisition programs mdaps are among those procurements that are commonly judged to have the most significant risk and therefore justify the use of costreimbursement contracts54 costreimbursement contr acts have come under renewed scrutiny as an example as result of the department of the navys termination of its cost reimbursement contract for the third littoral combat ship lcs that was being built by lockheedmartin55 this contract was terminated due to significant escalation in the cost of the ship and the inability of the navy and lockheedmartin to agree on modification to change the contract from costreimbursement to fixedprice for the ships completion in order to better control costs many experts believe the desire for technological superiority in dod weapon systems and military capabilities arguably necessitates the continued use of cost reimbursement contracts because of the ri sks involved in developing such cutting edge technology to improve the outco mes of such contracts congress could consider the following options require congressional approval to use costreimbursement contracts currently dod may not award multiyear procurement myp contract that exceeds 500m unless certain statutory criteria are met and authority is provided in an appropriations act56 congress could consider similar construct for dods use of costreimburseme nt contracts which meet or exceed specific criteria and exceed set threshold supporters could argue that with additional appr oval authority congress could gain additional insight into the details surrounding the costhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34026crs24 reimbursement contract supporters could also argue that an approval requirement could promote more technology demonstrations and other ri sk reduction activities by dod opponents could argue that congress already approves such contracts since dod discloses certain contract information in the budget material delivered to cong ress opponents could also argue that acquisition programs could be significantly delayed while waiting for congressional approval or in the event of disapproval require costreimbursement contracts to convert to fixedprice contracts as risk is reduced when dod awards cost reimbursement contract the contract typically remains cost reimbursement throughout its life ev as efforts are completed as these efforts are completed however the uncertainty in contractors tasks is reduced and risk is ssened congress could require that upon accomplishment of certain events or criteria that remaining effort be converted to fixedpr ice to complete remaining efforts under the contract since the level of risk remaining may longer support continued use of costre imbursement cont ract supporters could argue that as contract is performed more knowledge is gained and eventually there is insufficient risk inherent in remaining performance to justify continuing the costreimbursement arrangement supporters could so argue that conversion would better prepare contractors for fixe dprice followon or development toproduction procurements ho wever opponents could argue that funding regulations could preven t such conversion as cost reimbursement contract s may be incrementally funded while fixed price contracts must be fully funded which may force dod to guess when the accomplishments may happen to ensure that full funding is available opponents c ould also argue that the costs in terms of time complexity and additional planning to segregate cost reimbursement and fixedprice fforts would outweigh any potential benefits of such conversion require contractors to submit both costreimbursement contract proposal and fixe dprice contract proposal to quantify contract performance risk when dod determines the level of risk inherent in an effort factors such as schedule requirements level of detail in technical perform ance requirements and the technical maturity of th system and its components are typical considerations however quantifying those risks in terms of dollars can be nearly impossible without feedback from prospective contractors regarding what contr acts value would be for different contract types to help quantify the difference between cost reimbursement development contract and fixedprice development contract congress could require dod to acquire proposals of both types when procuring developmental efforts supporters could argue that only contractors proposal ffers sufficient data to measure how much risk is inherent in pa rticular effort supporters could also argue this approach could s pur industry to identify other riskshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34026crs25 that may not have been apparent to the government and result in better contract type lection opponents could argue that the costs and time associated with the prep aration of two proposals and their evaluation outweighs the potentia l benefits of the additional information opponents could so argue that this may make competitive procurements impossible as it would be impossible to fairly evaluate multiple offerors on standard set of criteria establish costreimbursement corps and training program to execute and manage major cost type contracts cost type contracts whereby contractors are paid for costs incurred as spelled out in the contract in crease the risks of cost overruns because the contractor does not have financial incentive to contain costs rigorous and effective c ontract management and oversight can reduce the cost risk to the government congress could consider establishing program that would produce certified acquisition experts in cost type contracts s upporters could argue that cost type contracts pose significant cost risk to government that justifies creating specialized workforce that possesses the contract management and oversight skills necessary to maintain fiscal discipline opponents could argue th at the factors leading to cost overruns in cost type contracts ar result of complex technologies and other factors not the adequ acy of the acquisition workforce opponents could also argue that the appropriate remedy for cost overruns in such contracts is not to increase training for cost type contracts but to increase the use of fixedprice contracts supporters could counter that in certain ci rcumstances and with effective management of the contractor co st type contract s could be less expensive that fixed price contracts for example in research and development contracts where neither the contractor nor the government knows how much work will be required fixed price contract will factor into its cost th risk to the contractor of the work being more intensive than estimated however in cost type contract the government only pays for the work actually performed thereby saving the government money if the work is completed quicker or more efficiently than estimated interagency and servi ces contracti ng practices two particular types of contracting that have come unde r renewed scrutiny recently are interagency contracting and services contracting interagency contracting is process where dod uses the contracts of other federal agencies to procure goods or services from private i ndustry dod typically uses these contracts to save time or money or both compared to using its own contract vehicles dod procures services from private industry when dod does not ve sufficient numbers or expertise within its civil service staff to accomplish department needs or believes time or money could be saved compared to using civil servants or finally if the need is temporary and does not justify hiring permanent employee in recent years dod has significantly increased spending on service acquisitions from fy1996 to 2005httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34026crs26 57 gao gao0720 defense acquisitions tailored approach needed to improve service acquisition outcomes

billion to over 141 billion respectively57 the gao and department of defens inspector general dodig have published reports on poor practices in dods interagency contracting and dod services contracting as distinct from equipment contracting practices58 some of the problems noted in the reports include the following circumventing numerous procuremen t and funding regulations the gao and dodig reports cited exam ples including inadequate competition issuing task orders out side the scope of the overarching contracts inadequate justificati on of actions and potential violations of the antideficiency act ada insufficient management oversight capacity and practices the gao and dodig reports cited examples such as some contracts not having oversight personnel assigned to them some were without quality assurance surveillance plan and increased managerial difficulty in those contracts where the requiring agency dod is not also the contracting agency although the problems raised by the gao and dodig reports can contribute to undesirable and costly outcomes in interagency and services contracting it is unclear whether they directly or indirectly re sulted in fraudulent wasteful or abusive practices by government or contractor personnel in october 2006 dod published new acquisition of services policy59 in response to section 812 of the fiscal ear 2006 national defens authorization act hr 1815pl 109163 this policy tablished new require ments for services acquisitions including the following standards and procedures fo r all services acquisitions new management

_gsa_moadocdod has not published an interagency contracting or interagency acquisition policy similar to its acquisition of services policy nor has it been required to do so however dod has entered into new morandum of agreement moa with the general services administration gsa which outlines 22 objectives to achieve acquisition excellence60 it is currently unclear whether dods ne w acquisition of services policy or its moa with the gsa will improve dods in teragency and services contracting practices in addition to congressiona l oversight on these new dod initiatives congress could consider dditional options to improve other aspects of these contracting practices including the following establishing services acquisition corps and training program the size and capabilities of the entire defense acquisition workforce is an issue congress could consid er and is discussed in later section however services acqui sition and oversight present unique size and capability challenges to the acquisition workforce responsible for such actions dod has training courses for services acquisition and oversight but does not have curriculum or program dedicated to producing services acquisition and oversight experts congress could consider establishi ng such program that would produce certified services acquisiti on personnel supporters could argue that services acquisition is so complex that only specialized detailed training program with g raduation criteria is adequate to ensure dod has sufficient expertise to protect taxpayer and dod interests supporters could also argue that the establishment and maintenance of such cadre of experts is the only way to institutionalize services acquisition best practices however opponents could argue that most dod services acquisitions are executed well and current or emerging challenges can be addressed through updated training courses opponents could also argue that career opportunities for corps memb ers could become limited due to the specialized nature of their work require quantitative costbenefit analysis for each services or interagency procurement action and establish minimum savings criteria one of the most common rationales used by dod to procure service or to use an inte ragency contract is the savings in time or dollars such use will gene rate for the requiring component compared to using internal resources to fulfill its requirements dod is not currently required to discretely estimate and capture these cost or schedule savings to support such procurement decision congress may consider establishing minimum cost or schedule savings criteria and the documentation of specific costbenefit analysis to ensure that those criteria are met to pursue service or interagency contract supporters could argue that such requirement is the only way for congress to ensure that dodhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34026crs28 actually saves significant time or money through the use of such procurement actions supporters could also argue that this requirement will help ensure that thorough market research is performed for procurement ac tion but opponents could argue that the cost and time necessary to perform the analysis may consume any potential cost or sche dule benefit from the procurement of service or use of an intera gency contract opponents could also argue that dod may forego substan tial savings in procurement and cause procurement to be unnecessa rily expensive or lengthy only because it didnt meet minimum sa vings criteria opponents could also argue that agencies often cont ract out for services because they lack the authority to hire enough ftes full time employees to perform the work inhouse limit the amount of funding that may be used for the acquisition of services or the use of interagency contracts each services acquisition or procuremen t through an interagency contract can have its own sets of adva ntages and disadvantages the advantages and disadvantages of an individual action when weighed against each other may not obvious ly indicate whether the action is prudent or not to avoid questiona ble use of these actions congress could consider limiting the amount of funding used for them supporters could argue that such restriction would incentivize dod to only pursue those that produced the greatest benefit supporters could also argue that dod would be incentivized to better plan and analyze potential actions to gauge advantages and disadvantages opponents could argu that such restriction would limit the flexibility of program managers and contracting officers to meet component needs opponent s could also argue that such restriction could result in increas ed cost or time to dod since some procurements may be forced into costlier or more timeconsuming vehicle or process to meet dod requirements require dod or gao report on actual benefits of services acquisition and int eragency contracting despite the scrutiny that each of these practices has received data appears available to judge whether procuring services or using interagency contracts is actually saving dod time or money compared to using comparable internal resources congress ma consider requiring dod or the gao to investigate and report on whet her savings in either category have been realized and if so qua ntify how much those savings were supporters could argue that legisl ative or policy actions to improve these practices could be better informed by rigorous analysis of whether dod has benefitted from thei r use supporters could also argue that such study could be good way to evaluate the effectiveness of current statute and policy opponents could argue that capturing such data may be prohibitively expensive and difficult given personnel turnover

contracting would not be reflected in the data therefore making the data set obsolete the defense acquisition workforce61 the size and capabilities of the defense acquisition workforce has been subject of much debate for over 15 years some believe the defense acquisition workforce is undersized and incapable to do all that is asked by dod evidenced by poor performance in both acquisition programs and iraq reconstruction efforts62 the current under secretary of fense for acquisition technology and logistics usdatl has made high performing ethical and agile workforce his number one goal63 the atl human capital strategic plan hcsp64 is the usdatls plan to achieve this objective the hcsp consists of five goals each of which are refined into enabling objectives outcomes and measures for example one of the hcsps goals is to establish comprehensive datadriven workforce analysis and decisionmaking capability to achieve this goal dod is pursuing improvements in the metrics and data that quantify the capabilities needs and characteristics of the acquisition workfor ce dod is also pursuing improvements in the information systems that capture and analyze the metrics and data along with making the metrics and data more transparent to enable workforce leadership to better plan and decide on departmental strategy the hcsp appears quite comprehensive and the linkage of goals all the way back to metrics appears sound however the details of how each link is measure appear vague and the hcsp does not appear to outline how these goals and supporting linkages will improve acqui sition programs and practices some options congress may consider to improve the defense acquisition workforce include the following increase the size of the defense acquisition workforce during the 1990s congress required dod to reduce the size of its acquisition workforce as result of perceived peace dividendhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34026crs30 65 report of the acquisition advisory panel to the office of federal procurement policy and the united states congress p 3from the 1991 gulf war by 2000 the acquisition workforce contracted by almost 5065 however despite significant increases in defense spending over the last decade the acquisition workforce has remained relatively stable resulting in fewer people managing ever greater workloads at time when many contracts are becoming more complex dods current high level of operational requirements may invite congre ssional action to authorize an increase in the size of dods acqui sition workforce supporters of such an increase could argue that the cost of the additional workforce would be outweighed by probable benefits such as reduced cost overruns on acquisiti on programs and more reasonable pricing and delivery on procured hardware nd services supporters could also argue that larger workforce could be better prepared to handle future unexpected contin gency operations where demand on the acquisition

evolutionary history of the defense acquisition structure prior to goldwaternichols the evolution of the defense acquisition structure can be generally categorized into three distinct periods the revolutionary war to world war ii world war ii to the goldwaternichols act and the goldwaternichols act to the present while each period experienced challenges unique to their times each also exhibited some characteristics that one could argue are similar to varying degrees and are useful in consideration of defense acqui sition issues today the fi rst two periods are discussed below while the third is discussed in the main body of this report revolutionary war to world war ii in comparison to the other two eras in the evolution of the defense acquisition structure there is relatively little documented analysis or examination of the structure during this time period such limited informa tion appears to have been due to four principal reasons first was political environment unfavorable to focused analysis of defense acquisition evidenced by strong antimilitary sentiments that dominated public attitudes from the time of independence until pearl harbor and americans focusing on the militarys technical skills producing an overem phasis on engineering and science75 second for most of our history pr ior to 1940 the federal budget was balanced except in years of war or economic recession76 third and possibly as an acknowledgment of the shortcomin gs in engineering and science until world war ii weapons acquisition in the united states was more political than military problem shield ed from large external threats the country had pressing need for sophis ticated weapons with few exceptions it was content to let european militaries ta ke the lead in developing and fielding new weaponry77 finally while there were instances of fraud and waste during the era occurrences of cost overruns or other poor performance in the execution of major programs as have been experienced since wwii appear evident the lack of such instances of poor major program performance may be primarily due to the fact that prior to wwii the us defense industry was made up of mix of public arsenalshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34026crs39 78 bair edward t defense acquisition reform behind the rhetoric of reform landmark commissions lessons learned the industrial college of the armed forces national defense university 1992 p 5 79 mcnaugher p 67 80 locher notes that the antimilitary attitudes of the nation ended with the pearl harbor attack pages 16 and 18 81 reeves p 10 82 bair p 5and ad hoc private efforts to produce weapons systems78 the combination of the environmental characteristics described above gave the public and therefore congress little reason to devote attention to the structure however that involatile mix did not completely stif congressional action desp ite such an environment legislators worried on the one hand that private industrialists would rob the federal treasury by charging high prices for shoddy weapons yet they sought on the other that the industrialists in th eir own states and districts got their fair share or more of the military contracts there were to be won79 congress appeared to have been aware of issues relating to such basic conflict but taking significant action appeared to require significant catalyst usually time of war or national economic distress in 1809 congress first called for competition in government contracting in 1861 the fi rst commission to study defense acquisition fraud was formed which was followed by numerous related commissions through the early 1900s and the 1930s saw congress focus intensely on the concept of government procurement fo r socioeconomic benefit the era prior to wwii was one of infanc for the defense ac quisition structure while there was little to distinguish the ch allenges of the structure with those of federal government acquisiti on overall the structures s ubsequent evolutionary eras would bring about significant change world war ii to the goldwaternichols act nearly every factor influencing and shaping the defense acquisition environment changed just after wwii not only were the nations antimilitary sentiments reversed due to the attack on pearl harbor80 but the existence of and potential for external threats to the nation became cemented add itionally the emergence of the cold war presented the us with persistent international security threat the real enemy was always the spread of communism be yond the soviet periphery likewise weapons systems would now be develope d almost exclusivel against soviet threat counterpart81 not only did the us have persistent international enemy but the enemys characteristics forced w eapons system development down road in which the perceived cold war imperative to attain qualitative superiority ensured that stateoftheart technological advances would be applied rapidly to weapons systems capabilities82 in contrast with the previ ous defense acquisition landscapehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34026crs40 83 przemieniecki js acquisition of defense systems american institute of aeronautics and astronautics 1993

emphasis was on simplicity reliability and producibility83 although just before this era deficits returnedand remained for the rest of the decade due to the great depression and the spending associated with president roosevelts new deal it was world war ii that forced the nation to spend unprecedented amounts on defense and to incur corresponding unprecedented deficits84 now not only was the american public intensely interested in defense activities due to the soviet threat but it also became interested in how the nations resources were being applied especially in the defense sector of the economy in fact the first of three questions one scholar notes rega rding the resolution of budget deficits is how much should we spend on nationa l defense versus domestic programs85 the guns vs butter debate has been significant political topic since the nation was founded and this very debate led to the beginning of the end of the reagan administrations increases in defense spending as by the mid1980scongress stopped the buildup with the budget deficit soaring and with important domestic needs going unmet members of congress argued that the nation could longer afford the reagan administrations ambitious plans86 one final contributing factor to the defense acquisition environment was the establishment and maintenance of perm anent domestic defens industrial base however for this establishment to occur th ere had to be market for its products as catalyst this market was born when the comparatively small and unsophisticated us peacetime militia envisioned by the federalists and the us constitution was becoming permanent large peacetime force supporting this force was an even larger industry dedicated to developing and producing sophisticate d technologically superior weapons these developments began the hothouse environment of military research and development that produced the intern ational arms race militaryindustrial complexes here and abroad and the expansion of military interests into new realms such as computers communi cations spaceflight microelectronics astrophysics and host of other fields87 in sum number of factors contributed to the defense acquisition structure becoming significant issue not just to those directly involved in its oversight or practice but significant issue in the nations political landscape acquisitionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34026crs41 88 kettl p 39programs and practices became more complex more costly and more prominent than at any time in the nations history president eisenhower recognized this development relatively early on and warned of milita ryindustrial complex that would demand huge share of america s wealth to perpetuate its power88 the environmental factors discussed above in combin ation with other factors such as the advent of joint military operations and organizational change within the military thrust the defense acquisition structure into greater role in national debate the results of the defense acquisition structure appear to have served as springboard for characteristic of this era that has perpetuated into defense acquisition today the use of commissions studies or panels to cure the ills of the defense acquisition structure
