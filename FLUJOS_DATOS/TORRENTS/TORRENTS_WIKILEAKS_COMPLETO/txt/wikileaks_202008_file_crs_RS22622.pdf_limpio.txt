g343g561n the 1970s series of lawsuits began challenging the funding disparities among school districts within the states1 schools in the us which typically receive some federal and state financial assistance generally derive substantial percentage of their funding from local property taxes which at least in the early days of education finance litigation generated significantly different levels of funding depending on how much the property in given district was worth spurred by concerns that such disparities discriminated against students in poor school districts or resulted in an inadequate education school finance plaintiffs began filing lawsuits in federal and state courts based on theories involving educational equity or adequacy 2 in the most prominent federal case on school financing san antonio independent school district v rodriguez 3 the supreme court rejected legal challenge to texass system of public financing for its elementary and secondary schools holding that the state finance system did not violate equal protection or interfere with fundamental right ultimately the rodriguez case which clarified that school funding disparities were not federal issue foreclosed school finance claims based on the us constitution and prompted plaintiffs to file lawsuits based on state constitutional claims thereby transforming education finance litigation into an issue of state law this memorandum discusses the rodriguez case and the resulting flurry of state education finance litigation including the dominant legal theories of equity and adequacy and the leading cases in each of these areas g8g142g141g142g155g138g149g561g5g152g158g155g157g561g138g151g141g561g157g145g142g561 g20g152g141g155g146g144g158g142g163 g561g5g138g156g142g561 in rodriguez the original plaintiffs in the case challenged the texas state system of public financing for elementary and secondary schools which they claimed to be violation of the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment4 because funding under the system which was based on local property taxes discriminated against students in less affluent school districts and interfered with the students fundamental right to education the supreme court rejected both of these arguments holding that the state fina nce system did not violate equal protection or interfere with fundamental right 5 under the supreme courts equal protection jurisprudence the general rule is that legislation is presumed to be valid and will be sustained if the classification drawn by the statute is rationally 1 for

g344g561related to legitimate state interest6 although laws that are based on suspect classifications such as race or gender or that interfere with fundamental right typically receive heightened scrutiny and require stronger if not compelling state interest to justify the classification or infringement the rodriguez court however concluded that the texas financing system did not discriminate against any definable category of poor people or result in the absolute deprivation of education and therefore held that there was impermissible classification based on wealth and discrimination against suspect class 7 likewise the court found that the constitution did not explicitly or implicitly guarantee right to education and that there was evidence that the texas financing system resulted in an education so inadequate that it interfered with the ability to exercise other fundamental constitutional rights8 the courts holding that there was discrimination against suspect class and interference with fundamental right was important because it determined the degree of judicial scrutiny that the texas financing system received had the court found violation of equal protection or infringement of fundamental right then th texas school funding system would have been subject to strict scrutiny and the state would have been required to offer compelling state interest as justification for the system in the absence of such finding however the texas financing system was subject to rational basis review under that standard the court upheld the state funding system as rationally related to the legitimate state interest of maintaining local control over matters involving education and taxation 9 g21g157g138g157g142g561g5g152g158g155g157g156g561 as noted above the rodriguez case foreclosed school finance claims based on the federal constitution and prompted plaintiffs to file lawsuits based on state constitutional claims instead thereby transforming education finance litigation into an issue of state law this section discusses the two major legal theories involved in state education finance litigationequity and adequacyas well as leading cases in these areas g7g154g158g146g157g162g561g5g138g156g142g156g561 initially litigants in school finance cases focused on the issue of equity arguing that the funding disparities among school districts were inequitable the plaintiffs in these cases contended that such inequities were unconstitutional and should be remedied by equalizing funding among all school districts although the us supreme court had rejected arguments based on the equal protection clause of the us constitution advocates for school financing reform typically based their new legal claims on equal protection provisions found within the constitutions of individual states for example in serrano v priest which is the most prominent example of an equitybased education finance claim the supreme court of california held that the state finance system for public schools violated the equal protection provisions in the california constitution because 6 city of cleburne v cleburne living center 473 us 432 440 1985 7 rodriguez 411 us at

wealth involves suspect classification and education is fundamental interest10 although an equitybased litigation strategy was effective in some of the early cases the difficulties of actually achieving equal educational opportunity through the fiscal neutrality principle as well as political resistance to judicial attempts to enforce court orders in the initial fiscal equity cases seem to have dissuaded other state courts from venturing down this path despite an initial flurry of proplaintiff decisions in the mid1970s by the mid1980s the pendulum had decisively swung the other way plaintiffs won only two decisions in the early 80s and as of 1988 15 of the state supreme courts had denied any relief to the plaintiffs compared to the seven states in which plaintiffs had prevailed 11 in part this shift may have occurred because state courts and legislatures experienced implementation difficulties when attempting to equalize funding among school districts and because court decisions that required equal resources did not necessarily ensure equal or adequate educational opportunities12 as result of this diminished success with equitybased claims plaintiffs in school financing cases began brin ging school finance claims based on adequacy theories instead g3g141g142g154g158g138g140g162g561g5g138g156g142g156g561 although state courts continued to analyze education finance cases in terms of equal protection the courts gradually began to examine other considerations notably arguments regarding educational adequacy specifically rather than rely on the argument that school funding disparities were violation of equal protection some plaintiffs began arguing that inadequate funding levels resulted in violation of state constitutional provisions that guaranteed an adequate education most of these claims were based on provisions found in virtually all state constitutions that require states to establish system of free public schools and provide students with thorough efficient or adequate education 13 for example in the early case robinson v cahill the supreme court of new jersey interpreted state constitutional provision that required the legislature to provide for thorough and efficient system of free public schools and the court concluded that we do not doubt than an equal educational opportunity for children was precisely in mind and the obligation is the states to rectify 14 as result the court ruled that the new jersey school finance system was unconstitutional but left it to the legislature to devise solution that would compel localities to provide equal educational opportunities to their students in another significant adequacy case rose v council for better education the supreme court of kentucky evaluated the claim that the state education financing scheme was inadequate and therefore violation of state constitutional provision that requires the legislature to provide for an efficient system of common schools15 10

g346g561the court not only found such violation but held that kentuckys entire system of common schools is unconstitutional16 because the entire system is underfunded and inadequate and fraught with inequalities and inequities17 the court then held that every child must be provided with an equal opportunity to have an adequate education and set forth educational standards to define what constitutes an adequate education18 currently state education finance litigation typically involves adequacybased claims as one commentator notes adequacy has become the predominant theme of the recent wave of state court decisions because the adequacy approach resolves many of the legal problems that had arisen in the early fiscal equity cases and because it provides the courts judicially manageable standards for implementing effective remedies19 regardless of whether such lawsuits involve equity or adequacy theories education finance litigation has thus far been brought in 45 out of 50 states 20 g3g158g157g145g152g155g561g5g152g151g157g138g140g157g561g11g151g143g152g155g150g138g157g146g152g151g561 jody feder legislative attorney jfedercrslocgov 78088 16 id at 215 17 id at 197 18
