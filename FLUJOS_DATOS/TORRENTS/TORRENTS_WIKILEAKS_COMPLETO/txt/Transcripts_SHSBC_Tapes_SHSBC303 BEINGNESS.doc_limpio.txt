beingness lecture given on 18 june 1963 well this is the what audience eighteenth june 18th june 18th good you made it to june 18th 1963 i want you to know this you made it to this date isnt that good news audience yes yeah yeah all right well i havent anything to talk to you about today but the main thing is that the subject is so vast that im just defeated by trying to know where to start in to give you the bad news about it its too bad the time track is long now ivethe exact date has momentarily slipped my mind but apparently the overtmotivator sequencewhat is it suzie female voice trillion trillion trillion yeah the overtmotivator sequence is trillion trillion trillion years ago less about hundred thousand trillion female voice less one hundred thousand yeah less onehundred thousand trillion you figure out the date i sat in session last night trying to figure this date out and i couldnt get it anyway its long track isnt it lot of track and we got just the process necessary to take it apart i hate to have to tell you that but youve been holding on to this track you know for long time nursing it caressing it hiding it missing it notconfronting it and being unwilling to be it for very long time and until we could get basic kickoff for cases that couldnt confront time track until i got that unsnarled i hadnt really been paying too much attention to the time track at large and the main difficulty with the time track and its use in auditing is the fact that you have so many cases that cant confront time track or any part of it so this gives you auditor losesif the only technique you had was engram running so it has taken many many years about eleven years to get an orientation on what we were about and like all very simple problems it absolutely exceeds the complexity of ones own wits by its simplicity and what weve been doing has been accumulating processes which brought somebody up scale to point where they could view the time track now thats the only thing weve been doing now its quite amusing when you get down to it that this is terribly simple statement isnt it well actually if all wed done in eleven years was just be able to make that statement why they would have been eleven years well spent but more than that has been done tremendous number of processes have been developed and accumulated and only recently were these processes codified and our biggest breakthroughs whatever these things appear to be as breakthroughs have been on more fundamental front theyheres the fundamental of what are we trying to do with the case now heres your ultimate procedureits roteengram running its an ultimate procedure as far as homo sapiens is concerned but the problem with it was that not everybody could do it therefore the subject itself has had to be very rapidly but by means hastily wrapped up and we have today rote engram running its quite remarkable and you must understand that this engram running is superior to anything we have ever done in this particular direction and listen to now bears relationship whatsoever to any engram running we have ever done you understand that because you will have to make that point stick here there and everyplace because youre going to run into an oldtimer sitting down in phoenix and he knows how to run engrams you fill somebody up full of peyote and the guy daydreams for half an hour while you snap your fingers at him you know he knows how to run engrams hes never going to run engrams that way you see because were not running engrams were running engrams by chain just to open up and smooth out the time track andbut the only reason were doing anything about engrams at all is because those are the parts of the time track which are least confrontable and if you get rid of those stretches then the pcs got time track see thats all youre just picking the worst parts of the time track to get rid of but heres the horror of it is the worst part of the time track denies anyone the best part of the time track so you see you have choice but to do the worst part of the time track thats thewhich is of course the engrammoments of pain and unconsciousness thats the only thing you can address on the time track because as long as they exist time track exists see its one of these things that you dont have any walnuts unless you have some walnuts you know i mean its one of those idiotic statements see if you dont get rid of the engrams you havent got any time track see because the confrontability of the time track is denied to the pc by the engrams unless you get those engrams out of the way why he cant confront his track there you are now this sets up innumerable problems sets up innumerable problems because the more heavily charged the track is the less the pc can confront it and there is point when the pc moves out from any confrontability of the engram and of course theres nothing now to confront at all nothing you therefore have this scale of cases the i to 8 ease levels and youve got your operating thetan and then youve got number two youra person with cleaned up time track got clean time track then youve got person with sporadic visio is number three and youve got what we call black five is number four see were getting further and further now from afrom confrontability of mental image pictures and events and youve got number five this guy cant confront it to the degree that if he tries to confront it he makes picture of it so that he can confront the picture of it hes got picture of picture and youve got six whos got picture of picture of picture and then youve got another harmonic of time track at all at level 7 which is of course evaluation of own opinions the fellow never confronts really anything now you noticed that the visio of the physical universe is diminishing see all the time you go down that scale and you get this oddity that people have noticed isautomobile accident occurs and youve got three witnesses and they all give three slightly different stories well now if these characters were all at level 7 why each one would have only confrontation of what he thought should have happened see and you would getyou wouldnt even find out what color the cars were man you wouldnt find out what street corner it was on youd get dissertation on laws that should be passed about careful driving or dont you see its confrontation of own opinion only now everybody confronts his own opinion to some degree these levels are up along the line as you run engrams on some character itsomewhere along the line hes going to dubin you know for moment or two hes going to see luaaaaah and hes also going to sometimes on very deep anaten proposition have dubin of dub you know he confronts this thing he thinks and after youve run it for while and you get some charge off and he kind of boils off in for moment and woag and so forth and oh now he knows it was different than what he first thought now he knows what it is and he runs that and he goes rruuuh and he gets some charge off and his ears sort of fry for little while and heand then he suddenly wakes up and its an entirely different incident its got some of the plot characteristics he had before but now its different incident entirely dont you see and now this is the time track see hes come through two layers of suppositions thatll happen quite ordinarily and that does not make your pc chronic level thats one of the characteristics of the engram but the engram can be so wholeheartedly high and mighty on this that the whole case you see takes on this manifestation see layers of unconsciousness hes moving further and further off now if you had anything dividing these various levels but of course you get your eighth level which is simply unaware but if each one of these levels of case states was to be divided from any other level it would be divided by layer of anaten see so that you get between level i and level 2 youre going to have slab of anatenunawareness boiloff unconsciousnessyou know anaten and between level 2 and level 3 youre going to have layer of anaten and between level 3 and level 4 youre going to have another layer of anaten youre actually compartmentations of anaten and if you saw this scale not as vertical scale but as horizontal scale anybody who is sitting at level 8 as chronic fact as chronicness you see as athis isthis is not particularities happening in the session lets supposing he wasnt going to get any auditing at all but in life somehow or another hes going to recover by livingness see he would have to walk from unaware to own evaluation and in order to get from unaware to own evaluation he walks through layers of anaten hell go woag and sluurrrrt and he goes real creaky and then hed have to get from 7 walking straight ahead you see from 7 up to 6 hed have to go through another curtain of anatentotally undisclosed anything beyond that and then to get from 6 to 5 he would walk through another curtain of anaten and 5 to 4 another curtain of anaten when he got to 4 hed go through another curtain of anaten before he got to 3 and from 3 to get to 2 hed go through curtain of anaten and then to get to i hed go through yet another curtain of anaten now these layers are thinner and thinner now the reason why theyre thinner and thinner is dual they actually are thinner and they also seem thinner because the greater awareness the individual has why the greater tolerance he has for unawareness so therefore there are two reasons why these seem thinner as you go higher on the scale two reasons one that they are thinner and the other that the person doesnt mind layer of anaten that much now youre going to see some case in catalepsis this is athis is chronic state catalepsisusing dirty word out of an old and forgotten piece of antiquity and the guy is just rigid blank or he is just blank or lets take amnesia amnesia he knows nothing he can remember nothing now understand absolutes are unobtainable but not only are they unobtainable but there are lesser and lesser levels of absolute so that we get down to this sort of state what do you think homo sapiens is doing when hes walking around thinking he only lived but once look at the amount of automatic unawareness there is of time track so you consider him pretty unaware character see just like that now what is he going to do when he first goes into this if you took somebody averagely that didnt have any perception of anything particularly and you just wanted to walk him through this first level of anaten youll be rather amused to find out that the second you throw into his lap the idea of having lived before that youll get confrontation of his own opinions about it and this will make him pretty groggy you got reality on that and if you push him up the line then his suppositional actions will also occur you know hell have ahell have suppositional and as he goes through from 7 to 6 hell have some of the wildest ideas of what it is all about that you ever cared to listen to see you havent run him on anything you see you just sold him on the idea hes lived before see and hethen hes had lots of opinions of the consequences this would have on the world one of the things they doits quite interesting you say well supposing everybody really lived forever and theyd just forgotten that theyd lived beforehis first thing is well now i dont know what this would do to old age pensions confrontation of his own evaluation you see thats the only thing that he can confront about it he cant collide with the reality of it at all so as you walk through it however you got him to earnestly discuss the fact that he had lived before and hell go through level of being knocked out cold almost and then hell manage to grapple with this thinghes going to get dubin of dub hell suppose you seethis or that and that is the result of this or that and youre going to get some very wild ideas thats how everybody was tutankhamen see thats how everybody wethese characters mesh up and you get everybody having been julius caesar or something like this you see because theyre just taking suppositional look at it and they think wouldnt it be nice and so forth and they might have been there dont you see they probably were somebody that used to serve him wine or something like that you know and one day spills some on him or something like that and they never quite got over the engram since you know theres probably been some kind of contact with the thing but their identity will be off the locale might have some germ of truth in it dont you see but thetheyre reaching there through dubin of dub now youif you could force him to look over this thing little more intimately you might get himyou might get him possibly this is all on discussional basis not on the basis of running him on the time track dont you see youd get him with some pictures of pictures hehis next thing hed collide withi think maybe i was an executioner because ive got picture here ofno thats out of movie i think i just have read that in book you see and athere he is wallowing through this next level see and then horror of horrorshaving had some fairly bright pictures everything goes black he hasnt got any pictures well now of course blackness can be an harmonic lower down but just pure blackness he doesnt know what its all about or anything like that is about as good as an invisibility but this is an invisibility of aof blackness which is and thats how you denote level 4 that blackness or invisibility is you see is part of the time track hes looking at blackness and he were to turn around slightly hed see planet over on his left get the idea or if you got him to go through the incident rapidly skitterscat one more time all of sudden it would cease to be invisible and it would takehe would realize that he was simply looking through air or something like this see theits an actual invisibleness contained in hes parked himself because the details are too terrible to confront hes parked himself at those comfortable parts of the engram which are nice and blank see here he is and theres nothing but black tsk nothing but black you see nothing but black thats all and you run him through it one more time you see or run him earlier aaarrrrh its good and blackin the direction hes looking but thats toward the tail of the aircraft the aircraft is going into the sun and he cant confront that so he confronts the tail end and see what i mean so he gets very zzzzzyuuh in the incident you know he goes guuuhhh well that he thought was good solution hes in this ship space ship something like that and hes falling into the sun so its fine idea at that moment to go good and anaten because its going to take himits going to take him the better part of the next year or so to finally reach the sun anyway and the most confrontable part of the incident when he recontacts it is the point where he went anaten you see and went blank and looked at nothing in other words you re getting nowwhat are you getting youre getting gradient scale of confront arent you as we go up the line here so hesthe 4 is simply selecting the blankest parts of actual incidents when he gets to 3 hes getting sporadic visio and hes looking at the more confrontable parts of actual scenery and when you get to 2 which is more or less theoretical case state the fellow could look at any or all of his time track itd just be where he happened to be in time mentally that told him whether or not he could see or he was looking at this sort of thing in actual fact the level 2 as we go up to level 1 the time track disappears now why does it disappear now theres many reasons why it could disappear and there are several theories that could still be thought up as to why it should but amongst these is that the time track itselfthis is theory you understand dont write this down with exclamation points as great truth because its merely something that i suspect the time track itself is method of not confronting do you see what i mean now it soundsit sounds weird when you first collide with this thing but it itself is method of not confronting now yeah the guys got it in his head and hes just mocking it up its good and safe because you observe these other harmonics and you see which way they are tending to go then you could extrapolate the probability that the time track itself was just method of not confronting something why does he have to have picture of it well you get then an inversion of confronting it see he doesnt want to confront it and this overwhelms him to the point where without power of choice he makes picture of it and you have the involuntary picturemaking apparatus which is the time track and how the time track appears and behaves its an involuntary create is what it is now so the individual if its an involuntary create must have been overwhelmed on the subject of creation and so therefore to be overwhelmed it must have been by something he wasnt confronting and although the time track is very accurate record it itself is probably the product of nonconfront now as we look this over then we see we are doing confronting scale from top to bottom on this state of ease and as we see ourselves involved with confronting thing it is then very very simple for us to bring wrong conclusion to bear that confronting will resolve the time track and although weve tried this and although confronting has considerable success and confronting itself is very interesting idea as process and does produce lots of results and that sort of thing it is not the common denominator it is not the common denominator of processes it is simply the common denominator of reaction the common denominator of processes is duplicate the time track is duplication of an actual event and each one of those levels on the case levels is willingness or unwillingness to duplicate and level 2 is probably an unwillingness to duplicate which brings about an overwhelming automaticity of making time track so your breakdown from ot toward clear is simply an individuals lack of desire to duplicate what he has to duplicate in order to be an ot lack of desire to do so and duplication is married hand in glove to the idea of beingness and as we study beingness we will see this with great clarity to be or not to be said the immortal stratfordonavons tourist attraction the old boyi always thought that was good scientology but i began to examine it recently and i found something very interesting about it that is not the question it is not the question why isnt it the question well it might be the question for life at large outside and inside this universe but once you are in this universe it is longer the question youre damn well going to be something whether you like it or not beingness is longer part of ones power of choice you cannot be or not be you can be or not be something but only to become something else any time you not be you will be b you see that all right therefore as the individual enters this universe he has specialized problem from there on and there is point on the time trackthe age of the universe may be infinite this may be an infinite universe we dont care about that because there was time you entered it see we dont care thatwhether or not the universe is timeless that is not the question in the first place as you examine peoples time tracks you find out some very interesting things about these time tracks you find their tolerance of time is improving as you go back and time is the single source of aberration and if tolerance of time improves as you go back then you must be getting into periods not only where theyre less and less aberrated but you must be drawing toward the beginning of the time track and its easier and easier to run oddly enough the further back you go which is contrary to what we used to think easier and easier to run soand theres less and less event per unit of time so youre looking directly atby extrapolation the fact that the time trackhas beginning and is not infinite the time track is not infinite 1 because at one time or another you entered this universe and 2 because all indications indicate that the time track the earlier you get on it is less and less constant continual and infinite thing the universe on the other hand continues at its own rate of vibration i mean its just been here its been vibrating for long time its going on and its going to be vibrating for long time and it was and it is and it will be and god help you who dreamed it up but this is the little handy jimdandy perpetual motion machine from way back but the point were making here is that it doesnt matter if the universe is infinite 1 youve got finite period back on the track where the pc did enter the place and 2 you have every indication that there was point where his time track began youve got these two things so therefore cases are resolvable you recognize dont you that case would be unresolvable if the time track were of infinite duration so thats an important point to us ive been examining it rather closely now lets get back to this beingness proposition once the bloke is in the universe there is not any such thing as not being you cannot absolutely not be in this universe you can unbe something but only to become something else you always will become something else the question is what to be thats the question and thats the only question there is in this universe that really bothers somebody you want to drive little kid mad say whatcha gonna be when you grow up johnny are you gonna be fireman nearly all kids your age wanna be fireman are you gonna be fireman he says im not gonna be fireman what are you gonna be johnny you gonna go to school and study something in order to be something kid will start going bluuuh you sometimes see some girl who has been very adored by her parents who had great ambitions for her and you will try to read into her as case the fact that she went into decline because she disappointed her parents youll try to read into her as case that she ran into decline because she couldnt keep up with their ambitions or because it crossed with her goals and all this sort of thing and you can examine it from all different sides and you still will not resolve her case completely its just that somebody was after her to be something and if they were after her to beblankwhatever it was it wouldnt be at all aberrative to her unless she knew that being blank was very dangerous indeed and youre looking now at the hookup of postulatecounterpostulate which makes continuing problem in terms of beingness now postulatecounterpostulate is the anatomy of problem its what hangs things up in time and moves things forward in time and so forth and there are many things which can become problem as well as this one but were locking at something which is fairly basic and very germane to this state of case scale and germane state of case scale is what well its just less and less things to be that are safe things to be theres dwindling spiral of beingness dwindling spiral of beingness has been entered ontothe moment the individual steps into this universe and it will eventually be proven to him that everything he can be is too dangerous to be that would be the eventual lesson taught by the universe everything you can be is too dangerous to be well look at us the characters that laughingly conduct what anybody who knew the subject would hilariously treat as big jokegovernment these charactersnewspaper proprietors and such lice as thisthese charactersthese characters you see start in campaign on us that you mustnt be scientologists that its very dangerous to be scientologist actually they just dramatize the game the food and drug nonsense over there is trying to teach american scientologists this lesson that if they succeed in saying that the meter has been mislabeled it says for use in scientology processing i dont know how this is mislabelif this meter has been mislabeled then they can go around and arrest every individual scientologist in the whole of the united states this is the propaganda line pardon my yawn these characters have about as much authority as kennedy i meant robert of course lookits going to take them upwards to two years just to get their lousy case in court thisthese wheels are going to turn are they and this is going to be the eventual lot of it all theyd never make the grade theyre the only ones asserting the meters ever healed anything see theyre the only ones that are lying about the case theyre confronting their own evaluation these are characters man theres nothing going to emerge out of this thing except they can put out propaganda line that said its very dangerous to be see its lie let tell you its very dangerous not to be scientologist in this universe its very dangerous in numerous ways to be member of the us government the united states attorney thats handling the scientology case has just been stricken with aneurysm and is not expected to get well until late autumn which puts our case off many months as i was saying its very dangerous not to be scientologist now lets look at this lets look at this did that shock you little bit but man will inevitably try to teach and beings will try to teach the danger of beingness but in actual fact there is nothing to do but be in this universe you see because you are located in universe which has finite space which appears infinite even if youre just spirit without body you still have the beingness of disembodied spirit this gives you the terrific workability of listing in 212s all you are doing is writing out endless beingnesses and you are giving the individual catalogs of beingnesses and so forth so therefore you had terrificterrific resurgences you see an ri is potential beingness real ri you can do lots of things with beingnesses but the basic lesson is that its too dangerous anything you want to be the ultimate lessonpardon meis that anything you would ever want to be will eventually be realized by you as being too dangerous to be or as being too discreditable to beone or the otherdiscreditable beingnesses and so forth there are characters around who actually just work day and night to make certain beingnesses discreditable you dont for moment think that profumo or somebody like that didnt have something in mind see i mean thisthey get to be something so they can become discreditable while being it now theres all kinds of wild ramifications you could sit and philosophize by the hour you could philosophize by the hour as to the ramifications of beingnesses upgrading downgrading beingnesses making problems about beingnesses and so forth the states effort to dominate the individual of course is simply jealousy of beingness of some kind or another but the question is not to be or notto be or not to be that is not the question the question is what to be that is the question so if you want guy to start sorting out his time track at almost any levelwell of course those levels would probably have to be above 7you canyou can start in on this question almost at once and youll run him into some very interesting categories now the time track itself is to duplicate or not to duplicate but any duplication winds up in beingness theyre united to marked degree or theyre at least gradients of each other so what dowhat do we see here do you realize that you will have cases which will not become ot until the beingness of ot is demonstrated to them to be not quite as dangerous as it has been been very dangerous to be an ot very very dangerous indeed its been very dangerous to be man its also very dangerous to be an ant thesewere getting into various problems and beingnesses and how about bloke how about fellow who has assigned to all upper states dangerous or discreditable beingness and all lower states dangerous and discreditable beingness and to his own state impossibility to be what case state would he be in well that happens to be the state of any case now for instance i can promise you very faithfully that if program exists for the security of this planet on which we could work with mutual cheerfulness youd find people very loath to advance their states of case or do anything or anything else theyd just startstay parked in an inertia because theres desirable future dont you see this is why hope also works as the most rudimentary therapy now youre at the level of hope you say all right if we do steps one two three four and five and wind up with this state of society on this planet why this would probably be good thing all right and people look at this and they say well yes and thats feasible and yes this could be done and mmhmm that would work actually it would take quite an idea im boxing around now such an idea exists its sitting on my desk its all written up i just havent released it for some weeks youd have to promise to some degree that an advanced state of case would not then bring about further problems complicated by the political or sociological situation on this planet you follow that in other words the persons case wouldnt advance you see if he didnt think that he could fit in to some framework of case advance right now you once in while find somebody with an advanced state of case and then he gets lonely theres nobody to talk to so he downgrades himself somehow or another so he has somebody to talk to thats the way he explains it that isnt the exact mechanism its the way he thinks of it hes just advanced to state of beingness that he considers precarious and dangerous unappreciated he thinks now if theres nothing to do with an advanced state of beingness its doubtful if people will try to attain it so youve got on the one side youve got the mechanics and technology of processing and case and whats wrong with it and what forms the ideas and so forth and you have on the other side whats this future going to be like look at all the trouble i got intoin yesteryear as free thetan now is there anything can resolve that problem such planning and organization alone would bring about case advance in the absence of such planning or promise in the future or coordination in the future youre not going to get as fast case advance you see this is on the basis of beingness all right let us suppose i advanced to state of being able to do this that and the other thing let us suppose i advanced to that state thats all very well but how will i fit into this thing and how dangerous will it be well you say well it wont be dangerous all i have to do is crack few heads together and make things snap and pop and itll all be well and so forth and little alarm bell goes in the back of your head and you turn on little bit of headache and you wonder whatwhat was that well that was the fact that the last time you did this some other ingenious bloke dreamed up new kind of theta trap and somebody else dreamed up new kind of an implant and somebody else tried to reassert mean in other words there are people who are on prevented beingness you can test these people rather easily just throw them any kind of beingness and they will not be it you know theyll notis it you say well itd be pretty good thing if we had wise prime minister oh i dont know that would make the government more powerful you see justalmost helatrobus 12 12 12 you furnish the plus hell furnish the nix now theres certain ideas you could advance that youd always find people negating them you just take any of the common helatrobus goals and advance this as good thing to do and youll have lot of people go onto an automatic nix quitequite amusing similarly youve got people who just negate beingness anything you wanted them to be or any beingness which was advanced they would degrade because they know its dangerous and they might even think they were doing people favor by doing this matter how it was rationalized what have we got here then well we have the idea that if we cannot process and have success with certain number of cases we havent got enough people to form any strata of civilization well its perfectly all right to say well all right youre making an officer cadre for an army all right and you only have to have that many and the rest of them can be as they are and so forth thats all very well but the minute you say that then youre presupposing that theres future plan to take care of all this in the absence of future plan of course then people would not know how they fit in to any part of this and sometimes scientologists are very puzzled as to how he fits into scientology and how he fits in with all this organization and so forth and i could give you quite talk on that but weve been to marked degree organizationally marking time well there exists right now plan for what you would do with this planet in order to produce this kind of condition on this planet and so forth and youd see that was highly workable you say thats fine we take care of this planet thats an afternoons work and we get that all straightened out and we get that game running and thats all fine but that doesnt prevent the boys from the next planet coming over here and suddenly going into resurge and so forth so all right the second you advance out on this line at all you advance into the organizational future you inevitably advance into the organizational future because youve got to continue to solve the problem of beingness because we are in this universe so its not just enough to solve the problem of beingness with regard to case and case level if you dont want derogation of case then youve got to continue to solve the problem of beingness and youve got to make it possible one way or the other for certain beingnesses to be safe out into the future i dontsomebody will say well perhaps rons just making pitch forgoing to have big organization and so forth and im not actually because theyre usually very hard to run right now were just keeping things burning very very well central organization wise and field auditor wise and so forth and were not doing too badly and were keeping the sparks lit and so on and that form is all very excellent but of course that isnt the forward progress that isnt the point of forward pressure that is simply the nucleus points for the forward pressure and were just carefully preserving those units and keeping them whizzing and getting our own house in order and then when it comes down to presenting any kind of plan by which this planet is suddenlybe safe from atomic fission and that sort of thing we take off from our captured territory dont you see we have occupied spot we do exist in certain areas then we can take off from these spots and straighten things out now when you think of the power of an ot youll see that there is nothing very much to straightening out these things but unless you plan to straighten them out youre not going to have any ots itll be very rare indeed that you would get anybody who would break through to that strata of beingness again because hes already been punished down to the ground manfor hitting that level dont you see well how could he maintain that level well in the past hes had very blind spot the ot has had very blind spot hes been not too bright because his ownconcept of his own power was so great that he thought he could stand alone and any time he went up against an organized body he lost because it could furnish more viewpoints than he could and thats the whole reason the individual can furnish only limited number of viewpoints to which he can pay attention and coordinate as long as hes an individual the individual usually loses to the organization so you see communism advancing across the world today its the plurality of viewpoints and that plurality of viewpoints makes it possible to confuse the singleness of viewpoint its simple problem of confusion you can always confuse the individual because theres an organized number of viewpoints which can voice different opinions and he cant quite isolate where these things are and hes pulled down eventually and i could say much more on the subject but all i wish to give you is some kind of aof relationship to these cases now the individual therefore the individual ot does have his problems and thats because he is an individual and thats because he has never worked on up the line hes alwayshas this conviction that he could do it all himself thats whats wrong with him thats one of his biggest achilles heels he could do it all himself all by himself and the funny part of it is he could he could actually stand off and take this planet and go pow and that would be the end of the planet man hed solved it but let tell you the little boys with the airplanes always show up sometime in the future may not realize it but about three hundred and oh maybe four hundredi guess close to five hundred trillion years ago there wasnt sun burning in this universe do you want to know where these magellanic clouds come from youll strike the period in your processing where do the magellanic clouds come from huh howwhats all this radioactive material thats floating around in space how has that never been rounded up actually its only been partially assembledonly partially universe was ended absolutely endedless than five hundred trillion years ago finished what these scientists are doing these days with their carbonatom deteriorization and i dont know what the devil theyre computing theyre pretty wild man matter doesnt go to pieces like that there wasnt any universe there was nothing but rubble but the space was left didnt do anything to collapse the space and thats where you get your planet builders lot of you have been planet builders and lot of thetans had to flex their muscles and get up there and put some suns together and so forth this is actual fact the wholeeverything had to be put back together again one of the reasons it all had to be put back together again is in spite of the destruction of this universe the little men with the airplanes showed up whered they come from who made them who was out there putting out theta traps while everybody was trying to put the universe back together again where would the space ships come from wherewhat happened well theres telling what happened but this has happened repeatedly in this universe repeatedly make it absolutely impossible for humanoids or doll bodies to exist wipe out any base or platform of any kind whatsoeverthis is making life safe for the ot you see put this whole thing into some kind of condition where an ot could be safe and then one day there are couple of airplanes with loudspeakers tying him up in knots then one day he steps over toward this funny looking mountain thats floating in the sky and theres pole on it and it goes tssuppand he says damn here we go again well the blind spot is that this universe having space and being formed in this particular way surrenders to cooperative action and doesnt surrender to individual action and thats the terrible lesson thats taught by the mest universe and the ot of yesteryear has never learned it now youre turning out different breed of cat today when he gets back up the line youre turning out an experienced being he hasnt learned from his experience that its all too dangerous to bewhich is what his experience has taught him previouslybut he has learned now that matter how powerful you are you still have some blind spots matter how big and tough you think you are you can still get on pole trap and youve got technology that can straighten somebody out now somebody thats gone around clanking around in space in the last few hundred trillion with pieces and scraps of pole traps hanging to him and that sort of thing and other thetan will have anything to do with him whatsoever nobody would pull it off of himsee tolerance of being an operating thetan has just deteriorated to nothing so what would you do today well youd say to the guy all right do you remember the first moment that you saw that trap and after you run him through it couple of times thered be dull clank and the piece of the trap thats there would go you see theres trick pulling thetan off trap but patching him up after hes been mixed up to this degree is difficult well that technology exists but theres greater technology than this to exist and that is unless fairly powerful beefy being doesnt learn his own inadequacy but learns that this is universe of organization and coordinationunless he learns this lessonhes just going to be back on the pole trap again and any body of beings that is operating with coordinated program can beat him the department of justice in the united states could probably beat him you know i mean its that corny youve got situation then where the individual is trying to operate in universe of cooperation and of course that degrades the beingness of the individual to that degree and his beingness goes downhill and the more he fights to be an individual the less he cooperates the less hes willing to cooperate the more enforced is his cooperation the more he fights against this sort of thing and the less freedom he has and the dwindlingthat is description of the dwindling spiral that an individual goes through so anybody who has drifted down this scale has drifted down it on the basis of confront thats for sure thats the mechanical fact but the healingness of this is going down scale on the basis of discreditable or dangerous beingnesses discarded he has facsimile of having been an acrobat and he knows its damn dangerous to be an acrobat his facsimile tells him so people dont like acrobats its not cooperative action nothing to it he doesnt want to have anything to do with an acrobat and it winds up that he didnt want to have anything to do with facsimile of an acrobat he didnt want anything to do with the beingness of an acrobat to such degree that with great surprise hes sitting in the auditing chairwith great surprise he suddenly looks at you having answered an auditing question and says you know theres an awful lot of track here that has to do with stages i never thought of myself as having anything to do with the theater i think i must have been an acrobat hell eventually say but thats the last thing hell realize usually in facsimile the hardest problem the pc has is trying to isolate is whos him and whats he what is he now that he has located him what is he and its usually the biggest lie in the facsimile one thing that hangs it up hes been running this thing through you see industriously as the executioner you know hes happy you know to run off this overt he doesnt plainly come out as the victim hes the victims wife and hetheyll saythey finally get this straight now oh thats what this is all about the one thing that rattles around and gets him very upset is what beingness is he when in what you see this is what gets him all tangled up and thats because beingness is deteriorated subject we have something in scientologyits dangerous not to be scientologist thats the only honest statement that i could have been able to make for very long time in this universe on the subject of beingness you know i mean not honest but factual you know that i know its very dangerous not to be scientologist but the rest of the beingnesses are mostly matter of opinion and the coordination of beingness and the coordination of beingnesses and so forth is one of the better solutions oh i can see the nearby planet with central organization the nearby planet rehabilitation center functioning but also politically and sociologically under control you dont put it politically and sociologically under control and if those solutions are not good solutions once more youve rendered an unsafebeingness situation the problem has to continue to be solved it isnt enough just to audit somebody up and say okay youre flying and you wonder why three days later hes back not flying well he found out it was unsafe to be clear hea thetan exteriorthis is one of the lessons they learn consistently its not safe to be theta clear this is not safe you go and you park your car and youre wandering off someplace looking at the tops of buildings and there you are driving your car down there you see in body and you park your car at the stoplight and you happen to get interested in this building that youre next to you know youre looking at the roof and girls sunbathing on it or something and you get very interested at this point and you forget to move the car on you not only forget to move the car onthis is an actual incident but go follow the girls off get dreaming about something you know and wander off and get very interested and say isnt it nice to be free and that sort of thing and then three days later have the embarrassment of coming back and picking up the body in hospital where its been dragged because its in coma and of course its got traffic tickets plastered all over it and doctors bills well thatll teach you and actually the case came downscale again you see to being humanoid so forth you couldnt have gotten him out of his head with crowbar you understand why well there wasnt any conditions arranged by which he could be theta clear see he was just going at it in very haphazard fashion well its very doubtful if youll ever be skyscraper tall again unless there was some guarantee to you that that beingness will not immediately turn around and wind you up in the soup see what i mean this by the way is all allowed for in processing and ive been working on it for some time you say im processing people in order to do this actually youve got it backwards if you process people you have to do this see so anybody who wants to be the association secretary of the nearest planet to arcturus apply here how abouthow about somebody whos plowing around and he gets on trap something like that with bingobango whos ever going to pull him out whats he going to do stay there for the next hundred billenniahundred billion years hundred thousand years something like that or is somebody going to look him up and say hey wheres joe havent had any reports wheres joe hmm bill you better go find out where the hells joe you see what i mean then of course thered be point in having this unless they had purpose to function and of course your purpose is quite fundamental youve probably had lost crews and wondered where this and that went and that sort of thing you had undoubted interest in locating that youve got an expanding game unless the game itself is not an expanding game then processing cannot produce stability now the individual who has gone down the reality scale all the way through the bottom hes gone down through the scale of beingness and to get him to be anything at the bottom is impossibleexcept an unaware being he goes into coma see he takes responsibility for any beingness of any kind whatsoever youve got dropping beingness all the way down now to move him up the line hed have to have some security in being able to be something at an upper level so your future livingness always to some degree ties in to the rise up the scale always to some degree and the problems that you run into in processing will very often hinge on this interesting thing that there is future beingness now this all resolves itself in processing and people can think more flexibly along in this line but the actual fact is that the problem stays unique and isolated outside the field of the time track because it has existed this is the way this universe is so thats the way the problem has existed so therefore you have to do something about the problem but as eases go down the scale further and further from reality theyre going further and further from responsibility why the further and further from responsibility well you dont dare be responsible for anything because you get in the soup and its this continuous repetition of this lesson and this lesson only that puts the individual gradually down that scale in livingness he doesnt want to remember what hes been he doesnt want to have anything to do with any part of his own past and so forth and yet the hideous part of it is that this scale just keeps on going south because there are deeper and deeper channels of unawareness but thetan cannot become totally always unaware if he could achieve that he probably would have some time since what to be to be an or to be b that is the question cant be an cant be b there arent any other things to be answer anaten this is the anatomy of life and its coordination with case levels and livingness and youll see this sort of thing show up in nearly every case you have anything to do with well in any case you have anything to do with i said nearly because some cases are insufficiently aware to answer any question to inform you of anything its very fascinating what you can do in simply using the technology of secure beingnesses using that alone as weapon you can sometimes bring about sanity marital counseling which we dont do particularly but weyou always run into some section of this is simply husband who cannot be husband wife who cannot be wife wife who will not let husband be husband and husband who will not let wife be wife the average marriage you say therefore marriage is very unhappy marriage is not unhappy marriage is difficult beingness thats all that you could say about it but you could use beingness processing oddly enough to handle it all providing you introduced bypassed charge all youd have to do is the bypassed charge of the marital partner that causes jealousy is the bypassed charge in the other person not knowing about the other persons pastnot knowing about the other persons past adequately brings about bypassed charge on the part of the individual who doesnt know its very funny manifestation its bypassed charge in the other person dont you see he gets upset about the fact that that charge isthreatens him to some degree but he doesnt know what it is and so you get crisscross of bypassed charge and by that analysis because we are not bypassing the other fellows charge not only the probability but the certainty exists that scientologists will be the first people who can ever be friends with each other in this universe because time alone will add up bypassed charge to people who know nothing about the time track or anything else so the whole problem of beingness and the whole problem of ease state all ties up with the problem of hope all ties up with the problem of expectations ties up with the problems of confront and all of these various things and youre looking here on this scale of cases at crossroads of everything we know as far as processing is concerned if we want to add up all of these things that we know and address these various levels why we raise the persons scale up the line increase his confrontability up the line and raise his level and we eventually get up to point where we can run engrams on him and when we can run engrams on him we can take him all the way what we lacked were positive techniques applied very directly which graduated the person up to the ability to run engrams we had the technology but hadnt applied it in the exact order because we didnt know quite what we were applying it to the exact end of since none of these lower technologies will clear only engram running will do that you take the tremendous barrier of the helatrobus implantsbars out the whole track wildest confusion anybody has ever walked into its all backwards upsidedown has beginning and end and ties up time and rides forward to present time as result all right why do you have to do anything about it not because of the persons conduct but because it louses up his time track and debars the easy route to running engrams final thing that youre trying to do is run engrams why are you trying to run engrams reaccustom the individual to various levels of beingness and after youve got all the engrams run out you got an ot and then youve got to have an organization to handle the problems between the ot and this universe otherwise he will just slop again okay thank you
