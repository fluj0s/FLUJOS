statutes or executive actions may clearly protect fossils in particular areas and although current gene ral laws and regulations appear to permit the protection of fossils on federal lands we are aware of current generalmanagement statute that expressly directs such protection or regulation available protection may vary depending on whether the federal lands in question were or are part of the public domain or were acquire d under various authorities authority for federal agencies to allow the collection and disposal of fossils is unclear in several respects due in part to uncertainties as to the application of significant statutes such as the antiquities act and the mining and mineral disposal laws to paleontological resources the nps is directed to protect national park system resources and both the fs and blm have general authority to protect resources and to regulate the use and occupation of the lands managed by th em dod has much greater control over access to and use of its lands than do the multiple use agencies the antiquities act applies to all the agencies covers paleont ological resources in some respects but is ambiguous in others and there is some question as to whether it is unconstitutionallyvague as basis of criminal prohibitions and penalties the general theft provisionsand trespass actions are available to protect fossil resources on federal lands specific penalties associated with the pr ovisions establishing offenses typically are quite low relative to the market and sc ientific value of many fossils however the general federal fine provisions make higher maximum fines available because the legal protection of paleontol ogical resources could be said to lack clarity uniformity and consistency some have suggested that additional backgroundand analysis from the relevant agencies and possible express legislative direction on these issues might be valuable httpwikileaksorgwikicrs98766contents introduction 1 g n r l s t t u t s 2

the antiquities act the antiquities act of 19064 authorizes the president to declare objects of historic or scientific interest situated on lands owned or controlled by thegovernment of the united states to be national monuments certainlypaleontological materials can be of scientific interest and several nationalmonuments have been created expressly to protect fossils and paleontologicalresources 5 when fossils are included in national monument the applicable restrictions prohibitions and penalties are clear because the general authoritiesapplicable to the national park system are available in addition to these executive actions creating national monuments some statutes have created national monumentsin particular areas and expressly protected fossil deposits 6 section 1 of the antiquities act penali zes any person who removes or destroys any object of antiquity regardless of which federal agency manages the lands or whether the actions are within national monument or not the wording is any person who shall appropriate excavate injure or destroy any historic or prehistoric ruin or monument or any object of antiquity situated on lands owned or controlled by the government of the united states without the permission ofthe secretary of the department of the government having jurisdiction over thelands on which said antiquities are situated shall upon conviction be fined in sum of not more than 500 or be imprisone d for period of not more than ninety days or shall suffer both fine and impris onment in the discretion of the court 7 emphasis added objects of antiquity is not defined in the act or in the implementing regulations8 therefore although fossils clearly can be protected by the president through their inclusion in national monum ent under section 2 of the act it is not clear on the face of the statute whether thei r removal or injury as objects of antiquity can be punished under the criminal penalties of 1 of the act httpwikileaksorgwikicrs98766crs3 9s rep 3797 59th cong 1st sess 1906 the statement on the senate floor simply paraphrased the bill language and the brief exch ange on the house floor did not involve

smyer 596 f2d 93910th cir 1979 cert denied smyer v united states 444 us 843 1979 the legislative history of the act is quite sparse and not helpful on the issue of fossils the committee report is less than half page in length and indicates onlythat the bill had the support of the archaeol ogical institute of america the american anthropological association the smithsonian institution and numerous museums 9 the report language does not indicate that paleontological resources could not beprotected under the act and as noted above fossils clearly can be objects ofscientific interest that can be protected through the creation of national monument but neither the report nor the very brief comments on the floor indicate the intended scope of the phrase object of antiquity used in the enforcement section the references to archaeological and anthropol ogical ie cultural organizations might support the argument that objects of antiquity does not include paleontologicalobjects however section 3 of the antiquities act authorizes the secretaries of the interior agriculture and the army to issue permits for the gathering of objects ofantiquity on lands under their jurisdiction nd to publish regulations to carry out the act 10 one set of regulations currently applie s to all three secretaries and states that the secretary of the interior has jurisdiction over antiquities on all government landsother than those within the forest reserv where the resources will be managed by the secretary of agriculture and those on military reservations where the resources will be managed by the secretary of the army 11 the regulations reflect the statute and require permit for the gathering of objects of antiquity these permits may be issued to reputable museums universities colleges or other recognizedscientific or educational institutions or to their duly authorized agents 12 objects of antiquity taken or collected without pe rmit or contrary to the terms of permit may be seized13 in the past blm and fs have issued permits for the excavation or collection of fossils under section 3 of the antiquities act as objects of antiquity but inrecent times have looked to other authority for such collection because of case in which court found the phrase object of antiquity to be unconstitutionally vague 14 court in subsequent case upheld c onviction involving destruction of ancient cultural artifacts from national forest on the grounds that those facts clearlyinvolved objects of antiquity 15 although the diaz case could be seen as limited by its facts it involved antiquities act criminal charges in case involving modernmasks it has called into question criminal enforcement actions under the actbecause paleontological materials are not clearly included in the wording of thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98766crs4 16a court reviewed the history of the litigation and noted that the antiquities charge seems to have long since been forgotten united states v larson 110 f3d 620 629 8th cir1997 the defendant in the larson case ultimately was charged with theft of federal property retention of stolen property and certain customs violations the property in question by that time in this series of cases was crinoid fossils marine invertebrate taken from forest service lands 17pub l 9695 93 stat 721 codified at 16 usc 470aa et seq 18the regulations implementing the act for the department of the interior are found at 43 cfr part 7 those of the department of agriculture are at 36 cfr 296 and those ofdod are at 32 cfr 229statute and are not mentioned in its legisla tive history the act is regarded as possibly being ambiguous enough in this regard that criminal enforcement action under the act involving paleontological resources might not be successful litigation over the bones of tyrannosau rus rex named sue initially involved charges brought under the antiquities act nd therefore provides an example of an instance when the object of antiquity nguage was applied to fossils however it is not clear what happened to this particular criminal charge in the ensuingsequence of litigation 16 because the archeological and historic preservation act of 1974 directs that federal lands and lands on which projects are federally financed or licensed besurveyed for objects of scientific interest and that those data be protectedagencies seem to use this act to incl ude paleontological resources among cultural resources to protect them under the various st atutes that direct protection of cultural and historical resources but the agencies have moved away from reliance on theantiquities act for permitting and enforcement arguably on the one hand the act can be said implicitly to provide management authority for an agency to pr otect paleontological resources in order to preserve them for possible inclusion in national monument or because they areimpliedly included within objects of antiquity however there is enoughuncertainty as to this last point that it may be difficult to obtain conviction under the criminal penalties section of the antiquities act archaeological resources protection act of 1979 the archaeological resources protection act of 197917 applies to archaeological resources on all public lands and indian lands and in many ways has superseded the antiquities act in the area of regulation of archaeological resourcesthe act

or receives federal assistance this statute provides another means to consider and protect paleontologicalresources as part of other federal actions and to protect paleontological resourcesalong with cultural resources but does not authorize general disposal of suchresources criminal theft provisions another important general statute that might be applied to removal of fossils from federal lands is 18 usc 64120 which prohibits the conversion theft sale or disposal without authorization of any thing of value of the united states person who steals government property or receives stolen property knowing it to have been stolen can be fined under title 18 or imprisoned for not more than tenyears or both but if the value of the property does not exceed 1000 the personshall be fined under title

imprisoned not more than fifteen years mineral laws although at first glance it appears that the federal mining and mineral laws do not apply to fossils this conclusion may not be warranted the materials act of 194721 provides for the sale and disposal of common mineral materials from public lands by the s ecretary of the interior and from national forests and certain other lands managed by the secretary of agriculture in 1955congress provided that certain common varieties of certain minerals would bedisposed of under the 1947 act the mining laws provide for the development oflocatable or hardrock minerals such as gold silver copper etc other minerals such as coal oil and gas may be developed through leases with the federalgovernment in 1955 congress removed certain mineral materials from theoperation of the mining laws and provided that they be disposed of under theseparate system for disposal of mineral materials 22 1962 act specified that petrified wood ie mineralized

thatcongress intended the 1962 legislation to eliminate petrified wood from the operation of the mining laws congress was concerned because the mining lawsprovide easy access to locatable minerals and some destructive methods such as theuse of tractor plows were being used to uncover deposits 24 the mining laws principally the mining act of 187225 allow the development and patenting of lands containing valuable locatable minerals one could argue that if petrified wood mineralized vegetative material can be disposed of under the materials act and was previously regarded as locatable mineral then perhaps common fossils mineralized animal matter may also be disposed of under thematerials law with more valuable fossils being locatable under the mining act the regulations of the blm and fs recognize petrified wood as disposable material but do not address fossils 26 the regulations of blm the agency with management responsibility for development of onshore federal minerals onlocatable minerals also do not address fossils 27 published opinions of the solicitor of the department of the interior or the attorney general could be found on this issue and court cases on whethe

duties of the nps is the protection of national park system resources the nps is to promote and regulate the use of the federal areas known as national parks to conserve the natu ral and historic objects and wild life sic therein and to provide for the enjoyment of the same in such manner and by suchmeans as will leave them unimpaired for the enjoyment of future generations 31 therefore nps regulations can provide for the protection of park resources one regulation provides except as otherwise provided in this chapter the following is prohibited 1 possessing destroying injuring defacing removing digging or disturbingfrom its natural state iii nonfossilized and fossilized paleontological specimens cultural or archeological resources or the parts thereof 32 the taking of some natural products for personal use is allowed under 36 cfr 21c but this section begins by referring only to certain fruits berriesnuts or unoccupied seashells which may be gathered and arguably the taking offossils is not included here the taking of research specimens of plants fish wildlife rocks or minerals may be allowed under 36 cfr 25 fossils are not expressly mentioned here but may be included

bureau of land management the bureau of land management is rele vant to discussion of paleontological resources for two reasons it is significant land managing agency and also is themanager of the onshore minerals of the united states the principal statutegoverning the management of the federal public lands by the blm is the federalland policy and management act flpma 33 this statute does not specifically address fossils but permits protection of fossils in several respects one of themanagement policies required by flpma is to manage the lands in manner thatwill protect the quality of scientific scenic historical ecological environmental and archeological values that where appr opriate will preserve and protect certain public lands in their natural condition 34 also the secretary of the interior is to issue regulations on the management use and protection of the public lands theviolation of which is punishable as criminal offense 35and regulations and plans for the protection of public land areas of critical environmental concern are to bepromptly developed 36 in addition the secretary of th interior is to take any action necessary to prevent unnecessary or undue degradation of the lands37 these duties typically are carried out through land use plans for particular areas as part of theplanning process flpma permits protecti on of fossil resources through the required inventory and planning processes or thr ough protective designations for particular areas such as research natural areas or areas of critical environmental concern authority for the disposal of fossil res ources is less clear than is the authority of the agency to protect such resources flpma authorizes the secretary to regulate the use occupancy and development of th public lands and this general authority might provide basis to permit the collecti on of fossils the intended authority with respect to this important resource could be clarified httpwikileaksorgwikicrs98766crs9 3843

or for subpart 92682 natural history resource management procedures additional blm rules may be posted at local sites affected42 state and local laws also may apply and may be enforced by the

usc 1733a authorizes the secretary to promulgate regulations for the management use and protection of the public landsand provides statutory penalties for violations of such regulations the penaltysections in the regulations apply only to violations of part 9260 and do not include the only flpmarelated regulations that address fossil removal 45 however flpma also provides in 1733g that the use of any portion of the public landscontrary to any regulation or order is unlawful and prohibited so the statutorypenalties set out in 1733a appear to pply regardless of the omission of

summary blm appears to have authority to protect fossil resources on the public lands under flpma but agency regulations do not expressly provide thisprotection at present time the antiquitie s act may also provide additional authority for fossil protection either if fossils are vi ewed as objects of antiquity the removal of which can be regulated or if it is argued that the agency can protect fossil resources to preserve them for possible presidential designation as nationalmonument but as mentioned previously court case has cast some doubt on theefficacy of the antiquities act as the basis for criminal enforcement actions authority for the disposal of fossils by blm is less clear permits for the collection of fossils can be issued unde r the antiquities act permits may be authorized under the general management au thority of blm to regulate development of the public lands fossils may be mineral material that can be sold under themineral materials act but this is not stated in the statute or regulations and thestructure of 43 cfr 8365b2 and 4 lends support to the interpretation that fossils are not mineral materials fossils may be locatable minerals under the mininglaws but again this is far from clear and one administrative case concluded thatfossils did not meet the tests for locatable minerals an agency representative hasindicated that blm may publish proposed regulations on paleontological resources soon forest service the principal statutes governing the mana gement of the national forests are the organic act47 the national forest management act nfma48 and the multiple use sustained yield act49 none of which expressly mention fossils the nfma and multiple use sustained yield act address timber production and other multipleuses of the forests which are referred to as involving various renewable surface resources 50 and arguably might not include fossils the organic act establishes the purposes of national forests as including the protection of the forest51 and the secretary of agriculture is authorized to regulatehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98766crs11 5216 usc 551 53 16 usc 1604 547 cfr part 3100 310042 5544 f ed reg 54268 54269

by fine of not more than 500 or imprisonm ent for not more than 6 months or both the nfma requires multidisciplinary approach to planning for each forest unitbased on the resources of each forest 53 other statutes may also apply depending on whether the forest in question was reserv ed from the public domain or was acquired under various acts as result there may be differences in management authoritywith respect to fossils fs regulations provide for the disposal of mineral materials citing many governing statutes pertaining to both public domain forests and national forestsystem lands acquired under various statutes therefore the issue of whether fossils are to be regarded as mineral materials or locatable minerals or mineral resources at all as discussed above in the blm sec tion is relevant to forest service managed lands as well because blm is the onshore mineral managing agency for the federalgovernment if fossils are locatable minera l resource their preservation or disposal on public domain national forests would be managed by blm with the fs as themanager of the surface if fossils are to be regarded as mineral materials the fs could manage their sale and disposal if fossils are neither locatable minerals normineral materials it is not clear what the authority for their disposal from nationalforest lands is as noted the antiquities act regulations in 43 cfr 3 apply to fs lands and may provide authority for protection of fossils as discussed above the generalregulations of the department of agriculture on enhancement protection andmanagement of the cultural environment define cultural resources heritageresources as including objects from the past 54 in 1979 the fs proposed changes to the fs manual to elaborate on and implement the departmental culturalregulations that stated paleontological re sources also are considered to fall within the authority of the antiquities act 55 this manual guidance was never finalized and is still in the process of being redrafted other current fs regulations do not expressly address removal of paleontological objects or natural products special use permits issued under theregulations of the fs may encompass the removal of fossils but it is not clear whatauthority exists for such disposal aside fr om the general authority to regulate the use of the forests the permitting authority of the antiquities act or possibly thematerials act or the general management authority of the fs 56 httpwikileaksorgwikicrs98766crs12 57 in addition to the general antiquities act regulations at 43 cfr part 3 there are army regulations for environmental quality at 32 cfr part 650 these primarily address pollution control issues but 32 cfr 6505 states that historic and cultural sitesstructures and objects under army jurisdiction will be preserved restored and maintained for the benefit and enjoyment of future gene rations emphasis added this regulation seems to emphasize historical objects rather than paleontological ones but might permitregulation of fossils item 10 of the same regulation states an integrated multiusenatural resource land management program will be conducted for forests and woodlands fish and wildlife open space soil water vege tation outdoor recreation natural beauty and increased public access and nonconsumptive utilization on lands under army jurisdictionwithin the provisions of ar 40580 and ar 42074 this language could permit the protection of fossil deposits but could be more express 5843 cfr part 3 59section 26b of army regulation 2004 cultural resources management summary of changes october 30 1997 draft regulation that is expected to be finalized soon states paleontological resources are scientifically significant fossilized remains specimens deposits and other such data from prehistoric nonhuman life the ahpa specificallyprovides for the survey and recovery of scientifically significant data which may beirreparably lost as result of any alteration of the terrain from any federal construction projects or federally licensed project activity or program any installation paleontologicalresource management requirements will be inte grated into icrmps and will establish and include installation policy for limitation of collection and removal of paleontological resources known paleontological resources will also be addressed in any nepadocumentation prepared for actions that may im pact or cause irreparable loss or destruction of such resources 6032 cfr part 189department of defense because access to defense lands is much mo re restricted than is access to parks or multiple use lands managers are less likel to have to deal with fossil collection and vandalism problems neither statutory provisions relating to fossils on dodlands nor any general regulations that specifically address fossils could beidentified 57 however the discussion of the antiquities act and regulations discussed above apply to military reservations58 in addition army regulations draw upon the authority to survey and protect scientific resources contained in the archaeological and historic preservation act to include paleontological resources as part of theintegrated cultural resources management plans 59 that in turn are integrated into land management plans for defense installations there also are regulations for the sale of mineral materials and the development of locatable minerals on dod lands60 so the issues and ambiguities discussed above with respect to those topics also pertain httpwikileaksorgwikicrs98766crs13 6118 usc 641 6218 usc 3571e 6318 usc 3571b provides that an individual who has been found guilty of an offense may be fined not more than the greatest of 1 the amount specified in the law setting fo rth the offense but see subsection of this section for times when the specified amount is the maximum penalty 2 the applicable amount under subsection d of this section3 for felony not more than 2500004 for misdemeanor resulting in death not more than 2500005 for class misdemeanor that does not result in death not more than 100000 6 for class b or c misdemeanor that does not result in death not more than 5000 or 7 for an infraction not more than 5000 18 usc 3559 classifies offenses according to the maximum incarceration available class misdemeanor is one for which the potential prison sentence is one year or less but more than six months class b misdemeanor is one for which the potential prison sentence is six months or less but more than thirty days class c misdemeanor is one for which the potential prison sentence is thirty days or less but more than five days and an infraction is one for which five days or less or imprisonment is authorized general penalties there are general federal criminal penalty provisions that are relevant to all the agencies the general statutory penalty pr ovisions for theft or conversion of federal property is fine or imprisonment for not more than 10 years or both however if the value of the property involved is 100 or less the penalty is fine or imprisonment for not more than one year or both61 other general provisions provide for ra nge of maximum fines although other substantive sections of the united states code may set out offenses and providefines usually these fines are lower than the fines available under the generalsections under 18 usc 3571 the ma ximum fine available shall be the highest amount of several alternatives stated only one of which is the amount stated in the law setting forth the offense if the am ount available under 3571 is higher than the amount set in the substantive section the higher amount governs unless language is specifically included in the substantive section to exclude the operation of thegeneral fines section 62 the sections discussed earlier in this report that punish violations of regulations etc have not b een amended to exclude the operation of the general penalties section in general the range of fines for violation by an individual would likely be from 5000 to 100000 depending on which statute is used to charge theoffender 63 however another general provision indicates that if an individual deriveshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98766crs14 6418 usc 3571d states that if any person derives pecuniary gain from the offense or if the offense results in pecuniary loss to person other than the defendant the defendant may be fined not more than the greater of twi ce the gross gain or twice the gross loss unless imposition of fine under this subsecti on would unduly complicate or prolong the sentencing process 65one committee report on an appropriations bill for the department of the interior requests additional agency information see srept 105227 at 60 1998 accompanying s 2237pecuniary gain from the offense the fi ne assessed could be twice the gross amount of gain64 this could result in higher fine than otherwise would apply summary in summary although particular statutes or executive actions may protect particular areas and although current gene ral laws and regulations appear to permit the protection of paleontological resources on federal lands we are aware of nogeneral statute that expressly directs protection of such resources the nps is directed to protect national park syst em resources and both the fs and blm have general authority to protect resources managed by them and to regulate the use andoccupancy of those lands available pr otection may vary depending on whether the federal lands in question were or are part of the public domain or were acquiredunder various authorities dod has much greater control over access to and use ofdod lands than do the multiple use agencies the antiquities act applies to all the agencies clearly covers paleontological re sources in some respects but is ambiguous in others and there is some question as to whether it is unconstitutionally vague as basis of criminal prohibitions and penalties the general theft provisions andtrespass actions are also available to protect fossil resources on federal lands aside from the permits authorized under the antiquities act authority for agencies to allow the collection and disposal of fossils is less clear than is their authority to protect them and the mini ng and mineral disposal laws are ambiguous as to their application to paleontological resources specific penalties associated with the pr ovisions establishing offenses typically are quite low relative to the market and sc ientific value of many fossils and these penalty provisions typically have not been amended since the enactment of general criminal fines provisions absent specific language specifying otherwise the generalfine provisions make higher maximum fines available because of the lack of clarity uniform ity and consistency among the agencies and laws on the issues of protection and regulation of paleontological resources on the federal lands some have suggested that additional analysis from the relevantagencies 65 and possible express legislative direction on these issues might be valuable
