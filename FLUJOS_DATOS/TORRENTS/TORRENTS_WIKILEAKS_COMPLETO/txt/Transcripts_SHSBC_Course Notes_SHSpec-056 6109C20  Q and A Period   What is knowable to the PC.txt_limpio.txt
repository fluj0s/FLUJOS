6109c20 shspec56 q and period what is knowable to the pc attention etc why do you get reaction on the meter at all that which is in the ken of reaction is in the knowledge of the pc that which will react is knowable an emeter can only react on those things which are instantly and immediately restimulated by the preclear himself the reason why you assess for an engram is not to find the hottest charge the reason you assess is to find out what is real to the pc what the pc can connect with emeters always used to be backed up with clever interrogation this is especially true in sec checks if something reacts it is real dont enforce reality on the pc contrary to what the pc says groupers give the pc an apparency that all time has jammed grouper is number of incidents becoming apparently located in one time instant the collapse of track that the pc experiences when they hit him doesnt in fact occur in session it occurred at some earlier track point the anatomy of grouper is commonly coldinstalled vacuum associated with implants person who has grouper has implanted people the only thing which can mash electricity like that is cold vacuum you could brainwash someone by smashing dry ice in his face and holding it there his bank would collapse cold is extreme stillness time is temperature temperature equals time equals motion therefore you must not run nomotion particularly near grouper so all you can run in the vicinity of grouper is motion and time it doesnt necessarily work fast add unknownness to that and it really gets interesting you could ask when was the time unknown to you what havent you known about time what time was unknown to what person has time been unknown what motion wouldnt you care to undertake gives motion and restraint or what motion was unknown which runs surprises and produces mean somatics the grouper will look like its stacking up and getting worse matter what you are doing but its not thats just the apparency you could relieve the grouper by running out the auditor and the session where he hit it all you have to do to free up grouper is to find the picture that the pc isnt grouped in and run it this rehabs his confidence in his ability to run pictures what does grouper look like like an art gallery all of whose pictures were thrown in heap and glued there the incident which produces one is like this rocket jockey lying on bed being hit by electronic rays so as to prevent him from exteriorizing and going back to running one of those planes thats been strafing the capitol they do an implant in which he thinks hes being hit by moving rays when implant they move in cold vacuum on him and plow it straight into his body thetan doesnt move out of that easily especially if hes done it to others the incident is of person lying on bed with pictures flying at him in running it keep the pcs attention on the bed not the pictures find whether hes administering the implant or getting it keep his attention on the bed and off the pictures use what dont you know about that patient etc you can unveil grouper by running arc break straightwire flatten this before starting to run the grouper and always assess engrams dont take one up just because the pc seems in it dont run the grouper get the pc out of it pc is so fixated on it he is so sure it happened in session that he thinks the session should cure it it was intended when put there to keep the person from getting out of it what kind of person applies groupers just about everyone in space opera is liable to decide the enemys habit of exteriorizing from body thats been shot down getting new body etc must be stopped he must be made to forget the information specialized implanting was the answer the most antipathetic things about the implant are that its cold lonely black etc put those things together and you get grouper someone whos alone in his scout craft for few years has only his own pictures to look at hell selfaudit space itself does lot of brainwashing you hit meteorite shower and suddenly youre in space falling into the sun having just been hit with redhot object this mades hefty engram when they implant the guy its presented as big arc break betrayal etc he gets the implant and never knows if they are his pictures or theirs the pictures will all be of class hell be sure theyre not his which is nice trick he disowns them he takes responsibility for it he dramatizes the irresponsibility by saying it happened in the session and he can do nothing about it but you can always find other pictures he can run and some day hell run the overt side of it grouper turns on with big somatic that makes the pc very uncomfortable this somatic can be turned off with what was unknown about that pain thats very good assist too pc whos gone into grouper can be hard to audit so its good thing to find out what hes in when running engrams look at why youre running particular engram its on terminal chain and should be run as what dont you know about it etc youre trying to get the pc as you to run package called valence the engram is the engram of the valence the pc is in so you should mention it while running it if you found as terminal looper you should use that in running it as what wasnt known to looper this also applies to running groupers its more serious problem when you have pc whos in grouper and you dont know his goal or terminal well go ahead and find the goal and terminal running engrams in scientology you run them more symbolically than verbally the same mechanisms are present as in book i bouncers groupers deniers callback etc you should use this trick when you find still picture direct the pcs attention to the motion on the other side of it or just before or after the egyptian area is bad one to get into because its confusing and violates the pcs beliefs it was space opera from one end to the other it was battleground between two space groups pcs have trouble running it because it violates their reality as gotten from history books lrh ran an incident of egyptians printing books of orders of the day from the invader force he knew there must be motion and sure enough he found battle after the death of the pharoah always audit the motion the heat never call for the still or the cold and youll keep your pc out of groupers it is what happens in the picture the picture is held in place by an avoidance of motion or notknownness on the subject of motion not by someone saying stay there you audit the motion not the words and not stillnesses
