mops ir kwbg is subject codels casey and ackerman meet with defense minister barak classified by dcm luis g moreno reasons 14 bd 1 c summary post hosted two codels during the week of may 25 one from the senate foreign relations committee led by senator casey the other from the house committee on foreign affairs led by congressman ackerman both delegations met with defense minister ehud barak who conveyed similar points on the peace process and israels concerns about iran end summary peace process 2 c barak began his meeting with the casey delegation by apologizing for being late due to what he described as an internal debate at the prime ministers office regarding the development of response to president obamas upcoming speech in cairo he noted there are perceived gaps between the usg and the goi regarding the peace process and explained the gois internal debate is focused primarily on how to ensure that the us and israel trust each other barak expressed confidence that pm netanyahu is sincere in wanting to seize this opportunity and move forward with the palestinians but alluded to members of the coalition who do not agree with this course of action 3 c from his perspective barak told the casey delegation that the goi was in position to dictate policy to the palestinians or the usg regarding the peace process it takes two to tango and three to negotiate he said barak noted that it is the gois responsibility to ensure that stone is left unturned regarding the peace process if efforts to achieve peace ultimately fail then the goi must be able to state that every effort was pursued he said he personally had objection to two states for two nations and panned arab arguments for binational state in israel barak said israel envisions two peoples living side by side in peace and good neighborliness as the final goal 4 c with the ackerman delegation barak focused on the need for regional approach to the peace process he supports regional initiative for peace and cooperation for the entire middle east region to be launched by israel he stressed as well the need to build trust and convince the us administration that the new israeli government is serious in its efforts toward peace 5 c barak commented on political developments in the west bank and gaza in both meetings he said the goi continues to review its policy and then added that the palestinian authority has much to accomplish in terms of law enforcement functioning judiciary and regaining control of gaza before balanced palestinian state can be created he has been extremely impressed with the work of us security coordinator gen dayton training pa security forces and commended salam fayyads concrete practical approach 6 c barak made clear in these meetings that he feels the palestinian authority is weak and lacks selfconfidence and that gen daytons training helps bolster confidence he explained that the goi had consulted with egypt and fatah prior to operation cast lead asking if they were willing to assume control of gaza once israel defeated hamas not surprisingly barak said the goi received negative answers from both he stressed the importance of continued consultations with both egypt and fatah as well as the ngo community regarding gaza reconstruction and to avoid publicly linking any resolution in gaza to the release of kidnapped idf soldier gilad shalit irannorth korea 7 c in his meeting with codel casey barak said the goi believes its keystone relations with the usg remain strong he described the integral role the usg plays in preserving israels qualitative military edge qme especially when faced with threats posed by iran hizballah and hamas he noted that the gois positions on iran are well known and described north koreas recent nuclear test as second wakeup call the first being the aq khan network barak asked rhetorically how lack of firm response to north korea would be interpreted by irans leadership speculating the usg would be viewed as paper tiger 8 c in both meetings barak said option should be removed from the table when confronting iran and north korea engagement will only work in conjunction with credible military option he said barak said he was tel aviv 00001177 002 of 002 personally skeptical that engagement would lead to an acceptable resolution and argued in favor of paradigm shift to confront the triple threat posed by nuclear proliferation islamic extremist terrorism and roguefailing states he said strategic partnership with china russia india and the eu is essential in facing these threats barak argued that failure to prevent nucleararmed iran would result in nuclear arms race in the region as turkey egypt and saudi arabia look to acquire nuclear weapons 9 c when asked if the usg and goi have fundamental differences of opinion when assessing irans nuclear program barak said we share the same intelligence but acknowledged differences in analysis he suggested that the usg view is similar to presenting evidence in criminal court case in which defendant is presumed innocent until proven guilty as such usg standards are tougher especially following the failure to find wmd in iraq while endproducts such as the 2007 nie unintentionally take on softer tone as result barak said the fate of the region and the world rests on our ability to prevent iran from gaining nuclear weapons as such the standards for determining guilt should be lower as the costs are higher 10 c in both meetings barak described iranians as chess not backgammon players as such iran will attempt to avoid any hook to hang accusations on and look to pakistan and north korea as models to emulate in terms of acquiring nuclear weapons while defying the international community he doubted tehran would opt for an open relatively lowthreshold test like the recent one in north korea rather iran will seek ways to bypass the npt while ensuring its program is redundant and wellprotected to prevent an irreparable military strike barak estimated window between 6 and 18 months from now in which stopping iran from acquiring nuclear weapons might still be viable after that he said any military solution would result in unacceptable collateral damage he also expressed concern that should iran develop nuclear capabilities other rogue states andor terrorist groups would not be far behind pakistan 11 c barak reinforced his message regarding pakistan in both meetings he described pakistan as his private nightmare suggesting the world might wake up one morning with everything changed following potential islamic extremist takeover when asked if the use of force on iran might backfire with moderate muslims in pakistan thereby exacerbating the situation barak acknowledged iran and pakistan are interconnected but disagreed with causal chain to the contrary he argued that if the united states had directly confronted north korea in recent years others would be less inclined to pursue nuclear weapons programs by avoiding confrontation with iran barak argued the us faces perception of weakness in the region 12 u codels casey and ackerman did not have the opportunity to clear this message
