government and finance divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33036federal financial services regulatory consolidation an overview summary among the arguments offered for consolidating the federal regulatory structure of the financial services industry is that the indus try has changed in ways that blur the clear cut boundaries between the functional ar eas of banking insurance secur ities and commodities markets it has also been argued that while the financial services firms are primarily responsible for effec tively managing their risks th new nature of those risks has created need for the government to take more comprehensive approach to financial regulation mo reover consolidated financial rvices regulator at the national level is more suited to accommodate international regulatory negotiations on financial services regulations such as capital accountin g and privacy standards the most recent proposal to consolidate the federal regulatory structure is the department of the treasury blueprint for modernized regulatory structure page 13 which would merge several federal regulatory agencies functions into fi ve distinct functional supervisory agencies the proposal consolidates regula tory functions not agencies even though number of proposals to consolidate the federal regulatory structure of the financial rvices industry have been put forth the united states has yet to make any significant move to do so key reason is that the functional competitive regulatory structure of the united states was and continues to be viewed by most policymakers and know ledgeable observers as being sound over time despite number of crises for example significant federal regulation of banks first occurred during the civil war when states management of their currencies failed dramatically in another example financial regulators addressed the savings and loan associations failures of the 1980s with riskbased capital requirements for all insureddepository institutions for the first time the sarbanes oxley act established accounting standards for publicly traded companies in response to the accounting frauds leading to the bankruptcy of several large publicly traded firms the structure has often been able to successfully address such problems quickly before they disrupt the economy to improve their ability to regulate the modern financial services sectors many countries including the united king dom japan and germany have recently consolidated their financial services regulatory agencies financial services authority of the united kingdom fsauk the financial services agency of japan fsa japan and the federa l financial supervisory authority bafin in germany provide point of comparison for the us regulatory structure these foreign regulatory structures are

banking insurance and securities trading are longer specific to an institution but are deliver ed by almost every financial services institution in most cases with little or differentiation since the 1980s financial services companies increasingly commingle products and services the passage of pl 106102 the grammleachbliley act g lba incorporated the commingling of financial services within institutions into us financial services law in this new glba framework the responsibilities of re gulating financial institutions are more difficult to achieve because their business activities have become more interrelated technological advances have helped to erase the traditional lin of demarcation in financial services produc ts upon which the regulatory structure was built bank regulators for example continue to lower barriers to bank entry into commodity futures and the options business and in surance has become popular bank product as bankers get more involved in the s ecurities business the business has been changing rapidly as financial instrume nts or products become more complicated the riskiness probability of fault of the products is mo re difficult to determine for regulatory purposes maintaining regula tory structure and control based on past market demarcations that are now slowly disappearing raises questions about the effectiveness of the regulatory structure that has responsibility for the safety and soundness of the financial institu tions under its jurisdiction this report is brief overview of the us federal financial services regulatory structure the first section is brief historical analysis of the functional and competitive regulatory structure of the three major financial services banking insurance and securities including commodities futures and options the second section deals with the difficulties in regulating institutions when they begin to provide services outside th eir demarcated lines of business the third section discusses some of the recent proposals to consolidate regulatory agencies in the united states the fourth section briefly assesses the consolidated financial services regulatory structures in the united ki ngdom japan and germany and the report concludes with some implications the major financial services regulators there are currently seven major federal regulators for the financial services industry the following is summary of the supervisory duties of the office of the comptroller of the currency occ the fe deral reserve system the fed the federal deposit insurance corporation fdi c the office of thrift supervisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33036crs2 ots the national credit union administration ncua the securities and exchange commission sec and the commodity futures trading commission cftc all these agencies regulate fo r safety and soundness the sec and the cftc emphasize consumer prot ection more than the others the office of the comptroller of the currency occ the occ is the regulator for ju st under 2000 nationally chartered banks and the us branches and ffices of foreign banks the occ conducts onsite examin ations of each national bank at least three times within every twoyear period the federal reserve system fed the fed supervises about 950 statechartere d commercial banks that are members of the system and more than 5000 bank hol ding companies and financial holding companies along with the occ it also supervises some international activities of national banks the fed uses both onsite examination and offsite surve illance and monitoring in its supervision process each institution is examined onsite every 12 to 18 months the feds inhouse examiners are to examine larger institutions continuously the bo ard of governors of the fed coordinates the examination and compliance activities of the 12 regional banks the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic the fdic regulates about 4800 state chartered commercial banks and 500 statechartered saving s associations that are not members of the fed they also insure deposits of the remaining 4000 depository institutions without regulating them the fdic examines its supervised institutions about once every 18 months the office of thrift supervision ots t h t s supervises about 950 federally ch artered savings associations savings banks and their holding companies like the occ the ots is located within but is independent of the treasury the ots is to conduct onsite exa minations of each institution at least three times every two years the national credit union administration ncua the ncua currently regulates 9369 fe derally chartered credit unions and another 3593 federally insure d statechartered credit unions most credit unions are small and considered to have limited risk exposure consequently credit unions and ncua are not covered further in this report the securities and exchange commission sec the sec regulates to protect investors against fraud and deceptive

prohibit firms from conducting any further business safety and soundness regulations safety and soundness regulations for banks consist of basically five components federal deposit insurance to reduce the likelihood of bank runs and panics deposit interest ceilings to reduce the costs of bank deposits and weaken banks incentives to invest in risky assets regulatory monitoring to ensure that banks do not invest in excessively risky assets have sufficien t capital given their risk have fraudulent activities and have competent management capital requirements to provide incentives for banks not to take excessive risk and portfolio restrictions to prohibit investment in risky assets under regulatory monitoring us banki ng regulators adopted uniform rating system known as camel to monitor banks safety and soundness c stands for capital adequacy stands for asset quality m stands for management ability stands for earnings and l stands fo r liquidity the banks capital is evaluated on the basis of the banks size as well as the composition of its assets and liabilities on and off the balance sheet the quality of the banks assets is determined by assessing the banks credit risk of loans in its

to be functional because regulators supervise by line of business such as banking insurance or securities trading the structure is said to be competitive because there are usually multiple regulators responsible for single f unction for example banking services3 regulatory responsibilities are widely dispersed among several regulators on the federal as well as the st ate level of government the us regulatory structure reflects historical evolution rather than deliberate design the structure has evolved by addr essing regulatory deficiencies on whatever level they are found for example federal

more recently the sarbanesoxley act cr eated new independent body the public company accounting oversight board to oversee auditors and established accounting standards for publicly traded companies in response to accounting fraud leading to the bankruptcy of several large publicly traded firms in most cases the us regulatory structure has been able to handle most financ ial crises successfully before they significantly disrupt econom activity the issue is the regulatory structures capacity to continue to handle most financial crises given the increased interrelationships and functional commingling within th financial services industry the united kingdom japan and germany recently consolidated and redesigned their financial services regulatory agencies to meet recent developments in the financial services markets these recent developments included the blurring of boundaries among functions need for comprehensive approach to risk management better allocation of regulatory resources and the need to accommodate international regulatory negotiations on trade in financial services the financial services authority in the united kingdom fsauk the financial service agency in japan f sajapan and the federal financial supervisory authority bafin in german provide point of comparison for the us structure these foreign regulatory structures are said to offer more effective methods of regulating modern financial services firms us functional and competitive regulatory structure us regulation of financial services is dispersed among number of regulators for example the fdic and the occ have regulatory responsibilities for national banks that are fdicinsured the occ hol ds these banks charters and therefore determines the activities in which they ma engage the fdic insures each of the institutions deposit accounts for up to 100000 on which it must make good if the institutions fail proponents of the frame work contend that competing regulatory bodies regulate less but do it more efficien tly the redundancy of regulators is more likely to detect and correct risky market be haviors before they velop into financial crises4 the structure allows regulations to be tailored to the specific deficiencies at the appropriate level of the busing firms also the structure promotes innovations and competition among financial services providers opponents argue that

suits their business plan this was confirmed in recent fdic survey that shows that the top reasons given by the 34 banks that changed their charter to the fdic were that the fdic was less expensive and more banker friendly and that other regulators were stricter and that institutions could more readily pursue market share increases5 on the other hand the ability to shop for regulators could lead to more institutions being regulated by the weakest regulators which would increase systemic risk regulatory competition in banking in the beginning of the nation the federal government exercised an indirect role in the regulation of banking through the first and second banks of the united st ates when president andrew jackson refused to renew the second banks charter states regulatory banking commissions filled the regulatory vacuum that was created6 the civil war and the disarray of the national currencies led to the reintroduction of the federal government into regulating banks by establishing the national bank ch arter system which was governed by the comptroller of the currenc occ established in 18637 its creation immediately began the dual banking system which exists today and placed the federal government in competition with states for the number and size of banks under their respective jurisdictions until recently most bankers preferred state charters because states regulations were cons idered less burdensome more layers to the regulatory structure and therefore competition between regulators were added with the creation of the federal reserve board after the panic of 1907 and the creation of the federal posit insurance corporation fdic after the banking failures of the great depr ession in the 1930s further layers of regulatory competition were added when saving banks and credit unions were provided with separate fede ral regulators which evolved into the office of thrift supervision ots and the national credit union administration ncua8 the great depression also led congress to pass the glasssteagall act of 1933 ch89 48 stat162 to further seal off banking fro m other financial serv ices enterprises by prohibiting banks from engaging in investment banking activities until it was repealed by the grammleachbliley act of 1999 glba p l 106102 it repealed the glasssteagall act and allows financial companies owning or operating

regulations states separated insurance companies from the banking industry10 these regulatory provisions also protected the insurance industry from the excesses of the securities i ndustry in the late 1920s that led to the stock market crash consequently when the stock market crashed in 1929 the insurance companies were in relative good shape11 having escaped the massive failures of the other parts of the financia l services sector the insurance companies were not included in new deal regulato ry legislation even though in 1934 the securities and exchange commission sec proposed federal agency to regulate insurance companies the proposal wa s soundly rejected upon objections from the industry and state regulators12 another possible expansion of federal regulation of insurance came in 1944 out of supreme court ruling which held that the insurance industry was subject to the federal antitrust laws13 the insurance industry feared that this ruling would preempt their state regulation as result the i ndustry lobbied congress heavily to pass the mccarranferguson act which granted insurance companies immunity from the antitrust laws to the extent that they were regulated by state insurance laws14 the mccarranferguson act protected the insu rance industry until the early 1950s when insurance companies began selling variab annuities which the sec challenged the sec argued that

other financial services providers there have been several gislative proposals in recent years to impose federal regulation on some companies who offer securities like products with banking services

development in the united states the agricultural recession of 1921 following wo rld war i and speculative manipulation of commodity prices prompted congress to pass the grain futures act of 1922 under its commerce powers29 the grain futures act required commodity futures trading to be conducted on organized exchanges such as the chicago board of trade which would register with the government as contract markets with commodity speculation and market manipulation uncheck ed in the great depression president roosevelt added regulation of the commodity markets to his request for regulation of the securities market congress res ponded with the commodity exchange act of 1936 cea which continued many of the re quirements of the grain futures act but required futures commission rchants the equivalent to brokerdealers in the securities business to register with the government30 for decades even though options trading of regulated commodities and manipulation of commodity prices were prohibited the government was unable to stop speculation and manipulation in commod ity prices particularly in options on unregulated commodities which added to the rapid rise in commodity prices in the early 1970s the commodity futures trading commission act of 1974 was enacted in response to developments in the comm odities markets which carried forward the commodity exchange act and created the cftc31 the cftc was given exclusive jurisdiction over the trading of commodity futures and commodity options on all commodities and it was given more enforcement powers than its predecessor its regulatory reach included commodity trading advisors commodity pool operators and associated persons of futures commission merchants32 despite the increased federal regulation of the commodity trade

the risks have risen sufficiently to show the deficiencies proposed consolidation solutions the most recent proposal to consolidat the federal regulatory structure of financial services industry is the department of the treasury blueprint for modernized regulatory structure the blueprint it was motivated by the bush administrations recognition that the existing functional regulatory framework longer provides efficient and effective sa feguards against poor prudential behavior of financial services firms36 the administration believed that the existing framework is based on structure that has been largely knitted together more than 75 years to address specific economic disrupti ons and is not optima l because financial institutions have become more opaque and more difficult to understand as the institutions develop new products and comp lex riskhedging strategies that are difficult to evaluate for these reasons on march 31 2008 treasur secretary henry paulson offered the blueprint as more optima l federal financial regulatory structure this proposed framework would consolidate similar functions more than it would consolidate agencies by renaming existing regulatory agencies and make significant changes in their responsibilities and functions there will be five major regulatory agencies which is the same number as there are federal banking regulators market stability regulator which is essential the monetary and lender of last resort functions of the federal reserve prudential regulator which would enforce the safety and soundness prudential regula tions that are shared by all existing regulators business conduct regulator which is consumer and business protection regulator whose functions are now shared by all regulators and particularly th seccftc federal insurance regulator which is essentially the federal deposit insurance corporation with additional insurance responsibilities preempted from states and corporate financial regulator which is essentially the seccftc and related self regulated organizations such as the securities exchanges the financial services industrys reacti on to the blueprint has been mixed with the criticisms outweighing the support of the proposal banking groups supported the prospects of regulatory modernization but were critical of the blueprints plan to eliminate the thrift and credit unition charters along with their supervisory agencies the office of thrift supervis ion ots and the national credit union administration ncua on the other hand the mortgage ba nkers suppor ted the blueprint arguing that it would lead to resolving regulatory inconsistences in mortgage lending supervision at the state level for insurance most smaller insurance companies opposed the blueprint s optional federal ch

been proposed before as shown below but has not happened congress and regulators in the first term of the george w bush administration raised the longstanding issue of consolidating federal financial services regulators37 the former us treasury undersecretary fo r domestic finance peter r fisher made an argument that the supervisory pr ocess of the financia l services industry should remain diverse and aimed at the riskbearing parts of financial firms however he strongly advocated creating one regulator to write rules and regulations this single regulatory agency supe rregulator should be responsible for only this activity38 such an agency would absorb the regulationmaking functions of all the major federal financial regulators the george w bush administrations restructuring efforts for financial services regulators was later shifted to oversight of particular institutions such as the gove rnmentsponsored housing enterprises fannie mae and freddie mac an even earlier suggested reform of the federal financial regulatory agencies was put forth in 2002 by donald powell chairman of the federal deposit insurance corporation chairman powe ll proposed to design new regulatory system that would reflect the modern financial services marketplace three federal financial services regulators would carry out federal supervision one would be responsible for regulating the banking indus try another for the securities industry and third for insurance compan ies that choose federal charter39 under this proposal regulators like the occ would be restructured out of existence along

agencies as mentioned previously the changes in the financial serv ices industry have led to the development of financial instruments that appear to fall into the jurisdiction of both the sec and the cftc45 to solve the problem in the 1990s the treasury proposed three alternative solutions combining the sec and the cftc giving the sec regulatory authority over all financial futures or tran sferring regulation of stock index futures from the cftc to the sec in hearing concerning the markets and trading reorganization and reform act of 1995 h r 718 that would have merged the cftc and the sec the gao pointed out to those considering the merger the difficulty of quantifying both the potential benefits and risks the gao also noted that merger might yield onl small budgetary cost savings46 as an alternative to consolidati on the comm odity futures modernization act of 2000 specified the respective jurisdictions of the two agencies and mandate that the two agencies negotiate their jurisdictional disputes as they may occur in the future the blueprint also proposed combining the sec and the cftc consolidation in other countries most of the arguments used in other countries to justify consolidation of financial services regulatory structure ar applicable to the united states these arguments were successful in convincing several of the united states major trading partners to consolidate their financial services regulators into single regulatory agency or authority the key arguments were47 the financial services industry has changed in ways that blur the clearcut

ability to allocate resources across agencies to carry out strategically focused priorities consolidated financial services regulator at the national level is more suited to accommodate international regulatory negotiations on financial services regulations nd supervision such as capital accounting and privacy standards among the countries that have adopted single national regulator are the united kingdom japan and germany in all thr ee countries the new agencies are generally recognized as the sole financial services supervisors however to varying extent the traditionally dominant regulators such as the central bank and or the ministry of finance still have important roles to play in the new consolidated framework in addition in contrast to the american comp etitive regulatory model these countries financial services sectors have been closer to monolithic regulatory structure than the united states in europe for example through universal banking banks have long tradition of providing banking services as well as trade in securities and insurance and the central banks andor ministry of finance were the dominant regulators48 financial services authority of the united kingdom in 1997 the financial services authority of the united kingdom fsauk consolidated financial services regulation in the uk by combining nine regulatory bodies fsa uk was given the responsibility to regulate virtually every aspect of financial services to compare with the united states fsauk has the roles played by the federal and state banking agencies the sec the cftc insurance and securities commissions as well as the sros49 it was also given expanded independent enforcement powers enabling it to bring action against violators and impose sanctions fsauk has single ombudsman to handle complaints by consumers in all financial services this is in contrast to the numerous hotlines to the various federal and state agencies in the united st ates another remarkable provision of the fsauk is that it assigns one office to develop policies on capital requirements for all financial sectors similar to the fish er proposal mentioned previously by comparison in the united states the assessm

industry in the united kingdom51 however major financial crisis came to light in 2001 that caused fsauk to reexamine its regulatory activities in the insurance sector equitable life is mutual insurer that sold policies in the high interest environment of the 1980s without setting aside the necessary reserves for these policies while equitable life assured pensioners that its assets would exceed its liabilities for years in 2001 the stated value of its cust omers policies was 44 billion more than equitables assets were worth consequently the company slashed its pension holders policy value by 1652 major study of the crisis blamed the light touch reactive regulatory environment that preceded the fsauk in response to the crisis fsauk has become more aggressive in regulating the insurance sector and has begun program of enforcement actions imposing fines and banning wrongdoers from the industry53 in the 2002 the international monetary fund found that the insurance industry is under considerable stress reflecting depressed investment returns declining profitability in base life insurance products and more recently increasing regulatory compliance cost as the fsa introduces more

is that sesc subagency of fsajapan lacks strong enforcement mechanism it has only the power to investigate and not the authority to impose sanctions but must refer matters of sanction to the

been effective primarily because of its ability to address ficiencies in financial institutions management of risk wherever they may appear while doing this the structure promotes economic growth by encouraging innovation competition and risk taking in the financial services market s in addition this structure is able to maintain its flexibility and resiliency on the other hand the federal regulatory structure is replete with costly redundanc ies that proponents call checks and balances but opponents call needless duplica tion all regulators in th is structure write rules conduct ffsite monitoring and examine financial services firms for compliance with their rules and regulations propone nts also argue that the costs of these duplicated activities are affordable due to the benefits the stable financial services industry contributes to overall economic growth while congress has heard the argument s promoting consolidation of us financial services regulators at the federal level congress has not enacted legislation to bring this about the industry and its regulators have argued against creating monolithic regulator because it could lead to unchecked extension of regulation beyond the established juri sdictional boundaries consolidated regulator would alter the existing regulatory checks and balances if such consolidated regulator extended its regulatory powers it could s tifle innovation in fina ncial services and prevent firms from shopping for regulators that provide the greatest advantage tohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33036crs23 their business plans on the other hand shopping for regulators could undermine safety and soundness by allowing the leas t effective regulator to supervise an increasing number of financial services institutions evidence from the experience in the ot her industrialized nations that have consolidated their financial services regulatory structures suggests that single regulatory structure could watch for systemic risk more effectively but that evidence is inconclusive these nations have not had these new regu latory structures in place for long time making it difficult to draw conclusions from their experience with any certainty moreover these nations c ontinue to experience failures at rates not significantly different from befo re their consolidation took place
