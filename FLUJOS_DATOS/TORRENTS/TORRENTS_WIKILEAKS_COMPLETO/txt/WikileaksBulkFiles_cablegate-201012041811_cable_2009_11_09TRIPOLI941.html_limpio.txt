renewed commitment from us in return for progress on heu shipment ref tripoli 938 classified by joan polaschik charge daffaires us embassy tripoli department of state reason 14 b d 1 this is an action request see 13 2 snf summary saif alislam alqadhafi told the ambassador november 27 that libya had halted the shipment of its final heu stockpiles because it was fed up with the slow pace of bilateral engagement saif claimed that libya had not received the compensation it was promised in exchange for an end to its wmd programs including cooperation in the military security nonproliferation civiliannuclear and economic spheres libya sought highlevel reaffirmation of the united states commitment to the bilateral relationship in the form of message to libyan leader muammar alqadhafi in order to move forward on the heu shipment saif alislam who claimed that he was back on the us portfolio said his father did not want to move back to square one and wanted to develop positive relationship with the new us administration the ambassador underscored the gravity of the situation and noted that the libyan government had chosen very dangerous venue to express its pique he also noted that many of the holdups in the bilateral relationship had been due to libyan political missteps and bureaucratic bungling the ambassador told saif he would try to get some kind of statement along the lines requested but the heu shipment should in way be held hostage to any specific actions beyond that saif assured the ambassador that once that message was conveyed to tripoli he would immediately fix the problem end summary 3 snf once again exhibiting their flair for the dramatic and after almost one week of stonewalling regarding the decision to not allow the departure of the heu shipment to russia the libyan leadership authorized meeting between saif alislam accompanied by an assistant and the ambassador accompanied by polecon counselor as the ambassador was departing for the airport to travel to washington during the november 27 meeting the ambassador expressed his deep concern about libyas decision to halt shipment of its remaining highly enriched uranium heu stockpile to russia for treatment and disposal the ambassador said that libyas wmd commitments were the cornerstone of the relationship and the lastminute unexplained disapproval of the shipment seemed to renege on those commitments he emphasized that the libyans must move forward with the shipment as soon as possible for security reasons and to preserve the bilateral relationship the ambassador pressed saif to explain why the shipment was held up and insisted that the libyans must improve communication in times of crisis stating that libyan officials cannot simply ignore calls from highlevel usg officials and refuse to explain their decisions that negatively affect bilateral interests this was way to conduct relationship the decision to halt the shipment and create this crisis was intensified by the timing and the international context given the presidents focus on nonproliferation and the problems engendered by iran by its actions libya was jeopardizing its relationship with the whole international community 4 snf saif alislam explicitly linked libyas decision to halt the heu shipment to its dissatisfaction with the us relationship saif said the shipment was halted because the regime was fed up with the pace of the relationship and what it perceived as backingout of commitments to bilateral cooperation the areas of specific concern were libyas purchase of military equipment nonlethal and lethal weapons an update on what was being done with libyas centrifuges movement on the regional nuclear medicine center and financial assistance for the chemical weapons destruction program including construction of the destruction facility saif pledged to solve the heu crisis and to allow the shipment to move forward as early as next week if the usg expressed renewed commitment to the relationship and to deeper engagement saif noted that the message needed to be conveyed to or addressed to libyan leader muammar alqadhafi 5 snf saif continued that prevailing domestic opinion and conservative forces were critical of libyas decision to dismantle its nuclear weapons program noting that he personally had played an important role in libyas reengagement with the west saif asserted that if something goes wrong people will blame whether i am in certain official position or not saif stated that libyas decision to give up its wmd programs was contingent upon compensation from the us including the purchase of conventional weapons and nonconventional military equipment security cooperation military cooperation civilnuclear cooperation and assistance to include the building of regional nuclear medicine facility and the end of double taxation and economic cooperation such as the signing of trade and investment framework agreement tifa 6 snf saif noted that libya was small rich country surrounded by large powerful poorer neighbors yet libya the only missile technology control regime mtcr signatory in the region had given up all of its conventional weapons and could not purchase replacement systems or military equipment from the united states he highlighted egypt nonmtcr signatory as an example of neighboring country that receives millions of dollars in us aid and military assistance but did not have to share libyas nonproliferation commitments relative to such neighbors libyas decision to dismantle its nuclear programs had weakened its ability to defend itself he stated we share rich natural resources oil and gas along the borders yet we have capacity to defend that wealth saif complained that libya could not purchase conventional weapons from the united states or even from sweden or germany due to us holds on the sale of those weapons to libya even until now seven years later there is an embargo on libyas purchase of lethal equipment he specifically mentioned problem purchasing tiger vehicles outfitted with americanmanufactured engines from jordan due to us legal restriction on libyas purchase of americanequipment 7 snf inquiring about the status of the centrifuges libya gave up as part of its wmd commitments saif argued that the us had used the deal as public relations coup for the previous administration he said that the fact that the centrifuges were sent to the united states and are still there rather than under iaea surveillance and control was big insult to the leader the fact that libya was never compensated for the centrifuges added to the insult in addition to the centrifuge problem he complained that libya had to pay for the destruction of its chemical weapons saif insisted that libya was not able to pay to destroy its chemical weapons stock noting that the construction of the destruction facility alone was estimated to cost us 25 million for these and other reasons relating to noncompensation for wmd decisions he stated that certain voices in libya were pressuring the leader to withdraw from the mtcr agreement he lamented that slowly slowly we are moving backward rather than forward he told the ambassador that in order for the relationship to progress the us needed to make move the ball is in your court saif urged 8 snf continuing his lament saif said the uslibya relationship was not going well since his last visit to the united states in 2008 saif said that both sides had deviated from the roadmap that had been agreed upon at that time which specified cooperation in the military security nonproliferation civiliannuclear and economic spheres he asserted that the roadmap had gotten lost due to his own disappearance from the political scene and preoccupation with other issues overseas he acknowledged that he was disconnected for long time but that he was back on the political scene although he was careful to caveat that he had not yet accepted an official role in the regime 9 snf saif raised few recent incidents that he argued illustrated how things were going wrong first he pointed to muammar alqadhafis recent trip to new york which in saifs opinion had not gone well because of the tent and residence issues and his pere qadhafis inability to visit ground zero he said that all three issues had been complicated by local us authorities and had humiliated the libyan leader even tourists can see ground zero without permission but head of state cannot secondly saif believed that his fathers unga speech had been misinterpreted by us audiences he specifically focused on statements involving moving the headquarters outside of the united states and various assassination investigations jfk rafik alhariri etc saif stated that the elder qadhafi meant offense by his statements but was merely trying to pave the way for any future decisions that potus might make related to those issues lastly saif noted that the libyan leader was worried about us intervention in africa the elder qadhafi was also against the linguistic and political division of africa into north and subsaharan africa and wanted countries such as the united states to treat africa as single entity rather than two blocs 10 snf saif said that muammar alqadhafi was serious about deepening engagement with the united states and establishing relationship with the obama administration saif said that his father did not want to go back to square one but wanted to move the bilateral relationship forward saif emphasized the libyan leaders interest in meeting potus in third country if meeting in the united states was not possible such meeting would help overcome the negative history that our nations shared would support the rebuilding of trust and might even help with us embassy operations and activities in libya according to saif 11 snf the ambassador noted that the relationship had seen several advancements and several serious setbacks since saifs last visit to the united states including the august 20 heros welcome accorded to lockerbie bomber abdel basset almegrahi by saif himself megrahis return had severely offended american sensitivities and renewed tensions that set the relationship back until that point there had been significant progress with militarytomilitary agreement signed in january and the positive april visit of national security advisor mutassim alqadhafi and his meeting with the secretary although the death of fathi eljahmi had been setback to the relationship the us and libya had found productive way forward through the establishment of bilateral human rights dialogue regarding concerns about us intervention in africa the ambassador reminded saif that colonel qadhafi and general ward had had what we believed to be very productive meeting several months ago which we had hoped would have dispelled any concerns the libyans had about us intentions in africa the ambassador explained that americans were hoping for more forwardleaning statement by muammar alqadhafi in new york but instead heard series of remarks that were not agreeable to the american public as result the relationship has been placed on lowburner since august 12 snf in spite of these issues the ambassador said the us had managed to keep moving ahead in the areas of security military political civiliannuclear and economic cooperation however many of the delays in implementation were due to libyas opaque bureaucracy the section 505 end user agreement for example had languished in the gol for months as had libyas response on tifa libyas slowrolling on visa approvals for official american travelers had delayed movement in areas such as civiliannuclear cooperation and on the regional nuclear medicine facility 13 snf saif acknowledged that he was disconnected for long time from the bilateral relationship and recognized that the heros welcome for megrahi had set engagement back he reiterated that he was back on the scene and could serve as the troubleshooter for any future problems he urged the ambassador to contact his office directly in times of crisis he also promised to resolve the visa issue stating that he understood the importance of transparent and reliable system of issuance in their oneonone discussion afterwards the ambassador asked saif to explain his actions when he accompanied megrahi back to tripoli saif said he knew what the reaction in the west would be but that it did not constitute an official welcome he had worked on the release for long time he was not public official and there were international media like jazeera present in addition saif claimed that the libyans would someday find way to show that megrahi was innocent the ambassador reiterated the damage the welcome had done and said amount of justification could undo that saif nodded his understanding saif also replied that if he is confirmed in his new position he was as yet not sure whether he would retain his current position as head of the qadhafi development foundation comment and action request 14 snf the libyan government has chosen very dangerous issue on which to express its apparent pique about perceived problems in the bilateral relationship point the ambassador underscored with saif alislam if saif is to be believed it appears we might have way forward if the department is willing we would urge phone call from the secretary to musa kusa with message for colonel qadhafi comprising general statement of commitment to the relationship commitment to work with the libyans to move the relationship ahead and strong point insisting that the heu shipment be allowed to go forward immediately and not be held hostage to any further actions bio note 15 snf saif met the ambassdor in an office on the bab alaziziya compound the office was filled with books including high stack of art and interior design books and several brochures distributed by the embassys public affairs section saif conducted the meeting in english he was accompanied by his personal assistant mohamed ismail ahmed dob 07061968 who said that he was born in alexandria egypt and spent his childhood years traveling abroad with his diplomat father including in afghanistan in the late 1970s where he attended the american school ahmed was softspoken and spoke fluent english he asked polecon chief to provide him with additional information on the status of libyas military procurement requests and letters of offer and assistance loas polaschik
