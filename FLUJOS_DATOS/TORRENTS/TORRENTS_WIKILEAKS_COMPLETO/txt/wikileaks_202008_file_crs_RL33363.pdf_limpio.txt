davisbacon act issues and legislation during the 109th congress summary the davisbacon act 1931 as amended requires among other things that not less than the locally prevailing wage be paid to workers employed in federal contract construction through recent decades the act has become continuing source of contention some raise questions shoul d the act be modified strengthened repealed can it be administered effectively and fairly adopted in 1931 at the urging of the hoover administration the act was regarded as an emergency measure intended to help stabilize the construction industry and to encourage employment at fair wages ie not less than those prevailing in the locality of the covered work it wa s amended in 1935 and its scope broadened in 1964 fringe benefit com ponent was added s ubsequently davis bacon provisions have been incorporated within numerous federa l program statutes the original davisbacon act was relatively simple statute which it was assumed the secretary of labor would have little difficulty administering however the nature of the statute changes within the construction industry and extension of the act to wide range of program statutes seem to have created complications by the 1950s some had begun to urge major am endment or repeal of the act through the rulemaking process the department of labor has modified application of the statute but controversies continue serious oversight of the statute commenced during the early 1960s and continued throug h the mid1990s since then there seems to have been general acquiescence toward the statute during the fall of 2005 the act was suspended for two months in th wake of hurricane katrina but then restored to its full effect among issues raised with respect to davisbacon have been the following revision of the database upon which prevailing wage rate s are based expansion of the conditions under which helpers gen erally unskilled or semiskilled workers can be employed on davisbacon projects revision of the ope rational concept of site of the work for davisbacon purpos and updating of the prevailing wage determination pro cess and the coverage threshold oversight has not resulted in conclusive resolution of issues surrounding the davisbacon act debate continues with respect to the application of the act to specific program statutes should all or most federal andor federally assisted contract construction be c overed by prevailing wage requirement should the act apply in cases where indirect federal funding mechanisms are used ie tax credits andor revolving loan funds

election to the senate in 1930 3 for quick historical overview of the act see crs report 94408 the davisbacon act institutional evolution and public policy by william g whittakerthe davisbacon act issues and legislation during the 109th congress the davisbacon act of 1931 s amended requires that not less than the locally prevailing wage be paid to wo rkers employed under federal construction contracts1 it also affects manpower utilization on such projects for example the employment of helpers or unskilledsemiskilled general utility workers with respect to the implementation of the act congress has assigned wide administrative responsibility to the secretary of labor but legislative oversight has continued more or less continuously at least since the 1950s through the years davisbacon provisions have been written into numerous program statutes application of the act to these and to new legislative programs has continued to spark congressional interest some have urged that the prevailing wage statute is as important now as it wa s in the 1930s others contend that the requirement should be set asid in order to stretch cons truction dollars by permitting payment of less than locally prevailing rates frequently the davisbacon or prevailing rate question has been contested within the context of program statutes in which wages were not central focus though nonetheless of considerable importance introducing the davisbacon act in 1931 at the urging of the hoover administration congress enacted prevailing wage legislation for federal contract construction legislation cosponsored by representative robert b acon rny and sena tor james davis r pa ie the davisbacon act2 the act was significantly amended in 1935 and its scope broadened in 1964 the definition of prevailing wa ge was expanded to include fringe benefits component otherwise th act remains essentially in its 1935 form3 although there have been intermittent effort s to repeal the davisbacon act and thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33363crs2 4 some employers it was alleged had paid the prevailing wage to their workers but then demanded rebates or kickbacks to end this practice congress passed the copeland anti kickback act in 1934 pl 73324 though not part of the davisbacon act it operates in tandem with that statute and in policy terms is usually part of the davisbacon debate 5 there does not appear to be any systematic analysis of the gap if any between the floor provided by the davisbacon act and the wages actually paid to construction workers on covered projects 6 with the fitzgerald act in 1937 29 usc 50 ff the federal government assumed an oversight role with respect to apprentice trai ning workers enrolled in programs recognized continuedrelated copeland anti kickback act 19344 such initiatives have been consistently rejected by congress which has th rough the years added davisbacon requirements to numerous i ndividual program statutes the structure and cont ext of davisbacon the davisbacon act requires that fe deral and some fe derally assisted construction contracts specify the minimum wage rates to be paid to the various categories of laborers workin g under those contracts minimum wages are defined as those rates of pay found by the secretary of labor to be prevailing b in the locality of the project c for similar crafts and skills d on comparable construction work the concept of locality is usually but not necessarily always county or metropolitan area normally construction work is divided into four categories residential nonresidential buildings highway and heavy construction the act does not require that collectively bargai ned union wages be paid unless such wages happen to be prevailing in the locality where the work takes place further the prevailing rate for davisbacon purposes represents floor not necessarily the rate that construction firm will have to pay in order to recruit and retain qualified workers5 typically the department of labor dol conducts two types of wage rate determinations general ar ea determinations and wher necessary specific project determinations dol sometimes collects data through direct survey process more often it works from data provi ded by contractors trade unions and other interested parties it may use both methods jointly the act requires that the advertised specifications for every construction contract in excess of 2000 to which the ited states or the district of columbia is party must specify the wage that the secretary of labor determines to be prevailing in the locality for the various classes of laborers and mechanics employed on the covered work speak ing generally dol does not recognize unskilled or semiskilled helpers as class of workers for wage rate determination purposes rather it evaluates workers by craft thus employers are discouraged from employing helpers on davisbacon projects turning to more skilled craftspersons instead dol does however recognize apprentices and encourages the employment on davisbacon projects of persons enrolled in bona fide apprenticeship programs6httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33363crs3 6

credential is portable ie recognized throughout the country such programs are usually funded jointly by th employer and the apprentice through temporarily reduced wage and often by c ontribution from the trade union in the craft the reduced wage option which increases normally with the systematic improvement in the skills of the apprentice tends to encourag employment of apprentices on davisbacon

numerous federal program statutes some states have enacted little davisbacon acts these state statutes however normally differ from each other and from the federal davisbacon act7 in general labor standards for federal contract procurement are governed by three statutes the davisbacon act app lies only to federal c ontract construction the walshhealey public contracts act 1936 deals with labor standards with respect to goods produced under contr act for the federal government the mcnamaraohara act 1965 popularly known as the rvice contract act deals with labor standards under fede ral service contracts the statutes do not apply to fully private sector work in addition there is the more general contract work hours and safety standards act 1969 the latter an amalgam of earlier federal workhours and safety enactme nts although the federal contract labor standards statutes supplement each othe r ie for construction goods and services they have different wage floors differe nt triggering mechanisms and other requirements and are applied differently with respect to th various types of fe deral contract work8 the purposes of the act in the 1920s the federal government undertook major program of public works as the nation moved into depr ession after 1929 this program had important implications for the areas where the work wa s to be performed however given thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33363crs4 9 during the late 1920s and early 1930s the contracting community appears to have been very much concerned about establishment of quality controls ethical

prevailing wage legislation in the state monthly labor review aug 1961 pp 839845depth of the economic catastrophe and th scope of unemployment any opportunity for work almost without regard to wa ge rates or conditions under which the work was to be performed was attractive bot h to workers and to struggling firms federal construction contr acts were normally awarded to the lowest responsible bidder process that appears to have limited the options of the various federal agencies when selecting contractor treatment of workers and payment of fair wages were not taken into account the result some argued was the sacrifice of product quality and bor standards for shortterm economy certain itinerant contractors employing workers imported from lowwage parts of the country were able or believed to be able to underbid local contractors for federal construction work in this way it was alleged flybynight operators would win contracts based upon the payment of substandard wages t workers desperate for employment but sometimes lacking mature and or appropriate skills nd then produce an inferior quality of construction in that manner the positive rehabilitative economic impact of public building and public works projects for the various localities was reduced to the disadvantage both of local contractors and local workers alike9 in drafting the davisbacon act cong ress was not searching for the cheapest available labor for federal construction work rather it prescribed payment of not less than the locally prevailing wage in order in part to protect fair local contractors and workers residing in and employed in local markets from contractors and low wage crews from outside of the area of cons truction work thus the original davis bacon act was as much protection fo r fair contractors as for workers10 however supporters have conte nded there is essen tial conflict between the purposes of the statute and securing bargain for the public agency consumer the taxpayer the prevailing wage statute preceded th fair labor standa rds act 1938 with its minimum wage provisions and was thus somewhat new concept in federal labor standards law11 davisbacon was viewed as device that might help to ensure quality of construction to stabilize the local economy and industry and to make thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33363crs5 12 some have questioned whether given the fair labor standards act after 1938 there was continuing need for davisbacon prevailing wage protection 13 proclamations and executive orders herbert hoover march 4 1929 to march 4

hrept 74 332 part 2 74th cong 1st sess washington gpo may 13 1935 pp 79 15 reduction of the coverage threshold appears to have been motivated by at least two considerations first contracts for painting and decora ting were often too small to come under the 5000 figure second it appears that some contractors artfully divided work into small parcels in order to avoid davisbacon coverage reducing the threshold to 2000 was viewed as means through which to extend coveragefederal government i ndirectly through its power as consumer model for private sector employers with re spect to labor standards12 continuing process in 1931 the davisbacon legislation was regarded as an emergency measure it sparked little controversy at the time of its enactment and from review of the hearings and debates of th at period it seems clear that congress anticipated none of the administrative problems that would ensue few of the terms or concepts embodied within the statute were defined provision was made for predetermination of the prevailing wage rate only after bid was submitted and contract awarded would cont ractor learn what his wage obligations might be how disputes were to be adjusted was not specified it was assumed that the secretary of labor would have little difficulty enforcing the act but complications were soon to arise almost immediately restructuring of the act commenced as congress and the administration each began process of rea ssessment in early 1932 in an effort to preempt action by the congress pr esident hoover moved to strengthen administration of the statute through executive order 577813 although congress proceeded with general oversight of the act and ultimately adopted reform legislation that initiative was vetoed by president hoover14 the copeland anti kickback act 1934 helped ensure that th appropriate rates w ould be paid without improper deductions then in 1935 congress approved basic changes to the statute the 1935 amendments reduced th coverage threshold from 5000 to 2000 b extended coverage from only public buildings as in the original enactment to construction alterati on andor repair including pa inting and decorating of public buildings or public works and c required that the locally prevailing davisbacon wage rates be predetermined that is prior to solicitation of bids and that they be written into bid solicitations15httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33363crs6 16 among trade unionists the davisbacon act affects primarily persons involved in the building and construction trades where the statute seems to have general support critics of the act however are more diverse group in some measure industry is split in policy terms the division of opinion seems to be more often philosophical reflecting basic attitudes toward labormanagement relations ra ther than division along partisan political lines the distinctions are not always neatly drawn the debate over davisbacon by the 1950s congress had begun to dd davisbacon provisions to various program statutes in which federal funding made the work possible but such extensions of coverage which would i nvolve new and different types of contract work and new body of contractors s eem to have sparked increased uneasiness with the act despite numerous efforts by davisbacon critics however proposals to weaken the prevailing wage legislation were uniformly rejected by congress through the years arguments for and ag ainst davisbacon have become largely fixed so have counter argume nts of defenders and critics the logic and many of the assumptions these arguments contain have b een questioned at length in the evolving debate few contentions about the act have gone or are likely to go unchallenged on both sides there are truths that advocates tend to accept without question current policy debate has focused upon change to amend the act whether to strengthen it or to diminish its impact or to repeal the statute outright outlined below are some of the arguments advanced by critics and by defenders of davisbacon expressed in summary as each side in the ongoing debate might state them some of these arguments pro nd may not appear on the surface to be consistent but then not all critics or defenders of the act can be expected to make precisely the same assumptions further rdly phrase of either set of arguments has passed without refutati on and counterrefutation16 perspectives of davisbacon critics some critics of davisbac on argue that the act is inflationary unnecessarily increasing public construction costs that it is difficult to administer that it has frequently been inequitably administered and that it hampers competition especially with respect to small and minorityowned businesses that may be unfamiliar with federal contracting procedures and lack the staff to deal with the requirements such procedures impose they contend that the act impedes efficient manpower utilization limiting the use of helpe rs or general utility workers some argue were davisbacon restrictions ab sent that contractors would be able to restructure the work to be performed divi ding tasks into less complex assignments in order to make practical the employment of workers who may be less skilled and who are also less expensive to employ the result they argue would be increased efficiency and they suggest this woul d likely open more employment opportunities to minorities and women allowing them to gain work experience and onthejob training while reducing the costs of public constructionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33363crs7 17 again one needs to recall that the davisbacon prevailing rate is floor not necessarily the rate that employers will actually have to pay dol suggests that union rates are used only where they are found to be prevailing in locality 18 conversely some argue that in the fully pr ivate sector there is significant amount of quality construction work that is perfo rmed without davisbacon protectionbesides critics note the davisb acon act 1931 1935 was enacted before there were federal minimum wage standards with the general minimum wage floor established under the fair bor standards act 1938 they suggest the davisbacon act is longer needed that is that super minimum wage for federal construction work is both unnecessary and ine quitable they assert that labor costs for federal construction coul d be reduced with savings for the taxpayer if actual local market wages were paid rather than administratively determined locally prevailing wages which some argue may often be union rates17 in addition they urge simplification of the copeland acts reporting requirements arguing that simple declaration of compliance would have equal effect that compliance with existing law is onerous bureau cratic and that reports are rarely even examined perspectives of davisbacon supporters supporters of davisbac on often contend that the act prevents cutthroat competition from flybynight firms that undercut local wages and working conditions and compete unfairly with local contractors that the act helps stabilize the local construction industry an advantag to workers and employers alike the act they suggest may tend to assure the consuming agency of higher quality work since employers required to pay at least the locally prevailing wage are likely to hire more competent and productive workers resulting in better workmanship less waste reduced need for supervision and fewer mistakes requiring corrective action18 this may lead to fewer cost overruns and more timely completion of public construction and in the longterm lowe r rehabilitation and repa ir needs thus some argue the davisbacon act could actually save the taxpayer money on public construction supporters of the act also argue that davisbacon deters contractors from fragmenting construction tasks in order to utilize lowwage and lowskill helpers or pickup crews some argue that wit hout davisbacon and in the absence of collective bargaining agreement contract ors would probably be unlikely to provide training beyond the necessary and narrow requirements of the job and would not likely enter into formal program such as those monitored by dols bureau of apprenticeship and training reducing or eliminating apprenticeship programs in the construction industry might work to the disadvantage of minority and women workers who are entering the building trad in growing numbers in addition some assert that if helpers are substituted for skilled craft workers it would likely be minorities and some women who might be laid off or forced into lowerwage jobs that failed to take advantage of their skillshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33363crs8 19 see also crs report 94908 davisbacon the act and the literature by william g whittakerwhat do we really know about the impact of the davisbacon act perhaps the most frequently asked questi on concerning the davisbacon act is how much money could be sa ved if davisbacon were repealed or modified to narrow its scope the short and honest an swer is probably one really knows conversely does davisbac on save money for the fe deral government in its purchases of construction for example employment of more highly skilled workers on davisbacon projects here again response may also be uncertain davisbacon literature is ex tensive and diverse much of it in the form of public materials ie agency reports and analyses journalists have taken continuing interest in the act resulting in substantial popular literature serious academic studies may be fewer it is extremely di fficult for an independent scholar to review the administration of the act to assess its impact first there is the scope of the task vast numbers of pr ojects scattered throughout th united states administered by different agencies nd invol ving hundreds of contractors and subcontractors working under dissimilar circumstances and in diverse labor markets second there is the problem of the availability of doc umentation since the contractors involved are of the private sector how much information has been preserved third access presents problem assuming that the data and documents have been preserved and could be made available securing such documentation and access to administrative personnel may be probl ematic both from the private sector contractors workers and unions and from the various public agencies if one assumes that documentation exists access is allowed that all of the parties are cooperative and that the means financial nd other are available for such an undertaking there remains fourth complication the analyst would be comparing something that did happen with something that in fact for whatever reasons did not happen payroll records labormanagement relationships availability of skilled worker s quality of supervision in ternal agency memoranda etc all relate to an actua l project and not to what mig ht have happened under other circumstances in the absence of davisbacon require ment would the contract have gone to the same contractor if so or if not w ould the contract have been managed in the same way did the act have any impact upon the wages actually paid or upon workforce utilization without davisb acon would different workers have been employed the work of governmental researcher may be further complicated by political or public po licy considerations19 for all of these reasons there appear to be significant gaps in our knowledge of the act and of its administration despite oversight by congress extensive study by public and private agencies and the work of individual scholars further few studieshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33363crs9 20 distinction needs to be made between labor costs and project costs higher labor costs could result in lower project costs if more efficient and more skilled workers are employed but as practical matter to what extent are actual project costs governed by the requirements of the davisbacon act might they reflect the manner of federal agency oversight and monitoring of the progress of the work is federal construction work supervised as closely as that of the private sector what might be the impact of other federal requirements style of constructionarch itecture especially for ceremonial buildings is cost impacted by various set

controversy in the construction industry journal of labor research fall 1992 pp 421435of the act whether public or private have escaped criticism on grounds of flawed methodology or inadequate sample size thus preci estimates of impacts ought to be viewed with considerable caution20 some areas of continuing concern the davisbacon act has been focu s of legislative and administrative consideration dol has instituted its ow n reform initiatives most notably during the reagan administration but these have often proven c ontentious and have resulted in prolonged litigation among areas of continuing concern and controversy are those discussed below the helper issue the davisbacon act make s mention of helpers nor does it refer to trainees apprentices or other skill groups rather it refers to various classes of laborers and mechanics and then leaves up to the secretary of labor the determination of just what those various classes might be and how they might be distinguished one from the other but just what is helper and how might he or she be differentiated from laborer or skilled construction worker an equally contentious issue has been whether the use of helpers is common or prevailing practice in the locality of propos ed federal construction project21 setting out the issue under davisbacon before bids are solicited the minimum locally prevailing wage rate is determined for each category of worker that might be used on the project where helper category is not recognized in the locality of the projected construction craf t or laborer rates have to be paid potentially but not necessarily increasing the labor cost of such construction on the other hand recognition of helper categ ory where it is not common or prevailing area practice could defeat the purposes of the act ie allowing contractors to fragment tasks so that lowskilled lowwage helpers could be employed instead of laborers and craft workers resulting in downward wage spiral further

tions have remained part of the debate over the helper issue through more than two decades and with the dawn of the 21st century they remain largely unresolved the position of dol on the issue has varied over time efforts to revise the helper requirement through the years helpers have been employed on davisbacon c onstruction where their use was common in the area of the projected work and where they were clearly distinguished from laborers and from skilled craft workers however such use of helpers appears to have been infrequent during the late 1970s the carter administration opened the general issue of davisb acon implementation for bate and public comment seizing the opportunity industry urged closer adherence to area practice when establishing worker classifications especially helper classifications22 but before new davisbacon regu lations could be given effe ct president carter was replaced in office by president reagan regulations proposed by the former administration were withdrawn nd their substance reconsidered new davisbacon regulations proposed by the reagan administration in may 1982 redefined the concept of helper nd poten tially expanded their use this change was applauded by industry and obj ected to by the building trades unions23 litigation followed in order to circumvent objections raised by the courts dol redrafted the helper regulations in january 1989 during the bush administration the courts acquiesced in the judgment of the department and cleared the regulations for implementation at that juncture congress objected refu sing to appropriate funds for implementation and enforcement of the regulation this restraint continued into the 1990s disappearing during fis cal 1996 then another impediment was raised dol under the clinton administration declined to act in june 1996 the associated builders nd contractors brought suit to require dol to enforce its helper regulations dol responded quickly and in late july assistant secretary bernard anderson affirm ed that the helper regulation approved but still suspended was simply nonadmin istratable anderson explained that the distinction between helpers and other workers in terms of their role and duties was insufficiently clear and that dol had intention of implementing the regulation in its current form24 in federal register notice of august 2 1996 dol noted that

beco available which warrants review of the suspended rule therefore the regulation remained in abeyance while dol engaged in substantive rulemaking on the issue25 through the next five months dol r eassessed the data and in december 1996 it announced that the helper regulati on would remain spended until the department either 1 issues final rule amending and superseding the suspended helper regulations or 2 determines that further rulemaking is appropriate and issues final rule reinstating the suspended regulations26 in july 1997 the us district court for the district of columbia ruled that the department was within its rights to issue an indefinite suspension of the helper regulation27 then in april 1999 dol issued new proposed rule th at would essentially reaffirm the status quo prior to the carter administration in itiatives of the late 1970s two decades earlier28 thus the use of helpers would be limited to demonstrated common area practice where they were clearly differentiated from laborers and other craft workers under the proposed rule their use could be expected to be infrequent another look fr om the congress late in the 105th congress representative charlie norwood rga in troduced legislation that would have created special category of workers ie helpers for davisbacon purposes but action was taken on the proposal early in the 106th congress in march 1999 the congressman introduced new legislation that would have tablished separate helper classification under the davisb acon act on july 21 1999 the house subcommittee on oversight and investigations committee on education and the workforce conducted general hearing on the impact of davisbacon helper rules for job opportunities in the construction i ndustry the subcommittee however took further action the rwood bill was not reported the helper issue also arose during committee consideration of the labor health and human services and education appropriations for fy2000 in that instance representative anne northup r ky raised objection to the helper regulation that dol had proposed in apr il 1999 at the congresswomans request language was added during ma rkup that would have deni ed funding to implement administer or enforce the helper rule proposed by the clinton administration however through the legislative proce ss the provision was dropped what impact its inclusion would have had may not have been entirely clear since in essence it would have codified existing practice as the 106th congress was drawing to close dol issued new final regulation governing the use of helpers it was dated n ovember 14 2000 and was set to take effect 60 days after its publication in the federal register just hours prior to the end of the clinton administra tion the regulation

helper is not employed as trainee in an informal training program the work of helper is not to be perfo rmed by any other cl assification of worker in the wage determination29 while this final regulation from the clinton administration has now gone into effect it may not be the end of the proce ss on the one hand the department could at its discretion reevaluate the helper question and issu new proposed rule or conversely congress could ttempt to resolve the issu through new legislation on may 23 2001 representative norwood in troduced legislation that had it been passed would have redefined the concept of helper and would have permitted the use of helpers on davisbacon projects the bill was referred to the subcommittee on workforce protections where it remained at the close of the 107th congress initiatives of the 108th congress in the 108th congress the helper issue was raised again by representative mars blackburn rtn with the introduction of new legislation the blackburn bill w ould mandate recognition for wage rate determination purposes of helpers as separate workforce classification and b require that helper be paid the preva iling wage of helpers employed on projects which are of character similar to the project on which the helper is employed in the locality in which the helper is employed the bill continues the term helper means semiskilled worker other than skilled journeyman mechanic who 1 works under the direction of and assists journeyman 2 under the journeymans direction and supervision performs variety of duties to assist the journeyman such as preparing carrying and furnishing materials tools quipment and supplies maintaining them in order cleaning and prep aring work areas lifting positioning and holding materials or tools nd other related semiskilled tasks as directed by the journeyman and 3 may use tools of the trade at and under the direction and supervision of the journeyman the blackburn bill was referred to the committee on

the workforce and on november 7 2005 wa s referred to the subcommittee on workforce protections the site of the work coverage issue the initial davisbacon act of 1931 was relatively simple statute but with experience the statute was modified in 1935 new lang uage was added to provide that the acts prevailing wage requirements should apply to the contractor or his subcontractor and to all m echanics and laborers employed directly upon the site of the work30 through the years with implementation of the act questions have arisen with respect to this seemingly uncomplicated pr ovision for example what is the site of the work and how is directly to be fined by whom must the workers in question be employed these concepts have changed over time with altered technology and industry practice but ra ther than being quietly resolved the site of the work issue would b ecome subject of administr ative review and ultimately of litigation31 rulemaking in this area would continue until near the close of the clinton administration late in 2000 litigation would be extensive questions of interpretation differences in the interpretation of the site of the work are numerous for example given the specific wording of the statute if workers engaged in the construction of building working on the structure itself were covered by davis bacon would workers in an adjoining space mixing mortar etc be similarly covered how far removed from the actual structure could such work take place and still be regarded as d irectly upon the site of the work where some assembly of components is undertaken in holding area down the street little way would workers engaged in such assembly be regarded as employed directly upon the site of the work for davisbacon coverage purposes if prefabricated units to be used at construction site in alaska were assembled at site in seattle thousand miles away would the seattle workshop be considered part of the site of the work as one begins to apply the statute questions multiply for example one might use the case noted above is the site in seattle owned by the firm operating in alaska are the employees engaged in the work in seattle direct employees of the alaska firm is the seattle site dedicated solely to the alaska project or is the work in seattle being performed by manufacturing plant that makes and sells components to any construction firm engaging in work public or private are thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33363crs14 32 several options could come into play th components in this hypothetical case could be offtheshelf purchases in which federal labor standards requirements may not be an issue they could be contract purchas of goods covered by the walshhealey public contracts act rather than the davisbacon act or if purchased from the manufacturer and installed by employees of the manufacturer the work coul d be regarded as an adjunct to the purchase of the goods possibly walshhealey covered or part of service contract covered under the mcnamaraohara service contract act the particular circumstances likely different in each case would seem to be determinative these issues were the subject of extensive hearings during the early 1960s with respec t to missile site development see us congress house committee on education nd labor special subcommittee on labor administration of th davisbacon act hearings 87th cong 2nd

the drivers from davisbacon coverage such questions may seem tedious but they have been through decades the subject of rulings from the comptroller general and focus of litigation andor of appeals through the hierarchy of dol am ong federal contracting agencies there has not always been agreement on these matters they have also been focus of attention for those who wish to extend davisbacon coverage broadly and for those who favor narrower application of the act dol has sought to deal with these issues through the regulatory process and continues to do so but with mixed results even precise judicial rulings have been insufficient to prevent partisans from finding nuances of meaning either in the statute or in the regulations from which further litigation might blossom33httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33363crs15 34 bureau of national affairs daily labor report sept 21 2000 pp a8a9 and federal register sept 21 2000 pp 5726957276 35 bureau of national affairs daily

through further litigation the clean water act and prevailing wage in 1961 congress passed federa l water quality legislati on that would emerge as what is now popularly known as the clean water act cwa included in the 1961 legislation was provision applying davisbacon prevailing wage requirements to construction of sewage trea tment facilities where ther was federal involvement ie direct federal assistance notab ly through grants to the states an altered requirement in 1987 congress shifted its focus rather than continuing with program of direct federa l funding grants of such construction it established structure of state revolving loan funds srfs about 80 federally funded with 20 nonfederal matching funds congress expected that by fy1995 the srfs would provide continuing sour ce of financing for pollution abatement and that the federal role further appropriations would end in authorizing legislation 1987 congress mandated da visbacon coverage for such work commenced prior to fy1995 things did not work out as anticipated however first the srfs did not provide an adequate source of fund ing for pollution abatement work second congress continued to fund this work though

authorizing legislation was adopted after 1987 however congress continued to appropriate funds for the cwa and the srf program continued thus question arose if the abatemen t program remained federal in terms of funding and priorities notwithstanding th absence of authorizing legislation should the statutorily mandated administr ative requirements of that program including the prevailing wage requireme nt remain in place in 1995 the environmental protection agency epa d eclared that davisbacon would longer apply to srfrelated construction that the requirement but not the funding had terminated at the end of the period c overed by the 1987 authorization ie by fy1995 thereafter agencies involved in such work would be permitted to pay contract construction workers less than the locally prevailing wage the market permitting and to avoid any other perceived disadvantages associated with davis bacon coverage the building and construction trades partment of the aflcio or bctd protested and following extended negotiation epa changed its pos ition in may 2000 it proposed settlement agreemen t under which davisbacon would once more apply to certain cwasrf constr uction and in an announcement published in the federal register of june 22 2000 called for co mment comment was sharply divided some industry groups and local g overnmental entities use rs of construction labor urged that davisbacon not apply and for the most part argued that epa was moving beyond its statutory authority in attempting to reinst ate that requirement the bctd conversely held that davisbacon did apply and ultimately with the concurrence of epa that the environmental agency was statutorily bound to enforce the prevailing wage requirement in the federal register of january 25 2001 epa decided that davisbacon did and should apply and would be applied effective on july 1 2001 subsequently epa moved the effective date back to september 1 2001 and then to october 1 2001 the situation then became somewhat ambiguous37 consideration during the 107th congress debate on the davisbacon provision of the clean water act continued into the 107th congress as the house and senate commenced
