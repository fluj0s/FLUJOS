comment trackback sorry adb this site is longer yours the school isnt yours the school and this site belong to us the students it belongs to the students who are here now i am hijacking this site it is now the leelanau students place to speak our minds the old site adbs site was about fighting subversively to get what you want what we want better system but now this site wont be about fuck the school they made take piss test theyre invading my privacy its not about fuck the school heres how you can piss them off hack its longer about fuck the school look what they did the new site is about news whats going on and how we can fix the problems the new site is by students for students and about students i would like to kick off the new leelanau talk with this update i have been going to leelanau for 2 years now and i am very pleased with the way my education has been shaped and effected by the school that being said there are some issues i want to bring forth these are all issues i have brought up in student council as the senior class representative issue 1 cameras the school i suppose over the summer installed 2 cameras in the kac this is to deter students from misbehaving pulling pranks and most of all having sex in the kac this issue has been talked about at almost every meeting and we are thinking about making petition against these cameras the other issue involving cameras is that another camera has been put out on the beach this is assumed to be about catching smokers one is quite sure who is watching these cameras and who looks at the tapes if there are any tapes at all i have heard that the cameras feed into mr beggs office which has yet to be confirmed please talk about this issue and help raise awareness issue 2 ms sunshines new discipline policy after mr sonnenberg left his role as assistant to residence life and as the disciplinary goto guy he went on to become the schools gym teacher which i am told he enjoys very much the school has put ms smithbell as the new disciplinary leader she remade lot of the policies and her explanation for the new title miss sunshine can be read on her office door the new discipline system is hard to read at best it is even harder to describe but the idea is to come up with individual punishments for different individuals while i believe her heart is in the right place and anything is better than last years system there are huge flaws in this new system for one there is more dorming ms smithbell has told that it makes her feel like she doing the old go to your room which we all went through when we were young the problem is that there are ideas of other punishments that seem to work we have tried giving apologies to the student body at quiet period we have tried snow shoveling the newest idea both of which are deterrent but most students just refuse to do these things i met with ms smithbell today regarding my lack of attendance to first hour class which i will admit is problem and she told she was getting tired of students disrespecting her i would have to agree that some students are being very disrespectful but what she told next was just too much she said that if students continued to miss classes skip classes or not sign in to morning sign in these students would not be asked to come back next semester she also told that some students were already chosen to not come back this is not the leelanau school way and i ask you all to write or talk to her about this new direction i have not had chance to bring this up in student council but i will come the next meeting issue 3 breadcereal bar if you havent noticed the leelanau cafeteria has recently made the decision to remove the bread bar and the cereal bar during lunch and dinner this im told is because certain students are eating straight carbohydrate diet which is extremely unhealthy this goes back to the issue the school has forgive if im being too preachy here of simply removing something when it would be better to educate the problem students and leave everyone else alone theyre using sword were they should be using scalpel if you hadnt guessed who was writing this you probably know now this is an issue i have been on top of since it became an issue i have made the decision to not eat in the cafeteria until the bread bar and cereal bar are brought back as peaceful protest and i invite anyone who wants to help out to do the same i love jims cooking and i hated to miss the thanksgiving feast which im told was amazing but i need to do this for myself and for my fellow classmates those are the issues i can think of right now as more arise i will post them when i can usually weekends at the coffee shop thanks for the new domain adb but this site is ours now contact if you want to get

suppose the question remains has the site been hijacked by dan stravinskas senior class representative 2009 so that only content not objectionable to him is published or does this site remain forum for the expression of revolutionary even radical ideas as well as those which might be considered more mainstream as far back as when i attended the leelanau schoolsleelanau for boys the great majority of leelanau staff members conspired to limit and control student thinking and expression often by the exercise of physical force the owner one arthur major huey did so with the application of firearms and waterdunking when confronted by student complaints of staff violence the headmaster one charles w shinn enforced with fisticuffs in his office with the door closed from their examples and that of other similarly inclined staff i learned that surviving comfortably had its basis in the application of force but only if one had the power and authority to do so the written expression of ideas not in line with those of staff as well as applying the lessons learned from staff about violence led to my graduating from leelanau in absentia too those factors spurred further research the results being enlistment in the military rising to the commissioned ranks voluntary enrollment in multitude of military schools the finest of which qualified in special forces the motto of which is oppresso liber and which prompted two voluntary combat tours with that unit concerted devotion to education in the skilled application of extreme force and dedication to the liberties to which americans are entitled by the united states consitution it is doubtful that i would have embarked upon such path had physical abuse and moral abstinence not been the shining light by which leelanau philosophy was and apparently still is guided in retrospect perhaps gratitude is due those leelanau staff members who most violated the law and their educational trust adb february 2nd 2009 at 0556 reply quote 3 just to clarify this site hasnt been hijacked and still remains under my control there is reason to be concerned about the security of the site that being said i do not control the site and this is still place that people can freely post their radical revolutionary ideas people who have ideas contrary to mine can still post them and ill still let them be here matter how much i disagree with them drawer 22 february 3rd 2009 at 1506 reply quote 4 thanks for clarifying my hijacking inquiry and associated security concerns your dedication to principle is greatly appreciated and firmly founded on the ground of that for which i have sworn to stand pat march 25th 2009 at 1109 reply quote 5 anonymous so dirty dan the man following in the footsteps of my crazy ass ex suitmate
