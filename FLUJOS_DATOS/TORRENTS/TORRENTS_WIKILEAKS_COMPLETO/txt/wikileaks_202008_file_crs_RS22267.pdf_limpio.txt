international community to be crucial test of the countrys democratic development as it prepares for eventual membership in nato and the european union eu the incumbent government led by the leftist socialist party and prime minister fatos nano came to power after the 1997 period of unrest and also won the last parliamentary vote in 2001 since the fall of communism in 1991 albania s political scene has been largely shaped by bitter feud between the socialist party and the democratic party and especially between their longstanding respective leaders nano and berisha as well as by intermittent power struggles within each party bloc httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22267crs2 1 the preliminary election report by the organi zation for security and cooperation in europe osce assessed that

wwwosceorgdocuments odihr20050715541_enpdfalbania has had relatively poor track r ecord of conducting elections that meet democratic standards in municipal ections held in october 2003 international observers reported numerous irregularities and assessed that the vote did not meet international standards on free and fair elections prior to the 2005 parliamentary vote some electoral reforms were pa ssed including code of c onduct agreed to by all political parties but shortcomings persisted according to international assessments the july vote produced complex result as expected both the socialist party and democratic party dominated the direct ballot portion of the vote 100 seats were directly elected under majority system and 40 by party list under proportional system and the democratic party appeared to capitalize on its anticorruption platform the initial international response to the july vote was warily positive if also critical of problems with voter registration and other processes1 however as in previous elections disputes over procedures and charges of fraud ensued leading to protracted delays in certifying final results albanias central election commission reviewed over 100 complaints of irregularities but called for repeat vote in only 3 districts the rerun in these districts took place on august 21 in the final results the democratic part won 56 seats in conjunction with four much smaller parties it cla imed total of 81 seats solid majority in the 140seat parliament the socialist party won 42 seats alone and 59 seats with four allied parties it was hurt by popular discontent with the na government as well as by the emergence of splinter parties that divi ded the left still disputing the conduct and outcome of the vote nano resigned as socialist party chairman and was succeeded by party official gramoz ruci many analysts believe that the socialist party is in need of major overhaul in the postnano period one potentia l leftist leader
