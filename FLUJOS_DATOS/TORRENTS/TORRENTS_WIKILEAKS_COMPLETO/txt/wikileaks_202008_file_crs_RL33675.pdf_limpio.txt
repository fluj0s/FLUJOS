couples may not have countable resources valued at more than 3000 although persons home and car are excluded from these calculations most other assets owned by person or married couple are counted and in most cases the assets of both partners in marriage are considered shared and equally available to both the husband and the wife persons countable income must be below ssi program guidelines to qualify for benefits and persons monthly benefit level is reduced by portion of his or her earned and unearned income the income of person ineligible for ssi can be considered when calculating the benefit amount of that persons spouse complicated process of deeming is used to determine how much of the ineligible persons income is to be considered when calculating his or her spouses monthly ssi benefits in some cases marriage may result in person being denied ssi benefits or seeing his or her ssi benefit level reduced because of the increase in family income or assets that results from the marriage this can occur if an ssi beneficiary ma rries another ssi beneficiary or person not in the ssi program this potential effect of marriage on the ssi eligibility and benefits of ssi beneficiaries has been called marriage penalty by the national council on disability this report provides an overview of the potential effect of marriage to another ssi recipient or an ineligible

the marriage of an ssi beneficiary to person who does not receive ssi benefits can have negative effect on the ssi beneficiarys eligibility and amount of benefits if the ineligible spouse brings significant income or assets to the family generally the income and assets of both persons in marriage are considered shared and equally available to either person which can result in an increase in the beneficiarys countable income or resources after marriage httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33675g18g152g157g142g151g157g146g138g149g561g7g143g143g142g140g157g561g152g143g561g15g138g155g155g146g138

when an ssi beneficiary marries person who does not receive ssi benefits portion of the ineligible spouses income is assigned or deemed to the ssi beneficiary and is counted as income for the purposes of determining benefit eligibility and the amount of monthly benefits the procedure used to deem income from an inelig ible person to his or her spouse who receives ssi benefits consists of several steps set by regulation and takes into account the overall size of the family13 the four steps in the income deeming process are included below and two examples of income deeming are provided in table 3 at the end of this report

the first step in the deeming process is to determine the countable monthly income of the ineligible spouse by taking his or her total earned and unearned income and reducing it by special limited set of income exclusions generally most income other than federal social service benefits is counted 14

once the countable income of the ineligible spouse has been established this amount is further reduced to account for any ineligible children living in the household or any aliens that the ineligible spouse may be sponsoring 15 for each child or sponsored alien the countable income of the ineligible spouse is reduced by an amount equa l to the difference between the monthly federal ssi benefit rate for couple and the monthly federal ssi benefit rate for an individual16 for 2008 this amount is 319 the difference between the federal ssi benefit rate for couple of 956 and the rate for an individual of 637 g21g157g142g153g561g345g495g561g6g142g157g142g155g150g146g151g146g151g144g561g21g21g11g561g142g149g146g144g146g139g146g149g146g157g162g561 the final countable monthly income of the ineligible spouse is used to determine the continued ssi eligibility of the beneficiary if the final countable income of the ineligible spouse is less than or equal to the difference between the monthly federal ssi benefit rate for couple and the monthly federal ssi benefit rate for an individual 319 for 2008 then income is deemed to the beneficiary and the beneficiary is eligible to continue receiving ssi benefits as an individual if however the final countable income of the ineligible spouse is greater than the difference between the monthly federal ssi benefit rate for couple and the monthly federal ssi benefit rate for an individual then the beneficiary and his or her spouse are considered couple and eligible to receive ssi benefits at the level for couple 13 20 cfr 4161163 14

after step 3 then his or her monthly ssi benefit is equal to the federal benefit rate for an individual minus any of his or her countable income the income of the ineligible spouse is not considered when determining the benefit amount in this case if however the married beneficiary and his or her spouse are considered couple after step 3 then their benefit is reduced by their combined countable income the final countable income of the ineligible spouse is added to the total income of the beneficiary this amount is then reduced by the standard income exclusions and the couples monthly benefit is reduced by this final income amount g6g142g142g150g146g151g144g561g152g143g561g20g142g156g152g158g155g140g142g156g561 unlike the rules governing the deeming of inco from an ineligible spouse to an ssi beneficiary the resource deeming rules are straightforward any resources owned by the ineligible spouse are deemed to the beneficiar all of the resources of married couple are considered to be available to the ssi beneficiary and are subject to the regular ssi resource limitations if the beneficiary is considered single beneficiary then he or she may have countable resources valued at up to 2000 if after the deeming of income he or she is considered part of beneficiary couple then the countable resource limit is 3000 the only exception to this rule is that the pension plan of an ineligible spouse is not deemed to beneficiary
