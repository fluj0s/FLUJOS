sop d15 report on the interpretation of palaeodata using climate simulations representing simulations by reconstructions gerd bürger fu berlin during the sop project phase one was faced with growing number of attempts to reconstruct millennial nh temperatures from various sources of proxy information jones et 1998 mann et 1999 briffa et 2001 briffa 2000 overpeck et 1997 crowley lowery 2000 esper et 2002 moberg 2005 these attempts did not show however converge towards unique millennial history as shown in fig 1 note that the proxy series have already undergone linear transformation towards best estimate to the cru data which makes them look more similar cf briffa and osborn 2002 figure 1 eight recent proxy based nh 20n temperature reconstructions 10y butterworth filter was used for smoothing at the same time series of millennial climate simulations was conducted using estimates of solar irradiance s greenhouse gases g and volcanic aerosols v as external historical forcing ideally the internal natural fluctuations the noise as well as the forcing response the signal is of the same scale and shape in all models and equals reality and with sufficiently large signaltonoise ratio snr for given forcing it should be possible to distinguish the signal from the noise and determine the sensitivity of the climate system to that forcing moreover proxies and models would show the same signal in the real world however both noise and signal tend to depend on the specific model and since proxy reconstructions are imperfect as well the real signal is deeply obscured fig 2 shows two millennial simulations using all three forcings s g and v one from the hadley centre model hadcm3 all simulation and the other from the dkrz model echog erik simulation obviously both models deviate considerably from each other and from the instrumental record jones et 1999 with cold bias of as much as 1k echog and 15k hadcm3 this is compensated for by tropical and sh warm bias not shown which gives much better fit for the global average at least some of the northern hemisphere difference between the two simulations may be because the hadcm3 all simulation has aerosol forcing whereas the erik simulation does not note that gcm parameters are tuned using that average among others as target it is unlikely that from those raw time series forcing signal can be detected figure 2

hadcm3 dashed global landocean grey range of reconstructions cf fig1 however under rather mild assumptions it can be assumed that the response of the system will not change drastically if transfered from the too cold to the normal state therefore it is justified to replace both simulations with corresponding best estimate to the cru data just like the proxies in fig 1 the bestestimate transformation moreover provides compact way to interpret the paleo series in the light of the climate simulations regressing in multivariate way the latter on the former yields for each simulation and reconstruction corresponding regression coefficient as shown in table 1 along with corresponding correlations from this it appears that the echog simulation better fits the proxies with multiple correlation of 078 compared to 048 for the hadcm3 the regression of the latter is equally dominated by the crowleylowery and briffa 2000 reconstruction while the echog regression is almost completely determined by crowleylowery this is probably due to their common long term millennial cooling and then sharp warming trend with correlation of 072 hadcm3 echog regr corr regr coefcorr coef jones et

regressed onto proxy based northern hemisphere temperature reconstructions the regression creates best fit of the reconstructions to each simulation as shown in fig 3 note that also on the smaller decadal time scales echog shows greater covariability with the reconstructions as result the spörer the maunder and the dalton minima are clearly visible larger deviations are seen in the early 12th and late 19th century where the echog simulates much warmer conditions than the reconstructions figure 3 observed cru black and simulated nh temperatures best estimate to cru red hadcm3 blue echog
