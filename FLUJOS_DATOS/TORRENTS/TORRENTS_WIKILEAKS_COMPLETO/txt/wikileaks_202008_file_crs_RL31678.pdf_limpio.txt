provisions that are or might be deemed associated with gpra such as performance measures and strategic plans the research identified 42 public laws from the 106th congress containing statutory language relating to gpra and performance measurement two of these ws were omnibus m easures containing gpraassociated provisions from 10 separate bills arguably better counted as 10 items rather than two for total of 50 enacted measures from the 106th congress with gprarelated provisions previous crs studies id entified 14 public laws with performancerelated provisions enacted during the 104th congress and 28 in the 105th although the rate of increase of 100 from the 104th to the 105th in the number of public laws with gpraassociated provisions was not quite sustained the rate of increase from the 105th to the 106th was significant at almost 79 in addition to statutes with gpraassociated provisions search of committee reports identified 24 additional public laws from the 106th congress that contained gpraassociated passages in accompanying reports compared with 17 laws so identified in the 105th thus total of 74 laws enacted in the 106th congress were determined to have gprarelevant provisions in statutory language or in committee report language compared with total of 45 public laws from the 105th congress with gprarelevant provisions in statute or accompanying reports congressional efforts to oversee gpra implementation continued in the 107th congress moreover the inclusion of budg et and performance integration as key initiative in the presidents management agenda

congress introduction the government performance and results act of 1993 known as gpra or the results act1 sought to promote greater effici ency effectiveness and accountability in federal spending by establishing new framework for performance management and budgeting in federal agencies gp ra establishes three types of ongoing planning evaluation and reporting require ments for executive branch agencies strategic plans covering 6 years but to be revised at least every 3years annual performance plans and annual reports on pr ogram performance in complying with gpra agencies must set goals devise performance measures and then assess results achieved gpra joined number of other budget and financial manage ment reform laws enacted in the last 24 years that were designed to upgrade existing procedures or to provide new mechanisms for managing government operations and improving accountability important new ro were established by the inspector general act of 1978 and the chief financial offi cers cfo act of 1990 the government management and reform act of 1994 and the federa l financial management improvement act of 1996 c ontained important amendments to the cfo act2 in addition to their impact on executive mana gement and accountability these statutes provide new or enhanced data and information about federal programs and performance in turn they establish ne w mechanisms and means for congressional oversight or the review monitoring and supervision of the implementation of public policy3 the framework created by the results act might contribute to several purposes which congressional oversight of the executive branch is designed to fulfill for example reports to congress pursuant to gpra arguably can facilitate evaluation of program performance lead to

broad sense to cover instances of gprarelated language in committee reports as well as more formal provisions in public laws in order to av oid unduly convoluted phraseology generally however such gprarelevant elements from committee reports are referred to as passages 8us library of congress congressional research service performance measure continuedeconomy of governmental opera tions help to assess the ab ility of agencies to manage and carry out program objectiv and assist in reviewing and determining federal financial priorities4 in terms of gpra congre ssional oversight is esse ntial not only to foster successful implementation of the act itself but also to make certain that congress reaps its expected benefits5 the importance of gpra fo r all types of congressional committees was alluded to by then comp troller general char bowsher in 1996 testimony authorization appropriation budget and ove rsight committees all have key interests in ensuring that gpra is successful because once fully implemented it should provide valuable da ta to help inform the decisions that each committee must make6 progress in gpra implementation has pr oved uneven to date some agencies have yet to define fully their goals pr ogram objectives and expected outcomes and results and to develop appropriate measures to gauge their attainment in accordance with gpra standards concerns have b een expressed about th costs and benefits of developing new resultsoriented performance measurement systems about the lack of interagency coordination to use similar measures to compare similar programs and about the need to link results act implementation to the everyday work of program managers supporters of gpra contend that pe rformance management and budgeting are feasible and assert that accountability nd congressional control over the budget will increase as congress gains experience in using objective resultsoriented information to oversee agencies and develop budget priorities however others are concerned that gpra might become futile and wasteful paperwork exercise with its documentation largely ignored on capitol hill this report identifies and analyzes provisions in public laws and committee reports from the 106th congress relating to gpra and its implementation7 this work is sequel to previous crs studies examining such provisions in public laws and their associated reports from the 105th congress8 and in statutes enacted duringhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31678crs3 8continued provisions in the 105th congress analysis of selected compilation by genevieve j

and in committee report language during the 104th congress by genevieve j knezo and william heniff 10for example language referring to perfo rmance of an artistic work was clearly not relevant to our interest whereas language concerning technical performance requirements for facilities or equipment might appear less clearcut but was generally excluded this pruning of the tentative listing of identified ex amples through assessments by the analysts eliminated more than third of the hits from the original computer search relevant excerpts then were captured in electronic format for further analysis genevieve knezo resources science and industry divisi on participated equally with the author in this phase of the research and her contributions are gratefully acknowledgedthe 104th congress9 the purpose of these studies is to review ways in which congress and its committees engage in ove rsight of gpra and more generally monitor implementation efforts by the executive branch agencies this report provides an overview anal ysis of data collected by crs on congressional efforts to monitor the implementation of the government performance and results act during the 106th congress 19992000 the approach entails an assessment of gprarela ted provisions identified in an electronic search of public laws and committee reports it should be noted that this approach covered specific citations to gpra as well as provisions that are or might be deemed associated with gpra such as performance measures and strategic plans after providing an overview of the data this report examines specific references from the 106th congress to gpra and its related documentation methodology online databases were used to identify legislative language of potential interest in committee reports and in the public laws enacted by the 106th congress searching the lexisnexis public law and committee reports libraries created an initial list of hits for the term performance add itional searches were executed to identify other possible variations of language in statutes referencing the government performance and results act eg results act and gpra for this review of the 106th congress the additional search term of strategic plan also was used the resulting electronic files of excerpts were examined to establish the relevance of each occurrence of the keyw ord terms although it was not necessary that the results act or gpra be cited explicitly the identified provisions had to be in accord with the laws requirements or at least allude to performance measurement10 for the 105th congress excerpts from committee report language otherwise meeting the criteria for inclusion but accomp anying bill that was not enacted intohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31678crs4 11committees may choose to issue findings relevant to gpra as committee print or in some other form of documentation rather than as formal committee report however the electronic data files searched in th is study covered only committee reports 12the listing of categories used in the 105th congress provided the starting point for the analysis of provisions in the 106th as well but some modifications were subsequently madelaw were excluded from further considera tion also excluded were references to gpra or to performance measures in oversight reports not attached to any legislation the crs review of the 106th congress is more comprehensive than were the previous efforts in that contents from all committee reports were examined committee reports searched for the 106th congress included reports accompanying legislation enacted or vetoed legislativ reports accompanying bills that received committee action in at least one chamber but did not become public law as well as oversight reports in some cases there were segments relevant to performance measures in the committee reports but not in the statutory language itself where language in committee report simply repeated bill language or reflected changes in current law that would occur with enactment the pa ssages from the report generally were not included in this analysis additional cav eats should be mentioned first committee report language does not reflect the full extent to which committees provided commentary or guidance on performance measures committee hearings doubtless contain additional references and particularly during development and revision of the strategic plans informal meetings of congressional and agency staff often occur second report language as we ll as public laws may incl ude provisions relevant to gpra implementation however unless gpra or performance or strategic plan were mentioned the provision wa s not captured in this survey11 as was done in the previous crs studi of performance measure provisions for the purposes of facilitating the analysis of provisions identified in public laws and reports from the 106th congress listing of descriptive attributes was established12 items in the listing were suggested by the excerpts of legislative language selectedand were intended to identify similar type s of language alb eit not necessarily identical moreover these categories were not designed to be mutually exclusive given provision could be judged to refl ect more than one category nor are the categories necessarily of equal significance some appear to be more important than others the excerpted passages were then assigned to these categories grouped under five broad headings which included refe rences to gpra nd related documents congressional guidance to agency implementation of performance measures congressional instruction to recipients of federal funding about gpra application gpra and budget matters and other perfo rmancerelated components these five headings then provided the framework fo r the discussion and analysis of the provisions in addition to an overview of gpraassociated provisions in the 106 th congress this report covers the first h eading references to gpra and related documents while others are to be addre ssed subsequently in companion report quantitative analysis was limited to counts of whether certain categories apply to the gpraassociated provisions iden tified in laws and reports from the 106th congress for example the number of laws and reports that explicitly mention thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31678crs5 13the author wishes to acknowledge the assi stance of clay wellborn and kevin gates in creating the access database and producing the counts and cross tabulations needed for the analysis of grpar elated provisions 14crs report 971059 op cit p 3 15however four of these public laws included reference to astrategic plan but not to performance or directly to gpra since str ategic plan was not used as search term in the crs studies of previous congresses for purposes of comparison it could be argued that it is more accurate to exclude the latter four and use the figure of 46 laws with performance measure provisions in the 106th congress however since the figures on occurrences in the 106th congress have relevance aside from comparisons with previous congresses it was decided to use the adjusted figure of 50 public laws from the 106th congress identified with gp raassociated provisionsresults act was indicated most of the categories however do not lend themselves to quantitative analysis because the ways in which they apply in different cases are not equivalent in addition quantitative analysis of categ ories that are not analogous cannot be meaningfully compared categ ory was counted only once for given law or report to which it applied for example if one report mentioned gpra 10 times and another only once they were treated as two occurrences not 11 the use of this conservative approach reduces the risk of ar tificially inflating the significance of the occurrences the numbers referred to in the subsequent discu ssion were derived by creating an access database of the gp rarelated passages nd their attributes13 another caveat mentioned originally in the report for the 104th congress bears repeating but arguably now may be receding as concern while number of committee reports contain performanceoriented language it is not possible to determine if this is change from previous congresses earlier laws and committee reports perhaps even predating 1993 may have included requirements for agencies to provide perform ancerelated data14 however without th availability of data over longer period particularly some benc hmarks for the situation before enactment of gpra conclusions based on apparent trends over time such as changes in the frequency of including provisions requiring performance information or in the types of such provisions rema in less than certain overview of provisions in 106th congress the research identified 42 relevant public laws from the 106th congress containing statutory language relating to gpra and performance measures see listing in appendix two of these laws were omnibus measur the consolidated appropriations act for fy2000 contained gpraassociated provisions from six originally freestanding bills while th consolidated appropriations act for 2001 incorporated relevant provisions from four measures so arguably p l 106113 and pl 106554 should be counted as constitutin g 10 items rather than two for total of 50 enacted measures from the 106th congress with explicit gpra or gpra related provisions15 previous crs studies identified 14 public laws with performancerelated provisions enacted during the 104th congress and 28 in the 105th while the rate ofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31678crs6 16the reports accompanying vetoed measures were gr ouped with those accompanying enacted bills because of the 14 reports in this category 10 accompanied appropriations measures eventually enacted under some rubric other than that of the original bill three from house appropriations committee four from senate appropriations committee and three from committees of conference increase of 100 from the 104th to the 105th in the number of public laws with gpraassociated provisions was not quite sustained the rate of increase from the 105th to the 106th was rather convinc ing at almost 79 in addition to statutes with gpraassociated provisions search of committee reports identified 24 more public laws from the 106th congress that contained gpra associated passages in accompanying reports from the house senate or conference committees so total of 74 laws in the 106th congress were acknowledged to have relevant provisions in statute or gp rarelated passages in accompanying committee reports in comparison tota l of 45 public laws from the 105th congress had gpra related provisions 28 of thes contained statutory provi sions while the remaining 17 had relevant passages in accompanying reports in many instances single public law had more than one accompanying report with relevant passages for the 106th congress the study identified total of 118 reports with gpraassociated passages accompanying bills passed by both the house and senate and either enacted into law or vetoed by the president16 of the 118 reports 52 came from house committees 38 from senate committees and 28 from conference committees as noted above in the methodology di scussion crs examination of committee reports from the 106th congress was more comprehensiv than in previous studies of performance measurement provisions the search of committee reports for the 106th congress included legislative reports acco mpanying bills that received committee action in at least one chamber but were not necessarily enacted as well as oversight reports with this expanded purview 87 additional reports with gpraassociated passages were identified 52 from house committees and 35 from senate committees for grand total of 205 reports from the 106th congress with relevant passages appendix b provide s listing of the reports the 205 reports containing gpra associated passages in the 106th congress included 28 from conference committees nd total of 104 from house committees and 73 from senate committees see tables 1 and 2 in the house 18 of the 20 committees were included while in the senate 15 of the 20 committees were represented however in both chambers the committees with the most reports identified with gpraassociated passages were the appropriations committees 19 reports or 14 of all the senate re ports came from the nate appropriations committee and 23 reports or 24 of all the house reports with relevant passages came from the house appropriations co mmittee after the two appropriations committees the senate governmental affairs committee came next with total of 12 reports followed by the house resources committee 12 house education and workforce committee 11 and house science committee 10httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31678crs7 17appropriations subcommittees for which gpraassociated passages were identified in 106th congress committee reports included the house and senate subcommittees on military construction and the senate subcommittee on defense another perspective incorporates the distribution of committees from which the reports with releva nt passages came across the thr ee congresses for which we have data as mentioned above for the pr evious two congresses only reports accompanying measures which became public laws were encompassed by the crs studies for the 106th congress we sought to cover all committee reports however for the purposes of comparison across c ongresses only those reports from the 106th conforming with the previous parameters were included ie committee reports accompanying measures that were enacted or vetoed table 3 provides data for house committees from the 104th 105th and 106th congresses while table 4 reflects the figures for senate committ ees over the same sixyear period following pattern seen previously in the 104th and 105th congresses and for the 106th congress as well the committees submitting the most reports having gpraassociated passages that accompanied b ills signed into law or vetoed by the president in both house and senate were the appropriations committees in the house 23 out of 52 total reports or 44 were from the appropriations committee and in the senate 18 out of 38 reports or 47 however in the previous congresses the appropriations committees accounted for major ity of the committee reports having gprarelated passages accompanying b ills enacted into law 56 in the 104th congress and 54 in the 103rd congress so while the house and senate appropriations committees retain ed first place for the re spective chambers in the 106th congress reports with gpraasso ciated passages were becoming more broadly dispersed among the various house and senate committees as indicated in table 3 in the 104th congress performance measurementrelated passages appeared in reports of four house committees in the 105th eight committees and in the 106th 18 committees for the senate in the 104th congress these reports came from five committees in the l05th

oversight reports the following discussion considers some examples of such passages in the respective types of committee reports appropriations reports most of the reports from the appropriations committees identified in this study contained multiple references to gpra the examples cited below provide sampling while less prevalent than in the preceding congress general language conveying committee support for gpra was inserted in many committee reports from the 106th congress one such instance occurred in the senate report accompanying the agriculture appropriations bill for fy2001 after alluding to the gpra requirements the report stated the committee supports the concepts of this law and intends to use the agencies plans for funding purposes the committee considers gpra to be viable way to reduce federal spending while achieving more efficient and effective government and will closely m onitor compliance with this law the committee is fully committed to the success and outcome of gpra requirements as envisioned by the congress the administration and this committee19 comments in committee report regardin g support for gpra and progress to date were also directed to particular agency for example the senate report accompanying the fy2000 laborhhseducati on bill noted with specific reference to the administration on aging the co mmittee supports the efforts of the agency in implementing the government performance and results act and believes the agency should continue work in this area20 in the senate report accompanying the fy2001 transportation appropriations bill separate section titled government performance and results act placed within the summary of major recomme ndations discussion likewise conveyed support and praise for gpra the co mmittee is fully committed to support the transportation department as it seeks to implement the requirements of the results act and commends the department for its aggressive implementation of

report citing both accomplishments and shortcomings to date in its performance report for fy 1999 the department of transportation included da ta for over 90 of the measures in the 1999 plan with the depa rtment meeting or approaching had positive trend for about 77 of its 1999 goal s however for five goals missed by significant amount the department is re viewing its strategies to see if they need to be changed22 the committee report also examined transportations fy2001 performance plan concluding clearly the transportation department has made major strides with its performance plan but that plan has yet to penetrate the daytoday operations of the department the modal administrati ons or the procurement or personnel processes in short the plans are very useful documents for determining how the department views the relative and absolute importance of its disparate goals and valuable gauge of whether the depa rtmental leadership is serious about remedying identified deficiencies or inconsistencies in programs activities management or direction23 sometimes the appropriations reports contained an overview assessment of gpra implementation for all the major agenci funded in the bill for example in the senate report accompanying the vahud fy2000 appropriations an introductory section titled government performance and results act noted the committee remains very concerne d regarding the compliance of the major agencies within the jurisdicti on of the appropriations subcommittee on va hud and independent agencies with regard to the government performance and results act gpra while each agency has made progress toward compliance with gpra each s additional progress to make each agency must do better at providing objective measurable goals for all program activities and projects and each budget justification must tie these goals into coherent set of funding requests 24 another format for presentation of committee observations regarding gpra was used in the senate report accompan ying the fy2001 laborhhseducation bill this report included as part of its intr oductory discussion separate section on gpra however there were general remarks across agencies but rather specific observations regarding the performance plans and reports provided for each cabinet department covered by the bill for example the committee seemed quite pleased with gpra

reports accompan ying labor hhseducation appropriations bills appeared to contain among the most in the house report accompanying the fy2000 bill there were over 50 mentions of gpra and over 100 hits on related terms such as performance measure and strategic plan26 in section titled government performance and results act to ward the beginning of the report the committee stated that it continues to believe that the departments and agencies within its jurisdiction have made adequate progress in establishment of goals and benchmarks yet remain long wa from meeting its overall intent27 i n subsequent sections the report notes repeatedly the committee is concerned that after two years of congressi onal interest and six years since the passage of gpra specified agency or program funded via the bill has not identified specific numerical performance goals or specific measurable standards however the committees report language on occasion wa s quite complimentary with regard to gpra implementation for example in the house report accompanying the laborhhseducation fy2001 bill the committee conveyed special approval in discussion of the account for departmental management salaries and expenses for the education department the committee continues to be pleased with the emphasis the departments senior management team has placed on complying with the government performance and results act the committee expects the department to conti nue to develop and re fine gpra measures for all programs28 there was at least one instance in report from conference committee accompanying

government reform committee along with the subcommittee on legislative and budget process of the house rules committee held joint oversight hearing on linking program funding to performance results38 in statement submitted for the record of the september hearing sen fred thompson conveyed some thoughts on the future of gpra observing we still have long way to go in implementing the results act and in making the federal government more resultsoriented and performancebased we are at the point after all these years of implementing the results act where we need to start using performance information to make decisions or we might as well give up on the act39 sen thompson then voiced some optimism regarding the future of gpra noting that he was encouraged by the presiden ts unprecedented interest in and the office of management and budgets new focu s on integrating performance review with budget decisions in similar vein rep stephen horn chairman of the subcommittee on government efficiency financial management and intergovernmental relations observed in his opening stat ement that many agencies have made significant progress in using their gpra plans and reports to measure their performance however the conn ection between performance results and funding decisions has been lacking and until decision makers firmly establish that linkage the results act w ill remain largely paper ex ercise fortunately the current administration is intent on blishing this link rep deborah pryce chairman of the rules subcommittee on the legislative and budget process likewise noted that she was encouraged by recent efforts to establish more meaningful link between gpra and th budget process and concluded her opening statement by saying that as government performance rating tools and measures become more and more reliable congress will be fina lly responsible for using and integrating this information into our budgetary and fiscal decision making40 to
