requested warrant for the arrest of sudanese president omar ssan albashir for genocide crimes against humanity and war crimes in the darfur region of sudan this represents the first time the icc

information on the international criminal court see crs report rl31437 international criminal court overview and selected issues by jennifer elsea 5 articles 13 and 14 1 of the rome statut provide for both states parties and security council referral of situ ations to the court during the negotiations the question arose of whether individual cases or situa tions should be referred to the icc prosecutor according to one author writing on the jurisdicti on of the icc it was suggested that states parties should not be able to make complaints about individual crimes or cases it would be more appropriate and less political if situations were instead referred to the court elizabeth wilmshurst jurisdiction of the court chapter 3 in roy slee editor the international criminal court the making of the rome stat ute issues negotiations results boston kluwer law international 1999 p 131 another author writing on the role of the prosecutor noted that the power s of the prosecutor could also be broadened in the context of states complaint to the court if the complaint referre d to situations rather than to individual cases proposal to this effect introduced by the us delegation in 1996 was very soon supported by large major ity of states many of whom had been uneasy with allowing party to select individual cases of violations and lodge complaintswith respect to such cases this couldencourage politicization of the complaint procedure the prosecutor after re ferral of the situation could initiate case against the individual or individuals concerne d silvia fernandez gurmendi

war crimes crimes against humanity and genocide2 the iccs jurisdiction extends only over crimes committed since the entry into force of the statute the icc is headquartered in the hague netherlands as of june 1 2008 106 countries were parties to the statute3 the united states is not party to the icc the assembly of states par ties the body made up of the 106 parties provides administrative oversight and other support for the court including adoption of the budget and election of 18 judges the prosecutor currently luis moreno ocampo from argentina and the registra r currently bruno cathala from france4 situations5 may be referred to the icc in one of three ways as outlined in the articles of the statute by state party to the statute the icc prosecutor or the united nations security council currently four situations have been publicly referred to the prosecutor the g overnments of three c ountries all parties to the icc uganda the democratic republic of congo and the central african republic each have referred situations to the prosecutor the security council has referred one s ituation darfur sudan to the prosecutor6 at least twohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34665crs3 7 reportedly the icc has received 1700 co mmunications about alleged crimes in 139 countries but 80 percent have been found to be outside the jurisdiction of the court the prosecutor has received self referrals only fro m african countries see stephanie hanson global policy forum africa and the international criminal court council on foreign relations july 24 2008 8 the bar for proving complementarity has been set very high in the icc case against congolese suspect thomas lubanga dyilo the pr etrial chamber ruled that in order for case to be inadmissible national proceedings must encompass both the person and the conduct which is the subject of the case before the court icc pretrial chamber i the prosecutor vs thomas lubanga dyilo decision on the prosecutors application for warrant of arrest article 38 february 10 2006 this language suggests that domestic prosecution must essentially duplicate the icc prosecution in order for admissibility to be challenged even in such case the icc may retain jurisdiction if domestic proceedings are not conducted impartially or indepe ndently rome statute article 17 9 article 27 of the rome statute 10 the united states signed the rome statute under the clinton administrati on on december 31 2000 but the statute was never ratified by the senate in may 2002 the bush administration notified the united nations that it did not intend to become party to the icc and that there were therefore gal obligations arising from the signature 11 the united states had supported version of the rome statute that would have allowed the security council to re fer cases involving nonstates parties to the icc but would not have allowed other states or the prosecutor to refer casespotential situations were dismissed following preliminary analysis and at least six others remain unde r consideration7 the icc is considered court of last resort it will only investigate or prosecute cases of the most serious crimes perpetrated by individuals not organizations or government s and then only when national judicial systems are unwilling or unable to handle them this principle of admissibility before the court is known as complementarity8 although many domestic legal systems grant sitting heads of state immunity from crimin prosecution the rome statute grants the icc jurisdiction over any individua l regardless of official capacity9 the us position on the icc the united states is not party to the rome statute the bush administration fir mly opposes the court and has renounced any us obligations under the treaty10 it objects to the court on number of grounds including the courts assertion of jurisdic tion in certain circumstances over citizens including military personne l of countries that are not parties to the treaty11 the perceived lack of adequate checks and balances on the powers of the icc prosecutors and judges the perceived dilution of the role of the security council in maintaining peace and security and the iccs potentially chilling effect on americas willingness toproject power in the fense of its interestshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34665crs4 12 each state party to an article 98 agreemen t promises that it will not surrender citizens of the other state party to international tribuna ls or the icc unless both parties agree in advance an article 98 agreement would preven t the surrender of certain persons to the icc by parties to the agreement but would not bi nd the icc if it were to obtain custody of the accused through other means see appendix for list of states parties

taking place in darfur the administration supported the formation of the international commission of inquiry for darfur28 however the bush administration preferred special tribunal in africa to be the mechanism of accountability for those who committed crimes in darfur it objected to the security council referral to the icc because of its stated objections to the iccs jurisdiction over na tionals of states not party to the rome statute29 however the united states had s upported version of the rome statute that would have allowed the secu rity council to refer cases involving non states parties to the icc but would not ve allowed other states or the prosecutor to refer cases the united states ab stained on resolution 1593 which is not equivalent to veto in the security council because the resolution included language that dealt with the sovereig nty questions of c oncern and essentially protected us nationals and other persons of nonparty states other than sudan from prosecution30 the abstention did not change th fundamental objections of the bush administration to the icc at the same time the bush administration has supported the need for the international community to come together and take action on the atrocities occurring in darfur31 the administration and congress have expressed support for bringing to justice those who perpetrate genocide war crimes and crimes

the oftmade suggestion that the counc il include in its resolution request under article 16 of the icc statute for defe rral or suspension of further icc action on the case for up to 12 months for the purpose of among other things facilitating efforts toward peaceful settlement of th situations in darfur and south sudan some governments also expressed concer ns that positive icc response to the

deferral by the security council chapter 172 in the international crimi nal court commentary edited by antonio cassese paola gaeta and john rwd jones new york oxford university press 2002 vol i pp 644654article 16 of the icc statute is entitled deferral of investigation or prosecution and provides that investigation or prosecution can be commenced or proceeded with under this statute for period of 12 months after the security council in resolution adopted under chapter vii of the charter of the united nations has requested the court to that effect that request may be renewed by the council under the same conditions thus if the security council actin g under chapter vii of the charter adopts resolution requesting the icc to suspe nd or defer any further investigation or prosecution of the case against bashir the icc including the prosecutor would be obliged to cease its investigation in that particular situation and the pretrial chamber before which the warrant request is pending would have to suspend its considerations the council request would be applicable for 12 months and would be renewable david scheffer who headed the us delegation to the conference that drafted the icc statute in an august 20 2008 oped in jurist noted that the negotiating history of article 16 should be instructive to how the council currently examines the darfur situation79 scheffer pointed out that artic 16 was drafte d and adopted to enable the security council to suspend or defer an icc investigation or prosecution of situation before either is launched if priorities of peace and security compelled delay of international justice he stated that the original intent behind article 16 was for the security council to act preemptively to delay the application of international justice for atrocity crimes in particular situation in order to focus exclusively on performing the councils ma ndated responsibilities for international peace and security objectives this was tool to be employed by the council in instances of premature state party or pr osecutor referrals in addition scheffer observed that if the current proposals fo r council suspension of further icc action on situation referred to the icc by the c ouncil had been foresee n article 16 never would have been approved by themajority of government s attending the talks on the rome statute for it would have been viewed as creating rights for the security council far beyond the original inte nt of the singapore compromise scheffer noted nonetheless one plausi bly may argue that the language of article 16 of the rome statute techni cally empowers the security council to intervene at this late date and block approval of an arre st warrant against president bashir or even suspend its execution follo wing any

against widespread impunity on the continen t nevertheless th iccs actions have provoked debates over the cour ts potential impact its pe rceived prioritization of africa over other regions its selection of cases and the effect of international prosecutions on peace processes most pe rsistently critics ve accused the icc of potentially jeopardizing the ttlement of longrunning civ il wars in the pursuit of an often abstract justice suppor ters of the court reject these criticisms and hope that icc investigations will build accountability for the worlds gravest atrocities and contribute to africas l ongterm peace and stability potential impact many hope that the icc will usher in new period of international accountability for the gravest human rights abus by ensuring that perpetrators are brought to justice the iccs founders anticipated that by ending impunity the icc would deter future atrocities108 indeed some observers ve argued that the iccs success should be evaluated not just based on the punishment of past atrocities but also in terms of the effect its investig ations have on reducing abysmal conduct in the present and future109 the office of the prosecutor maintains that the choice of cases is not based on calculations of dete rrent effect though the office acknowledges that strategic communications related to icc prosecutions may play role in deterrence110 the goal of deterrence has been particularly salient in the iccs investigations in africa which have focused todate on regions where conflict is ongoing or only recently settled111 however difficulties in

maintain that deterrence is difficult to evaluate and that changes in perpetrators behavior may be visible only over the l ongrun some argue that the courts compilation of evidence including transcribed interviews with witnesses may serve future prosecutions or reconciliation processes even if they do not immediately lead to convictions accusations of bias the iccs investigations in subsaha ran africa have stirred concerns over african sovereignty and the long history of foreign intervention on the continent for example president paul kagame of rwanda which is not state party to the court has portrayed the icc as new form of imperialism that seeks to undermine people from poor and african countries nd other powerle ss countries in terms of economic development and politics113 other commentators ve alleged that the prosecutor has limited investigations to africa because of geopolitical pressures either out of desire to avoid confront ation with major powers or as tool of western foreign policy114 the attempt to prosecute bashir has been particularly controversial drawing rebuke from african governments and re gional organizations supporters of the court respond that investig ations todate have been determined by referrals either by african states or the security council and that the prosecutor is analyzing situations in countries outside of africa in addition observers have pointed out that national legal systems in africa are particularly weak which has allowed the icc to assert its jurisdicti on under the principle of complementarity115 the office of the prosecutor maintains that its choice of cases is based on the relative gravity of abuses and that crimes committed in subsaharan africa are among the worlds most serious116 the prosecutors selection of cases also has proven c ontroversial icc prosecutions in sudan had prior to the reque st for warrant against president bashir drawn criticism for targeting midlevel officials rather than those with alleged higherorder responsibility for abuses in darfur some ve criticized icc prosecutions in uganda the drc nd car for focusing on alleged abuses committed by rebel fighters to the exclusion of

have responded that the prosecutor is mandated to focus on limited number of particularly serious cases and that investigations are ongoing and c ould lead to prosecutions against members of opposing sides in the future justice vs peace one of the most persistent criticisms of the iccs actions in africa has been that by prosecuting active participants in ongoi ng or recently settled conflicts the court risks prolonging violence or endangering fragile peace processes by removing the bargaining chip of amnesty from the negotiating table critics allege the icc may remove incentives for peace settlements while encouraging perpetrators to remain in power in order to shield themselves fro m prosecution some observe that in such cases it is difficult to tell victims of these conflicts that the prosecution of small number of people should take precedence over peace deal that may end the appalling conditions they endure nd the daily risks they face119 concerns that the aims of justice and peace may conflict have been particularly prominent in uganda and sudan in uganda some observers argue that icc arrest warrants against lra commanders have acted as an impediment to achieving final peace agreemen t however others counter that the threat of icc prosecution on top of other shifts in the c onflict was decisive factor in bringing the lra to the negotiating table in 2006 th is observation has led some to see the icc in uganda as an important ingredient in political solution for the conflict plagued north120 in sudan some observers have ar gued that the attempt to prosecute president bashir could endanger the comprehensive peace agreement for southern sudan and the peace process in darfur or provide an incentive to the ruling party to cling to power ahead of elections sc

international prosecutions maintain that the pursuits of peace and justice are complementary rather than oppos ed as credible threat of prosecution may serve as an important lever of pressure on actors in conflict124 for example priscilla hayner of the international center for transitional justice writes it would be wrong to suggest that pragmatism always trumps principle in matters of life

of events since july 14 2008 the united states abstained on council resolution 1828 2008 extending the unamid mandate pointing to the language in preambular paragraph that referred to the july 14 application by the icc prosecutor and the possibility of c ouncil request for ferral of further consideration of icc consider ation of that case as the r eason for the abstention the united states also had abstained on c ouncil resolution 1593 2005 by which the council sent the situation in darfur to the icc for investigation while the bush administration would have preferred di fferent venue for c onsideration of the genocide conditions in darfur it did not halt referral to the icc by vetoing the resolution some observers have suggested that the us position in the past would not have permitted abstention on the two council resolu tions thus they maintain that the united states has moved to policy that r ecognizes that under cer tain circumstances the icc may have role127 others have pointed out however that any perceived moderation in us views toward the c ourt has not affected its overall position not to become party to the icc statute current us efforts as reflected by us abstentions in the council appear to be driven by nonicc foreign policy issues that are perceived as more important the need to support the us policy against genocide in darfur was perceived as more important than overall us opposition to the icc this broader policy drove the us abstention on council referral of the situation to the icc in 2005 moreover the need to ensure that the unamid mandate on the brink of expiring was extended for another 12 m onths was perceived as more important and drove the us abstention in july 2008 john bellinger the legal advisor to the s ecretary of state in
