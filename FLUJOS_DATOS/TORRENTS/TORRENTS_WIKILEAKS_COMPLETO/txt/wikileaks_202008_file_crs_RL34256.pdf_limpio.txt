nuclear facilities as agreed in the sixparty talks the sixparty talks include the united states south korea japan china russia and north korea and were begun in august 2003 to attempt to resolve the current crisis over north korean nuclear weapons beginning in late 2002 north korea ended an eightyear freeze on its plutonium production program expelled international inspectors and restarted facilities north korea may have produced enough additional plutonium for five nuclear warheads since 2002 in total it is estimated that north korea has up to 50 kilograms of separated plutonium enough for at least half dozen nuclear weapons on february 10 2005 north korea announced that it had manufactured nuclear weapons for selfdefense and that it would bolster its nuclear weapons arsenal on october 9 2006 north korea conducted nuclear test with yield of under 1 kiloton the united states and other countries condemned the test and the united nations security council passed resolution 1718 on october 14 2006 that requires north korea to 1 refrain from nuclear or missile tests 2 rejoin the nuclear nonproliferation treaty npt and 3 abandon its weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missile programs on february 13 2007 north korea reached an agreement with other members of the sixparty talks to begin the initial phase 60 days of implementing the joint statement from september 2005 on denuclearization key components of the agreement include halting production at the yongbyon nuclear complex and delivery of heavy fuel oil to north korea in july 2007 international atomic energy agency iaea inspectors verified the shutdown of the yongbyon facilities on october 3 2007 the six parties adopted joint statement in which north korea agreed to disable the yongbyon facilities and provide declaration of all its nuclear programs by december 31 2007 the october 2007 statement said the united states would lead disablement activities and provide the initial funding for those activities much still remains to be confirmed regarding north koreas nuclear weapons production capabilities and delivery systems particularly regarding uranium enrichment although us officials confronted the north koreans in 2002 with intelligence that reportedly proved that pyongyang was pursuing uranium enrichment program us intelligence officials have said they do not know where the uranium program is based and have over time shown less confidence about what the scope of the program might be further although seismographs registered the october 9 2006 detonation and environmental sampling confirmed radioactivity uncertainty about the weapons design and sophistication remains additional transparency on fissile material stocks and programs including the uranium enrichment program may contribute to better picture of north korean nuclear weapons capabilit ies this report will be updated as events warrant

satellites tracked growing indigenous nuclear program in north korea the north korean nuclear program began in the late 1950s with cooperation agreements with the soviet union on nuclear research program near yongbyon its first research reactor began operation in 1967 north korea used indigenous expertise and foreign procurements to build small nuclear reactor at yongbyon 5mwe it was capable of producing about 6 kilograms kg of plutonium per year and began operating in 1986 1 later that year us satellites detected high explosives testing and new plant to separate pl utonium in addition construction of two larger reactors 50mwe at yongbyon and 200mwe at taechon added evidence of serious clandestine effort although north korea had joined the nuclear nonproliferation treaty npt in 1985 under soviet pressure safeguards inspections began only in 1992 raising questions about how much plutonium north korea had produced co vertly in 1994 north korea pledged under the agreed framework with the united states to freeze its plutonium programs and eventually dismantle them in return for several kinds of assistance 2 at that time western intelligence agencies estimated that north korea had separated enough plutonium for one or two bombs other sources estimated four to five bombs north korea complied with the agreed framework allowing international atomic energy agency iaea sealsincluding the canning of spent fuel rods at the yongbyon reactorand permanent remote monitoring and inspectors at its nuclear facilities when in 2002 us negotiators reportedly presented north korean officials with evidence of clandestine uranium enrichment program the north korean officials reportedly at first confirmed this then denied it publicly the conflict quickly led to the breakdown of the agreed framework the bush administration argued that north korea was in material breach of its obligations and after agreement with south korea japan and the eu the other members of the korean economic development organizati on or kedo stopped the next shipment of heavy fuel oil 3 in response north korea kicked out international monitors broke the seals at the yongbyon nuclear complex and restarted its reactor and reprocessing plant after an eightyear freeze members of the sixparty talksthe united states south korea japan china russia and north koreabegan meeting in august 2003 to try and resolve the crisis in september 2005 the six parties issued joint statement on how to achieve verifiable denuclearization of the korean peninsula which formed the basis for future agreements4 after negotiations broke down north korea tested nuclear device in october 2006 the denuclearization action plan of february 2007 called for shutdown of facilities and provision of fuel oil to north korea5 currently in the second phase of this plan the united states is working with north korea to disable key facilities 1 5mwe is power rating for the reactor indicating that it pr oduces 5 million

program that was due at the end of 2007 as promised in an october 3 2007 joint statement on secondphase actions6 the denuclearization action plan does not include actions that will address fissile material stocks the uranium enrichment program or dismantlement of warheads and instead focuses on shutting down and disabling for at least years time the key plutonium production facilities third phase to begin after disablement is complete and declaration is accepted by the six parties is supposed to address all aspects of north koreas nuclear program including weapons using north koreas declaration as basis for future action understanding the scope of the program and the weapons capability will require transparency and careful verification for complete verifiable irreversible disarmament to be achieved g25g142g138g153g152g151g156g561g18g155g152g141g158g140g157g146g152g151g561g15g146g149g142g156g157g152g151g142g156g561 acquiring fissile materialplutonium239 or highly enriched uranium heuis the key hurdle in nuclear weapons development 7 producing these two materials is technically challenging in comparison many experts believe weaponization to be relatively easy8 north korea has industrialscale uranium mining and plants for milling refining and converting uranium it also has fuel fabrication plant nuclear reactor and reprocessing plantin short everything needed to produce pu239 in its nuclear reactor north korea uses magnox fuelnatural uranium 99u238 metal wrapped in magnes iumalloy cladding about 8000 fuel rods constitute fuel core for the reactor when irradiated in reactor natural uraniu m fuel absorbs neutron and then decays into plutonium pu239 fuel that remains in the reactor for long time becomes contaminated by the isotope pu240 which can poison the functioning of nuclear weapon 9 spent or irradiated fuel which poses radiological hazards must cool after removal from the reactor the cooling phase estimated by some at five months is proportional to the fuel burnup reprocessing to separate plutonium from waste products and uraniu m is the next step north korea uses purex separation process like the united states after shearing off the fuel cladding the fuel is dissolved in nitric acid components plutonium ur anium waste of the fuel are separated into different streams using organic solvents in small quantities separation can be done in hot cells but larger quantities require significant shielding to prevent deadly exposure to radiation 10 north korea appears to have mastered the engi neering requirements of plutonium production it has operated its nuclear reactor is believed to have separated pu from the spent fuel and has reportedly taken steps toward weaponization in january 2004 north korean officials showed an

u235 is weaponsgrade 8 the physical principles of weaponization are wellknown but producing weapon with high reliability effectiveness and efficiency without testing presents significant challenges 9 plutonium that stays in reactor for long time reactorgrade with high burnup contains about 20 pu240 weaponsgrade plutonium contains less than 7 pu240 10 hot cells are heavily shielded rooms with

operation11 dr siegfried hecker delegation member assessed that the stated density of the material was consistent with plutonium alloyed with gallium or aluminum if so this could indicate degree of sophistication in north koreas handling of pu metal necessary for weapons production but without testing the material hecker could not confirm that the metal was plutonium or that it was alloyed or when it was produced g24g142g155g146g143g146g140g138g157g146g152g151g561g138g151g141g561g515g6g146g156g138g139g149g142g150g142g151g157g516g561 in september 2005 north korea agreed to abandon all nuclear weapons and existing nuclear programs but implementation of this goal was stalled 12 the october 9 2006 nuclear test is seen as catalyst in uniting the other members of the six party talks to toughen their stance towards north korea and as turning point in pyongyangs attitude security council resolution 1718 calls on north korea to abandon its nuclear weapons in complete verifiable and irreversible manner 13 in february 2007 as part of implementation of the september 2005 joint statement north korea committed to disable all nuclear facilities and provide complete and correct

separated weaponsgrade plutonium that has already been produced as well as full disclosure of uranium enrichment activities 15 as of midjanuary 2008 north korea had not yet submitted declaration north korean foreign ministry said on january 4 th at it had notified the united states of the content of its declaration in november 2007 however assistant secretary hill said that the two sides had discussed what was expected to be in declaration and it was clearly not complete and correct declaration16 north korea reportedly suggested it would declare 30 kg of separated plutonium in its declaration lower number than us officials have alluded to see above but in the range of some analyses17 the united states has said that materials facilities and programs need to be included in declaration in addition to plutonium stocks north korea has agreed to address concerns about uranium enrichment program but denies that it has one see below 11 alloying plutonium with other materials is common in plut onium metallurgy to retain th deltaphase of plutonium which makes it easier to cast and shape two steps in weapons production hecker january 21 2004 testimony before sfrc 12 joint

warhead information18 north korea has said it would not include warhead information at this stage since december 31 when expectations that north korea would provide declaration were not met us officials have emphasized that the completeness of the document is more important than its timing ambassador chris hill suggested that it would be preferable to have declaration from the north koreans before the end of february when the new south korean president takes office19 north korea also has expressed dissatisfaction that the united states has not yet removed it from the terrorism list or lifted the trading with the enemy act sanctions both part of phase 2 us officials in response have made clear that these actions would be taken only after complete declaration is submitted to the six parties g6g146g156g138g139g149g142g150g142g151g157g561 the october 2007 joint statement said the united states would lead disablement activities and provide the initial funding for those activities 20 disablement indicates physical measure to make it difficult to restart operation of facility while terms are being worked out for its eventual dismantlement us officials have said that they would prefer disablement process that would require 12month time period to start up the facility again21 team of us technical experts in midoctober 2007 continued negotiations with the north koreans on plan that reportedly includes 10 discrete steps to disable the three main yongbyon facilities related to north koreas plutonium program nuclear fuel fabrication plan t plutonium reprocessing plant and 5megawatt experimental nuclear power reactor 22 the step that requires the most time to achieve will be the remove of the irradiated fuel from the reactor to storage in an adjacent cooling pond23 the disablement process began in early november 200724 japan has reportedly also expressed interest in contributing expertise but it is not clear if this will be agreed to by north korea25 on january 4 2008 north korea announced that it would slow the pace of disablement at this stage meaning removal of fuel rods in response to stalemate over the contents of declaration and in response to fuel shipments not having been received on time and the united states not yet removing it from the terrorism list26 nevertheless us officials report that significant progress has been made and said that slowing of fuel rod removal was necessary for safety reasons south korean official said that fuel rod removal is expected to take several months and may be completed by the end of march 27 18 see crs

inspectors returned to north korea in july 2007 to monitor and verify the shutdown install seals and monitor facilities at the yongbyon nuclear complex and have had continuous presence there since then28 in his september 10 2007 statement to the iaea board of governors director general mohamed elbaradei stated that the iaea was able to verify the shutdown of nuclear facilities including the nuc lear fuel fabrication plant radiochemical laboratory reprocessing plant and the 5mwe experimental nuclear power reactor inspectors are also monitoring the halt in construction of the 50megawatt nuclear power plant at yongbyon and the 200megawatt nuclear power plant in taechon29 the united states has contributed 18 million as the us voluntary contribution and japan has contributed 500000 to the iaea for their work in north korea30 in the future the iaea may be called on to investigate north koreas past nuclear program in addition to monitoring activities however to date its role has been limited to monitoring the shutdown of yongbyon facilities the iaeas role in disablement and future dismantlement efforts has yet to be determined some analysts recommend an observer role for the iaea during disablement steps and continued iaea monitoring to boost international confidence in the process31 since iaea inspectors were expelled from north korea in 2002 information about north koreas nuclear weapons production has depended on remote monitoring and defector information with mixed results satellite images correctly indicated the startup of the 5mwe reactor but gave details about its

although north korea has tested one device vice foreign minister kim gye gwan has previously said that north korea possesses multiple bombs and was building more 46 key factor in assessing how many weapons north korea can produce is whether north korea needs to use more or less material than the iaea standards of 8kg of pu and 25kg for heu per weapon47 the amount of fissile material used in each weapon is determined by the design sophistication there is reliable public information on north korean nuclear weapons design in all estimates of north koreas separated plutonium range between 30 and 50 kg with an approximate 5 to 6 kg of this figure having been used for the october 2006 test48 this amounts to enough plutonium for approximately five to eight nuclear weapons assuming 6 kg per weapon after the test north korean could possess four to seven nuclear weapons an unclassified intelligence report to congress says that prior to the test north korea could have produced up to 50 kg of plutonium enough for at least half dozen nuclear weapons and points out that additional plutonium is in the fuel of the yongbyon reactor49 under secretary christopher hill has also cited the 50 kg

200354 reprocessing the 8000 fuel rods would yield between 25 and 30kg of plutonium perhaps for four to six weapons but the exact amount of plutonium that might have been reprocessed is unknown in 2004 north korean officials stated that the reprocessing campaign was conducted continuously in four six hour shifts in april 2005 the 5mwe reactor was shut down this time to harvest fuel rods for

estimated that the two reactors could generate about 275kg of plutonium per year if they were operating 61 dr hecker estimated that if the 50mwe reactor was functioning it would mean tenfold increase in north koreas plutonium production62 north korea agreed to halt work on reactors as part of the six party talks as of july 2007 the iaea is monitoring to ensure that further construction takes place at these sites significant future growth in north koreas arsenal would be possible only if the two larger reactors were completed and operating and would depend on progress in the reported uranium enrichment program with construction of the 50mwe and 200mwe reactors shuttered and the yongbyon facilities awaiting disablement and eventual dismantlement north korean plutonium production for the moment has stopped the reprocessing facility is also now shut down and under iaea monitoring however even with the reprocessing facility shut down north korea could build additional warheads with

unclassified report of august 2007 stated we continue to assess with high confidence that north korea has pursued efforts to acquire uranium enrichment capability which we assess is intended for nuclear weapons all intelligence community agencies judge with at least moderate confidence that this past effort continues the degree of progress towards producing enriched uranium remains unknown however 70 in testimony to congress on february 2008 director of national intelligence michael mcconnell confirmed this assessment the confidence level of these assessments may have changed because of decrease in international procurement by north korea uranium enrichmentrelated imports would be more easily detected by intelligence agencies than activities inside north korea itself uranium enrichment facilities can be hidden from aerial surveillance more easily than plutonium facilities making it more difficult for intelligence agencies to even detectthus degree of progress in turning the equipment into working enrichment program is unknown furthermore there are significant differences between assembling smallscale centrifuge enrichment program and operating largescale production plant and reportedly little evidence of procurement for largescale plant has emerged 71 as part of the february 2007 agreement in the sixparty talks north korea agreed to provide complete declaration of all nuclear programs and disablement of all existing nuclear facilities and has pledged to do so by the end of 2007 us officials have said that this will include any uranium enrichment activities

enriched uranium for weapons and that the 68 there has been considerable misinterpretation of the intelligence communitys view of north korean efforts to pursue uranium enrichment capability the intelligence in 20 02 was high quality information that made possible high confidence judgment about north koreas efforts to acquire uranium enrichment capability the intelligence community had then

projects however when us scientists analyzed the aluminum tubing provided as sample evidence they found traces of enriched uranium on the tubing analysts argue that in addition to the possibility that this is proof of north korean uranium enrichment program it is also possible that the uranium traces could have been on the tubing when north korea received it73 this issue remains unresolved

north korea had the capability to arm missile with nuclear device pentagon officials later backtracked from that assessment dni report to congress says that north korea has short and medium range missiles that could be fitted with nuclear weapons but we do not know whether it has in fact done so 74 north korea has several hundred shortrange scudclass and medium range dongclass ballistic missiles and is developing an intermediate range ballistic missile the taepodong2 that was tested unsuccessfully in july 2006 would be able to reach the continental united states if it becomes operational dni assessed in 2008 that the taepodong2 has the potential capability to deliver nuclearweaponsized payload to the united states but that absent successful testing the likelihood of this is low 75 it is possible that pakistani scientist aq khan may have provided north korea the same chineseorigin nuclear weapon design he provided to libya and iran even though that design was for an heubased device it would still help north korea develop reliable warhead for ballistic missilessmall light and robust enough to tolerate the extreme conditions encountered through ballistic trajectory learning more about what is needed for mini aturization of warheads for ballistic missiles could have been the goal of north koreas testing smaller nuclear device76

and coercive diplomacy than for warfighting and assess that pyongyang most likely would not attempt to use nu clear weapons against us forces or territory unless it perceived the regime to be on the verge of military defeat and risked an irretrievable loss of control 77 statements by north korean officials emphasize that moves to expand their nuclear 73 glenn kessler uranium traces found on n

states against the north korean regime78 nuclear weapons also give north korea leverage in diplomatic negotiations and threatening rhetoric often coincides with times of crisis in negotiations in january 2008 north korean media report stated that the country will further strengthen our war deterrent capabilities in response to us attempts to initiate nuclear war this statement came as north korea was expressing its displeasure that it had not yet been removed from the us terrorism list79 g11g156g156g158g142g156g561g143g152g155g561g5g152g151g144g155g142g156g156g561 congress will have clear role in considering us funding for the disablement and decommissioning of north koreas nuclear facilities as well as other inducements for cooperation as agreed in the six party talks for example the president has submitted request to congress for 106 million to provide heavy fuel oi l or an equivalent value of other assistance to north korea on an actionforaction basis in support of the six party talks in return for actions taken by north korea on denuclearization as part of the 2008 war funding request 80 this amount was approved in the omnibus appropriations bill for fy2008 passed in december 2007 congress could also play role in establishing legal authority for assistance to nuclear disablement and dismantlement in north korea the departments of state and energy are now working to dismantle the nuclear facilities at the yongbyon complex in north korea this effort is being funded through the state departments nonproliferation and disarmament fund ndf ndf funds may be used notwithstanding any othe r provision of law and therefore may be used in north korea since north korea conducted nuclear test in october 2006 section 102 b the glenn amendment usc 2799aa1 of the arms export control act prohibits assistance to nonnuclear weapon state under the npt that has detonated nuclear explosive device possible solution under discussion would be to carve out an exception to the glenn amendment specifically for north korean nuclear disablement and dismantlement which would require congressional action 81 beyond the glenn amendment restrictions department of defense funds must be specifically appropriated for use in north korea section 8045 of the fy2008 defense appropriations act says that none of the funds appropriated or otherwise made available in this act may be obligated or expended for assistance to the democratic peoples republic of korea unless specifically appropriated for that purpose however this year authorization was given for ctr funds to be used globally see section 1305 the fy2008 defense authorization act specifically encourages activities relating to the denuclearization of the democratic peoples republic of korea as potential new initiative for ctr work currently the department of defense is not working on disablement efforts but there may be future role for dod is the six party process progresses to dismantlement work 78 see

enough funds available to support the disablement of north koreas nuclear weapons arsenal and production capability in the fy2008 omnibus appropriations act the committees on appropriations provided does nnsa with funding discretion to provide up to 10 million towards its activities in north korea it also directs the department to submit supplemental budget request if additional resources are required during fy200882 in addition congress may influence the course of the negotiations with north korea through legislation that limits or places requirements on us diplomatic actions for example hr 3650 has been introduced and referred to the house foreign affairs committee calling for certification by the president that north korea has met range of nonproliferation and political benchmarks before lifting any us sanctions imposed becaus it has been deemed supporter of international terrorism by the secretary of state83 congress could also establish reporting requirements on progress or condition appropriations or disburse ment to north korea upon verification measures congress could also be involved in other aspects of potential changes in us relations with pyongyang such as removal from the state sponsors of terrorism list monitoring of the north korean human rights issues funding for further denuclearization steps including verification provisions and establishment of normalized ties once nuclear dismantlement has been achieved g3g158g157g145g152g155g561g5g152g151g157g138g140g157g561g11g151g143g152g155g150g138g157g146g152g151g561 mary beth nikitin analyst in
