six months in 2008 commission staff and the remaining two commissioners continued to provide information to the regu lated community and to prepare for additional commissioners in the interim however th absence of quorum at the fec delayed administering aspects of the presidential public financing program rulemakings and enforcement actions15 immediate issues facing the repopulated commission include rulemaking to implement portions of the h onest leadership and open government act of 2007 hloga pending enforcement cases and advisory opinion requests and administering the presidential public campaign financing program16 the commission may also need to respond to ongoing litig ation surrounding the bipartisan campaign reform act17
