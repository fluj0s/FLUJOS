the united mine workers of america umwa combined benefit fund cbf to help pay the medical expenses of orphan re tirees their spouses and dependents from fy1996 through fy2005 746 million in interest was transferred the law provides that if the regular aml fees sunset speci fees should be established solely to provide for the annual transfer to the cbf under current law 50 of the aml fees collected are allocated back to the state or indian tribe that collected them known as the state share since 1977 when smcra was enacted the production of co has shifted westward mostly to wyoming while most of the remaining high priority reclamation sites are in eastern states the location of historic pre 1978 coal production the office of surface mining estimates that at least 3 billion in additional reclamation expenditures is needed to clean up remaining priority 1 nd 2 sites aml fees could be lower or collected for fewer years if the state share allocation were eliminated and the aml fund focused on reclaiming these high priority sites however western states would have less interest in supporting the aml fund if they received nothing in return for their producers contributions

same rates continued each time the fees were extended according to the legislative history of section 402a of smcra the lower fee set for underground mining compared with surface mining reflects the

balancing two factors first lignite generally has had lower value than coal and thus 10 percent fee could be onerous second many recent longterm contracts for lignite have had prices in the same range as subbituminous coal14 thus the disparity in rates was not linked to differences in the estimated cost of repairing damage done to the environment by the lternative methods of coal removal the aml reclamation fee is collected quarterly from coal operators commonly referred to as producers it is levied on each ton of coal produced domestically from its outset in 1977 the fee was not levi ed on imported coal recently the issue of whether the fee applies to exported coal has been in litigation in an april 2005 decision the federal claims court ruled that applying the fee to exported coal is unconstitutional the government still has the option to appeal the decision approximately 100 million in refunds of aml fees are at stake15 the fee is administered and collected by the office of surface mining osm in the interior department16 osm was successful in collecting an estimated 999 of aml fees due in fy200517 in fy2004 aml fee collections were 287 million while total distributions

event that congress allowed the regular fee to expire28 osm noted that section 402 b of smcra did not address whether the same differences in rates should continue to apply to coal produced after the regular fees expired29 in its september 17 2004 rule osm stated its intention to maintain the same ratios among the per ton fees that were originally established by smcra the fee per ton of coal produced by underground methods would be 43 of the fee per ton of coal produced by surface met hods the fee per ton of lignite coal produced would be 29 of th fee per ton of coal produced by surface

estima tes of coal production by type of mining and were set with the intention of raising 69 million the estimated interest earnings of the aml fund in fy2005 the ex act level of the fees was

industry division of crs contri buted this section economic burden of the fee32 for some time aml fees have been below the statutory percentofprice limits of 10 of value for surface and undergr oundmined coal and 2 for lignite steep increases in coal prices in late 2003 nd in 2004 further reduced the relative burden of the fee measured as percent of price in the last year coal prices have fallen somewhat raising the relative burden but it is still below the low points of 2004 in most cases judging by spot prices the price of coal in midaugust 2006 is as much as 85 higher than in 2003 and the relativ burden of the aml fee in the categories examined in table 1 consequently is only between half and twothirds of what it was in 2003 it should be noted that spot prices in recent years have been noticeably higher than likely contract prices which apply to the predominant share of us coal production consequently the actual bur den of the aml fee in 2006 probably is somewhat greater than indicated by the percentages reported in the following text and table the 035 aml fee equaled 14 of th estimated average us price of surfacemined bituminous coal in midaugust 2006 2500 compared with 26 in 2003 1342 the 015 fee equaled 03 of the estimated average us price of undergroundmined bituminous coal in midaugust 2006 4500 compared with 06 in 2003 2671 the 010 fee was at 09 of the average us price of lignite in 2003 lignite price data are available yet for 2006 for the aml fees to be at the percentofprice limits the price of surfacemined coal would need to be 350 per ton or less undergroundmined coal 150 per ton or less and lignite 500 per ton or less in contrast the black lung excise tax blet runs closer to its limit of 44 of price in most cases the blet of 055 pe r ton of surfacemined coal equaled 22 of the estimated midaugust 2006 average us spot price of surfacemined bituminous coal 2500 but is 50 of th spot price of powder river basin coal 1090 the twice as high tax of 110 per ton on undergroundmined coal equals 24 of the estimated mida ugust 2006 average us s pot price of underground mined coal 4500 the relative aml fee generally is higher on surfacemined coal than on undergroundmined coal both because the ab solute fee is higher and because the price of surfacemined coal is lower however the relative burden of the fee can differ by specific type of coal within t hose categories for example the 035 aml fee in midaugust 2006 equaled 32 of the estimated average spot price of bituminous coal surf acemined in the powder river basin which has lower heat content than most other bituminous coals it was 08 for surfacemined bituminous coal from other geographic basins this compares with an average 03 burden of the 015 fee for undergroundmined
