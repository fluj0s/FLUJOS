g343g561g17g159g142g155g159g146g142g160g561 nearly 105000 horses were slaughtered for human food in 2006 all in two foreignowned texas plants and third foreign plant in illinois according to the us department of agriculture usda virtually all the meat was for export the largest markets being france belgium switzerland italy japan and mexico the united states exported more than 17000 metric tons of horse meat valued at about 65 million in 2006 most of these horses were raised for other purposes like riding but were longer wanted by owners dealers collected them for the plants from auctions boarding facilities and elsewhere although us horse slaughter had been rising since 2002before recent series of court actions closed the three plantsit remained below levels of the 1980s when more than 300000 were processed annually in at least 16 us plants although us slaughter has ended for the present advocates continue to support federal legislation to ban it permanently theyand those who have opposed permanent banalso express concern about the shipment of more us horses to canada and mexico where plants can still slaughter them for food

the use of equines for food nor set onfarm care standards protection usually has been subject to varying state and local laws some of these laws may set care standards although more are likely to be anticruelty measures however us horse slaughter plants were long subject to the federal meat inspection act fmia of 1906 as amended 21 usc 601 et seq which requires usda to inspect all cattle sheep swine goats and eq uines slaughtered and processed into products for human food this act administered by usdas food safety and inspection service fsis aims to ensure that meat and meat products from these animals are safe wholesome and properly labeled fsis safety inspection is mandatory and most costs must be covered by appropriated funds except for overtime and holiday periods at inspectors also are charged with enforcing the humane methods of slaughter act 7 usc 1901 et seq requiring that livestock but not poultry be rendered unconscious prior to slaughter plants also can request that graders from usdas agricultural marketing service ams be placed in their plants to assign official grades to their products based on quality traits and yield plants pay user fees for this inspection service which is voluntary and conducted under authority of the agricultural marketing act ama of 1946 as amended 7 usc 1621 et seq the 1946 ama is also the authority fsis uses to provide voluntary food safety inspections of animals and products not specifically covered by either the federal meat inspection act or the poultry products inspection act horses often had to be shipped long distances to reach the few plants that until 2007 were slaughtering them horse practitioners and welfare groups gained passage of language in the 1996 farm bill pl 104127 title ixa commercial tran sportation of

states have laws aimed at preventing the slaughter of horses for human food federal lawsuit filed by the owners of the two texas slaughter plants beltex corporation and dallas crown inc sought to clarify that the texas state law banning the sale of horsemeat first passed in 1949 was not enforceable and that they should not be prosecuted the us district court for the northern district of texas in forth worth had earlier agreed with the plants owners that the law had been repealed was preempted by the fm ia and violated the dormant commerce clause of the us constitution however on january 19 2007 panel of the us court of appeals for the fifth circuit rejected all three arguments declaring the texas law to be in force and clearing the way for the state attorney general to prosecute the plant owners if they continued to operate the two plants have ceased slaughtering for human food elsewhere the illinois legislature in may 2007 passed law banning horse slaughter the illinois plant owned by cavel international was able to operate until september 2007 when the us court of appeals for the seventh circuit ruled that the state law does not violate the interstate and foreign commerce clauses of the us constitu tion the plant appealed to the us supreme court which in june 2008 declined to hear the case g8g142g141g142g155g138g149g561g14g142g144g146g156g149g138g157g146g152g151g561

amendment by representative sweeney to prohibit funds provided in the measure to pay for the antemortem inspection of horses under the meat inspection act on september 20 2005 the senate adopted an identical floor amendment by senator ensign by 69 to 28 vote the final conference report hrept 109255 signed as pl 10997 on november 10 2005 retained this amendment but delayed the effective date for 120 days because the fmia has long required fsis inspection of equines like other designated livestock species before the meat may enter commerce the amendments supporters presumed that the plants could longer process them for human food however the final housesenate report stated it is the understanding of the conferees that the department is obliged under existing statutes to provide for the inspection of meat intended for human consumption domestic and exported the conferees recognize that the funding limitation in 794 prohibits the use of appropriations only for payment of salaries or expenses of personnel to inspect horses subsequently the three plants on november 23 2005 petitioned usda for voluntary mortem inspection under the 1946 ama with the antemortem portion funded by user fees the plants and other horse slaughter supporters noted that the relatively narrow wording of the 1 other federal laws protect horses used in research and ban soring for shows see crs report 94731

bills to prohibit permanently the movement and slaughter of horses for human food were introduced into the 110 th congress by representative schakowsky and senator landrieu hr 503 s 311 these measures would have amended the horse protection act 15 usc 1821 et seq which currently makes it crime to exhibit or transport for the purpose of exhibition any sore horse ie one whose feet have been injured to alter its gait the schakowsky and landrieu bills would have prohibited the shipping transporting moving delivering receiving possessing purchasing selling or donation of any horse or other equine to be slaughtered for human consumption the bills would have permitted usda to detain for examination and evidence any horse for which it has probable cause that the animal will be slaughtered for food violators would have been subject to specified criminal and civil penalties and prison terms the bills would have increased authorized appropriations for administering the act from 500000 to 5 million annually the senate commerce committee ordered the bill to be favorably reported srept 110229 on april 25 2007 full senate action did not occur 2 usdas rule estimated that the new fees would

hr 857 and s 2352 to halt horse slaughter differed in detail from the more recent measures for example these earlier bills did not amend the horse protection act hr 857 and s 2352 also explicitly would have required officials to work with animal welfare societies and animal control departments to place confiscated horses temporarily with nonprofit animal rescue facility required the owner of confiscated horse to post bond sufficient to provide for 60 days of care and required the secretary to make grants to specified rescue facilities willing to accept confiscated horses

1331 et seq which seeks to protect wild horses and burros on federal lands at issue has been whether and under what conditions such horses could be acquired and eventually sold for slaughter an explanation of this issue can be found in crs report rl34690 wild horse and burro issues by carol hardy vincent g21g142g149g142g140g157g142g141g561g3g155g144g158g150g142g151g157g156g561 most us and canadian consumers view horses as performance and companion animals rather than food horse protection and animal welfare groups contend that americans overwhelmingly favor an end to horse slaughter for human food practice such groups have called cruel and unnecessary according to these groups horses are transported long distances often in deplorable conditions in poorly equipped trucks and trailers where they are exposed to bad weather and often inadequate rest food and water however veterinary journal article counters market demand for horsemeat for human consumption is almost certain to continue and may grow in the foreseeable future it is therefore proper and necessary that we continue to work w ith national and international groups to provide humane care for horses intended for slaughter and maintain as much consensus and practicality on these issues as possible3 3 reece and others equine slaughter transportupdate on research and regulations journal of the american

concern expressed by opponents of ban on horse slaughter is that rescued horses are more likely to become neglected and abused by owners who lack the knowledge financial resources andor interest to care for them at the same time the existing us horse infrastructure cannot absorb the large numbers of animals that would be confiscated or otherwise diverted from slaughter as result of slaughter prohibition opponents of such ban believe the american horse protection association ahpa is opposed to the slaughter of horses for food but did not endorse the slaughter ban bills in the 108th congress ahpa which maintains list of us and foreign horse sanctuaries had observed that not all sanctuaries may have the means or business skills to take in large numbers of horses and that nationwide standardsetting or oversight system exists for them4 texas rescue group stated some equine rescues are large organizations with system of checks that keep everyone honest others may be small one or two person operations there are national oversight organizations that can verify the honesty of nonprofit equine rescue 5 the national horse protection coalition nhpc asserted that sanctuary associations have accreditation programs and strict guidelines and that state and local animal welfare laws exist to ensure humane animal care others counter that such guidelines if they exist have not been endorsed or overseen by any nationally recognized authority and that most state and local laws are anticruelty measures not proactive care standards some including the humane society of the unit ed states hsus have observed that equine shelters are less wellestablished than cat and dog shelters which often are associated with local governments and humane societies citing the extreme costs and staff time needed to shelter horses hsus warned of needing to be aware of distinctions between sheltering horses and sheltering other companion animals6 the american association of equine practitioners aaep estimated that the cost of horses basic care approximates 1825 annually exclusive of veterinary and farrier care more recent study estimated the annual cost of caring for an unwanted horse at 23407 nhpc has argued not every horse currently going to slaughter will be rescued by one of these nonprofit organizations but many horses will be kept longer will be sold directly to new owner or will be humanely euthanized by licensed veterinarian among other alternatives euthanasia methodsprimarily chemical injection and in some emergency situations gunshots are considered by the nhpc and others to be more humane than slaughter which generally involves stunning with captive bolt to make the animal unconscious before it is killed and bled euthanasia averages from 50 to 150 per horse tiny fraction of the cost of keeping horse as companion or work animal nhpc has stated in response to arguments about the high expense of dealing with horse diverted from

g348g561opponents of slaughter ban contend that disposing of many additional horses each year could create environmental problems such as soil and groundwater contamination ban supporters counter that hundreds of thousands of us horses die naturally or are euthanized each year and are now safely disposed of many are not buried but sent to rendering plants where their remains are used in industrial
