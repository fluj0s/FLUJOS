bridge enewsletter lrhs congress lectures date all things depend on communication but lets get down to communication and space and we find his communication activity with another being through and across space was his first action which might have been susceptible to future mishmash and aberration hence communication is the top single aberrative button that you can push and push and push and itll run out the whole track because all things depend on communication communication is the common denominator to all reality communication must exist whatever else exists or one would never know that anything else existed this excerpt was taken from the success congress lectures communication cause to effect an article by l ron hubbard excerpted from the success congress lectures because nobody else was ever able really to get you into trouble you had to get yourself into trouble because of this then the communication factor involved in this was from cause to effect you have to process preclear at causepoint and it was at causepoint that you have to hit or its at causepoint that you have to hit with all processes you cant hit at effectpoint if you continue to hit at effect point youre running again second postulate so we have complete communication as earlier and more powerful than incomplete communication and we have cause as earlier and prior than effect if you can get the ideathis is an erroneous ideabut you get the idea of thetan sails into the universe he has to communicate before hes communicated to he has to make himself visible which is communication generation you see he has to say hes there one way or the other by either bringing in body or throwing out some sparks or doing something he has to say hes there before anybody can communicate back to him so therefore all communication is priorly causecausative communication and we get complete causative communication as being the button which then undoes all incomplete communications all effects and everything else right on up the line because communication is the common denominator to everything else all up the line you can use it to run out practically anything and everything anyplace an individuals decision to succumb came about on the day when he decided to register an observation of somebody elses postulate that the other person had been injured by his communication he had to decide his own communication had been bad or had been improper and that it had caused something to happen at the other end he didnt want to have happen he let himself be convinced one way or the other that his communication should not have occurred that the receiptpoint of the communication did not deserve it and should not have had it now this becomes the single trickthe single aberrative trick which is prior to all other aberrative tricks and on which all other aberrative tricks played by anybody depends l ron hubbard excerpted from the lecture communication processes this lecture is available in the success congress lectures success from listening to the congress lectures i have been listening to lrh lectures for long time i listened to the pdc lectures 25 times for about 4 years
