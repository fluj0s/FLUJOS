tax provisions for dependent care the dependent care tax credit dctc and the exclusion from income for employerprovided dependent care assistance programs dcap both provisions use the same definitions of qualified employment related expenses and qualifying dependents the working families tax relief act of 2004 pl 108311 changed the definition of qualifying dependent beginning in tax year 2005 to conform with changes made to the personal exemption for more uniform definition of child qualified employmentrelated expenses are those expenses for household services and care of qualifying dependent necessary for the taxpayer to be employed for the purposes of qualified employmentrelated expenses qualifying dependent is crs2 dependent less than 13 years of age for whom the taxpayer can claim personal exemption beginning in tax year 2005 the dependent under 13 must be qualifying child of the taxpayer as defined for the personal exemption1 dependent of the taxpayer who is physically or mentally incapable of providing self care beginning in tax year 2005 the dependent who is physically or mentally incapable of providing self care must live with the taxpayer for at least half the tax year or spouse of the taxpayer who is physically or mentally incapable of providing self care beginning in tax year 2005 the spouse who is physically or mentally incapable of providing self care must live with the taxpayer for at least half the tax year family may pay either private individual or dependent care center for dependent care dependent care center is facility that provides care for more than six individuals who are not residents and receives fee or other payment for providing those services however payments to dependent care center are qualified expenses only if the center meets all applicable state and local laws and regulations qualified expenses do not httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21466 include payments to child of the taxpayer under the age of 19 or payments to an individual the taxpayer can claim as dependent for the personal exemption dependent care credit dctc the dctc is calculated as percentage as high as 35 of qualified employmentrelated expenses for qualifying dependents pl 108311 eliminated beginning in tax year 2005 the requirement that the taxpayer maintain the household the qualified employmentrelated expenses for the dctc beginning in tax year 2003 are actual expenses capped at 3000 for one dependent and 6000 for two or more dependents if the taxpayer has two or more children the 6000 need not reflect 3000 per child the per child allocation does not matter as long as part of the 6000 is spent on each child the economic growth and tax relief reconciliation act of 2001 egtrra pl 10716 raised the expense limits from 2400 for one child and 4800 for two or more children and increased the credit percentage from 30 to 35 beginning in tax year 2003 egtrra also increased the income level at which the credit rate begins to phase down resulting in higher credit rate for incomes between 10000 and 43000 the egtrra increases will sunset at the end of 2010 and the dctc will revert to tax year 2002 levels for married taxpayers the qualified expenses are also limited to the lesser of the taxpayers or spouses earned income if the spouse is fulltime student or incapable of providing self care they are often not employed and earning income special rule exists for this situation each month that the spouse is fulltime student or incapable of providing self care the spouses income for purposes of calculating the credit is assumed to be 250 for one child and 500 for two or more children if the spouse is fulltime student all year this results in an income for purposes of the credit equal to the tax year 1 for more information on the qualifying child definition see internal revenue service irs publication 501 exemptions standard deduction and filing information available at httpwwwirsgovpubirspdfp501pdf crs3 2002 qualified expense levels of 3000 for one child and 6000 for two or more children married taxpayers must generally file joint return to take the dctc but special rules exists for couples who are legally separated or living apart the 35 rate is reduced by 1 point for each 2000 or fraction thereof by which income exceeds 15000 but the rate is not reduced below 20 as shown in table 1 the credit is 20 at incomes above 43000 table

tax credits2 taken against the sum of regular and alternative minimum tax liability in tax year 2005 total of 65 million returns used the dctc for total credit of 35 billion3 the nonrefundable nature of the credit results in many lower income taxpayers not being able to fully utilize the credit for example in tax year 2007 married couple with two children claiming standard deduction and qualifying expenses of 6000 would not have taxable income and taxes to offset with the credit until their total income was more than 24900 the 2 other nonrefundable credits include those for education retirement savings adoption and the child credit which is refundable for certain taxpayers 3 internal revenue service individual complete report publication 1304 table 33 available at

employerprovided dependent care assistance programs dcap taxpayer can exclude from income up to 5000 paid or incurred by an employer for qualified dependent care expenses under an employerprovided dcap the dcap definitions for qualified dependent care expenses and qualified dependent are the same definitions as for the dctc an employer can provide direct payment to child care providers provide onsite child care or reimburse parents for child care they obtain similar to the dctc payments made to dependent of the taxpayer or child of the taxpayer under age 19 are not excluded from income these arrangements are often funded through salary reduction agreements under salary reduction agreement the employee agrees that specified amount be set aside for the employers dcap4 the employer dcap must be written plan meeting certain rules for nondiscrimination among employees but need not be funded by the employer by using salary reduction an employee receives the benefit of the income exclusion during the tax year rather than at years end the tax savings from using dcap include for federal taxes the income set aside times the taxpayers marginal tax rate5 the payroll taxes on the income set aside if the taxpayers income exceeds the maximum amount subject to payroll taxes there is payroll tax savings and any applicable state taxes on the income set aside therefore for any given amount set aside the higher the taxpayers 4 the plan will then reimburse the employee from the set aside amount employee contributions for dependent care expenses this type of arrangement is also known as flexible spending arrangement or flexible spending account and is often offered as part of cafeteria benefit plan in which employees may choose from one or more taxable or nontaxable benefits 5 the marginal tax rate is the tax rate on an additional dollar of income crs5 tax brackets at the federal and state level the greater the potential savings from using dcap the employee benefits research institute ebri reports6 that in 2005 the average employee contribution to dependent care flexible spending plan was 2630 the national compensation survey in march 2007 by the bureau of labor statistics shows that 31 of employees had access to dependent care reimbursement account under section 125 cafeteria benefit plan7 interaction between the dctc and the dcap although both provisions use the same definition of employmentrelated expenses the same expenses cannot be used for both the dctc and dcap taxpayers must choose between the two tax provisions for the same qualified dependent care expenses for taxpayers in tax brackets higher than the dctc credit rate the dcap using salary reduction arrangement is more advantageous however because the dctc has higher limit 6000 in the case of two or more children higher income taxpayer may use up to 5000 in dcap with salary reduction and use 1000 of taxpayer paid employmentrelated expenses for the dctc httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21466
