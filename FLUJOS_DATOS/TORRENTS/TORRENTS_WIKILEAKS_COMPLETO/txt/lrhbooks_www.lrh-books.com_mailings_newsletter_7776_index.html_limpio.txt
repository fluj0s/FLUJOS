bridge publications inc newsletter date responsibility and education searching for data is not as reliable method of obtaining facts as taking responsibility for the object you wish to know about if you dont believe it take little kid sometime and show him machine and if he can at all grasp this concept of responsibility get him to take responsibility for various parts of the machine and then listen to him tell you what the machine is all about now education is that system of giving people data without making them responsible for any of it now an individual who will not take responsibility cannot change and person who cannot change cannot handle any problems and person who cant handle problems certainly cant help and person who cant help anything certainly wont create and person who cant or wont create is doing so because he cant or wont take responsibility for the actions and parades of his creations so this little thing goes round and round and round in an endless cycle l ron hubbard excerpted from the first postulate lectures the discovery of the rock an article by l ron hubbard from the first postulate lectures i have been carefully and gradually leading you up to this gigantic object i had to give you your lecture yesterday because yesterdays lecture contains most of the solutions to this object known as the rock now definition of rock is that facsimile which the preclear is continuously and obsessively creating and which he is suppressing below his level of consciousness with an inhibitor the rock in other words is an obsessive creation it is almost totally identified with anything and everything wrong with the bank its keynote is aaa reference book one we said one time that if you could find out what the mind was doing and parallel it you could undo it thats one of the earliest observations of dianetics well when i discovered this one that the mind was obsessively mocking up something and then inhibiting it obsessively it became very clear why there was reactive bank and when you say rock you mean the core center of the reactive mind not for this lifetime not for the body not for freud but for the whole track it is what the thetan has been accumulatingly wrecking himself with from time immemorial and explains the dwindling spiral he begins to obsessively mock this thing up and the longer he mocks it up the more he identities other things with it perhaps it was originally word of warning if i keep this mocked up then im not going to get into similar situation again so duplication old op pro by dup all by itself chipped away on the rock the service facsimile is computational lock on the rock and is that series of complaints or protests the preclear makes to protect the rock and that is the service facsimile therefore that about which the preclear complains had better never be audited by you except to make him little happier so you can get on with the job because youre auditing the protective coating of something now at the outset lets go into this with zero technicality thetan spirit you is actually capable of tremendous creation but when you have taken an irresponsibility for some part of your ability to create you can then continue to create without knowing that you are creating now we dont know that you arent creating the whole physical universe we dont know that you arent creating everybody you see we dont know this positively this is simply matter of whos god well youre the logical candidate youve accepted the blame for everything else you might as well accept the blame for that one now where you are capable of tremendous creativeness you very often find that creativeness painful or undesirable or upsetting in some way and you have potential of disowning itcreating it and disowning it at the same time so that you dont even know about it and this in essence is the reactive mind now when we talk about the rock we are talking about that thing that engram which an individual is continuously and obsessively compulsively creating and continuously and obsessively and compulsively inhibiting in such way that he knows nothing whatsoever about it so the first definition of the rock is that experience on the whole track which the person has totally disowned and is totally creating now the test of it is this if you improve persons ability to create mental image pictures you improve the quality of his reactive mind you improve the quality of his mental image pictures by improving his ability to create its quite important and this tells you why the rock remains obscure and why an individual continuously lessens his ability to create therefore it becomes painful to create if you become little bit better at creation over here with your left hand you are busily mocking up behind your back something that is butchering you and you get better able to mock up billboard out in front of you you also get better able to mock up total reactive mind what do we mean by reactive mind anything anybody has ever meant or summed up as an outofsight compulsive thinkingness that victimizes the individual now thoughts and engrams secondaries locks of course with their energy and masses and space and time tabs all go together to make up this reactive mind restimulation is simply signal in the environment which sets off the individuals compulsive need he thinks to mock up the unpleasant experience again actually an engram doesnt exist until it is keyed in do you remember dianetics doesnt exist until its keyed in it is not stored anywhere except in the capability of the person of recreating an experience its not stored there is bank which contains billion engrams which are selected out in some supermechanical way what happens is quite different the individual goes through an experience and until something reminds him of the experience doesnt even recreate picture of it but he has the potentiality of recreating the picture in full l ron hubbard excerpted from the lecture the rock click here for more information on the first postulate lectures responsibility and education the discovery of the rock the first postulate lectures what existed before the beginning the 20th advanced clinical course of 1958 was the toughest and most exciting acc yet delivered the knowhow of clearing was in place and the most profound secrets of unraveling the reactive mind were being taught by lrh and drilled and learned to perfection by these students lrh had isolated an even more direct route to the most fundamental aberration of any being but he knew that in order to successfully guide preclear down that route the auditor himself would need not only topnotch auditing skills but comprehensive understanding of the bank and how it works thus on 14 july 1958 the 20th advanced clinical course opened in washington dc with fiftytwo auditors in attendance the stage was set for broadscale clearing to occur the likes of which this universe had never seen the technology that lrh personally taught these select fiftytwo auditors is now available to you in the first postulate lectures the discovery of the basic incident on any preclears case and the processes
