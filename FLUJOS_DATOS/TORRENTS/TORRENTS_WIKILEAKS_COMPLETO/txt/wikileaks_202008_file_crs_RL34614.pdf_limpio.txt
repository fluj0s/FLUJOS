and safety issues for consideration introduction nanotechnology term encompassing nanoscale science engineering and technology is focused on understanding controlling and exploiting the unique properties of matter that can emerge at scales of one to 100 nanometers1 these properties are believed by many to offer substantial economic and societal benefits key issue before congress regarding nanotechnology is how best to protect human health safety and the environmen t as nanoscale materials and products are researched developed manuf actured used and discar ded while the rapidly emerging field of nanotechnology is believe d by many to offer significant economic and societal benefits some research results have raised concerns about the potential environmental health nd safety ehs implications of nanoscale materials potential tools the federal government mig ht use to address these concerns include research and development regula tion and international engagement some of the properties of nanoscale materials eg small size high surface areatovolume ratio that have given rise to great hopes for beneficial applications have also given rise to concerns about their potential adverse implications for the environment and human health and safety2 there are more than 600 nanotechnology products reporte dly commercially available3 and with this number of products concerns have be raised about the health and safety of the scientists working with nanoscale materials workers who manufacture the products consumers who use the products and members of th general public who may be

primarily on nanoscale materials that are intentionally designed and produced often referred to as engineered nanomaterials issues surrounding the potential ehs imp lications of nanotechnology emerged with the launch in 2000 of the national nanotechnology initiative nni the nni is multiagency federal effort to coor dinate and expand federal nanotechnology research and development rd effort s between fy2001 and fy2008 the federal government invested 84 billi on in nanotechnology rd many governments around the world have followed the us l ead and established their own national nanotechnology programs the private sector has invested heavily as well global nanotechnology rd investments public and private are estimated to have totaled 124 billion in 2006 alone4 such large investments and intensified efforts to capitalize on these public and private investments have caused some observers as detailed later in this report to suggest that there is insufficient in formation about the potential effects nanotechnology products and manufacturing processes ma have on human health safety and the environment they assert variety of uncertainties including how nanoscale particles might be tr ansported in air water and soil how they might react with the environment chemically biologica lly or through other processes how they might be distributed and deposited and whether they might accumulate in plants or animals others express the view that concer ns about nanotechnology ehs implications are often overgeneralized nd overstated among the arguments they put forth are that nanoscale materials are frequently embe dded in other materials as part of the manufacturing process that some nanotec hnology products such as semiconductors have nanoscale features but do not contain nanoscale par ticles that nanotechnology materials may replace other materials that have significant and known risks that some nanoscale particles tend to aggregate or agglomerate in the environment into larger particles that l onger have nanoscale dimensions and that people are regularly exposed to nanoscale particles pr oduced naturally and as incidental by products of human activities congressionallymandated reviews of the nni by the national research council nrc and the presidents council of advi sors on science and technology pcast have concluded that additi onal

results indicate that the reactivity of some nanopa rticles potentially can result in cell damage in animals13 carbon nanotubes cnts have pot ential uses in wide range of applications eg materials ba tteries memory devices electronic displays transparent conductors sensors medical imaging however some scientists have ex pressed concerns that some cnts exhibit properties similar to asbestos fibers and might become lodged in organs eg lung s harming humans and animals14httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34614crs7 ehs concerns about carbon nanotubes and other fullerenes much of the public dialogue about potential risks associated with nanotechnology has focused on carbon nanotubes cnts and other fullerenes molecules formed entirely of carbon atoms in the form of hollow sphere ellip soid or tube since they are currently being manufactured and are among the most promising nanomaterials these concerns have been amplified by some research on the effects of cnts on animals and on animal and human cells for example researchers have reported that carbon nanotubes inserted into the trachea of mice can cause lung tissue damagea that buckyballs spherical fullerenes caused brain damage in fishb and that buckyballs can accumulate with in cells and potentially cause dna damagec there are scientists who have argued that experiments indicating cntfullerene toxicity are not conclusive they suggest that toxicity reported by researchers may have resulted from uncharacterized contaminants in the samples resulting from the synthesis purification and postprocessing methods used in the manufacture of cnts thus they assert the experiments could be measuring the toxicity of nonnanoscale materials and therefore unfairly indicting nanoscale materials they also contend that such nonnanoscale contaminants if identified as toxic potentially could be eliminated or controlled in the manufacturing process the issue of contaminants is often cited by advocates for improved standards reference materials sensors instrumentation and other technologies for the characterization of nanoscale materials some experiments have produced results that indicate cntsfullerenes are nontoxic research on singlewalled carbon nanotubes swcnt s by the institute of toxicology and genetics in karlsruhe germany reported that in three of four different types of tests conducted swcnts did not show toxicity in the fourth test which appeared to indicate swcnt toxicity the researchers concluded that the results were false positive and explained how the swcnts interacted with the materials in the assay to produce misleading result these researchers concluded that this result points to the need for careful selection of assays and the need for the establishment of standards for toxicity testing of cnts and other nanomaterialsd work at rice universitys center for biological and environmental nanotechnology conducted in 2005 found cell toxicity of cnts to be low and that it could be reduced further through simple chemical changes to the surfacee earlier research demonstrated that similar surface modifications of buckyballs reduced their toxicity nanotechnology may offer the potential to engineer around known and potential hazards by changing the size molecular construction or other property of nanoscale material to make it safe or less hazardous experts advise that the potential to do so will require thorough understanding of the properties of the various nanoparticles and their effects on humans and other organisms lam cw james jt mccluskey r and hunter rl pulmonary toxicity of singlewall

engineering disciplines and technological appli cations sufficient knowledge has been developed about the useful properties of certain nanom aterials how they can be manufactured and how they can be applied in useful ways to enable commercial product development in other areas of nanotechnology fundamental research on nanoscale phenomena and processes is under way that may lead to greater understanding and beneficial pplications in the years ahead in general however nanotechnology is still an emerging field nd there is dearth of information about how nanoscale particles and vices might adversely affect human health safety and the environment accordingly there is widespread agreement on the need for more research to better unders tand such implications in reviews of the nni15 both the national research council and the presidents council of advisors on scie nce and technology pcast concluded that assessment of potential nanotechnology ehs risks is not possible due to the absence of information and tools according to the nrc it is not yet possible to make rigorous assessment of the level of risk posed by engineered nanomaterials further risk assessment protocols have to be developed and more research is required to enable assessment of potential ehs risks from nanomaterials16 similarly pcast concluded that it is premature to rigorously assess the levels of risk posed by engineered nanomaterials adequate tools are bein g developed but are not yet in place17 leaders of the nni have argued strongly that to achieve the economic societal and ehs benefits of nanotechnology the nation must concurrently address its potential adverse effects according to thenunder secretary of commerce for technology phillip j bond leading administration advocate for the

nanotechsafety101paperpdfaddressing societal and et hical issues is the right thing to do and the necessary thing to do it is the right thing to do because as ethically responsible leaders we must ensure that technology advances human wellbeing and does not detract from it it is the necessary thing to do because it is essential for speeding technology adoption broadening the ec onomic and societal benefits and accelerating and increasing our return on investment18 this is view shared by many in the business community 2006 survey of business leaders in the field of nanotec hnology indicated that nearly twothirds believe that the risks to the public th workforce and the environment due to exposure to nano particles are not known and 97 believe that it is very important or somewhat important for the government to address potential health effects and environmental risks that may be associated with nanotechnology19 the project on emerging nanotechnolog ies pen has warned that bad practices in nanotechnology research or production may result in nanotechnology accident that would chill investment galvanize public opposition and generally lead to lot of hand wringing on the part of governments who are betting large sums of money on the nanotech revolution20 successfully addressing ehs issues is s een as vital for those potentially exposed to nanoscale materials eg consumers researchers manufacturing workers the general public businesse s and investors for variety of reasons protecting and improving human health safety and the environment enabling accurate and efficient risk assessments risk managementand costbenefit tradeoffs ensuring public confidence in the safety of nanotechnology research engineering manufacturing and use preventing problem in one pplication area of nanotechnology from having negative consequences for the use of nanotechnology in unrelated application areas due to public fears legislative interventions or an overlybr oad regulatory response and ensuring that society can enjoy the widespread economic and societal benefits that nanotechnolog is believed by many to offerhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34614crs10 in addition the us regulatory envi ronment for nanotechnology could be an enabler for innovation and contribute to strong sustainable economy by creating predictability accurately ssessing risks and benefits and fostering the swift movement of safe pr oducts into the market such an environment is likely to favor nanotechnologyrelated inves tments and innovative activities in the united states by domestic and foreign stakeholders as oppos ed to nations where such regulatory conditions do not exist conversely if the us regulatory envi ronment is not handled effectively ie if it lacks predictability if regulatory approaches do not accurately assess risks and benefits or if appr oval processes are too long or ex pensive it could prove major impediment to innovation economic growth and job creation as well as posing potential threat to health safety and the environment in such regulatory environment investment capital may be driven away from nanotechnology potentially beneficial products may not be developed sa fe products may be denied regulatory approval or uns afe products may be allowe d to enter the market alternatively nanotechnology investme nts research nd production may be driven to other nations with preferable regulatory environments on the one hand such regulatory system might be more desirable to investors and companies because it is more predictable more efficient and less costly in such case the united states might miss out on nanotechnologys pot ential economic benef its on the other hand if other nations regulatory system s are more attractive to investors and producers because those systems underregula or do not regulate at all then nanotechnology research development nd production could present increased ehs risks worldwide selected issues for consideration given the widespread agreement that nanotechnology ehs concerns must be addressed discourse on how best to do so has focused on three main issues federal investment in ehs research federal regulation and international engagement these issues are closely interrelated for example reliable ehs research is required by regulatory bodies to termine whether and how to regulate nanotechnology products since all nations f ace the same fundament health safety and environmental issues international coordination on ehs re search could help accelerate development of common body of knowledge through the sharing of results and reduction in redunda nt research this shared knowledge could in turn inform regulatory decision making nd perhaps improve the consistency of regulations among nations regulations st andards and enforcement might need to be coordinated worldwide to protect worker s and consumers as in termediate and final products are frequently produced along global supply chains and sold in industrial and commercial markets around the world in addition one nations policies governing nanotechnology production use nd disposal may have implications for nearby nations and perhaps for all nationshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34614crs11 21 nehi is working group of the nanoscale science engineering and technology nset subcommittee of the white house national sc

practicality and efficacy of such an approach some argue that it is unlikely that omb would commit to multiyear multiagency roadmap accompanied by specific funding levels such an approach would depart from the current executive branch annual budget development process and reduce om bs flexibility in future years in addition agencies often have to res pond to new requirements based on emergent

inc onsistent regulation of nanomaterialsa there is general agreement among stakehol ders that these activities can contribute to creating an environment where research re sults can be reliably shared and compared to protecting human health and safety and to creating common language about nanotechnology that increases clarity in the sharing of ideas and information however international standardization efforts are often time and resourceconsuming and can divert resources from more pressing needs in addition such efforts can be used by nations and other organizations for competitive

nanotechnol ogy ehs research into single office would likely decouple such research fro m related efforts within nni agencies and from the knowledge base in the agencies that is currently networked

to the existing regulatory system while these factors may affect broad range of technologies nanotechnology may be especially affected due to the rapid growth in public and private rd investments in

properties at the nanoscale for example platinum which exhibits magnetism in its bulk form shows significant magnetic properties in nanoscale clusters of 13 atoms the optical properties of gold also can change with particle size at 10 nanometers gold particles absorb green light and appear red not gold not only can nanoscale particles differ in properties from bulk material with the same chemical composition they may also differ from other nanoscale materials with the same chemical composition for example the melting point of an element which was believed to be constant regardless of the elements particle size can change with particle size nanotechnology research has demonstrated that the melting temperature of gold decreases when the particles radius drops below 10 nanometers from

commerce70 under the provisions of tsca producers of new material must provide epa with premanufacture notifi cation pmn epa then has 90 days to approve manufacture to require informa tion from manufacturers or to restrict chemical use other tsca provisions permit epa regulation of existing chemicals already in commerce but these rely on ep factfinding and rulemaking before epa can require testing or restrict uses veral ngos have urged epa to consider all nanoscale materials new regardless of whet her the material is on the epa inventory list in its bulk form71 however some nanotechnolog materials have the same chemical composition as materials that are already in commerce raising the question of whether the nanotechnology materials are new and thus subject to pmn requirements with respect to this issue epa stated that epa is considering how best to evaluate and where appropriate manage the risks associated with engineered nanoscale materials nms nanoscale

ruling that device that incorpor ates substance intended to prevent destroy or mitigate pests is considered pesticide and is required to be registered under fifra while the ruling is not unique to nanomaterials it came in the context of advertising claims for washing machine containing nanoscale silver ions that kill microbes epas ruling made this appliance the first nanotechnology product to
