property rights ipr traditionally have been matters of national concern individual nation states have developed ipr regimes reflecting their national needs and priorities over time intellectual property protection and enforcement have come to the forefront as key international trade issue for the united states figuring prominently in the multilateral trade policy arena and in regional and bilateral us free trade agreements ftas the protection and enforcement of ipr in the united states and abroad is of key interest to congress intellectual property is an increasingly critical component of the us economy industries that rely on intellectual property protection in the united states claim to lose billions of dollars each year due to overseas ipr infringement there is also concern about the potential health and safety consequences of counterfeit pharmaceutical drugs and other products as well as the link between terrorist groups and traffic in counterfeit and pirated goods the role of congress in addressing ipr and traderelated issues stems from the us constitution which provides congress with the power to regulate international trade while authority to negotiate trade agreements has been delegated periodically to the president congressional action is needed to bring the agreements into force in promoting ipr through international trade policy congress may choose to consider whether or not ftas are an appropriate vehicle for boosting intellectual property protection and enforcement congress may also balance ipr protection and enfo rcement with other public policy goals such as access to medicine in poor or developing countries another issue that is before congress is the effectiveness of the current us coordinating structure for promoting international ipr support in the 110 th congress legislation was enacted to establish new entity to coordinate intellectual property activities within the federal government legislation was also introduced calling for greater us international ipr enforcement efforts and increased prioritization of resources devoted to such activities this report discusses the different kinds of ipr forms of ipr infringement importance of ipr to the us economy estimated losses associated with ipr infringement organizational structure of ipr protection in multilateral regional bilateral us government agencies involved with

licensed to others usually in return for fees and or royalty payments although the world trade organizations wto agreement on traderelated aspects of intellectu property rights trips provides minimum standards for ipr protections such rights are granted on national basis and are in general enforceable only in the country in which they are granted however countries are obliged to abide by wto rules and their ipr enforcement practices can be challenged by other countries at the wto g18g138g157g142g151g157g156g561 the patent act 35 usc 101 et seq governs the issuance and use of patents in the united states patents are granted for inventions of new products processes or organisms known as utility patents patents may also be granted for designs and plants for an invention to be patentable it must be new nonobvious invol ving an inventive step and have potential industrial or commercial application the patent provides the holder with the exclusive right to sell the invention for period of 20 years or to prevent the incorporation of the invention into other products without the permission of the righ tsholder the patent right is based on the proposition that inventors must be granted temporary monopoly over their invention in order to encourage innovation and to promote the expend iture of money on research and development the patentholder recoups his upfront costs through temporary monopoly over sale of the invention in return for this economic rent the patentholder must disclose the content of the patent along with test data and other information concerning the invention this is meant to spur further creativity by those seeking to build on the patent after its expiration domestically patents are granted by the patent and trademark office pto of the department of commerce g22g155g138g141g142g561g21g142g140g155g142g157g156g561 trade secret is any type of valuable information including formula pattern compilation program device method technique or process that derives independent economic value from not being generally known or readily ascertainable and is subject to reasonable efforts by the owner to maintain its secrecy1 examples of trade secrets include blueprints customer lists and pricing information while protection of patents and copyright is matter of federal law trade secret protection is found also in state law however most states subscribe to the uniform trade secret act utsa there are important differences between trade secrets and patents individuals do not have to apply for trade secret protection as they would do with patents protection of trade secrets originates immediately with the creation of the trade secret there is process for applying for or registering trade secrets trade secret protection does not expire unless the trade secret becomes known in contrast patent applicants must disclo information about their innovation to the pto in order to acquire patent patents offer rights holders stronger protection but for limited period of time while applying for patent can be costly and lengthy process patents are valuable if the confidentiality of the innovation is fragile or if the area of research is highly competitive 1 uniform trade secret act 14

united states is based on the copyright act 17 usc 101 et seq copyrights protect original expressions of authorship such protections include literary or artistic works such as books music sound recordings movies paintings architectural works and computer software and databases though not individual bits of data traditionally copyrights differed from patents in that there was claim to industrial applicability or novelty of the idea the expression of the idea not the underlying idea was being copyrighted while some of the criteria for copyrights differ from those of patents the objective is the same investments of time money and effort to create work of cultural social and economic significance should be protected to encourage further creativity us law protects authorship for life plus 70 years for personal works or 120 years from creation or 95 years from publication for corporate works copyrights may be registered by the copyright office of the library of congress or acquired through creating and fixation of the work of authorship g22g155g138g141g142g150g138g155g148g156g561 trademark protection in the united states is governed jointly by state and federal law the main federal statute is the lanham act of 1946 15 usc 1051 et seq also known as service marks trademarks permit the seller to use distinctive name mark or symbol to identify and market product service or company the trademark allows quick identification of the sellers product and for good or ill can become an indicator of products quality if for good the trademark can be valuable in the introduction of new products by conveying an instant assurance of quality the trademark is designed to prevent other companies with similar merchandise from freeriding on the association of quality with the trademarked item thus trademarked good may command premium in the marketplace because of its reputation for trademarks distinctiveness is at premium because trademark must capture the consumers imagination to be effective as generic names of commodities cannot be trademarked tr ademark rights are acquired through use or through registration with the pto related concept to trademarks is the geographic indication which is also protected by the lanham act the geographic indication acts to protect the quality and reputation of distinctive product originating in certain region however the benefit does not accrue to sole producer but rather the producers of region geographic indications are generally sought for agricultural products or wines and spirits protection for geographical indications is acquired in the united states by registration with the pto through process similar to trademark registration 2

owners exclusive rights as afforded by patent laws involves third partys unauthorized use of the patented device as relates to international trade the greatest challenge to the patent right is infringement in foreign countries or non observance by wto member states to the minimal standards of the trips agreement copyright infringement occurs when third party engages in one of the acts requiring the copyright owners 2 for information on geographical indications and international trade negotiations see crs report rs21569 geographical indications and wto negotiations by charles

sound or visual recordings of and broadcasting the copyrighted work g18g146g155g138g140g162g561 the term piracy has applications to both copyrights and trademarks the major challenge facing copyright protection is piracy either th rough physical duplication of the work illegal dissemination of copyrighted material such as computer software music or movies over the internet andor participation in commercial transactions of copyrighted materials without the consent of the copyright owner with respect to trademarks piracy involves the registration or use of famous foreign trademark that is not registered in the country or is invalid because the trademark has not been used g5g152g158g151g157g142g155g143g142g146g157g146g151g144g561 an imitation of product is referred to as counterfeit or fake counterfeit products are manufactured marketed and distributed with the appearance of being the genuine good and originating from the genuine manufacturer3 the purpose of counterfeit goods is to deceive consumers about their origin and nature counterfeiting and copying of original goods is major challenge for trademarked products the counterfeited product can be sold for premium because of its association of the original item while reducing the sales of the original items furthermore consumer experience with counterfeited good of inferior quality can damage the reputation of the trademark product popular examples of counter feit products in fake fashionwear such as louis vuitton bags or rolex watches or fake pharmaceutical products such as popular brand name prescription medicines related issue is the imitation of labels and packaging of trademarked goods in this situation the imitator uses trademark that is confusingly similar to wellknown trademark in order to benefit from the reputation of the product with which he is competing

international agreements are concentrated in firms headquartered in the united states and other developed economies developing countries tend to be net importers of intellectual property for example half of the approximately 56 million patents in force in 2005 were from companies or inventors in japan 28 of total or the united states 21 of total4 through the patent cooperation treaty pct an international patent filing system administered by the world intellectual property organization wipo these two countries continued to represent little over half of all international patent filings in

their businesses among the industries that are dependant on patent protection are the aerospace automotive computer consumer electronics pharmaceutical and semiconductor industries copyrightbased industries include the software data processing motion pictures publishing and recording industries other industries that indirectly benefit from ipr protection include retailers traders and transportation businesses which support the distribution of goods and services derived from intellectual property 8 according to 2004 study us industries that rely on intellectual property accounted for close to 40 of total growth achieved by the us private sector in 2003 these industries comprised about 20 of the private sectors contribution to the us gross domestic product gdp that same year with almost 18 million workers the intellectual property industries are one of the largest source of jobs in the united states employees receive notably higher wages than individuals in other sectors9 more broadly iprintensive industries also contribute positively to the us economy through productivity gains and other spillover effects the intellectual property industries contribute positively to the overall us trade balance through royalties and licensing fees rightsholders may authorize the use of technologies trademarks and entertainment products that they own to entiti in foreign countries resulting in revenues through royalties and license fees10 in 2006 us receipts from crossborder trade in royalties and license fees relating to patent trademark copyright and other intangible rights amounted to 634 billion and payments totaled 264 billion this resulted in surplus of 370 billion 6 percent increase from the previous of year11 industryspecific figures also demonstrate the importance of the intellectual property to the us economy for example the business and entertainment software motion pictures recording and publishing industries which rely on copyright protection was estimated to constitute about 819 billion or about 7 of us gdp in 2005 these industries accounted for nearly 13 of us economic growth and 4 of us employment 54 million workers in 2005 foreign sales and exports

several factors contribute to the growing problem of ipr infringement while the costs and time for research and development are high ipr infringement is associated with relatively low costs and risks and high profit margin for instance based on survey of ten pharmaceutical companies the tufts center for the study of drug development estimated that the cost for developing new drug cost was over 800 million on average 15 according to phrma it takes about 10 to 15 years of research and developm ent to create new drug pharmaceutical companies collectively spent an estimated 552 billion for research and development in 200616 in contrast drug counterfeiters can lower production costs by using inexpensive and perhaps dangerous or ineffective ingredient substitutes the development of technologies and products which can be easily duplicated such as recorded or digital media has led to an increase in counterfeiting and piracy increasing internet usage also has contributed to the distribution of counterfeit and pirated products additionally civil and criminal penalties often are not sufficient deterrents for piracy and counterfeiting the united states is especially concerned with foreign ipr infringement of us intellectual property compared to foreign countries ipr infringements levels in the united states are estimated to be relatively low g21g142g146g163g158g155g142g156g561 because of the secretive illicit nature of ipr infringement it is difficult to estimate the magnitude of its impact on us producers and exporters however data on seizures of counterfeit and pirated goods can be obtained from customs authorities one study by the organization for economic cooperation and deve lopment oecd indirectly extrapolated available customs data on seizures to conclude that worldwide trade in counterfeit and pirated goods may have amounted to 200 billion in 2005 in particular the study used the customs information to estimate the probability that imports of particular goods from particular countries would be pirated or counterfeit the oecd estimate does not include the counterfeit and pirated goods produced and consumed within country and does not include infringing goods

estimates do not account for internet piracy which iipa contends is an important contributor to copyright piracy 24 there is possibility that such ipr infringement loss estimates actually may overestimate the extent to which sales of pirated and counterfeit goods displace legitimate sales the basic economic model employed in such estimates assumes that there is perfect substitutability between pirated and legitimate goods which would equate sales of pirated goods to revenue losses of legitimate us copyright businesses some analysts suggest that legitimate firms face competition threat only if the individuals purchasing counterfeit products would be able and willing to purchase the legitimate product at the price offered when piracy is not present 25 for consumers in poor developing countries especially this assumption may not be tenable there is not always direct relationship between ipr infringement rates and the costs to us firms the size of countrys market and us industries access to the market affect the extent to which infringement rates translate into costs to us iprbased industries for instance the united states had the lowest software piracy rate in the world in 2006 21 however the united states was also the largest contributor to piracy losses for the us business software industry because of the significant size of the do mestic computer software market losses to the software industry from usbased piracy totaled 73 billion in 2006 by contrast countries with higher software piracy rates nevertheless had lower infringement costs to us software firms see table 3 the smaller sizes of the markets in these countries contributed to lower piracy related absolute losses stemming from these countries the worldwide software piracy rate was 35 with

organization wto an international organization established in 1995 as the successor to the general agreements on tariffs and trade ga tt the wto was established as the result of the uruguay round of trade negotiations 19861994 which resulted in numerous agreements on trade in goods services investment and other nontariff barriers to trade one of the uruguay round agreements was the agreement on traderelated aspects of intellectual property rights trips the trips agreement sets minimum standards on intellectual property rights protection and enforcement with which all wto member states must comply the united states the european countries and the ipr business community were instrumental in including ipr on the uruguay round agenda many developing countries were wary of including ipr in trade negotiations preferring to discuss them under the world intellectual property organization wipo see below instead however developing countries acceded after being granted delayed compliance periods and after achieving negotiating goals on other issues such as textiles and clothing and savoring the prospect of operating under rulesbased trading system while previous international agreements on intellectual property rights continue to exist see table 4 the trips agreement was the first time that intellectual property rules were incorporated into the multilateral trading system two basic tenets of the trips agreement are national treatment signatories must treat parties of other wto members less favorably in terms of ipr protection than the partys own na tionals and mostfavorednation treatment any advantage in ipr protection granted to the party of another wto member shall be granted to nationals of all other wto member states much of the trips agreement sets out the extent of the agreements coverage of the various types of intellectual property copyrights trademarks geographical indications industrial designs patents layout of circuitry design trade secrets and test data the trips agreement provisions build on several existing ipr treaties administered by the wipo discussed below another part provides standards of enforcement for ipr covered by the agreement it enumerates standards for civil and administrative procedures and remedies the application of border measures and criminal procedures council for the trips agreement was established to monitor the implementation of the agreement and transition arrangements were devised for developing countries finally the agreement provides for the resolution of disputes under the uruguay round agreements dispute settlement u nderstanding dsu the binding nature of the dsu with the possibility of the withdrawal of trade concessions usually the reimposition of tariffs for noncompliance sets

all36 article 7 declares that the protection and enforcement of ipr should contribute to the promotion of technological innovation and to the transfer and dissemination of technology to the mutual advantage of producers and users of technological knowledge and in manner conducive to social and economic welfare and to balance of rights and obligations this paragraph attempts to link the protection of ipr with greater technology transfer including technology covered by ipr protection to the developing worldthe language itself has been interpreted in various ways developed countries have tended to consider this language exhortatory but developing countries have tried without much success to make technology transfer meaningful obligation within the trips agreement system article 662 of the agreement requires developed country members to provide incentives to their enterprises and institutions to promote technology transfer to leastdeveloped countries to assist them in establishing viable technology base developed countries report annually on their efforts to encourage technology transfer ldcs complying with international ipr standards may impose greater burdens on developing countries than developed countries developing countries generally have to engage in greater efforts to bring their laws judicial processes and enfor cement mechanism into compliance with the trips agreement consequently developing countries were given an extended period of time in which to bring their laws and enforcement mechanisms into compliance with the trips agreement developing countries and postsoviet states were given an additional four years from the entry into force of the agreement january 1 1995 for products that were not covered by countrys patent system such as

in agreeing to launch the doha round of wto trade negotiations trade ministers adopted declaration on the trips agreement and public health on november 14 200139 the declaration sought to alleviate developing count ry dissatisfaction with aspects of the trips regime it delayed the implementation of patent system provisions for pharmaceutical products for least developed countries ldcs until 2016 the declaration committed member states to interpret and implement the agreement to support public health and to promote access to medicines for all the declaration recognized certain flexibilities in the trips agreement to allow each member to grant compulsory licenses for pharmaceuticals and to determine what constitutes national emergency expressly including public health emergencies such as hivaids malaria and tuberculosis or other epidemics paragraph 6 of the declaration directed the wto members to formulate solution to corollary concern the use of compulsory licensing by countries with insufficient or inadequate manufacturing capability compulsory licenses are issued by governments to authorize the use or production of patented item by domestic party other than patent holder they are authorized by article 31 of trips which places certain limitations on their use scope duration provision that predominantly restricted production authorized by compulsory license to the domestic market became the focal point of the negotiations because it in effect conveys the right of compulsory licensing only to countries with the capability to manufacture given product countries without domestic manufacturing capability were essentially precluded from using this flexibility of the trips agreement on the eve of the cancun ministerial in august 2003 wto members agreed on decision 40 to waive the domestic market provision of the trips article on compulsory licensing article 31f for exports of pharmaceutical products for hivaids malaria tuberculosis and other epidemics to least developed countries ldcs and countries with insufficient manufacturing capacity this decision was incorporated as an amendment to the trips agreement at the hong kong ministerial in december 2005 the amendment must be ratified by twothirds of the 152 wto member states until then the 2003 waiver continues in force to date 43 countries the united states switzerland salvador south korea norway india the philippines israel japan australia singapore hong kong china mauritius egypt mexico and the 27 countries of the european union have ratified the amendment 41 the system established by the wto allows ldc and countries without sufficient manufacturing capacity to issue compulsory license to company in country that can produce such product after matching compulsory license is issued by the producer country the drug can be manufacturing and exported subject to various notification requirements quantity and safeguard restrictions while several exporting countries have established laws and

instrument to promote stronger ipr regimes by foreign trading partners in general the united states has viewed the trips agreement and wipoadministered treaties as minimum standard and has pursued higher ipr protection and enforcement levels through regional and bilateral agreements g22g155g138g141g142g561g18g155g152g150g152g157g146g152g151g561g3g158g157g145g152g155g146g157g162g561 under trade promotion authority tpa congress delegates its constitutional authority to regulate foreign commerce to the president to negotiate and enter into certain free trade agreements ftas and to have their implementing bills considered under expedited legislative procedures amendment upordown vote pr ovided the president follows the guidelines objectives reporting and consultation requirements mandated by congress ipr have become important negotiating objectives in grants of trade promotion authority the most recent extension of that authority expired on july 1 2007 ipr negotiating objectives were first enacted in trade negotiating authority then known as fast track authority by the omnibus trade and competitiveness act of 1988 p l 100418 the act sought enactment and enforcement of adequate ipr protection from negotiating partners it also sought to strengthen international rules dispute settlement and enforcement procedures through the ga tt and other existing intellectual property conventions this negotiating mandate led to the establishment of the trips agreement during the uruguay round and the ipr provisions in north american free trade agreement nafta fta negotiations in this century have been conducted under the trade promotion authority act of 2002 p l 107210 in the intervening period since the 1988 act the trips agreement came into force and the ipr provisions of nafta became the template for further bilateral or regional ftas thus the focus of ipr negotiating objectives shifted from creating to strengthening the ipr trade regime one broad objective was to apply the existing ipr protection to digital media the negotiating objectives contained provisions to extend ipr protection to new and emerging technologies and to methods of transmission and dissemination the language called for standards of enforcement to keep pace with techno logical change and to allow rightsholders the legal and technological protections for their works over the internet and other new media second broad objective was to negotiate trade agreements in terms of ipr that reflect standard of protection similar to that found in us law 46 this phrase opened the door to the negotiation of provisions that go beyond the level of protection provided in the trips agreement often referred to as tripsplus provisions these obligations include expanding coverage to new sectors establishing more extensive standards of protection and reducing the flexibility options available in trips some of the new asures also address technological innovations that have come about since the trips agreement 47 46 pl 107210 sec 2102b4 47 the european union also plans to pursue what are considered to be tripsplus provisions by some in future economic partnership agreements with

agreement on trade policy that addressed democratic concerns about the implications of enhanced ipr on developing countries ability to meet public health needs in particular congressional leadership sought to ensure that pending ftas allowed trading partners to have enough flexibility to meet their ipr obligations and to be able to promote access to lifesaving medicines while otherwise meeting their international ipr protection and enforcement obligations ipr language previously negotiated in the ftas with the developing countries of peru panama and colombia discussed below subsequently were modified to reflect the agreement because korea is an industrialized country the united states did not significantly scaledown the patent protection obligations in the uskorea fta what follows is

g18g138g157g142g151g157g156g561 patent protection is arguably the most contentious area of us fta negotiations on ipr issues while the united states and other developed countries advocate for strong patent protections in order to promote innovation there is concern that such stringent protections may delay developing countries access to generic drugs and increase prices many of the ftas in force include tripsplus patent provisions the most prominent of which are patent term length extensions linkages between regulatory authority and patent status data protection compulsory licensing and parallel importation the ftas with peru panama and colombia respond to the concerns of some members of congress over provis ions that could restrict access to medicines in these countries and contain less ambitious standards for pharmaceutical patents compared to previously negotiated ftas pharmaceutical industry advocates express concern that this scale down in patent protection in these ftas may set precedent for future fta negotiations 49 g18g138g157g142g151g157g561g22g142g155g150g561g7g161g157g142g151g156g146g152g151g156g561 many ftas include provisions for mandatory patent term length extensions beyond the trips agreement obligation of patent protection terms of twenty years from the filing date these ftas allow for extensions in cases of unreasonable delays in the issuance of patents due to the regulatory review or administrative process patent holders contend that such measures enhance the ability of rightsholders to recoup the costs of research and development of new products however there is concern that patent terms extensions may delay the entry of generic drugs into market in scaledown from tripsplus obligat ions ftas with peru colombia and panama state that

general the term patent linkage refers to the attachment of regulatory approval for the marketing of drug with the status of patent if patent exists the fda and its counterparts in other countries may not grant marketing approval for generic version of drug that is patented in the country without the permission of the pate nt holder patent linkage is common provision in the trade agreements obtained by the united states this presents departure from trips under which generic drug manufacturers are able to apply for marketing approval without the patent owners permission and prior to the expiration of the patent this may reduce the time it takes for generic drugs to enter market once the patent expires 50 in light of developing country concerns about delays in access to generic versions of drugs ftas signed with peru panama and colombia do not tie marketing approval for generic drug with the patent status of its brand name drug

products in order to market them the trips agreement requires members to take measures to protect such data from disclosure and unfair commercial use the trips agreement does not prescribe any time period for this protection recent us ftas take these standards step further generally requiring fiveyear period of marketing exclusivity for the patent holder which typically begins from the date the product is approved in the country under this tripsplus provision generic drug manufacturers who want to market and distribute generic version of drug while the data exclusivity period is in effect must conduct their own clinical trials and submit their own findings to the national drug regulatory authority they cannot rely on the findings submitted by the patent holder some critics contend that such provisions may raise the cost of manufacturing generic versions of patented drugs as well as delay access to generic forms of drugs the ftas with peru panama and colombia now include provisions that may reduce data exclusivity terms of five years by minimum of six months in practice 51 g5g152g150g153g158g149g156g152g155g162g561g14g146g140g142g151g156g146g151g144g561 compulsory license is an authorization by government for third parties such as company or the government itself for the manufacture or use of product under patent without the permission of the rights holder the trips agreement permits signatories to issue compulsory licenses for patented devices and provide compensation to the owner of the patent and does not limit the situations in which such licenses may be issued the third party must have attempted to obtain permission from the patent holder although this requirement is waived in times of national emergency or other extenuating circumstances us ftas with australia and singapore limit attaining compulsory licenses only for domestic use and to situations of remedying antitrust violations or in situations of public noncommerci use national emergency or other cases of 50 while trips does not directly speak to the rights of generic drug manufacturers in obtaining marketing approval for generic drug before the expiration of the patented drug article

of the rightsholder after those goods were legitimately sold elsewhere parallel importation relates to the concept of territorial exhaustion of iprs which governs the extent of ipr after the first

the rightshol der under an international system ipr are exhausted at the first sale for any destination and such goods can be exported freely article 6 of the trips specifically excludes issues arising from exhaustion of ipr from wto dispute settlement allowing each member to adopt different exhaustion regimes thus trips does not address the issue of parallel imports some developing countries contend that parallel importation is an alternative method for governments to incr ease access to medicines in the absence of compulsory license 52 pharmaceutical companies have voiced concerns that this practice threatens their ability to engage in price differentiation between different markets us ftas negotiated with australia singapore and morocco disallow parallel importing of

ftas the trips agreement does not mention any obligations regarding rightsmanagement informa tion which is electronic information that identifies protected work its author and terms and conditions of use 53 perhaps due to the fact these technologies were not available at the time in contrast usnegotiated trade agreements prohibit the removal or alteration of such information while patent protection has experienced policy shifts in the ftas with peru panama and colombia copyright protection provisions have remained fairly consistent through the ftas in general fta signatories are obligated to provide an additional twenty years of copyright protection this brings the minimum copyright term to seventy years from the death of the author or authorized publication compared to fifty

information gathering and analysis based on the ustrs annual trade barriers report and consultations with wide variety of sources including government agen cies industry groups other private sector representatives congressional leaders and foreign governments the special 301 statute is the overall guideline for identifying countries for the various lists however placements are country specific and according to ustr official take into consideration host of factors several of which are mentioned in the special 301 report 57 these include the level and scope of the countrys ipr infringement and their impact on the us economy other considerations include the strength of the countrys ipr laws and enforcement of ipr laws the ustr also evaluates progress made by the country in improving ipr protection and enforcement in the past year however even significant progress oftentimes does not change the position or inclusion of country on the lists for instance the ustr may decide not to upgrade country from the priority watch list to the watch list so that it can continue monitoring the countrys intellectual property practices also the ustr may note si gnificant progress made by country but not remove the country from the special 301 list in order to continue highlighting concerns about the countrys practices and limit backsliding another consideration for the ustr is the sincerity of the countrys commitment to multilateral and bilateral trade agreements there is weighting criteria for the factors or formula to determine the placement of country on the watch list

inclusion of ipr provisions in the trip s agreement there has been an ongoing debate about the appropriateness of including ipr as component of us trade policy some argue that ipr which grant legal temporary monopolies to rightsholders for their creations are actually barriers to trade and have place in trade liberalization negotiations others contend that ipr promote trade through innovation economic growt h and technology transfer from advanced to developing countries in addition to this broader discussion about the role of ipr in trade policy concerns have been voiced about the trade policy channels used by the united states to promote international ipr protection and enforcement the bush administration has pursued strengthened international ipr through multilateral regional and bilateral venues however some question the appropriateness of using regional and bilateral ftas for this purpose contending that such actions take away from the effectiveness of multilateral ipr promotion efforts periodically members of congress have expressed concern over us attempts to expand the ipr obligations of foreign countries through trade agreements in 2002 the tpa legislation was amended to state that the united states recognized the doha declaration on the trips agreement and public health in the context of negotiating ftas in the 110 th congress congressional democrats and the administration agreed to modifications of the patent provisions in the peru fta as result of the may 2007 bipartisan trade agreement still new government accountability office gao report suggests that ustr should offer clearer policy guidance to align fta negotiating activities with the wto doha declaration87 additionally there is concern by some that the ratchet of ipr commitments pursued through regional and bilateral ftas may be too stringent for developing countries and may limit innovation and creativity by stifling the exchange of ideas further expansion of ipr provisions may be affected by the language of any future tpa in discussions about renewal of tpa congress may choose to consider possible reiteration or expansion on its ipr goals related to global health from the 2002 tpa at issue for congress is whether or not to follow the template provided by the peru panama and colombia ftas in future trade negotiations without renewal of the tpa the administration ma be prompted to seek stronger ipr through plurilateral venues in october 2007 the united states and several key foreign trading partners australia canada the 27 member states of the european union japan mexico morocco new zealand singapore south korea switzerland announced their intention to begin negotiating an anticounterfeiting trade agreement acta the countries have pledged to go beyond the trips

this committee will assist the ipec in the development of joint strategic plan to combat counterfeiting and infringement in contrast to niplecc gao interviews with agency officials suggest that stop is viewed positively for its role in enhancing ipr enforcem ent as priority among federal agencies the private sector and internationally as presidential initiative stop does not derive from statutory authority according to the gao stop does not fully meet the characteristics associated with being an effective national strategy gao has expressed concern that stop does not discuss risk management or the costs investments and processes needed to balance the threats associated with counterfeit products with the resources that are available 93 in testimony before the senate banking housing and urban affairs committee foreign policy observer moises naim stated that governments must be selective in setting their priorities adding it is unrealistic to expect governments to combat every aspect of counterfeiting this approach will further burden already overstretched governments and greatly reduce their effectiveness 94 one question inferred from the foregoing is whether the united states can or should devote equal resources to prevent the importation of fake gucci bags and counterfeit medicines while protection and enforcement of ipr is stated priority for the united states it is difficult to get sense of the magnitude of funding and resources devoted toward ipr support as there is one line item in the federal budget for ipr protection our analysis suggests that the united states spent at least 19 billion to support ipr in fy2008 the proposed budget for fy2009 by the president suggests that intellectual property enfor cement is top priority the presidents funding requests for fy2008 for iprrelated agencies were greater than for fy2008 95 additionally there is limited information on the economic and other impacts of piracy and counterfeiting on the united states for example in its special 301 report ustr uses industry figures that are not independently confirmed this complicates the ability of lawmakers to weigh the threat of ipr infringement against the federal resources available for ipr and other government priorities g3g158g157g145g152g155g561g5g152g151g157g138g140g157g561g11g151g143g152g155g150g138g157g146g152g151g561 shayerah ilias analyst
