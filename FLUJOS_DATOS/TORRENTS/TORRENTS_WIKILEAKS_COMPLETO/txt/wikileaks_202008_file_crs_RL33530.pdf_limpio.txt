if return to the 1967 border is guaranteed and if it includes generous us economic aid comparable to that which egypt has received since signing peace agreement with israel the analysts also believe

principle of land for peace secretary of state james baker organized peace conference in madrid in october 1991 that launched almost decade of the oslo process to achieve peace it continued under president william clinton who asserted that only the regions leaders can make peace and vowed to be their partner with the hebron protocol of 1997 however the united states seemed to become an indispensable and expected party to israelipalestinian talks clinton mediated the 1998 wye river memorandum and the united states coordinated its implementation he personally led negotiations at camp david in 2000 the george w bush administration initially sought less prominent role and secretary of state colin powell did not appoint special middle east envoy after the september 11 2001 terrorist attacks the administration focused on the peace process mainly as part of the war on terrorism secretary of state condoleezza rice also did not name special envoy asserting not every effort has to be an american effort it is extremely important that the parties themselves are taking responsibility 10 she encouraged israelis and palestinians to act but personally mediated november 2005 accord to reopen the border crossing between gaza and egypt after israels withdrawal from gaza in 2007 she engaged again partly in order to elicit the support of moderate sunni arab governments to thwart the rise of iranian influence those governments see resolution of the palestinian issue as key to regional stability and to denying iran opportunities for destabilizing actions the joint understanding presented at the november 2007 annapolis conference creates new role for the united states as judge of israels and the palestinians fulfillment of their commitments under the 2003 international road map to twostate solution in january 2008 president bush appointed air force lt gen william fraser iii assistant to the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff to monitor the parties compliance with their commitments gen fraser who has been replaced by lt gen paul j selv was not to mediate or enforce compliance instead according to national security advisor stephen hadley fraser will be in dialogue with palestinians and israelis and get the facts on what each of them is doing to implement the road mapwhat they are doing what they are not doingand to bring that to their attention encouraging the parties to move forward on their obligations to complete the road map11 fraser was to visit the region from time to time but the trilateral mechanism has barely functioned

present to usinitiated international meeting in annapolis md on november 27 2007 abbas pressed for framework for substantive agreement on core issues formerly referred to as final status issues as well as for timetable for implementation mechanisms for implementation and monitoring at first olmert emphasized daytoday issues but then agreed to discuss core issues while retaining his desire for vague declaration without timetabl that would enable him to hold his coalition government together on september 10 olmert and abbas agreed to set up negotiating teams for twostate solution and ministerial committees to work on security communications economic cooperation water rights environmental issues and the like and later appointed foreign minister tzipi livni and former prime minister ahmad quray aka abu ala to head the teams secretary rice described annapolis as meeting at which regional actors and the international community would rally around bilateral vision of twostate solution as well as help support the development of palestinian institutions economic development and so forth54 rice excluded hamas from the process saying if youre going to have twostate solution you have to accept the right of the other party to exist youre going to have to renounce violence on september 24 olmert described annapolis as short international meeting intended to give international encouragement to the process that we initiated with the palestinians he said that the goal was to increase support for abbas and deepen israels ties with moderate arab countries

concessions and raising the politically sensitive question of dividing jerusalem which many israelis and other jews refer to as their eternal undivided capital on november 12 olmert told his cabinet that he did not view freeze on all building on the west bank to be part of the road maps requirements but that israel would not build new settlements or expropriate land and would raze illegal outposts 55 this appeared to conform to israels policy on socalled natural growth whereby settlers would be allowed to build within the borders of existing settlements the palestinians demand 100 settlement freeze including ending natural growth and others in the international community agree with this stance at the annapolis conference on november 27 president bush read joint understanding

jerusalem as their capital abbas claimed that ending the occupation will eradicate the greatest excuse for terrorism 57 olmert asserted that israel would base its positions not just on security council resolutions 242 and 338 and the road map but on president bushs april 14 2004 letter to former prime minister sharon58 both sides were able to appear successful at annapolis israel succeeded in making implementation of any peace treaty dependent upon implementation of the road map and in avoiding rigid timetable and deadline israelis also were pleased that president bush called for israel to be homeland for the jewish people which the palestinians have been reluctant to acknowledge because of its possible effect on the refugee issue and for ending settlement expansion but not for freeze 59 palestinians were able to remove road map implementation as precondition for final status negotiations obtained oneyear target date and involved united states as judge of the parties

negotiations between israelis and palestinians for an outline of an agreement for palestinian state the second is the implementation of the road map and the third is building the institutions of

issue he observed that jerusalem is one of the most difficult challenges on the road to peace but did not offer remedy 63 mr hadley emphasized the importance of vision of palestinian state and moving toward it so that at moment of clarity the palestinian people will choose whether they want to be part of an emerging state or under the rule of hamas olmert emphasized that as long as there will be

intelligence authorization act for fy2008 agreed to in the house on december 13 would limit spending of the intelligence budget to 30 until each member of the intelligence committees has been informed with respect to intelligence regarding the facility targeted on september 6 the administration objected that this provision would circumvent the executives authority to control access to extraordinarily sensitive information123 the senate agreed to the conference report on february 13 2008 by vote of 5145 and the bill was cleared for the white house on april 24 national security advisor stephen hadley cia director michael hayden and director of national intelligence mike mcconnell presented evidence to congressional committees that the israeli target was nuclear reactor designed by and being built with the assistance of north korea hayden said that the reactor was within weeks or months of completion and within year of entering operation it could have produced enough material for at least one weapon these officials reportedly acknowledged lack of evidence indicating that syria was working on nuclear weapons designs and that they had not identified source of nuclear material for the facility they expressed low confidence that the site was part of nuclear weapons program 124 they also denied us involvement in planning or executing the september 6 strike experts suggested that the inability to identify source of fuel raised questions about when the reactor would have been operational and agreed that the inability to identify facilities to separate plutonium from fuel raised further questions about whether the reactor was part of weapons program 125 on june 16 international atomic energy agency iaea director general mohammed elbaradei told arabiyah television we have evidence that syria has the human resources that would allow it to carry out large nuclear program we do not see syria having nuclear fuel126 g17g157g145g142g155g561 hres
