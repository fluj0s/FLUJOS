baldwin legislative attorney american law divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30528national monuments and the antiquities act recent designations and issues summary president clinton used the antiquities act of 1906 16 usc 431433 to create 19 new national monuments and enlarge 3 others all but one of the designations were made during president clintons last year in office the new monuments range in size from 2 acres to nearly 19 million acres the 22 monuments created or enlarged by president clinton total about 59 million acres the second largest acreage of any president and only president franklin d roosevelt used his authority more often on 28 occasions vs 22 for president clinton the antiquities act authorizes the president to create national monuments on federal lands that contain historic landmarks historic and prehistoric structures or other objects of historic or scientific interest the president is to reserve the smallest area compatible with the proper care and management of the objects to be protected the act was designed to quickly protect federal lands and resources and presidents have proclaimed about 120 monuments totaling about more than 70 million acres congress has modified many of these has created monuments itself and about dozen times has abolished presidentially created monuments presidential establishment of monuments sometimes has been contentious eg president franklin delano roosevelts creation of the jackson hole national monument in wyoming 1943 and especially presiden t carters massive alaskan withdrawals 1978 monuments created by president clinton also have generated criticisms centering on the size and the types of resources protected the level and types of threats to areas the inclusion of nonfederal lands within monument boundaries effects on land uses the agency that manages the monuments the constitutionality of the act and consistencies of the act with the withdrawal public participation and environmental review aspects of other laws opponents have sought to revoke or limit the presidents authority to proclaim monuments or to impose environmental studies and consultation procedures among other changes supporters favor the act in its present form as applied by presidents for nearly century and note that many past designations that initially were controversial have come to be supported they contend that the president needs continued authority to promptly protect valuable resources on federal lands that may be threatened president clinton selected the bureau of land management blm to manage many of the monuments but other agencies were assigned to manage monuments as well monuments typically are established or enlarged subject to valid existing rights which would allow existing rights to continue eg development of valid existing mineral rights in general land uses may continue if they are not barred by the proclamations and do not conflict with monument purposes usually the proclamations and supporting documents do address land uses many of the new monuments bar new mining claims and mineral and energy leases as well as motorized vehicle use offroad although grazing often is allowed in some cases water rights have been reserved for the federal government while in others water rights are expressly not reserved monument management plans to be developed with public participation also

introduction1 presidential establishment of national monuments under the antiquities act of 1906 16 usc 431 et seq has protected valuable sites but also sometimes has been controversial displeasur with president franklin roosevelts proclaiming of the jackson hole national monument in wyoming 1943 prompted litigation on the extent of presidential authority under the antiquities act as well as 1950 law to prohibit future establishment of national monuments in wyoming except as authorized by congress president carters alaska withdrawals 1978 also were challenged in the courts and led to statutory requirement of congressional approval for withdrawals in alaska larger than 5000 acres2 president clintons proclamation of the grand staircaseescalante national monument 1996 triggered several lawsuits law authorizing land exchanges and proposals to amend or revoke presidential authority under the antiquities act3 yet initial opposition to some monument designations turned to support over time some controversial monuments later were enlarged and redesignated as national parks by congress and today are popular parks with substantial economic benefit to the surrounding communities for instance the jackson hole national monument was expanded and redesignated as the grand teton national park httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30528crs2 4this report focuses on monuments created by president clinton under the antiquities act national monuments amended or created by law during president clintons tenure in office such as the santa rosa and san jacinto mountains national

pace of legislated land protection as justification for the president to create these national monuments president clintons secretary of the interior bruce babbitt stated that president clinton used his authority under the antiquities act to designate additional monuments where areas of interest to the clinton administration were not being protected through the legislative process several of the new monuments were described as national landscape monuments by secretary babbitt6 national landscape monuments evidently would protect integrated landscapes and ecosystems that are distinct and significant in contrast with earlier monuments which secretary babbitt called curiosities that stand out from the landscape because of their beauty or geographic or historical value some plaintiffs have challenged whether the president has authority to accomplish these management goals through the creation of national landscape monuments givenhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30528crs3 7see us dept of

created by presidents from 1906 through 1999 are listed chronologically in continuedthe language in the antiquities act regarding protecting objects and limiting the size of monuments secretary babbitt sought to create national landscape monuments on blm lands and to have blm continue to administer the lands the secretary sought to develop the blms role in land protection broadening the agencys traditional focus on mining and grazing and other extractive land uses to this end on june 19 2000 the blm announced the creation of national landscape conservation system comprised of the agencys national monuments conservation areas wilderness areas wilderness study areas wild and scenic rivers scenic trails historic trails and other areas7 approximately 39000000 acres are in this system approximately 15 of all land blm administers according to blm statements incorporating these units into system will give them greater recognition management attention and resources secretary babbitt contrasted national landscape monuments with national park system units administered by the park service landscape monuments were intended to serve outdoor recreationists but would not accommodate large numbers of visitors they were to lack visitor centers guides overnight accommodations and fees so that they would present an adventure for visitors land uses would not be as restricted as in units of the park system although secretary babbitt stated that destructive and incompatible uses would be barred the antiquities act of 1906 the antiquities act of 1906 authorizes the president to proclaim national monuments on federal lands that contain historic landmarks historic and prehistoric structures and other objects of historic or scientific interest the president is to reserve the smallest area compatible with the proper care and management of the objects to be protected 16 usc431 congress subsequently limited the presidents authority by requiring congressional authorization for extensions or establishment of monuments in wyoming 16 usc 431a and by making all withdrawals in alaska exceeding 5000 acres subject to congressional approval 16 usc 3213 the antiquities act was response to concerns over theft from and destruction of archaeological sites and was designed to provide an expeditious means to protect federal lands and resources president theodore roosevelt used the authority in 1906 to establish devils tower in wyoming as the first national monument fourteen of the 18 presidents since 1906 have created about 120 monuments in total including grand canyon grand teton zion olympic statue of liberty and chesapeake and ohio canal8 many areas initially designated as national monuments were later madehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30528crs4

designations such as national parks or national preserves in 1322 of the alaska national interest lands conservation act anilca pl 96487 10most of this acreage is longer in monument status because it has been included by congress in other protective designations primarily through enactment of anilca into national parks president clinton used his authority under the antiquities act 22 times to proclaim 19 new monuments and to enlarge 3 others with total federal acreage of approximately 59 million acres only president franklin delano roosevelt used his authority more often on 28 occasions and only president jimmy carter proclaimed more monument acreage 56 million acres of land in 17 units in alaska9 congress too may create national monuments on federal lands and has done so on many occasions supporters of congressional rather than presidential action note that congress is unlimited in its authority to customcraft legislation to suit particular area for instance congress could allow more land uses than is typical for national monuments created by the president for example by allowing new commercial development or it can afford additional protection some observers advocate legislation as opposed to presidential action as more likely to involve the input of local and other citizens congress also has modified monuments including those created by the president for instance by changing their boundaries congress has abolished some monuments outright and converted others into different protective designations such as national parks about half of the current national parks were first designated as national monuments further congress has enacted legislation to establish variety of other protected areas some recent measures reportedly were pursued as alternatives to monument designations monuments vary widely in size while more than half of the presidentially proclaimed monuments initially involved less than 5000 acres they have ranged from less than 1 to nearly 11 million acres the largest monument the wrangellst elias national monument now national park and national preserve was created as part of president carters 1978 alaska withdrawals about 10 of all federal land more than 70 million acres has at one time been protected under the antiquities act10 monument issues and controversies president clintons monument proclamations generated concerns among some members of congress state and local officials user groups and others regardinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30528crs5 11this law applies primarily to the lands managed by the bureau of land management blm and actions taken by the secretary of the interior although some provisions also apply to the lands managed by the forest service and the secretary of agriculture 1243 usc 1714 president ial authority to create monuments recent criticisms and controversies in congress have challenged the size of the areas and types of resources protected and the authority and procedures for monument designation criticism has been expressed by those who oppose restrictions on land uses both extractive eg mining and recreatio nal eg offroad vehicle use as result of monument proclamations critics also perceive lack of consistency between the antiquities act and the policies established in other laws especially the land withdrawal provisions of the federal land policy and management act of 1976 flpma 43 usc 1701 et seq11 the environmental reviews required by the national environmental policy act nepa 42 usc 4321 et seq and the public participation requirements of nepa flpma and other laws among the measures considered during recent congresses were bills to impose restrictions on presidential authority such as to limit the size or duration of withdrawals prohibit or restrict withdrawals in particular states encourage public participation in the monument designation process revoke the presidents authority to designate monuments or require congressional approval of some or all monument designations and promote presidential creation of monuments in accordance with certain federal land management and environmental laws measures also were introduced to change land uses within monuments and to alter monument boundaries supporters of the antiquities act assert that changes to the act are neither warranted nor desirable they contend that previous congresses that focused on this issue were correct in not repealing the antiquities act and that the courts have been generally supportive of presidential actions under the act they further claim that presidents of both parties have used the authority for nearly century to expeditiously protect valuable federal lands and resources and they defend the presidents ability to take prompt action to protect areas that may be vulnerable to looting vandalism commercial development and other real or perceived dangers because it can provide instant protection to areas the antiquities act is supported as avoiding possibly speculative establishment of rights that could be costly for the government to buy out following slower designation processes while the secretary of the interior can make temporary emergency withdrawals of blm lands12 there is comparable authority with respect to national forest lands or other federal lands defenders also note that some past designations that initially were contentious have come to be widely supported over time they contend that large segments of the public support land protection such as through monument designations for the recreational and economic benefits that such designations often bring monument size in establishing national monument the president is required by the antiquities act to reserve the smallest area compatible with the proper care and management of the objects to be protected 16 usc 431 many monuments have been quitehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30528crs6 13for more information on cases on monument size and other legal issues see crs congressional distribution memorandum legal issues raised by the designation of the grand staircase escalante national monument by pamela baldwin december 13 1996 the memorandum addresses the types of objects protected designation procedures blm as monument manager and whether nonnp s management may constitute reorganization requiring congressional approval small but several presidents have established large monuments examples of large monuments include katmai established in 1918 with 1088000 acres glacier bay created in 1925 with 1379316 acres most of the alaska monuments proclaimed in 1978 the largest being wrangellst elias with 10950000 acres and grand staircaseescalante established in 1996 with approximately 1900000 acres the proclamations for all 22 of the monuments created or enlarged by president clinton repeat the language of the antiquities act that the acreage reserved is the smallest area compatible with the proper care and management of the objects to be protected these proclamations range in size from 2 acres to 1870800 acres supporting documents for some of the larger recent monuments assert that the lands surrounding the identified objects are included to maintain the relationships among the objects and the remoteness that allows them to exist also mentioned are that biological objects need the preservation of an entire ecosystem and that management of series of discrete sites is more difficult than managing larger contiguous area critics assert that large monuments violate the antiquities act in that the presidents authority regarding size was intended to be narrow and limited they charge that congress intended the act to protect specific items of interest especially archaeological sites and the small areas surrounding them they support this view with the legislative history of the act in which proposals to limit withdrawal to 320 or 640 acres were mentioned but not enacted they contend that some of the monument designations were greater than needed to protect particular objects of value defenders argue that the antiquities act gives the president discretion to determine the acreage necessary to ensure protection of the resources in question which can be particular archaeo logical site or larger features or resources the grand canyon for example originally was national monument measuring 08 million acres president theodore roosevelt determined that this large size was necessary to protect the object in question the canyon defenders also note that after considering the issue in the early 1900s congress deliberately rejected proposals to restrict the presidents authority to set the size of the withdrawal further they assert that preserving objects of interest may require withdrawal of sizeable tracts of surrounding land to preserve the integrity of the objects and the interactions and relationships among them the courts generally have deferred to the presidents judgment as to proper size however the case law on this subject is not extensive and it is uncertain what conclusion court might reach in any particular case in the future13 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30528crs7 14cameron v united states 252 us 450 455456 1920 15wyoming v franke 58 f supp 895 d wy 1945 in this case the court indicated that if there were an instance where there was evidence of substantial character that an area contained objects of historic or scientific interest the creation of monument by president could be found to be arbitrary and capricious and clearly outside the scope and purpose of the monument act however the court noted that evidence from experts and others introduced at trial was sufficient to support finding that there were objects of historic and scientific interest in the jackson hole national monument objects protected under the antiquities act the president can establish monuments on federal land containing historic landmarks historic and prehistoric structures and other objects of historic or scientific interest some proclamations have identified particular objects needing protection while others have referred more generally to scenic scientific or educational features of interest some critics assert that because the original purpose of the act was to protect specific objects particularly objects of antiquity such as cliff dwellings pueblos and other archeologi cal ruins hence the name antiquities act presidents have used the act for impermissibly broad purposes such as general conservation recreation scenic protection or protection of living organisms these purposes they argue are more appropriate for national park or other designation established by congress supporters of current presidential authority counter that the act does not limit the president to protecting ancient relics and maintain that other objects of historic or scientific interest is broad wording that grants considerable discretion to the president review of legal challenges on this issue shows general deference to presidential determinations of objects appropriate for protection the supreme court upheld the creation of the grand canyon national monument in apparent agreement with the presidents assertion that the grand canyon is an object of unusual scientific interest14 however in another case lower court did note in dicta that is not as part of the holding and hence not precedent that there might be circumstances in which president might be held to have exceeded his authority15 thus the outcome of any future legal challenge in this area is not certain level and type of threat presidents sometimes have cited threats to resources eg natural and cultural to support establishing monuments although imminent threat is not expressly required by the antiquities act in his remarks designating the grand staircaseescalante national monument for instance president clinton expressed concern about work underway for large coal mining operation that he asserted could damage resources in the area sometimes the noted threats appear less immediate as for the lands included in the grand canyonparashant monument proclaimed january 11 2000 which could be increasingly threatened by potential mineral development according to the administration in other cases threats were reported by the press one press report for instance stated that the national trust for historic preservation hadhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30528crs8 16see infra note 8 at 53 and 55 17see us dept of the interior bureau of land management interim management policy for newly created national monuments jan 11 2000 on blms website at httpwwwazblmgovinterimgthtm the interim management policy was issued to provide guidance on managing blm monuments pending completion of the planning process to develop particular management guidance for each monument identified the now president lincoln and soldiers home national monument as one of the countrys most endangered historic properties presidential creation of monuments in the absence of immediate threats to resources troubles those who believe that the law is intended to protect objects that are endangered or threatened they charge that presidents have established monuments to support environmental causes limit development and score political gains among other reasons those who contest these charges note that the antiquities act lacks requirement that objects be immediately threatened or endangered others cite the pervasive dangers of development and growth recreation looting and vandalism as sufficient grounds for contemporary presidential action inclusion of nonfederal lands in some cases nonfederal lands are contained within the outer boundaries of monument regardless of whether they are technically or even expressly excluded from it the inclusion of state or private lands among federal lands within monuments borders has been source of controversy the clinton administration has indicated that the monument designation does not apply to nonfederal lands because the antiquities act authorizes the president to proclaim monuments only on federal lands as solicitor of the department of the interior john d leshy asserted this view in 1999 testimony before congress stating that the antiquities act applies only to federal lands and that monument designations cannot bring state or private lands into federal ownership16 nearly all of president clintons monument proclamations have stated that nonfederal lands will become part of the monument if the federal government acquires title to the lands from the current owners whether lands could be condemned for monument purposes is not clear others however note that while private or stateowned lands are technically not part of the monument development of such land located within monuments is difficult because such development might be incompatible with the purposes for which the monument was created or constrained by management of the surrounding federal lands blm interim monument management policy provides that activities on non monument lands that damage the monument be reported to the responsible management official for appropriate action17 there is elaboration on what might constitute appropriate action monument supporters also note that if state or private land owners within monument fear or experience difficulties they can pursue land exchanges with the federal government president clintons monument proclamations typically have authorized land exchanges to further the protective purposes of the monument forhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30528crs9 the blmmanaged monuments the agency is to consider not only land exchanges but land or easement acquisitions to enhance the purposes of the monuments according to the interim management policy effects on land use monument designation applies to federal lands but in some cases designation may have implications for uses on nonfederal lands designation can limit or prohibit existing or potential development or recreational uses common concern is that monument designation potentially could result in new constraints on development of existing mineral and energy leases claims and permits as well as barring new leases claims and permits there are fears that mineral activities may have to adhere to higher standard of environmental review and probably will have higher cost of mitigation to ensure compatibility with monument designation the recent proclamations have protections for valid existing rights for land uses but the extent to which designations may affect those rights is not yet clear see the discussion of mineral rights below another concern is actual or potential restriction on commercial timber cutting as result of designation for instance future timber production is expressly precluded in the giant sequoia national monument although certain current logging contracts can be implemented some argue that restrictions are needed to protect the environmental scenic and recreational attributes of forests logging supporters assert that forests can be used sustainably and that concerns raised by environmentalists as grounds for limiting commercial timber operations do not reflect modern forestry practices other concerns have included the possible effects of monument designation on grazing hunting and offroad vehicle use some of president clintons proclamations have restricted such activities to protect monument resources and the monument management plans being developed for the new monuments may result in additional restrictions for instance some private citizens who use public lands for grazing cattle or extracting minerals have claimed that their activities have been restricted and that they have suffered economically as result states and counties frequently have viewed restrictions on federal lands in their jurisdictions as threats to economic development they argue that local communities are hurt by the loss of jobs and tax revenues that result from prohibitingrestricting future mineral exploration timber development or other activities some argue that limitations on energy exploration could leave the united states more dependent on foreign oil advocates of creating monuments claim there are positive economic impacts resulting from designation including increased tourism recreation and the relocation of businesses and people which may exceed the benefits of traditional economic development others allege that the public interest value of environmental protection outweighs any economic benefit that could have resulted from development some maintain that development is insufficiently limited by monument designation through the preservation of valid existing rights for particular uses such as grazing andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30528crs10 18462 us 919 1983 19the status quo of blmmanaged lands could be maintained because 204e of flpma 43 usc 1714e authorizes the secretary to temporarily withdraw blm lands for period of up to two years comparable authority does not exist with respect to lands managed by continuedmining and that the restrictions on future use should be tighter areas need to be left intact for future generations they argue consistency of antiquities act with nepa and flpma the federal land policy and management act of 1976 flpma authorizes the secretary of the interior to make certain land withdrawals under specified procedures it requires congressional review of withdrawals that exceed 5000 acres but in manner that is likely to be considered an unconstitutional legislative veto under the ruling in immigration and naturalization service v chadha 18 flpma also contains notice and hearing procedures for withdrawals by the secretary of less than 5000 acres in enacting flpma congress not only imposed limits on the ability of the interior secretary to make withdrawals but repealed much of the express and implied withdrawal authority previously granted to the president by several earlier laws critics of the antiquities act argue that it is inconsistent with the intent of flpma to restore control of public land withdrawal policy to congress they assert that congress is the appropriate body to make and implement land withdrawal policy and that congress intended to review and retain veto control over all executive withdrawals exceeding 5000 acres legislation to abolish the presidents authority to create national monuments or to require congressional approval of presidential recommendations for national monuments was considered in recent congresses challengers to this view note that congress in enacting flpma did not repeal or amend the antiquities act despite extensive consideration of all executive withdrawal authorities they argue it was the clear intent of congress to retain presidential withdrawal authority under the antiquities act similarly critics note that recent monuments were proclaimed by president clinton without the environmental studies required of agencies for major federal actions under the national environmental policy act nepa or the opportunities for public participation that nepa flpma and other land management laws provide here too it can be noted that the statutes in question do not pertain to the actions of president under the antiquities act as opposed to an action of an agency and that the antiquities act is silent as to the procedures president must follow to proclaim new monument some urge that procedures for environmental review and public participation should be added to the monument designation process so that significant withdrawals with resulting effects on existing uses would not be made without scientific economic and public input legislative proposals of this sort were considered in the past few congresses others counter that such changes would impair the ability of the president to take action quickly to protect objects and lands thereby avoiding possible damage to the resources and the possible speculative establishment of rights19 they assert thathttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30528crs11 19continued other agencies 20proposals to address the issues raised in this section primarily those considered during the 106th congress are covered below under legislative activity 21for discussion of the legal issues associated with the creation of the monument and the sale of the land see crs congressional distribution memorandum designation of part of governors island as national monument by pamela baldwin and morton rosenberg may 22 2001 participation requirements are not needed in law because presidents typically consult with government officials and the public before establishing monuments further they charge that nepa applies to proposed actions that might harm the environment not to protective actions such as monument designation some believe that nepa requirements are unnecessary for monument designation because once monuments are created detailed management plans are developed in accordance with nepa20 monument management although most monuments now are managed by the national park service nps congress has created some monuments that are managed by other agencies in 1996 president clinton created the grand staircaseescalante national monument and assigned its management to blm the first such area administered by blm president clinton subsequently selected blm as exclusive manager of more new monuments in other cases monument management is being conducted jointly by blm and another agency for instance president clinton chose blm and nps to jointly manage two monuments the president also chose other agencies to manage monuments solely or jointly including the forest service fish and wildlife service department of energy and department of defense in creating new monuments president clinton often retained as monument manager the agency that was administering the lands before the monument designation in two of the proclamations that expanded monuments president clinton made management changes the pinnacles expansion lands were transferred from the blm to the nps because the existing pinnacles monument was being managed by the nps for the craters of the moon national monument expansion president clinton chose the nps as primary manager of some of the lands that had been under blm jurisdiction for the two marine monuments buck island reef and virgin islands coral reef the president assigned management to the nps further although the bureau of reclamation owns the land within minidoka internment president clinton required the secretary of the interior to transfer administration of the monument to the nps finally president clinton selected the nps to manage governors island in consultation with the administrator of the general services administration gsa although existing law pl 10533 9101 requires the gsa to sell the land21 the clinton administration had expressed interest in having blm manage monuments created on its lands and in increasing the emphasis of the agency on land protection the blm also may have been chosen to manage several of the newhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30528crs12 22as general matter grazing may be allowed in nps units under 16 usc 3 unless it is prohibited by the statute creating the unit or the secretary

counsel 396 february 8 1980 monuments because the lands were intended to be both protected and managed for multiple uses multiple uses include recreation range timber minerals watershed fish and wildlife and protecting scenic scientific and historical values mineral development timber and hunting are the principal uses that would be compatible with blm management but generally not with nps

new mineral and energy rights and hence are similar to nps units in that respect the canyons of the ancients monument allows new oil and gas leasing and development under certain circumstances grazing is another land use typically allowed on blm lands but often precluded on nps lands even though it is allowed under statute22 it could be argued that having blm manage monuments rather than nps generally allows for more flexible management that is under the blm interim management policy uses generally would be permitted unless shown to be detrimental to the monuments in nps units uses are more likely to be prohibited unless shown to be beneficial some critics have expressed concern that the blm lacks sufficient expertise or dedication to land conserva tion to be charged with monument management the presidents authority to choose management agency other than nps has been questioned before 1933 monuments were managed by different agencies including the war department and the department of agriculture in 1933 president franklin d roosevelt by executiv order 6166 consolidated management of national monuments in the nps most and possibly all existing monuments were transferred to the nps and monuments presidentially created between 1933 and 1978 were managed outside the nps two of the alaska monuments created by president carter in 1978 were managed by the forest service which is in the department of agriculture and two were managed by the fish and wildlife service fws management by fws does not appear to have been contentious however assigning management of the two alaska monuments to the forest service was controversial and the nps and the department of agriculture agreed to enter into memorandum of understanding on managing the monuments the two monuments subsequently were given statutory approval in anilca for forest service management 1980 opinion from the office of legal counsel department of justice appears to indicate that the president may have some flexibility in choosing the managers of post1933 monuments23 others assert too that the authority of the president under the antiquities act carries with it discretion to choose the managing agency they contend that there is exclusive authority for the nps to manage monuments however critics argue that management by an agency other than npshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30528crs13 is transfer of part of the current functions of the nps and that the transfer of an agency function especially to another department constitutes reorganiz ation of government and that the president currently lacks such reorganization authority some counter that establishing new monument under another agency would not constitute reorganization because management of current nps units and the general authority of the nps to manage monuments would be unaffected even if placing management authority under department other than the department of the interior might constitute reorganization the president nevertheless might be able to move function of the nps to the blm under congressionally approved authority allowing transfers of functions within the department of the interior reorganization plan 3 of 1950 some of the clinton designations raise the issue of whether the president has authority to choose management agency other than the nps other legal issues the property clause of the constitution article iv sec 3 cl 2 gives congress the authority to dispose of and make needful rules and regulations regarding property belonging to the united states some have asserted that the antiquities act is an unconstitutionally broad delegation of congress power because the presidents authority to create monuments is essentially limitless since all federal land has some historic or scientific value others believe the act would be upheld if challenged on this basis because it has been in effect for so long and because courts have upheld other broad delegations of property authority for example the mining law of 1872 which allows state and local laws and customs to supplement federal law several cases were filed challenging the 1996 designation of the grand staircase escalante national monument on various grounds the utah association of counties uac filed suit asking the court to set aside the proclamation on the grounds that 1 president clinton violated the antiquities act and the separation of powers doctrine by withdrawing public lands from the application of the mining laws and mineral leasing laws when congress reserved this power to the secretary of the interior 2 president clinton exceeded his constitutionally delegated authority under the act to achieve wilderness preserva tion of lands when congress reserved that authority to itself 3 president clinton exceeded his authority under the act to reserve only the smallest area compatible with protection of specific objects 4 the chair of the council on environmental quality failed to implement and enforce nepa and worked with defendants secretary babbitt and the department of the interior to avoid complying with nepa and 5 secretary babbitt and the interior department violated federal law by recommending the creation of the monument without complying with procedures imposed by federal law second suit was filed by the utah schools and institutional trust lands administrati on sitla it alleged that president clinton exceeded his authority under the act and the constitution when he created the monument that the interior department violated flpma and nepa during the course of designation and that the withdrawal violated the utah enabling act of 1894 and the equal footing doctrine under which new states are admitted to the union on par with existing states httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30528crs14 24tulare county et v clinton 100cv02560 ddcthe mountain states legal foundation also filed suit alleging that the creation of the monument violated the antiquities act because 1 president clinton did not confine the withdrawal to the smallest area compatible with the purpose 2 president clinton did not confine it to objects of scientific and historic interest and 3 his actions were arbitrary and capricious in that he exceeded his authority under the constitution this suit also alleges that all defendants violated flpma the federal advisory committee act the antideficiency act and the constitution the cases were consolidated but the sitla case was settled and has been dismissed the others are being heard in the us district court for utah but have not moved very far toward decision the united states asked the court to rule first on the question of whether congress could be said to have ratified the creation of the monument through several enactments since its creation eg those related to boundary adjustments and land exchanges in the procedural context in which the issue was before the court the court found congresss actions insufficient to constitute ratification and declined to dismiss the case on that ground the united states attempted to appeal on this issue before completion of the trial in the district court but the 10th circuit denied this interlocutory appeal there is indication of when the lower court might rule on the other issues an environmental group that was denied intervenor status has appealed that ruling suit also was filed in the us district court for arizona challenging the grand canyonparashant national monument it raised questions related to whether the monument might threaten to limit land use prevent legislators from representing their constituents reduce the accountability of governmental officials and violate the equal protection aspects of the 14th amendment plaintiffs sought to have the antiquities act declared unconstitutional and to require the president to follow constitutional disposal processes the suit was dismissed on november 20 2000 for lack of standing and for failure to state claim on which relief could be granted another suit was filed challenging the designations of canyons of the ancients cascadesiskiyou hanford reach and ironwood forest it claimed without elaboration that by creating these monuments and specifying certain management restrictions president clinton impermissibly took actions with respect to federal lands by exercising powers that are reserved to congress under the constitution challenge24 to the designation of giant sequoia national monument asserts among other counts that the creation of the giant sequoia monument to protect ecosystems and landscapes was so lacking in specificity as to the objects protected that it either does not comport with the standards in the antiquities act or the act itself represents an unconstitutional delegation of the authority of congress to manage the property of the united states article iv of the us constitution furthermore the suit asserts the land management restrictions in the giant sequoia proclamation and related administrative documents violate the planning requirements of the national forest management act nfma and nepa as well as 9 of the nfma which requires an act of congress to return national forest lands to the public domain which plaintiffs maintain is what the new management restrictionshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30528crs15 2516

plans be completed within specified time eg 3 years the overriding management goal for all monuments is protection of the objects described in the proclamations the amount of detail on land uses varies among the monuments for instance the proclamations for the buck island reef california coastal governors island minidoka internment pompeys pillar president lincoln and soldiers home and virgin islands coral reef monuments generally do not address as many issues as the proclamations for other monuments some issues may not arise for these monuments given their distinctive characteristics for instance their small size or waterbased nature most of the other monuments protect large parcels of onshore land with diverse features except for the proclamation for the president lincoln and soldiers home national monument the proclamations establish or enlarge the monuments subject to valid existing rights existing uses of the land that are not precluded by the proclamations and do not conflict with the purposes of the monuments generally may continue supporting documents for the blm monuments state that the exercise of such rights could be regulated where necessary to protect

generally the proclamations state that such withdrawals are subject to valid existing rights except that the proclamation for the president lincoln and soldiers home does not address valid existing rights subject to valid existing rights most of the proclamations bar new mineral leases mining claims prospecting or exploration activities and oil gas and geothermal leases by withdrawing the lands within the monuments from entry location selection sale leasing or other disposition under the public land laws mining laws and mineral and geothermal leasing laws however the proclamation for canyons of the ancients allows new oil and gas leasing including carbon dioxide under specified circumstances in addition to continuing existing oil and gas leases the secretary may issue new leases only to promote conservation of oil and gas resources in any common reservoir being produced under existing leases or to protect oil and gas resources against drainage28 in both canyons of the ancients and upper missouri river breaks the secretary of the interior is to manage oil and gas development subject to valid existing rights so as not to create any new impacts that interfere with the care and management of the monument these oil and gas leasing provisions were included because at the time canyons of the ancients national monument was created about 85 of the monuments lands had been leased for oil and gas development and development was underway production primarily occurs on the mcelmo dome field which contains carbon dioxide reserves and the overlying island butte ii cutthroat and canyon units which produce natural gas condensate and oil supporting agency materials state that as production is completed the area will be reclaimed and there will be new development thereafter production from current leases is estimated to last for 30 to 40 years29 for upper missouri river breaks more than 60000 acres 16 are covered by existing federal oil and gas leases these leases include part of the leroy natural gas field that has been developed over the past few decades agency materials provide information on energy development within other national monuments for many of the monuments there are existing federal oil gas or mineral leases but in some cases there is current development approximately 135000 acres of grand staircaseescalante currently are leased for oil and gas and about 65000 barrels of oil are produced annually from five active wells there also are 6 federal oil and gas leases covering approximately 6000 acres 3 of the carrizo plain that are now producing commercial quantities of oil and gas in 1999 more than 48000 barrels of oil were produced httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30528crs17 3016 usc 460n3 the nps and the blm share management authority

in particular study by the us geological survey assesses the probability of the existence of oil gas coal and coalbed methane within the new monuments and the potential volume of oil and gas the report states that five monuments were appraised as having moderate to high probability of the existence of oil and gas resources california coastal canyons of the ancients carrizo plain hanford reach and upper missouri river breaks the other monuments were estimated to have potential or low to very low probability of the existence of oil and gas the report also determined that only grand staircaseescalante has high probability of coal and coalbed gas the other monuments were determined to have low or very low probability of coal and coalbed gas the study does not address ongoing development within national monuments or the availability of monument lands to resource extraction in some cases the federal government does not own the mineral estate of lands within the monuments for example the federal government owns only the surface estate of approximately 100000 acres within carrizo plain and the mineral estate of lands within pompeys pillar is held in trust by the united states for the crow tribe withdrawals preserved the 22 proclamations state that existing withdrawals reservations and appropriations continue but the monument becomes the dominant reservation this generally requires that uses of monument lands be managed to protect monument values and if there is conflict with uses otherwise authorized protection of the monument governs prior to the creation of monument for instance lands in the area may have been removed or withdrawn from the operation of some or all of the public land laws or from being subject to some particular use either by statute or secretarial order such withdrawals generally remain in effect until they expire or are specifically modified or revoked grazing grazing expressly may continue in several of the monuments created or enlarged by president clinton according to the proclamations for agua fria canyons of the ancients carrizo plain craters of the moon giant sequoia grand canyon parashant grand staircase escalante ironwood forest upper missouri river breaks and vermilion cliffs grazing would continue to be governed by laws and regulations other than the proclamations grazing has been controversial in some of these monuments eg grand staircaseescalante and carrizo plain with some asserting that grazing has been unnecessarily curtailed while others claim that grazing has not been sufficiently limited to prevent ecological damage blm is to continue to issue and administer grazing leases within the lake mead national recreation area of the grand canyonparashant monument in accordance with the law establishing that area30 grazing may continue to be permitted in the expanded pinnacles areahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30528crs18 30continued land within the lake mead national recreation area under the proclamation although it is not allowed elsewhere in this npsmanaged monument in practice grazing is typically precluded on nps lands the proclamation for cascadesiskiyou states that existing grazing permits or leases may continue with approp riate terms and conditions in addition the secretary of the interior is to study the impacts of grazing on objects of biological interest within the monument the secretary is instructed to retire allotments if grazing is determined to be incompatible with protecting monument objects of biological interest if permits or leases are relinquished by existing holders before the study is completed the secretary may reallocate forage for grazing only if reallocation furthers the protection of the monument the proclamations for kashakatuwe tent rocks and sonoran desert contain particular direction on grazing the secretary is to retire the grazing allotments on lands within kashakatuwe tent rocks unless the secretary determines that grazing advances the protective purpose of the monument agency documents state that only 12 cows graze on monument lands during part of the year and that if there is available forage the animal unit months should be reallocated in the sonoran desert national monument grazing south of interstate highway 8 may continue only until the current permits expire grazing permits in that area will not be renewed grazing south of the interstate is prohibited to foster the longterm ecological health and stability of the area according to agency documents in developing the management plan for the area blm will consider whether to also ban grazing north of interstate highway 8 grazing north of that highway may continue only if blm finds it compatible with the protection of the historic scientific and other objects of interest within the monument for hanford reach the proclamation requires the secretary of the interior to prohibit grazing to protect monument objects the proclamations for buck island reef california coastal governors island minidoka internment pompeys pillar president lincoln and soldiers home and virgin islands coral reef do not directly address grazing apparently because grazing is not an issue for these monuments for blm monuments the agencys interim monument management policy generally allows livestock grazing in accordance with existing permits and leases under existing laws policies and procedures blm generally is allowed to make adjustments to grazing permits and leases and this authority is reflected in the interim policy for instance adjustments could be made to ensure that proper stocking levels are not exceeded which the interim policy characterizes as of paramount importance timber the 22 proclamations imply that timber cutting is precluded through general prohibition against removing any feature of the monuments harvesting appears tohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30528crs19 have been significant issue for only few of the monuments in particular two of the proclamations contain specific provisions on timber commercial timber harvesting is specifically prohibited in cascadesiskiyou except when part of an authorized ecological restoration project the area currently is under timber harvesting moratorium and the proclamation makes this moratorium permanent according to white house press release dated june 9 2000 new timber production is precluded in giant sequoia but timber sales under existing contracts and those with decision notice signed between january 1 1999 and december 31 1999 may be completed under the terms of the decision notice or contract this provision provides transition period of approximately two and half years during which timber sales are phased out for both cascadesiskiyou and giant sequoia some trees may be removed as needed for ecological restoration maintenance or public safety and also for personal fuelwood in the case of giant sequoia ecological restoration activities may be needed to counteract the effects of previous fire suppression and logging according to the giant sequoia proclamation the final management plan for grand staircaseescalante prohibits commercial timber harvesting within the monument other provisions of the plan address collecting forestry products for instance the plan allows fuelwood harvesting post cutting and christmas tree cutting by permit within designated areas water rights federal reserved water rights often have been controversial but have been asserted and upheld with respect to management of national monuments and parks subject to other valid existing water rights water rights necessary to protect monument objectives are expressly reserved for the federal government in several of the monuments agua fria carrizo plain cascadesiskiyou giant sequoia hanford reach and pinnacles these proclamations do not relinquish or reduce any federal water use or rights that existed prior to the establishment of the monuments the proclamations for canyons of the ancients craters of the moon grand canyonparashant ironwood forest kashakatuwe tent rocks minidoka internment pompeys pillar sonoran desert and vermilion cliffs expressly do not reserve federal water rights but also do not relinquish any existing federal water rights federal land management agencies or in some cases the secretary of the interior are to work with state authorities to ensure that sufficient water is available for the monuments the proclamation for grand staircaseescalante also states that water rights are not reserved it directs the secretary of the interior in preparing the monument management plan to evaluate the necessity of water for the care and management of the objects and resources protected by the monument and the extent to which further action is needed under federal or state law to assure availability of water the final monument management plan does contain provisions on water including several that seek to assure water availability and quality one such provision states that blm may seek appropriative water rights under utah state law for the limited visitor facilities within the monument that need water httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30528crs20 water is not reserved generally for the upper missouri river breaks because federal water rights already exist within the monument in 1976 congress included the area in the national wild and scenic rivers system and that water right has been quantified through compact between the united states and the state of montana however the proclamation does reserve water in two tributaries containing biological objects that are dependent on water that reservation in the judith river and arrow creek does not relinquish or reduce any federal water use or right that existed before the creation of the monument water rights are not addressed in the proclamations for several monumentsbuck island reef california coastal governors island president lincoln and soldiers home and virgin islands coral reef water rights does not appear to be an issue for these monuments given their small size or location fish and wildlife for most of the monuments the existing authority of the state in which the monument is located for fish and wildlife management on federal lands would continue this means that the state can regulate fish and wildlife on federal lands notably fishing and hunting except as overridden or modified by the secretary hunting is banned in the expanded pinnacles monument area as is typically the case on nps lands under general nps authorities hunting had been allowed when the land was managed by blm hunting also is banned on lands added to the craters of the moon national monument which will be managed by the nps that ban has been controversial and the subject of legislation because hunting had been allowed on these lands under blm management before the monument was designated fish and wildlife management are not addressed explicitly by the buck island reef california coastal governors island minidoka internment and president lincoln and soldiers home monuments hunting is not an issue for some of these monuments given their nature and hunting is typically banned on nps lands while not explicitly stated existing fish and wildlife authority is generally not affected by the proclamation for the california coastal monument according to the clinton administration the proclamation does not affect federal or state authority over fishing oil and gas development or other uses of adjacent water however the proclamation protects federally owned features in the nearshore ocean zone for 12 miles from shore in part to provide for feeding and nesting habitat this may raise questions as to authority to regulate fisheries between the state the department of commerce and the department of the interior the secretary of the interior is to prohibit all extractive uses in the buck island reef monumen t the secretary also is to generally prohibit extractive uses in the virgin islands coral reef monument however the secretary may issue permits for bait fishing and blue runner line fishing in certain areas if such fishing is consistent with the protection of the monument although the proclama tions do not alter state authority for fish and wildlife management it is likely that the federal monument managers will work in conjunction with state authorities in managing fish and wildlife since federal managers havehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30528crs21 authority to modify or override state regulation in some instances blms management plan for grand staircaseescalante for instance contains five objectives and numerous actions for managing fish and wildlife one objective is to manage land uses within the monument so as to prevent damage to fish and wildlife and their habitats another objective is to work cooperatively with the utah division of wildlife resources to reestablish populations of native species and to protect and enhance the habitat of native species offroad vehicle use using motorize d and mechanized vehicles offroad except for emergency or authorized purposes is prohibited under the proclamations for many monuments agua fria canyons of the ancients carrizo plain cascadesisikiyou craters of the moon grand canyonparashant hanford reach ironwood forest kashakatuwe tent rocks sonoran desert upper missouri river breaks and vermilion cliffs the ban is designed to protect objects within the monuments similarly the interim policy governing blm monuments generally bars motorized and mechanized vehicles offroad and states that management discretion should be used where necessary to protect monument resources such as through emergency closures whether to allow vehicular travel on designated routes or in designated areas or to close routes or areas to vehicular use in those monuments where such use is not expressly prohibited likely will be addressed when drafting the management plan for each monument for example although the proclamation creating grand staircase escalante is silent as to offroad vehicles the final management plan for the monument prohibits motorized and mechanized travel offroad motorized and mechanized vehicles are allowed on designated routes which according to the plan primarily provide access to particular destinations and do not present significant threat to monument resources in some of the areas offroad vehicle use was prohibited before the monument designations some of the prohibitions may not have been fully implemented in other areas that became monuments offroad vehicles had been allowed at least in some places for instance for canyons of the ancients the existing management plan only prohibited travel offroad in approximately 25 of the monument area for giant sequoia motorized vehicle use is permitted only on designated roads new roads or trails are to be authorized except to further the protective purposes of the monument and roads and trails may be closed or altered before the management plan is issued to protect monument objects motorized vehicles were permitted on trails until the end of the year 2000 the management plan is to contain transportation plan that provides for visitor enjoyment and education offroad vehicles are not addressed for the several monumentsbuck island reef california coastal governors island minidoka internment pinnacles pompeys pillar president lincoln and soldiers home and virgin islands coral reef offroad vehicle use does not appear to be an issue in several cases because of the nature of the monuments recreational vehicle use offroad typically is not allowed on nps lands and generally is barred in blm monuments under the agencys interim policy for new monuments httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30528crs22 some of the proclamations address other transportation issues for instance the proclamation for cascadesiskiyou states that the secretary of the interior shall close particular road to motorized and mechanized vehicular use other routes or parts of routes have been closed under the interim management policy for cascade siskiyou the proclamations for canyons of the ancients carrizo plain cascade siskiyou craters of the moon ironwood forest kashakatuwe tent rocks sonoran desert upper missouri river breaks and vermilion cliffs state that the secretary of the interior is to prepare transportation plan or management plan that addresses road closures travel restrictions or other actions necessary to protect objects within the monument management of vessels is to be included in the management plans for the buck island reef and virgin islands coral reef monuments synopsis president clinton created 19 new national monumen ts and enlarged 3 others the monuments vary greatly in size from few acres to nearly 2 million acres creation of some of them has been controversial and raised numerous issues including whether the president has the authority under the antiquities act to create landscape monuments of great size and whether the antiquities act should be amended to limit large withdrawals or to address concerns about the process by which monuments are designated the clinton monuments also vary as to the uses that are allowed or prohibited on them and the agencies entrusted with their management the bush administration has indicated that it will reconsider the boundaries and uses established in the monuments created or expanded by president clinton and that it will seek public input into reexamination of individual monuments the extent to which subsequent president can modify or rescind monuments created by previous presiden t raises legal issues also some members of congress have indicated an interest in revoking or amending the authority of the president to create national monuments and in considering expressions of public approval or disapproval of the monuments or of particular aspects of their size configuration and

federal land and an additional 15000 acres of private land are within the borders of the monument these figures reflect land exchanges and boundary adjustments since the monument was proclaimed under the proclamation the monument is being managed by the blm the blm was managing the lands before the monument designation and the clinton administration sought to enhance the conservation role of blm the proclamation gave blm three years to develop plan for managing the monument and in february 2000 the final plan became effective32 the management plan calls for the establishment of monument advisory committee comprised primarily of scientists to advise monument managers on science issues and on implementing the management plan it emphasizes maintaining the primitive and remote condition of the land while providing for the study of scientific and historic resources within the monument developed recreation is limited to small areas of the monument and major visitor facilities will be located outside the monument motorized access is limited and the lands are withdrawn from new mineral development subject to valid existing rights the heart of the management plan is zone system
