through the crs web military suppression of enemy air defenses sead assessing future needs christopher bolkcom specialist in national defense foreign affairs defense and trade division summary httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21141 suppressing enemy air defenses sead has been central element of projecting military air power for over 50 years however several developments suggest that this mission is of growing importance to the department of defense dod some say that the emergence of new technologies and air defenses will increasingly challenge us sead efforts making budgetary judgments on sead programs and processes requires the assessment of complex factors this report will be updated introduction suppression of enemy air defenses sead is defined by the department of defense dod as that activity that neutralizes destroys or temporarily degrades surfacebased enemy air defenses by destructive andor disruptive means1 by this definition many military platforms munitions and processes contribute to sead including reconnaissance and surveillance standoff jamming employment of airtosurface munitions and electronic and infrared ir countermeasures2 variety of weapons platforms and munitions can and have been used to attack enemy air defenses including long range bombers helicopters surfacetosurface missiles precision guided munitions pgms rockets and dumb bombs however some combat aircraft have been designed or modified to increase their effectiveness against enemy air defenses and are typically thought of as sead assets these include the f16 ea6b fa18 f15e and recently f22a these aircraft carry number of munitions useful against surfacetoair missiles sams some carry the agm88 high speed anti radiation missile harm which is designed to lockon to and destroy the groundbased radars used by some sams and antiaircraft artillery aaa also the harm targeting system hts and the tactical electronic reconnaissance processing 1 joint publication 102 dod dictionary of

system terpes improve the ability of the f16cj and marine corps ea6b prowlers to target enemy air defense radars suppressing enemy air defenses has always been an important means of protecting us aircraft and enabling effective air operations however sead may be of growing importance to dod and congress for at least three reasons while combat aircraft have played an important role in most us conflicts since world war i the last several conflicts bosnia in 1995 kosovo in 1999 iraq 1996present and afghanistan in 2001 have emphasized the use of airpower there appear to be very few countries capable of seriously challenging us air forces in airtoair combat since operation desert storm 100 percent of all us combat aircraft losses have been due to enemy air defenses us aircraft has been lost to an enemy aircraft since 1991 most countries will challenge us airpower primarily with surfacebased air defenses3 dod finds some air defenses difficult to suppress or destroy many httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21141 analysts say that emerging air defense technologies and tactics will prove more threatening and more difficult to counter than current systems issues of concern the pentagon frequently expresses concern over several interrelated developments in enemy air defenses the emergence and proliferation of new generation of russian sams and the application of new technologies either in conjunction with these or with other air defense elements shoulderfired missiles continue to pose problem for todays sead forces observers are also concerned about the effect of strict rules of engagement on sead effectiveness russian sa10 and sa12 sams have been operational since the 1980s but currently are in the inventory or possession of only handful of countries eg russia china cyprus the czech republic and germany4 these double digit sams are concern for military planners due to their mobility long range high altitude advanced missile guidance and sensitive radars the russian sa20 still under development has been likened to the us patriot pac2 missile but with an even longer range and radar capable of detecting stealthy aircraft military planners are concerned that country with only handful of these sams could effectively challenge us military air operations by threatening aircraft and disrupting operations from great distances 3 historically the percentage of us combat losses due to aerial combat has steadily declined and the percentage of losses due to enemy air defenses has steadily risen in world war ii us air combat losses were split almost evenly between aerial combat 46 and air defenses 54 by the korean and vietnam wars however combat losses due to enemy air defenses had risen to approximately 90 and aerial combat losses had dropped to approximately 10 percent 4 world missiles briefing teal group inc feb 2005 india iran syria and vietnam are known to have negotiated with russia for these systems but acquisition has not been confirmed crs3 variety of new technologies and military systems could exacerbate the double digit sam challenge first commercial information and communications technologies are enabling adversaries to better network the elements of their air defense systems this allows them to disperse radars sam launchers and other associated platforms throughout the battlespace and to share targeting information between launchers this in turn suggests that radars may be used less frequently and for shorter periods of time complicating us sead efforts second terminal defenses are being marketed by number of international defense companies these radarguided gatling guns are designed to protect double digit sams or other high value air defense assets by shooting 3000 to 4500 rounds per minute into the sky these systems could prove quite effective in shooting down harm or other missiles aimed at enemy air defenses third russia and other countries have developed and are selling gps jammers over varying distances these lowwatt jammers degrade or totally disrupt the gps guidance signals used by many us pgms to augment inertial guidance systems reducing their accuracy us military planners must also grapple with todays pernicious air defense threats such as shoulderfired missiles unlike double digit sams manpads eg the us stinger russian sa7 and french mistral are widely proliferated and found in the httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21141 inventories of scores of countries these missiles are difficult to suppress due to their small size high mobility and ir guidance unlike radar guidance ir guidance which manpads tend to use does not emit energy that us selfdefense systems can detect thus the launch of an irguided missile often comes as surprise to the targeted aircraft reducing the time for evasive maneuvers or deployment of self protection countermeasures this increases manpads effectiveness ir guided sams were the primary source of air combat losses in operation desert storm5 and since 1973 nearly half of all air losses in combat have been attributed to irguided sams many of them launched from manpads others estimate that manpads caused 90 of worldwide combat aircraft losses from 198420016 shoulderfired missiles also pose terrorist threat to civilian aircraft rand estimates that at least 20 and as many as 40 civilian airliners were shot down by terrorists using manpads between 1975 and 19927 crs estimates six of these aircraft were actually airliners the others were smaller than most commercial aircraft8 the threat to civilian airliners posed by terrorists with shoulderfired missiles appears to be an issue of increasing congressional concern at least three bills introduced during the fy2005 budget cycle addressed methods for mitigating the threat of shoulderfired missiles to commercial aviation9 rules of engagement roe are designed by military planners to reduce the likelihood of fratricide shooting down friendly aircraft to minimize unintended civilian casualties and in some cases for political feasibility eg operating in ways palatable to 5 steven zaloga the evolving sam threat kosovo and beyond journal of

crs report rl31741 homeland security protecting airliners from terrorist missiles 9 ibid p 20 crs4 coalition partners some have asserted that roe in recent conflicts have been draconian and tied the hands of sead pilots reducing their effectiveness10 dod may seek congressional support for more lenient roe in future wars assessing future sead needs there are many factors that can be weighed when attempting to measure the success of dod sead efforts and determining what future needs eg new aircraft upgrades to selfprotection capabilities better munitions may be dod has had considerable experience suppressing enemy air defenses over the last 50 years survey of this experience provides some insight into sead success and challenges and helps provide context in which congressional oversight decisions can be made the following section describes three measures of effectiveness moes that can be used to focus congressional inquiry into future sead needs moe 1 combat attrition the first area that merits examination is combat attrition how many us combat aircraft have been shot down in recent conflicts how many have been shot down by groundbased air defenses because sead missions are httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21141 designed ultimately to protect us aircraft combat attrition provides some insight into the effectiveness of sead efforts as indicated in table 1 below from world war ii to the present the loss of us combat aircraft has steadily declined both in absolute terms and relative to the number of combat sorties flown while these numbers do not prove that sead is solely responsible for this very favorable trend it is clear that sead is an important contributor to aircraft survivability table 1 estimates of combat aircraft losses total combat conflict combat

expended to protect us aircraft how onerous mission is sead as table 2 below suggests twentytothirty percent of httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21141 all combat sorties in recent conflicts were devoted to sead while historically this ratio is much lower while this increase in sead sorties could be attributable to number of factors it appears that sead is growing mission area table 2 estimates of sead

power caucus bolling afb mar 12 2001 moe 3 efficiency by some measures us sead efforts have been effective however other observations suggest that efficiency could be improved for example one moe pertains to the destruction of enemy air defenses dead while suppressing enemy air defenses through electronic warfare ew or intimidation can effectively crs6 protect us aircraft the effect is ephemeral destroying enemy air defenses is generally preferred to suppressing them because of the enduring effect that destruction has on military capabilities as table 3 suggests us air forces have had mixed results in recent conflicts destroying enemy air defenses in some cases such as in iraq us destructive sead efforts have been somewhat successful in other cases such as kosovo where the serbs employed variety of challenging tactics efforts were less successful table 3 destructive sead some estimated results conflict estimated results desert storma 35 of 120 fixed sam batteries

aerospace power journal summer 2002 and interview with personnel involved in operation allied force d iraq improves in face of bombs new york times on the web aug 30 2001 another measure of efficiency pertains to tactics one sead tactic to fire numerous harm missiles preemptively that is in the direction of sam that is suspected to exist but which hasnt turned on its radar thirty three of 56 harms used in operation deliberate force were fired preemptively11 over 1000 harms in operation allied force were fired at only handful of sams suggesting many preemptive shots12 while using harms in this way may effectively deter adversaries from shooting at us aircraft it also poses two problem areas first preemptive harm use can be expensive since harms cost approximately 250000 per missile second preemptively fired harms present fratricide risk if there are enemy radar emissions for the harm to guide on the missile could lockon to friendly emissions and destroy the wrong target at least six harms shot during kosovo ended up by accident in bulgaria13 while launching harms preemptively may be effective and necessary it not efficient the navys advanced antiradiation guided missile aargm program may reduce the need for or the potentially negative effects of preemptive missile launches 75m requested in fy2006 the aargm program is pursuing number of improvements to harm including adding radar that can detect enemy radars after they have turned off and hardware and software improvements that limit the areas in which the missile can fly when searching for target 11 deliberate force
