inland waterways ecosystem updated august 24 2005 kyna powers analyst in energy and environmental policy resources science and industry division nicole t carter analyst in environmental policy resources science and industry division congressional research service the library of congress upper mississippi river system proposals to restore an inland waterways ecosystem summary recent proposals to expand the upper mississippi riverillinois waterway umriww major transportation route for products moving to and from illinois iowa minnesota missouri and wisconsin have met with significant controversy some of this controversy centers on the cumulative environmental effects of the current navigation system and the proposed expansion the upper mississippi river system umrs which includes the navigation channel and surrounding floodplain supports an unusually large number of species for temperate river the umriww navigation system alters umrs habitat and contributes to decline in the abundance of some species for example locks dams and other channel structures inhibit the movement of fish between and within river segments fill side channels backwaters and wetlands with sediment and suppress plant growth by reducing water clarity in 2001 in response to criticism that draft navigation feasibility studies did not look at navigations cumulative environmental effects the corps restructured its feasibility study to include an ecosystem restoration component in late september 2004 the corps released final feasibility report recommending that congress approve 50year framework for combined ecosystem restoration and navigation improvements the ecosystem restoration component is aimed at maintaining and restoring broad array of habitats and ecosystem processes at total cost of 53 billion for the 50year plan authorization of an initial set of both restoration projects at 158 billion and navigation projects at 203 billion has been proposed in the 109th congress for discussion of proposed legislation see crs report rl32915 upper mississippi riverillinois waterway investments legislation in the 109th congress by nicole t carter and kyna powers the federal responsibility and more specifically the role of the corps for restoring ecosystems altered by federal projects is still being defined consequently the scope of largescale restoration efforts and the federalnonfederal costshare are being developed largely on casebycase basis the corps umrs restoration plan recommends actions limited to the navigation system and its floodplain with federal responsibility for more than 90 of the cost the underlying question is whether or in what form congress will authorize and appropriate funds for ecosystem restoration on the umrs if authorized umrs restoration would be the corps second largescale restoration effort and the first largescale restoration effort for highvolume commercial waterway this report explains what is meant by

engineers authorization issues in the 109th congress coordinated by nicole t carter evolution of ecosystem restoration plan the corps feasibility study which began in 1993 to investigate the longrun navigation needs of the umriww has been the subject of much controversy in particular allegations contending that the corps manipulated benefitcost analysis to support umriww navigation lock expansion and the subsequent investigation are cited by some corps observers as evidence that fundamental changes need to be made in the corps project development and approval process4 the corps had also been criticized by state and federal natural resource agencies and environmental groups since the early years of the study for not including mitigation of environmental impacts beyond the incremental environment impacts of lock expansion the national research council nrc of the national academy of sciences repeated this criticism in 2001 report reviewing the feasibility study5 in response in 2001 the corps reformulated the economic analysis and added an ecosystem restoration component to the study to examine measures to address the cumulative environmental impacts of navigation and other stressors of the umrs ecosystem the nrc continues to review the study second nrc panel produced report in december 2003 that reviews the reformulated study6 and another report in october 2004 that

has not significantly reduced the debate over the urgency necessity and national benefit of expanded navigation capacity the corps ecosystem restoration plan has been less controversial with the discussion being largely focused on the magnitude and cost of the restoration effort the federalnonfederal costshare the scope of the restoration effort ie focus on the navigation project or the larger watershed and the linkage between navigation and restoration for river management and federal investments legislation the 109th congress has introduced two bills to authorize ecosystem restoration as part umriww investments these bills s 728 and hr 2864 water resources development act wrda of 2005 would authorize many of the investments the corps recommended each would authorize 203 billion for navigation and 158 billion for ecosystem restoration these bills are discussed further in crs report rl32915 upper mississippi riverillinois waterway investments legislation in the 109th congress by nicole t carter and kyna powers umrs ecosystem change congress identified the umrs as nationally significant ecosystem and commercial navigation system in the water resources development act wrda of 1986 pl 99662 according to the corps and basin state representatives the umrs ecosystem is in decline and action is needed if further degradation is to be avoided8 the umrs has been changed by multiple factors with the construction of navigation infrastructure and water management for navigation being principal among these factors thirtyseven lock and dams and channel training structures that create 9foot deep navigation channel alter the distribution and movement of river water these changes allow for lowcost transportation between the upper mississippi river basin and the gulf of mexicos ocean ports however these structures also inhibit the movement of some animal species between and within river segments fill side channels backwaters and wetlands with sediment and suppress plant growth by reducing water clarity other factors also have contributed to ecosystem decline including landuse practices in the watershed that cause sediment to enter the system and levees that isolate floodplains from the river the mississippi and illinois rivers also have long history of impaired water quality attributable to contamination from agricultural industrial residential and municipal sources figure 3 shows the upper mississippiillinois river watershed the area drained by the two rivers and their tributaries the watershed at 121 million acres 190000 square miles 6 of the lower 48 states is much larger than the umrs 8 corps final feasibility report and peis p 96 gary r clark upper mississippi river basin association umrba testimony on upper mississippi river and

from all five basin states to help coordinate the states riverrelated programs and policies and work with federal agencies that have river responsibilities crs5 which is limited to the navigable river reaches and associated floodplains and covers 25 million acres 3900 square miles umrs significance according to the us geological survey usgs the umrs is one of the nations greatest ecological treasures9 due to the complexity of the system and its northsouth orientation the umrs is unique among large temperate rivers in that it supports an unusually large number of fish species10 more than 150 species of freshwater fish 25 of all north american fish have been reported to inhabit the umrs overall the umrs provides temporary or permanent habitat to more than 485 species of fish birds and animals11 the umrs also supports recreational opportunities annually there are 12 million recreational visits to the umrs12 boating sightseeing sports fishing hunting and trapping are some of the more popular recreational uses13 it is estimated that recreation activities generate 12 billion and over 18000 jobs annually14 congress has recognized the importance of umrs habitat since early in the 20th century congress established the upper mississippi river national wildlife and fish refuge in 1924 but specified that it is not to interfere with navigation15 it provides 242400 acres of habitat for migratory and local birds animals wildflowers and aquatic plants fish and other aquatic life this refuge which is administered by the us fish and wildlife service covers 261 miles along the mississippi river 9 us department of the interior geological survey ecological status and trends of the upper mississippi river system 1998 p 122 hereafter referred to as usgs status and trends 1998

river basin association at httpwwwumrbaorgbasinfactshtm ecosystem decline although the umrs provides recreation and species habitat the federal infrastructure on the umriww was authorized by congress for the purpose of navigation the corps manages the upper mississippi river and the illinois river to provide 9foot navigation channel to create this channel the rivers were transformed from freeflowing rivers into series of separated navigation pools behind locks and dams these changes in the hydrologic regime alter water quality parameters such as temperature dissolved oxygen and sediment transport crs7 thereby ultimately affecting fish and wildlife and terrestrial and aquatic ecosystem processes such as intermittent inundation and drying16 consequently side channels backwater and wetlands are filling in with sediment see figure 1 while the loss of total aquatic habitat 1417 may be small the proportional loss of backwaters exceeded 10 in more than half of the reaches examined18 some of the reaches are projected to lose from 20 to 30 percent of their backwaters in the next 50 years19 under current sedimentation rates many backwater areas throughout the umrs will probably become terrestrial areas within the next 50 to 100 years20 including fish mammals birds and amphibians the umrs is home to 36 federally listed rare threatened or endangered species according to the united states geological survey mussels are good indicator of ecosystem health while 50 species of mussels were once found in the umrs recent surveys have documented drop to 30 species two of which are federally listed as endangered21 this decrease may indicate broader ecosystem decline ecosystem changes have not reduced the number of fish species found in the umrs however they have affected the distribution and abundance of some species22 for example lack of suitable winter habitat threatens some popular backwater species including bluegill crappies and large mouth bass23 the river also contains federally listed endangered fish the pallid sturgeon and over 50 statelisted rare threatened or endangered fish24 responding to decline in response to ecosystem changes environmental enhancement projects have been undertaken since wrda 1986 in which congress established the environmental management program for the umrs the emp consists of habitat rehabilitationenhancement projects and longterm resource monitoring program under the emp the corps has completed more than 40 habitat 16 navigation requires elevated water levels during dry seasons so sediment deposited in shallow backwater and side channels is not compacted by exposure to air this results in the sediment being easily resuspended into the water column where it reduces light penetration essential for plant growth less vegetation reduces aquatic insects fish waterfowl and other animals 17 corps final feasibility report and peis p 100 18 backwaters small generally shallow body of water attached to the main channel with little or current of its own shallow slowmoving water associated with river but outside the rivers main channel ibid 611 19 ibid p 106 20 usgs status

construction and 16 are in the design stages together these additional projects will improve approximately 74000 acres of riverine and floodplain habitat26 according to the corps current annual environmental investments 339 million on average in federal and state funds are inadequate to prevent continued degradation27 pointing to indicators of ecosystem decline many groups are concerned about the longterm effects of continued ecosystem alteration and argue for further investments in ecosystem restoration that will support habitat diversity some cite the loss of migratory birds in the areas of the illinois river and the middle and lower mississippi river as examples of possible outcome if investments are not made28 environmental groups want to reverse ecosystem decline and to increase the services and benefits provided by healthy ecosystem eg recreational uses the corps proposal for ecosystem restoration corps preferred ecosystem restoration plan the corps proposes in its final feasibility report and peis to reverse ecosystem decline by making investments in restoration at the same time as investing in navigation expansion the report puts forth preferred alternative for dual purpose umriww navigation and umrs ecosystem restoration plan 24 billion in navigation improvements and 53 billion for ecosystem restoration over 50 years29 under the corps recommended costshare option 425 billion in measures under the ecosystem restoration plan more than 80 of the total would be paid for 100 by the federal government as they would address impacts from the existing 9foot navigation project or for activities on federal lands the remaining 105 billion would be for floodplain restoration backwater water level management backwater dredgingrestoration island and shoreline protection measures to increase topographic diversity of the floodplain and some adaptive management activities the costs would be shared with local sponsors 65 federal and 35 nonfederal 680 million federal and 370 million nonfederal unlike most of the corps mitigation efforts for its other projects the corps preferred umrs restoration plan is not focused on particular species instead it is 25 the corps provides before and after pictures for one of its emp projects in corps final feasibility report and peis p8 26 us army corps of engineers rock island district 2004 report to congress

management strategy for the upper mississippi river 1993 29 the 200 million for mitigation of incremental environmental damage associated with navigation improvements is included in the navigation plan not the restoration plan crs9 aimed at restoring an array of aquatic and terrestrial species because of this more systemic approach the preferred restoration plan combines multiple categories of measures that together are expected to benefit the physical chemical and biological health of the entire umrs ecosystem the corps preferred ecosystem restoration plan contains total of 1009 measures including 248 for island building and protection 14 for fish passage 40 for floodplain restoration 21 for water level management and dam operations 208 for backwater restoration 147 for side channel restoration 64 for wing damdike alternation 235 for shoreline protection and 32 for topographic diversity because habitat is seen as key component in restoring species diversity and abundance30 habitat is used as gauge of what will be achieved under each measure the 1009 measures are estimated to influence total of 703717 acres of habitat many times the level of effort under the existing emp according to the corps the needed environmental and social mitigation for harm caused by the ecosystem restoration measures would be minimal the final feasibility report and peis indicates that the selected restoration alternative would have net positive effect on ecosystem goods and services and effect on commercial navigation water supply or hydroelectric power it stated that navigation pool drawdowns could harm livestock watering and recreational boating but the effects would be minimal moreover recreational boating may see an overall benefit from restoration investments integrated navigation and ecosystem management the corps feasibility report recommends that the restoration measures be implemented within the context of new overall dualpurpose management framework today navigation is the sole purpose of the corps umriww project and ecosystem restoration activities are conducted separately under the emp the corps recommends creating structure for umriwwumrs investments and operations consisting of three basic elements adding ecosystem restoration as umriww project purpose creating dualpurpose navigation and restoration authority31 approving combined navigation and ecosystem restoration plan as framework32 and adaptively implementing navigation investments and adaptively managing ecosystem restoration investments33 30 the usgs states that habitat is critical because the diversity and abundance of species found in the river depends on the diversity and abundance of habitat usgs status and trends 1998 p 72 the plan places particular emphasis on backwater habitat which is one of the primary types of habitat being lost 31 navigation is currently the only authorized purpose of the umriww 32 corps final feasibility report and peis p 491 33 part of the corps definition of adaptive management is an approach to natural resources management that acknowledges the risk and uncertainty of ecosystem restoration and allows for modification of restoration measures to optimize performance the process of implementing policy decisions as scientifically driven management experiments that test predictions continued crs10 according to the corps these three elements combined would allow the agency to proceed with operational changes and nearterm investments for navigation and ecosystem restoration investments would be planned as part of longterm combined river management framework that minimizes risk by establishing process to incorporate acquired information into ongoing decisionmaking known as adaptive management and they would be authorized in phases according to the corps integrated management of the environmental and navigation purposes will improve operational efficiency resulting in costsavings and synergistic benefits34 the corps also argues that dualpurpose authorization would give it flexibility to use operation and maintenance funds for ecosystem restoration and for navigation35 representative of the upper mississippi river basin association testified before congress that the states enthusiastically supported the corps decision to restructure the study consistent with their longstanding commitment to integrated management of the river36 number of agencies and nongovernmental organizations also support dualpurpose authorization barge industry group also testified that it supports the ecosystem restoration plan but believes that ecosystem restoration should be implemented without adversely affecting the growth of navigation37 moreover entities such as the national corn growers association and the midwest area river coalition 2000 do not support dualpurpose operation or integration of operation and maintenance for navigation and ecosystem restoration citing that an existing backlog of navigation operation and maintenance om activities and lack of clarity regarding implementation criteria for integrating operations38 adaptive management the third component of the corps proposed management framework is adaptive management adaptive management is mechanism for dealing with the uncertainty of undertaking largescale multiyear effort to change complex system the adaptive management component of the corps plan which is budgeted for 653 million calls for scientific panel system level learning and restoration plan bioresponse monitoring39 this approach is recognition that identifying and eliminating all uncertainties involved with restoration before initiating project is impossible furthermore reducing uncertainties consumes time and money and may delay the initiation of restoration efforts thus leading to further ecosystem degradation 33 continued and assumptions in management plans using the resulting information to improve the plans sic ibid p 611 34 ibid p 512 35 ibid p 491 36 upper mississippi river basin association june 24 2004 testimony 37 christopher j brescia midwest area river coalition 2000 marc 2000 testimony before the house transportation and infrastructure subcommittee on water resources and environment june 24 2004 38 corps final feasibility report and peis p 482 and 485 39 ibid p 512 crs11 while the builtin flexibility of adaptive management is seen as an asset for coping with uncertainty adaptive management can be seen as risky because there is the potential that it could be used to justify delays in implementing important activities or to abandon previously set goals moreover adaptive management is relatively recent management approach thus contributing its own uncertainties entities such as the national corn growers association has expressed concerns about adaptive management but hopes that the corps will continue to work closely with stakeholders however the us environmental protection agency the basin states and environmental organizations support the corps proposal for adaptive management for umrs restoration the october 2004 nrc report found the adaptive approach to be vital to the integrity of the corps preferred plan for combined ecosystem restoration and navigation investments it states that the preferred plan provides for program of incremental implementation an excellent framework for comprehensive adaptive management if the corps is provided the resources and if it commits to the needed data collection improved modeling techniques and evaluation many of the flaws and omissions in this study can be corrected in the course of implementation by the application of adaptive management principles40 at the same time the nrc was critical of the corps for not defining clear sciencebased framework for implementation monitoring and evaluation41 preferred and alternative plans in addition to describing the corps preferred restoration plan and an integrated management framework the feasibility report also describes how the corps arrived at its recommendation in selecting its preferred plan the corps analyzed five 50 year options for ecosystem restoration42 each of these alternatives has different target and therefore requires different level of investment the corps describes alternatives ae by scope as follows43 without project condition action current environmental activities continue b net loss protect and maintain existing environmental diversity c first increment of restoration restore the habitats most directly affected by the navigation project 40 october 2004 nrc report p 8 41 ibid 56 42 the corps focused its alternatives analysis on 50year plans analyses of the alternative plans b c and do not include discrete discussion of the first 15year increment the corps also examined multiple options for navigation improvements these are not discussed in this report 43 corps final feasibility report and peis p 183 crs12 d restoration to an intermediate level restore broad array of habitat types using management practices and cost effective actions and restoration to high level restore to include most environmental objectives that can be accomplished in the context of the navigation project as shown in table 1 the number of measures to be undertaken under the alternatives varies from additional actions above the current emp investments alternative to 1202 measures alternative within some categories of measures the differentiation between alternatives is pronounced the most dramatic difference is the number of fish passage projects and floodplain restoration plans see table 1 while there would be fish passage at dam sites under alternatives through c alternative d has 14 and alternative has 33 for floodplain restoration specifically alternatives b and c have 2 and 5 projects respectively while alternative d has 40 projects and alternative has 80 projects44 the level of investment under each restoration plan also affects the plans expected benefits measured by the corps in acres of influence45 and cost with the exception of the noaction alternative the number of acres influenced by the projects increase from 148 thousand acres under alternative b to 1227 thousand acres under alternative similarly the associated costs increase from 17 to 84 billion as the number of projects increase

corps final feasibility report and peis these estimates include embankment lowering to promote connectivity and measures to decrease water level fluctuations on the iww these are refinements to the d plan made by the corps that is referred to in the final report as d 44 these projects correspond to the following acreage for alternatives b through d b 1000 c 16000 d 105500 and 251500 45 the corps describes acres of influence as the area positively affected by the restoration measure ibid p viii it is estimated using data gained from already implemented restoration measures primarily emp projects the october 2004 nrc report p 8 is critical of the acres of influence metric as poorly correlated with ecological outcomes crs13 plan selection the corps evaluated its five ecosystem restoration alternatives using combination of qualitative analyses and estimated quantitative outputs qualitative assessments included ecosystem diversity ability to address ecosystem objectives maintenance and enhancement of ecosystem goods and services acceptability and adaptability46 quantitative measures included costs acres of influence cost effectiveness ecosystem completeness and regional economic development from this evaluation the corps rated alternatives d and as close in their overall ranking but recommended alternative d specifically alternative d was identified as the preferred alternative primarily because it is likely to achieve high degree of completeness and diversity in the most efficient manner47 while the basin states and environmental organizations generally support the corps preferred alternative d number of entities including the us epa the us fish and wildlife service and number of basin states would prefer the more extensive alternative in its analysis the corps compared environmental benefits with the cost of achieving those benefits this comparison is called cost effectiveness analysis cost effectiveness analysis is used as an optimization technique to identify either the least costly alternative for an established policy objective that defines the level of benefits desired or to maximize what can be achieved for given investment in the case of the final feasibility report and peis the corps does not use cost effectiveness analysis for either of these purposes instead the alternatives analyzed describe range of benefits for range of investments that is each of the five analyzed alternatives generates different quantity of benefits measured as acres of influence benefits were estimated by examining the acres of habitat affected through restoration activities under the emp comparing acres of influence and cost helps the corps to compare alternative plans however the usefulness of the comparison is limited by the fact that different acres of habitat are of different quality moreover the corps analysis is not particularly useful for comparing the benefits and costs of the umrs restoration effort with the benefits and costs of other largescale restoration efforts or corps flood control and navigation investments48 the corps proposal for 15year first increment after analyzing the 50year alternatives the corps recommends approval of 50year framework for ecosystem restoration investments and authorization of first 15year increment at 146 billion49 following the corps preferred costsharing option most projects would be 100 federal responsibility and some would be costshared with nonfederal sponsors overall responsibility for construction costs and other first costs eg land acquisition would be approximately 91 federal 46 ibid p 232 47 ibid pp 469 and x 48 corps navigation projects are evaluated using benefitcost analyses in which benefits are monetized thus facilitating comparison across projects this analysis is not used for restoration projects because computing the economic value of restoration benefits is difficult 49 corps final feasibility report and peis p 515 crs14 133 billion and 9 nonfederal 01350 in addition to the firstcost the corps estimates that operating and maintaining the ecosystem restoration components will cost 76 million51 the corps would likely be responsible for operation and maintenance om costs associated with fish passage facilities water level management and dike and wing dam alterations these costs are estimated at 12 million the remaining 64 million would be borne primarily by the us fish and wildlife service and the states the cost share allocation is currently unclear however om costs associated with floodplain restoration projects would largely be paid by the states and nonprofit entities and the us fish and wildlife service would likely assume responsibility for operating and maintaining completed habitat projects52 while the feasibility report does not include an analysis of alternative 15year increments the corps states that measures were selected to provide 1 the best return on investment 2 the best gains in habitat and species diversity and 3 additional knowledge that will facilitate adaptive implementation of the 50year plan the corps also selected measures for which there would be sufficient time to plan design construct and monitor within the 15year time frame53 however some environmental organizations contend that 15year time frame is insufficient to achieve tangible results and that longerterm authorization is needed the us fish and wildlife service for example states that there will be need for ecosystem restoration authority for as long as the navigation system is operated and maintained54 on the other hand the state of wisconsin supports the 15year time frame on the basis that it will likely allow time to document the need for alternative as it stands the corps proposed 15year increment includes 225 measures under three main activities55 fish passage and dam operations fish migration is largely impeded by the locks and dams on the navigation system to help fish stocks move more freely through the system the 15year plan would include about 30 of the fish passage and dam operations measures recommended in the 50year plan specifically the 15 year plan would include fish passage construction at 4 dams and fish passage planning and design at 2 dams 209 million and new dam operating procedures and related land acquisition or easements at 2 dams 41 million

protection and restoration 277 million total 65 federal debate over the corps ecosystem restoration proposal if congress decides to authorize an ecosystem restoration plan for the umrs it will face number of policy decisions the more contentious aspects of such authorization may deal with the plans magnitude and cost costshare scope and relationship to authorization of navigation investments and navigation operations these decisions are briefly described below restoration magnitude and cost the corps analysis of ecosystem restoration includes five alternative plans of which restoration goals can be achieved at different levels of investment policymakers are now confronted with deciding on the magnitude of restoration efforts if any to be undertaken should the restoration effort maintain existing ecosystem conditions ie net loss or should it restore ecosystem conditions without trying to attain some preexisting situation if restoration is the objective how much of the earlier ecosystem function should be restored answers to these questions are based on value judgements and depend on balancing what the federal government and the basin states are willing to invest in restoration with the desire for restored ecosystem as previously described the corps 53 billion restoration plan would maintain and restore ecosystem function one factor that some restoration supporters argue should be considered in deciding on federal investments is the relative spending on restoration and navigation implementing the corps 50year restoration plan would result in an average annual cost including both initial investments and om of almost 140 million this compares to the 185 million on average annually spent on the om and rehabilitation of the existing navigation system and the additional 60 million annually for implementing the corps 50year navigation plan56 costshare another investment consideration is the distribution of financial responsibility among federal and nonfederal sponsors the umrs restoration plan 56 these estimates were updated by congressional research service based on data provided in the us dept of the interior us fish and wildlife service draft supplement to the april 2002 draft fish and wildlife coordination act report for the upper mississippi and illinois river system navigation feasibility study april 2004 crs16 raises the question of who is responsible for paying for restoration of ecosystems partially damaged by existing federal projects since wrda 1986 nonfederal sponsors have been responsible for greater portion of corps project costs the cost share formulas evolved out of debate over having beneficiaries ie nonfederal sponsors pay for the benefits received by footing portion of project costs57 the established costshare for corps ecosystem restoration projects is 65 federal 35 nonfederal however the corps recommends for the umrs costshare arrangement that increases federal responsibility because of the role of the federal umriww navigation system in earlier degradation the extensive federal land holdings and the multistate nature of the effort the recommended arrangement which is generally supported by the states agencies and environmental and navigation organizations would result in the 53 billion of restoration costs being split 91 federal 9 nonfederal this cost share could be viewed as reflecting federal responsibility for mitigating damage caused by existing federal projects other federal agencies basin states environmental organizations and the nrc support the corps proposed costshare observers outside the basin and others less likely to be direct beneficiaries of investments may argue that nonfederal beneficiaries should pay higher portion of the cost although the corps provides justification for the dominance of federal financing some observers may dispute this dominance for various reasons one reason stems from part of the perceived motivation for adopting costshare arrangements in wrda 1986 the costshare formulas cant guarantee that every new project will be worth the price but they will force state and local interests to weigh the costs against the benefits more conscientiously58 in this view one purpose of costsharing is to put corps projects to market test whereby state and local beneficiaries confirm the value of project by agreeing to share in the cost59 another benefit is that nonfederal sponsors may have greater sense of project ownership in contrast the absence of local financial involvement can be seen as particularly problematic for restoration project which lacks benefitcost analysis that identifies the level of investments at which the costs outweigh the benefits of longer term ecosystem services supporting humaneconomic endeavors and other societal values on the other hand one could argue that the willingness of local partner to pay for ecosystem restoration does not provide an accurate litmus test given the ecosystems national significance some environmental organizations are concerned with how the costsshare arrangement will effect the corps restoration priorities they fear that requiring the nonfederal sponsors to contribute 35 for some activities will discourage the corps from aggressively pursuing these activities particularly floodplain management activities 57 m reuss reshaping national water politics the emergence of the water resources development act of 1986 alexandria va us army corps of engineers institute for water resources oct 1991 58 ibid p 199 59 the october 2004 nrc report p 52 was critical of using market test for umrs investments because of the role of the umriww navigation project in ecosystem decline and because the benefits of restoration investment may not be local crs17 second objection to the dominance of federal financing for umrs restoration may be that the available federal funding for umrs restoration could be constraint on restoration progress the federal government and the corps in particular is or may become involved in other largescale multibillion dollar restoration efforts such as the florida everglades restoration and the coastal louisiana wetlands restoration this growing financial commitment to restoration investments is happening within the context of large projected federal budget deficits and backlog of corps construction projects currently estimated at more than 40 billion restoration scope the corps constrained the restoration plan by limiting its geographic scope the corps plan targets restoration for the umrs that is the umriww and its floodplain as result reducing stressors that are beyond the floodplain in the larger watershed are not included among the recommended measures instead the plan recommends measures to address the symptoms of these stressors that is the corps restoration plan does not include changes to land use practices related to increased sedimentation and degradation of other water quality parameters flood damage reduction practices on largescale or significant alterations to navigation infrastructure for example the corps plan recommends backwater dredging measures dredging addresses the symptom of elevated sedimentation but not the land use practices that can cause it because these practices are considered outside the scope of the navigation study and navigation project substantial restoration benefits are not in the corps plan because they would interfere with navigation the corps also limits the recommended restoration measures to the scope of the navigation project and study that is the measures are to address the cumulative impacts of operations of federal projects and other ecosystem stressors without harming navigation for example dramatic water level changes that could produce substantial restoration benefits are not in the corps plan because they would interfere with navigation the nrc recommended in its december 2003 report that the corps should to the extent feasible use more holistic approach that includes factors such as water quality flood damage reduction and sediment transport the corps maintains that more comprehensive watershedtype approach is beyond the scope of the authorization under which the agency is conducting the feasibility study60 according to the corps another reason for the current restoration scope is that the five basin states support the concept that the study should remain focused on navigation and an environmentally sustainable navigation system61 because only some of the stressors causing ecosystem degradation are managed under the corps plan not all of the ecosystems natural river processes are restored resulting in the need for regular human intervention to obtain some restoration benefits some environmental organizations such as american rivers would prefer to have ecosystem restoration authorized for the entire watershed activities under the corps proposal would be limited in scope to the umrs the october 2004 nrc report showed less concern about the geographic scope of the restoration effort and was more interested in 60 corps final feasibility report and peis p qm5 61 ibid p qm5 crs18 restoring natural river processes that shape floodplains62 consequently the nrc supports not only dual purpose authorization but also multipurpose authorization that includes flood management63 would more comprehensive watershed approach accomplish restoration at less cost in the longrun and if so would this reduced cost be offset by potential constraints on navigation and flood damage reduction benefits linked authorization as described above the corps limited the scope of its ecosystem restoration proposal to the navigation channel and surrounding floodplain the corps selected this scope because restoration plans were developed in the context of the navigation study that is the study has restoration as half of dualpurpose plan the environmental community uniformly support the need for restoration investments and dualpurpose management the community however is not united on how to achieve this some environmental groups64 such as the mississippi river basin alliance and audubon support authorizing package of restoration and navigation investments within dual purpose management context other environmental groups would like to see additional ecosystem restoration authorized through the existing structure of the emp without authorizing largescale investments in navigation legislation on the corps proposal could link navigation funding to ecosystem restoration alternatively legislation could authorize ecosystem restoration without authorizing the navigation project or vice versa65 should authorization or funding for ecosystem restoration and navigation be linked if so how closely should they be joined these questions apply beyond the corps proposal for the umr iwwumrs to other corps projects and other federal restoration efforts as the first combined largescale navigation and ecosystem restoration project it could set precedent for future proposals what is the threshold for adding ecosystem restoration to other federal projects should all largescale water projects eg locks dams and levees have an ecosystem restoration component in addition to their ecosystems rivers are resources that may be used for multiple purposes such as hydro power navigation flood control recreation and water supply while many 62 this interest in natural river processes and floodplain connectivity is linked to another criticism made by the nrc the october 2004 nrc report p 8 states that proposed restoration measures represent an impressive range and number of candidate actions the assembly of those measures into restoration alternatives however is not adequately grounded in principles and theories of large river floodplain science and restoration 63 ibid pp 23 the october 2004 nrc report also questions if the corps assumption that the navigation season and 9foot channel depth will remain unchanged is appropriate and if this assumption implicitly gives navigation superior position to other river uses ibid pp 1920 64 these organizations do not necessarily support the corps entire navigation proposal they tend to oppose lock expansion but support smallscale measures 65 for more information on current legislation see crs report rl32574 upper

purposes agencies have been directed to construct and operate number of federal projects for single purposes should all federal projects be managed for multiple purposes linking ecosystem restoration and navigation as with any multipurpose designation is ultimately policy question of how congress wants federal agencies to manage public resources conclusion the army corps of engineers has released final feasibility report and chiefs report recommending that congress authorize 15year initial increment of ecosystem restoration measures as part of combined 50year investment and management framework for umriww navigation and umrs restoration authorization of umrs restoration poses policy questions for decision makers such as what level of restoration should be authorized and at what cost what should be the federal responsibility for umrs restoration investments congress is being asked to answer these questions in the context of interest in and debate over navigation expansion on the umriww the answers that congress may provide are likely to be viewed as precedent setting for other largescale restoration efforts especially efforts for ecosystem restoration of other inland waterways and rivers an additional challenge is the uncertainty of what would be achieved through umrs restoration investments this uncertainty comes from multiple sources ecosystem restoration is young science the corps plan only addresses some of the stressors causing ecosystem decline and restoration implementation depends on available appropriations the issue for policymakers is further complicated because analytic tools to assist in decisionmaking for restoration projects are less robust than for other corps projects that use benefitcost analysis the corps has recognized these challenges in its feasibility report in response the agency recommends an adaptive management and implementation strategy for restoration however some observers see adaptive management as contributing another element of uncertainty and risk congress may weigh these risks when considering the level of ecosystem restoration and federal investment for the umrs if it wants to make these restoration investments in conjunction with navigation expansion or separately and what role it wants during implementation and funding 66 most federal dams are managed for multiple purposes furthermore licenses issued by the federal energy regulatory commission for nonfederal dams often contain provisions aimed at retaining or enhancing the rivers recreational ecological or tribal benefits crs20 related crs
