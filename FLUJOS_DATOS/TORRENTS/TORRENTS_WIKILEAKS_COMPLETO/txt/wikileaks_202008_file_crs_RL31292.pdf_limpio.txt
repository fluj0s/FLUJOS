terrorism issues for congress summary for well over decade international terrorism has been major concern of the us intelligence community collection assets of all kinds have long been focused on qaeda and other terrorist groups intensive analytical expertise has been devoted to determining such groups member ships locations and plans intelligence agencies had been acutely aware of the da nger for years in february 2001 director of central intelligence dci george tenet public ly testified to congress that the threat from terrorism is real it is immediate and it is evolving furthermore osama bin ladin and his global network of lieutenants and associates remain the most immediate and serious threat nevertheless the intelligence community gave specific warning of the september 11 2001 attacks although all obs ervers grant that terrorist groups are very difficult targets and that undetected movements of sma ll numbers of their members in an open society cannot realis tically be prevented serious questions remain an extensive investigation by the two intelligence committees of the september 11 attacks was undertaken in 2002 although the final report is not yet public the committee members found that the intelligence community prior to 911 was neither well organized nor equipped to meet the challenge posed by global terrorists focused on targets within the u s separate inde pendent commission was established in early 2003 to take another look at the ev ents preceding september 11 counterterrorism is highly dependent upon human inte lligence humint the use of agents to acquire information and in certain circumstances to carry out covert actions humint is one of the least expensive intelligence disciplines but it can be the most difficult and is undoubtedly the mo st dangerous for practitioners mistakes can be fatal embarrass the whole country and undermine important policy goals congress makes decisions regarding the extent to which the importance of humint outweighs the inherent risks countering terrorism requi res close cooperation between law enforcement and intelligence agencies some terrorists will need to be brought to justice in courts but others are dealt with by military forces or covert actions in recent years important steps have been taken to encourage clos er cooperation between the two communities but some believe terrorist acts may have been fac ilitated by continuing poor information exchanges between intelligence and law enforcement agencies and by blurred lines of organizational re sponsibility congress will oversee the implementation of the evolving relationship that affects im portant principles of law and administration and may c hoose to modify the roles and missions of intelligence and law enforcement agencies military operations to counter terrorism are dependent on the availability of precise realtime intelligence to support bombing campaigns using precision guided munitions the linkage between sensor nd shooters will be crucial as will access to global geospatial database s as defense transforma tion progresses congress will also oversee the development of increas ed intelligence support to military

struggle against international terrorism places new and difficult demands on the us intelligence community acquiring information about the composition location capabilities plans and ambitions of terrorist groups is an enormous challenge for intelligence agencies meeting this challenge requires different skills than were needed to keep informed about the capabilities and intentions of communist governments at the same time requirements continue for coverage of geopolitical developments around the world nd other transnational issues such as narcotics smuggling observers point to several major challenges that the intelligence community will likely encounter in supporting the counter terrorist effort first is renewed emphasis on human agents signals intelligence and imagery satellites have their uses in the counterterrorism mission but in telligence to counter terrorism depends more on human intelligence humint such as spies and informers any renewed emphasis on human intelligence necessarily will involve willingn ess to accept risks of complicated and dangerous missions and likely ties to disreputable individuals who may be in positions to provide valuable information time and patience will be needed to train analysts in difficult skills and languages second terrorist activities pose significant analyt ical challenges in addition to acquiring analysts with esoteric language skills intelligence agencies must develop expertise in many third world areas that had been of peripheral c oncern in years past much of the data available will be in open unclassified sources that intelligence agencies have often neglected third is the closer relationship between intelligence and law enforcement agencies in counterterrorism efforts intelligence agencies work alongside law enfo rcement agencies that have far different approaches to gathering evidence developing leads and maintaining retrievable databases policies and statutes are being modified to facilitate closer relationship between the two sets of agencies but closer cooperation s raised difficult questions abouthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31292crs2 1 see walter pincus intelligence

operations against terrorists will reenforce requirements for collecting and transmitting precise intelligence to military commanders or operators through secure communications systems in real time the growing reliance of military operations on the availability of precise inte lligence is well understood but the availability of collection platforms such as reconnaissance aircraft unmanned aerial vehicles and r econnaissance sa tellites has been limited throug hout much of the past decad such platforms are especially important for counterterrorist operations in large measure meeting these ch allenges will be the responsibility of executive branch officials the primary role for congress will be to decide appropriate levels of budgetary resources and to oversee intelligence community efforts to ensure that resources are well managed and that the nations intelligence needs are met some obser vers believe that congress has special responsibilities to provide clear statutory framework to guide the unpr ecedented and uncertain evolution of intelligencelaw enforcement relationships such framework is necessary they suggest to minimize chances for failure of the campaign against terrorists or alternatively serious erosi on of the protections of individual liberties that have evolved over many centuries in the aftermath of september 11 2001 congress moved rapidly to provide intelligence agencies with expanded aut horities and increased funding to support counterterrorism in the year 2002 congressional intelligence committees investigated the background of the septem ber attacks and reco mmended legislation to reorganize the us intelligence community vast intelligence assets were deployed in support of milita ry operations in iraq and there are continuing requirements in afghanistan programs likely will be established to support the longterm struggle against terrorism and necessary budgetary resources identified intelligence support to the department of homeland security is key concern and one that remains under review in november 2001 one media account sugge sted that major reorganization of the intelligence community might be under consideration by the executive branch1 members of the two intelligence committees released number of recommendations in december 2002 to strengthen ma nagement of intelligence activities2 t h legislative future of such proposals is uncertain however whatever the organizational relationships intelligence for counterterrorism will be affected by the need for good humint analysis close tie s to law enforcement

to pull together information on international terrorism from all sources and devise c ounterterrorism plans after the fall of the soviet union and the warsaw pact terrorism was perceived with even greater concern especially as us military forces and installations re peatedly were attacked by terrorist groups as in the 1996 khobar towers barracks in saudi arabia the august 1998 bombing of us embassies in kenya and tanzania and the attack on the uss cole in october 2000 public statements by senior intelligence officials affirm that the threat to the united states posed by international

the threat from terrorism is real it is immediate and it is evolving state sponsored terrorism appears to have declined over the past fi ve years but transnational groups with decentralized leadership that makes them harder to identify and disrupt are emerging furthermore osama bin ladin and his global ne twork of lieutenants and associates remain the most immediate and serious threat3 in this

11 was an intelligence failure 8 joint investigation by the house and senate intelligence committees was undertaken in 2002 by joint inquiry staff the final report will not be pub licly available until mid2003 but number of findings and recommendations were made public in decem ber 2002 that described inadequacies in the organization of the intelligence community9 in the fy2003 intelligence

months to submit its report some observers have suggested comparis ons to the investigations that were undertaken during and after world war ii c oncerning the japanese attack on pearl harbor10 those investigations were viewed by many observers as politicized either seeking or deflectin g mistakes by the roosevelt administration by the time of the conclusion of the cong ressional investigation in

laid th groundwork for the establishment of national intelligence effort by the nationa l security act of 1947 similarly the investigation of the events leading up to the september 11 attacks might lay the groundwork for new relationship betw een intelligence and law enforcement in the immediate wake of 911 cong ress passed the usa patriot act principal purpose of which was to remove perceived restrictions on closer law enforcementintelligence cooperation in or der to support counterterrorist efforts12 modifications to the foreign intelligence surveillance act fisa for the same purpose were acted shortly thereafter as part of the fy2002 intelligence authorization act pl 107108 and furthe r changes are being considered in 2003 the need to integrate intelligence and law enforcement information greatly influenced the deliberations that resulted in the establishment of the department of homeland security dhs in early 2003 th is legislation envisioned an analytical directorate in dhs that would be the center of an integrative effort based on information from intelligence and law enforcement sources the executive branch however has created separate terrorist th reat integration cent er ttic under the direction of the dci that began operations in may 2003 at the same time number of observers have expressed seri ous concerns about closer ties between intelligence and law forcement agencies and especially about the use of intelligence gathering techniques against us citizens and resident aliens the passage of the usa patriot act and rela ted legislation in th wake of 911 has been criticized as fundamental weakenin g of civil liberties protections further legislative initiatives to align law enforcement and intelligence efforts more closely are likely to result in greater opposition aside from the investigation into the background of the september 11 attacks intelligence agencies will be adapting their efforts to the requirements of the campaign against terrorism renewed emphasis is being placed on human intelligence on improved analysis on coope ration with law enforcement agencies and on ensuring that realtime intelligence about terrorist

washington post nov 18 2001 pa1 for background on covert actions see crs report 96844 covert action an effective inst rument of us foreign policy by richard best jrhumint collection many observers believe that intelligence required for the campaign against terrorism will require significant changes in the human intelligence humint collection effort the cias operations directorate is responsible for the bulk of humint collection although the defense hu mint service within dod is smaller entity more directly focused on militaryrela ted issues overall budget requirements for humint are dwarfed by the major investment required for satellites and signals intelligence collection humint however undoubtedly can be dangerous for those involved and it is of course for many in the media and the general public the core intelligence discipline13 both the emphasis on humint and on the exchange of data between intelligence and law enforcement agencies will influence the evolution of the us intelligence community in the coming decade these two efforts will not in themselves have major budgetary implications humint is both difficult and dangerous but not necessarily expensive and information exchanges between agencies ordinarily involve only information technology costs however placing priorities on these two aspects of the intelligence effort will almost inevitably detract from other missions and disciplines in the view of many obser vers there may be tendency to give less emphasis to traditional intelligence collecti on and analysis regarding foreign political economic and military developments whereas to some extent intelligence analysts experienced in looking at foreign policy economic and defense issues can shift from one country to another it ma be more difficult for an analyst to turn from issues of diplomacy economics and warfare to the st udy of obscure terrorist groups that may be involved in religious i ndoctrination or various cr iminal fundraising activities although humint is not in itself an expensive discipline it requires large amounts of support and an awareness by senior officials of possible negative consequences potential complications in cluding imprisonment of us agents in foreign countries and loss of friendly lives have to be given careful consideration major diplomatic embarrassment to the united states can result from revelations of covert efforts especially those that go awry such embarrassment can jeopardize relationships that have been developed over many years httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31292crs7 14 discussion of current weaknesses in the cias humint effort is found in seymour m hersh what went wrong new yorker october 8 2001 hersh claims that cia has steadily reduced its reliance on overseas

adelman facing the enemy washingtonian november 2001 p 33 collecting humint to support the counterterro rism effort will require significant changes in the work of intelligence agencies14 terrorists do not usually appear on the diplomatic cocktail circuit nor in gatherings of local businessmen in many cases they are also involved in various type s of criminal activities on the margins of society terrorist groups may be composed almost wholly of members of one ethnic or religious group they may routinely gage in criminal activities or human rights abuses developing contacts with such groups is obviously difficult challenge for us intelligence agencies it requires longlead time preparation and willingness to do business with unsavory individuals it cannot in many cases be undertaken by intelligence agents serving under official c over as diplomats or military attaches it may require an indepth knowledge of local dialects and customs furthermore the list of groups around the world that might at some point in the future be involved in terrorist activities is not short making determinations of where to seek agents whose reporting will only be important under future eventualities is difficult challenge with the risk of needlessly involving the us with corrupt and ruthless individuals critics of the current us humint collection effort point to these and other institutional problems one repor t quotes former cia official the cia probably doesnt have single truly qualified arabicspeaking officer of middle eastern background who can play believable muslim fundamentalist

be evaluated without access to classified information it is not clear what steps the intelligence community has taken to realign its hu mint operations developing humint collection strategy under these circumstances is difficult challenge for the intelligence community especially for the cias operations directorate the fbi and the smaller defense humint service observers suggest the need for series of policy decisions involved in reorientation of humint collection move towards greater reliance on nonofficial cover noc non official cover means that agents are working as employees or owners of local business and thus are removed from the support and protections of american embassies that would be available if the agent had cover as us govern ment official of nonintelligence agency if the agent must be seen as engaged in business considerable time must be devoted to the cover occupation providing travel pay health care administrative services etc is much more difficult the agent will not have diplomatic immunity and cannot be readily returned to th us if apprehended in the host country he or she may be subj ect to arrest imprisonment or potentially execution there is potential for agents working in businesses to become entangled in unethical or illegal activities to go into business for themselves that could embarrass the us and detract from their official mission18 requirements for us intelligence agents with highly developed skills in foreign languages are difficult to meet few graduates of us colleges have such skills and language education is expensive recruiting us citizens who have ethnic backgr ounds similar to members of the societies in whic h the terrorist groups operate may subject individuals to difficult pre ssures especially if the agent has family in the targeted area the house intelligence committee reported in september 2001 that the intelligence communitys most pressing need is for great er numbers of foreign language capable intelligence personnel with increased fluency in specific and multiple languages the committee has heard repeatedly from both military and civilian intelligen ce producers and consumers that this is the single greatest limitation in intelligence agency personnel expertise and that it is deficiency throughout the intelligence community19httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31292crs9 19 continued 107219

are higher than adding intelligence staff to embassies few observers could have predicted the intense us concern with so malia kosovo or afghanistan that eventually developed ten years from now there may be whole set of challenges from groups that one today is even aware of in short reorienting humint collection to give significantly greater attention to terrorist or potentially terrorist groups would have importa nt administrative implications for the intelligence community while budgetary increases would not necessarily be dramatic gi ven the size of the existing intelligence budget even paying hundreds of human agents would be far less costly than deploying satellite the infrastructure needed to train nd support numerous agents serving under non official cover would grow significantly extensive redundancy would be required to cover terrorist groups that may never pose significant threats to us interests with such considerations in mind the senate intelligence committee in its report accompanying the fy2 004 intelligence au thorization bill s 1025 noted interest among some members in more vigorous humint collection especially unilateral collection under nonoffi cial cover and from nontraditional humint platforms the committee further noted that some observers have even suggested the need for the creation of small highly specialized semi or fully independent humint entity charged with collecting against nontraditional targets and rogue states that traditionally ve proven highly resistant to humint penetration involving traditional offici alcover operations the committee did not endorse this concept but urged diligent effort and new approaches to humint management within existing agency components20 central issue for congress is the extent to which it and the public are prepared to accept the inherent risks involved in ma intaining many agents with connections to terrorist groups statutory law21 requires that congressional intelligence committees be kept aware of all intelligence activities unlike th situation in the early cold war years when some intelligence efforts were designed to be deniable it will be difficult for the us government to avoid responsibility for major mistakes or illconceived efforts of intelligence agenci although there is very widespread consensus that qaeda poses threat to all americans and to fundamental american interests it cannot be assume d that the us public or members of congress will view other groups in the sa light intelligence professionals recall that earlier associations with anticommunist elements in central america camehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31292crs10 22 many of the statutory restrictions on in telligence activities imposed in response to public criticism have nonetheless been widely accepted and congressional oversight of intelligence agencies is now routine 23 richard k betts fixing intelligence foreign affairs januaryfebruary 2002 p 48 24 the principal

anticommunists were guilty of human rights violations and because th ey were or appeared to be propping up reactionary and oppressive re gimes these criticisms cam to be shared by many members of congress and as result inte lligence agencies perceived that they were operating under excessive scrutiny and cloud of suspicion for many years22 the direct attacks on the us homeland on september 11 2001 ma well have produced willingness on the part of the american public to accept greater risks but intelligence professionals will undoubtedly be concerned to ensure that the work of their agencies not be jeopardized by shifts in public opinion analysis terrorist activities present intelligence analysts with major challenges first there must be an awareness of the social ideological and political environment in which terrorist movements develop such awareness usually requires detailed knowledge of geographic ethnic religi ous economic and political situations in obscure regions there is ready supply of analysts with command of such skills except perhaps among recent emigrants who may have complex ties to their homelands moreover areas of concern are likely to shift over time as one longtime observer has noted such analysts could serve their whole careers without producing anything that the us government really needs and good analyst wants to be buried in an inactive account w ith peripheral significance23 much of the information required to anal yze terrorist environments derives from extensive study of open source documents newspapers pamphlets journals books religious tracts etc some observe rs believe that the intelligence community overly emphasizes sophisticated techni cal collection systems and lacks comprehensive strategy for collecting and exploiting such open source information osint24 although efforts are underway by in telligence agencies to expand the use of osint many observers believe that intelligence agencies should continue to concentrate on the collection and analysis of secret information in this view the intelligence community should not attemp t to become government center for research that can more effectively be undertaken by think tanks and academic institutionshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31292crs11 25 ibid p 58 betts makes the interesting point that expertise can get in the way of anticipating radical departure from the nor m p 49 terrorists succeed by undertaking actions that are unprecedented or to american ey irrational thus trained analysts with years of experience may be less inclined to think outside the box although ignorance of the terrorist groups composition and goal s would not guarantee unique insightsonce terrorist group hostile to american interests has been identified the intelligence community will be called upon to focus closely upon its membership plans and activities many collection resources will be targeted at it and much of the information will be classified and highly sensitive the most challenging problem for analysts at this point is to attempt to discern where the terrorists will strike and through what means open societies are in evitably vulnerable to terrorists especially those persons willing to commit suicide in the process of seeking their goals the skills necessary to anticipate the unpredicta ble are extremely rare some suggest useful approach may be to assemble w ar room comprised of number of analysts to sift through all available data such an effort was created to follow qaeda but did not foresee september 11 the bottom lin is that anticipating such attacks is intellectually difficult hiring more people and spending more money do not guarantee success25 others suggest greater reliance on outside consultants or an intelligence reserve corps when terrorist threats become imminent such an approach might also allow agencies to acquire temporarily the services of persons with obscure language skills while there are security problems involved in bringing outside experts into highly classified environment this may be one approach that can provide needed personnel without unnecessarily expanding the number of government analysts in regard to analysis major issues for congress include holding intelligence agencies responsible for the quality of thei r work the effective and efficient use of open source information and th appropriate use of outside consultants analytical judgment is not easily mandated or ac quired leadership is key along with accountability and willingness to accept that even the best analysts cannot foresee all

intelligence information by which individual names could be checked although there ar many potential concerns about the establishment of centralized databases most observers see the need to ensure

major concern has been the foreign intelligence surveillance act fisa wa s enacted in 1978 to establish system for authorizing surveillance to collect information related to national security concerns the process for obtaining warrant under fisa differs from that for obtaining warrant for criminal activities there are different procedures and special fisa courts the fundamental purpose is to

enforcement by the intelligence community will have major implications for us foreign policy over the years the us government has maintained good relations ba sed on shared appreciation of common interests with many governments whose legal systems ar far different from our own in some cases the us has chosen to accept the fact that foreign government may shield narcotics smugglers or member s of groups the us considers terrorist and to try to build relationship of mutual interest s with the country in the hope that its involvement with terrorists will eventually abate such policy inevitably runs counter to the ethos of law enforcement agencies seeking to apprehend suspected criminals and put them on trial reportedly senior fbi officials during the clinton administration sought

who be lieved that pressing the sa udis would complicate efforts to work with riydah on other important issues32 the relationship of intelligence collection to law enforcement in dealing with terrorism poses complex issues for polic ymakers terrorism can of course be attacked militarily without concern for domes tic law enforcement but most observers believe that such an approach is appr opriate and practical only when terrorists directly threaten the us homeland in other cases law enforcement may be the approach that can effectively deal with the problem while not undermining support for larger policy interests or leading to significant us casualties information used in judicial proceedings is often of different type than that usually collected by intelligence agencies33 it is collected differently stored differently and must usually be shared to some extent with opposing attorneys nevertheless over the past decade series of initiatives have been undertaken to enhance the usefulness of information collected by intelligence agencies to law enforcement agencies and vice versa34 the barriers to flow of information between the two communities were both administrative and statutory both types have been addressed by executive branch policies35 and by the passage of the usapatriot act of 2001 pl 10756 which specifically lays the groundwork for making information collected by law enforcement agencies including grand jury testimony available to intelligence agencies bringing law enforcement and intellig ence closer together is not without challenges first the two sets of agen cies have longestab lished roles and missions that are separate and based on constitutional and statutory principles the danger of using intelligence methods as routine wenforcement tool is matched by the danger of regularly using law enforcement agencies as instruments of foreign policy bureaucratic overlap and conflicting ro and missions are not unknown in many governmental organizations but such dupli cation is viewed with great concern when it affects agencies with power to arrest and charge individuals or to affect the security of the country congress may expl ore the ramifications of bringing the two communities closer together most observers believe that even if statutes and policies encourage closer cooperation between inte lligence and law enforcement agencies

august new yorker october 12 1998 p 35bureaucratic obstacles to be overcome within the intelligence community there has been tendency to retain information within agencies or to establish special compartments to restrict dissemination for security reasons similar tendencies exist among law enforcement agencies that guard information necessary for their particular prosecutions some observers suggest that channels for transferring information must be clearly established and that clos encouragement and oversight by both the executive branch and congressional committees would be required to ensure smooth functioning of tr ansfer arrangements key issue is the overall direction of th effort as has been noted the only person with responsibility for the directi on of both intelligence and law enforcement efforts is the president the bush ad ministration like its recent predecessors has instituted arrangements by which the justice department is included in the deliberations of the nati onal security council nsc36 there are few complaints that such arrangements do not work effectively at present but there were situations during the clinton administration when it was believed that fbi director louis freeh did not share important informa tion with the nsc and the white house37 law enforcement may require that some information be closely held and not shared outside the justice department but if law enforcement and intelligence efforts are to work more closely in dealing with international terrorist threats procedures will have to be in place to ensure that important information is shared such arrangements would arguably require close monitoring by the president himself but that could prove burden upon his time significant issue for congress is how to budget and conduct oversight of intelligence and law enforcement efforts engage d in counterterrorist efforts the fact that intelligence and law enforcement agencies are in separate functional categories for budgeting purposes has contributed in th view of some observers to different resource environments and indirectly to the acquisition of incompatible information technologies in general they argue that for many year s the budgets of law enforcement agencies have faced significan tly tighter constraints than have those of intelligence agencies in particular s ophisticated information technology it systems have been acquired by intelligence agencies that while expensive have absorbed only small percentage of annua l national defense sp ending acquisition of the similar levels of it capabilities by the fbi and other law enforcement agencies was not feasible since much higher percen tages of administration of justice spending would have been needed hence seamless system encompassing all echelons of intelligence and law enforcement agencies for storing and exchanging information in real time on potential terrorist threats has yet to be developed observers believe that any effort to enhance intelligence and law enforcement it resources across agencies boundaries w ill require determination by both thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31292crs16 38 section 311 of the intelligence

in budget submissions along with totals for counterproliferation c ounternarcotics and counterintelligenceexecutive and legislative branches since the budgeting process is shared responsibility the office of management and budget omb forwards to congress each year proposed budget broken down into functional categories with most intelligence agencies falling into the nati onal defense 050 category and the fbi and other law enforcement agencies bein g in the administration of justice 750 category when congress passes the annual budget resolution funding levels for the various functional categories are allocated to separate appropriations subcommittees in process known as the 302b allocations this process can create procedural hurdles to the shifting of funds from one f unctional category to another therefore both branches may review the need to ma ke coordinated inte ragency examination of law enforcement and intelligen ce spending on counterterrorism38 intelligence agencies are overseen by the two select intelligence committees the appropriations committees the armed services committees and others that monitor intelligence efforts of various cabinet departments most observers believe that the intelligence community receives reasonably thorough oversight even if comparatively little is shared with th public intelligence committees are widely perceived as taking bipartisan approach to oversight despite widelyperceived need for greater centralized coordination of the community the fact that most of the nations intelligence effort is undertaken in the defense department complicates oversight law enforcement agencies receive oversight from the two judiciary committees and the appropriators but observers point out that the primary oversight of law enforcement agencies is provided by the courts in which success or failure is ultimately judged judiciary committees have often reflected strong differences over legal issues and nominations as result the nature and exte nt of congressional oversight for intelligence and law enforcement agencies are different nevertheless some observers believe that given the scope of law enforcement involvement in the counterterrorism ffort there may be need for greater congressional scrutiny of the overall intelligencelaw enforcement relationship the emphasis on homeland defense issues may l ead some to call for different forms of congressional oversight intelligence support to counterterrorist military operations the campaign against afghanbased terro rists and the iraq war of 2003 which was characterized as related to the war on terrorism graphically demonstrated the importance of changes in intelligence suppor t to military operations since the end of the cold war beginning with desert storm in 1991 us military operations have increasingly depended on precision guided munitions pgms to hit targets while minimizing losses of civilian lives preci sion attacks in turn depend upon

concepts part of the larger effort to transform the nations defense strategy and force structure have proven useful in operations conducted against rrorist organizations where the focus is on attacking small groups or facilities nd avoiding widescale st rikes on population centers the growing dependence of us military forces on precise and realtime intelligence support requires significant i nvestment by the intelligence community as well as new organizational arrang ements although satellite imagery is undoubtedly useful especially in locating fi xed installations much of the tactical intelligence used in military campaigns against terrorist units is provided by manned aircraft such as the u2s and uavs such as the predator and the longrange high altitude global hawk the linkage of such platforms to platforms armed with pgms contributed significantly to allied succe ss in the persian gulf war of 1991 and to operation allied force in kosovo in 199939 the iraq war of 2003 and the afghan campaign of 20012002 have once again grap hically demonstrated their value in operations against terrorist targets although the value of such intelligence collection platforms is almost universally recognized the num bers available to dod are limited40 as recently as mid2000 dod was considering decommissioning u2s in order to make additional funding available for future global hawk procurement41 secretary of defense donald rumsfeld noted in his national defense university speech on january 31 2002 the experience in afghanistan showed the effectiveness of unmanned aircraft but it also revealed how few of them we have and what their weaknesses are he stated that the defense department plans to add more of what in the pentagon are called low densityhigh dema nd assets euphemism

and geopolitical analyses for national policymaking congress has acknowledged the need fo r better displays of data tied to geographical reference points on computer links that w ould be available to all military echelons and civilian policymakers the displays would incorporate information from all intelligence disciplines including humint and open source materials and would be made available in

together effectively ties between intelligence nd armed servi ces committees ar historically close but observers may sugge st new oversight structureshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31292conclusion effective counterterrorism political diplomatic and litary requires good intelligence but counterterrorism inte lligence differs in many ways from the intelligence support that was needed during the cold war and for which the intelligence community remains in large measure organized significant challenges lie in the area of humint collection where practices that might produce much valuable information could be expensive and involve the united states in activities that if revealed could be highly cont roversial at home and abroad intelligence and law enforcement are becoming increasingly intertwined few doubt that valuable insights can derive from close correlation of information from differing intelligence and law enforcemen t sources should the two communities draw too close together however there ar wellfounded concerns that either the us law enforcement effort would become increasingly inclined to incorporate intelligence sources and methods to the detr iment of longstanding legal principles and constitutional rights or lternately that intelligence gathering in this country or abroad would increasingly be hamstrung by regulations and pro cedural requirements to the detriment of the national security difficult decisions will have to be made some affecting organizationa l responsibilities and fine lines will have to drawn observers believe that the campaign to counter terrorism w ill tend to reinforce the perceived need to transform the us defense structure to take full advantage of information technologies and precision mun itions counterterrorist missions may not dictate the procurement of platforms but they are likely to have an important influence on the intelligence collection communications and information links at the same time observers caution that the current war on terrorism which has accentuated the need for law enforcement and inte lligence cooperation may not despite administration projections be decadeslong endeavor they argue that even as qaeda and other terrorist orga nizations are being dealt with traditional geopolitical concerns remain given the nature of organizational dynamics they suggest it may be difficult to maintain adequate expertise on international military and geopolitical issues that will remain of vital concern in the future terrorist threats have become central concern for the us intelligence community but the rest of the world has not disappeared fro m policymakers horizons as secretary of defense rumsfeld stated in his national defense university speech we cannot and must not make the mistake of assuming that terrorism is the only threat the next threat we face may indeed be against terrorists but it could also be cyberwar traditional stateonstate war or something entirely different
