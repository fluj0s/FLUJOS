nations nations unies office of internal oversight services internal audit division ii audit of unov security and safety management ae200532102 executive summary in september 2005 oios conducted an audit of the u nited nations office at vienna security and safety management the audit covered activities with expenditure of approximately 32 million for the biennium 20042005 out of which th cost attributable to united nations was approximately 8 million overall unov security an d safety section unov sss had adequate arrangements in place to provide security services in compliance with its mission the representatives from iaea unido and ctbto expr essed their satisfaction with the security services provided by unov sss however ios noted number of areas in which arrangements could be improved to provide more effi cient and effective security services security management system the designated official do has not established country level security management team smt for austria and the crisis management fo r unov and all other organizations in vienna international centre vic was incomplete whilst the security advisory group appeared to be similar to the smt there were disti nct differences in these two bodies particularly in the roles and decisionmaking power s of the do initiatives to strengthen and unify the security ma nagement system there had been little change in the security manage ment at unov after the establishment of the department of safety and security dss dss had not established common security policies and the reporting lines for the do and the chief of security required further clarification under hmoss requirements unov proposed to relocat the commissary from the vic unov is unable to implement this proposal without t he agreement of other international organizations in vic furthermore unov has been successful so far in implementing some mitigating measures identified to reduce the r isks associated with the commissary in vic this issue had remained unresolved at the time of the audit the expected completion date for the hmoss project s had been continuously revised from the initial date of december 2004 to june 2006 and the implementation rate for h moss projects was only 28 percent in august 2005 t he main reasons for this were the somewhat slow reaction of the austrian authorities the lack of continuity in the leadership at unov sss during the past two years the coordin ation challenges among the many parties involved in the implementation of the proje cts and the overestimation of costs in the approved budget organizational structure unov sss planned to change its organizational struc ture following the significant increase in the number of staffing from 90 to 155 the new structure however was based on existing operational requirements and considerat ion was not given to the new security posting requirements as stated in the hmoss such as the establishment of layered security perimeters within the vic human resource management security officers that worked on official united na tions holidays were not paid overtime they were merely given credits for timeoff at sing rate unov sss did not establish training directives and policies there was assurance that training opportunities for security officers were dequate physical assessment trainings were conducted and therefore assuranc could be taken that all security officers were physically fit to perform their dutie s moreover the security officers at unov did not undergo periodical testing for use of illegal drugs andor controlled substances provision of security and safety services there was consolidated policy that governed the condition of access to vic data input controls to ensure information integrity in the pas s system were inadequate out of total of 16500 ground passes in circulation 4909 groun d passes had expiry dates and 539 ground passes had an expiration period beyond the r ecommended period of five years unov had approved procedures to govern the condu ct of security investigations whilst three of the six security officers responsib for security investigations have some prior experience as police officers none of them r eceived any formal investigation training after they joined the united nations the 610 fire wardens in vic did not receive any pra ctical training in first aid skills or basic fire fighting knowledge due to lack of equi pment asset management and weapons control unov sss needed to improve its weapons control dur ing surprise count oios found four cases of firearms being issued without the req uired weapons permit in addition unov had not taken any steps to ensure that the 23 firearms issued to security officers on missions during the last five years are still in custody unov sss did not maintain records to monitor the qu antity of ammunitions on hand logs were maintained to account for the use of t he sensitive surveillance equipment and there was lack segregation of

etarygeneral sg through the united nations security coordinator now the under secret arygeneral for the department of safety and security for ensuring the security and safety of united nations personnel the do for austria is the ddg of unov following the statement by the sg in his report of october 2004 1 that the directorsgeneral or executive secretaries will serve as designated officials working in close cooperation with their chiefs of administration dss proposed the director general dg of unov to be appointed as the do for austria as there are three dgs and one executive secretary heading the organizations at the vic the dg of unov agreed to be the do and requested that his appointment be made i n consultation with other dgs and of the vbos and that dss provide him with the necessar training at the time of the audit dss had not yet acted on the dgs requests and therefor the ddg remained the do for austria 1 paragraph 59 pf the report of the secretary gener a59365 3 11 the do stated that he did not receive any train ing either from unsecoord or dss oios noted the same condition occurring in geneva nd the hague duty stations where the dos were not provided with any form of training th do for austria did not appoint an alternate do in hisher absence and had not formed country security management team smt as required under the security operations manual however he initiated the crisis management plan and participated in the formation f security advisory group dss stated that with the assistance from the chiefs of securi ty dss is in the process of identifying training dates for the dos envisioned to be in ear ly 2006 b security management team 12 the consultative committee on common services i n vienna cccs 2 of which the do is also member established the security advisory group sag subsidiary body focusing on security issues in vic in january 2004 whilst the sag may appear to be similar to smt there are distinct differences between these two bo dies as summarized below table 2 differences between smt and sag smt sag smt members consist of the do the deputy or alternate do heads of agencies as determined by t he do security advisor medical officer and an internationally recruited staff member familiar wit h local conditions andor the local language and staff mber with legal background 3 sag members consist of the do and representative of each vbos nominated by each organization and the chief of security as an exofficio member to advise and assist the do in country wide securit management to advise and give recommendation to cccs on securi ty management issues within vic chaired by the designated official chairmanship on an annual rotating basis the representative from ctbto was the chairman in 2005 decision making powers lies with do decision making powers lies with cccs 13 in the absence of smt the sag provides for um to discuss security issues with the stakeholders and plays an important role in monitor ing the implementation of hmoss security enhancements projects the do agreed with oios that the sag is not subst itute for smt and therefore undertook to establish it dss agree d to this in december 2005 c cooperation with host country government 14 unov maintained good relationship with its ho st country austria and reported that the austrian authorities were cooperative and responde d swiftly to requests for the reinforcement of policing outside vic as well as at the residences of the four vienna based usgs as and when required the sharing of intellige nce and joint trainings however the austrian authorities had been less forthcoming in i mplementing vbos requests in conjunction with security strengthening projects under hmoss these included requests for traffic diversion closing of public roads and public car park adjacent to the vic and moving further away the bus terminal which is near the vic 2 cccs is joint consultative machinery that overs ees the management and administration of common ser vices in vic 3 ideal composition of smt as stated in the united nations security operations manual 4 d crisis management plan 15 unov sss had prepared crisis management plan which as of the date of audit only for unov with involvement of other vbos oios fo und the plan incomplete alternate members were not included for the vienna crisis ope rations group vcog and the location where vcog would direct crisis management operation s had not been identified in the event that the vic cannot be used recommendation head2right unov s designated official should with the assist ance of the chief of security and the security advisory group appoint r epresentatives from the various agencies in vic to be members of vienna cri sis operations group and with the cooperation of the host country iden tify the location to direct crisis management operations in the event that the vic cannot be used rec 01 16 unov accepted the recommendation and will implement it by july 2006 oios will consider the recommendation implemented when it rec eives copy of the complete and updated crisis management plan b mandate 17 the stsgb20005 on the organization of the ited nations office at vienna stated that the division for management unov is responsib to provide security and safety services to users property and buildings in vic this state ment remains valid even after the establishment of dss in january 2005 as the sg stat ed in his report 4 that dss is to provide common security policies and standards and day to day decision making on matters of security will remain decentralised security decisi ons regarding secretariat personnel in geneva and vienna will be made by the directorsgen eral with the advice of the chief of security and safety at the duty station c initiatives to strengthen and unify the security management system establishment of dss 18 general assembly resolution 59276 requested th creation of dss in january 2005 to strengthen and unify the united nations security m anagement system sms the sgs report of 11 october 2004 outlined the role of dss and rep orting lines of the uns sms in july 2005 dss issued guidelines on the reporting and ac countability structure for offices away from headquarters oahs as well as for the regiona l commissions the status at unov as of september 2005 following these changes is summari zed in the table below 4 paragraph 37 of sg report dated 11 october 2004 a59365 5 table 3 sg report of october 2004 5 dss guidelines issued in july 2005 status at unov as of september 2005 the sg report did not state the reporting lines for the chief of security and safety section the chief of security and safety is responsible for the day to day operations and reports to the dg or the executive secretary unless otherwise specified the first reporting officer for the chief of security was the ddg of unov dss is to provide common security policies and standards to enable the united nations to make quantum leap in the quality and scope of its arrangement paragraph 45 of sgs report the director division of headquarters security and safety services in dss provides overall policy direction and technical support to chiefs of security and safety at oahs she monitors implementation and acts as alternate first reporting officer for chief of security dss had not established common security policies and standards the chief of security did not have an alternate first reporting officer the do will report to the directorate of security on security related matters regarding all civilian personnel in the country and any disagreement would be brought to the attention of the sg who would make the final decision and paragraph 39 of sgs report the dg at offices at geneva nairobi and vienna and the executive secretaries of the four regional commissions and the usgdss are directly and jointly accountable to the sg for security arrangements in cases where the executive head of the headquarters is concurrently appointed as the do the above reporting line and specific responsibility for the headquarters staff and officers remain unaffected dss had not implemented its proposal for the dg of unov to be do for austria the reporting lines for the do and dg of unov on security related matters remain unchanged the directorate of security will designate senior security officer as country security adviser the country security adviser will report directly to the do and through the do to the directorate of security this will unify all country security programmes under single individual providing unity of command and clarity of accountability paragraph 40 of sgs report the chief of security and safety may also serve as the chief security advisor to the do in this dual function the chief of security and safetychief security adviser will report to the director of headquarters security and safety services and to the director of regional operations in the dss as appropriate in cases where the chief of security is not the chief security advisor for the country specific guidance will be provided to clarify reporting lines at the duty station the do has recommended to dss to appoint the chief unov sss as the chief security adviser for austria however dss has neither confirmed nor rejected this proposal thus there was chief security advisor for austria at the time of audit 19 as indicated above the dss guidelines suggest ed that the chief of security had to report to number of persons they included the dg of v the do since the do for austria is not the dg of unov the director division of head quarters security and safety services in dss and possibly the director of regional operation s in dss if the chief of security is appointed as the chief security adviser for austria there were too many persons that the chief of security had to report and could limit his ability to respond as needed resulting in lack of unity of command and clarity in respect of accountability unov stated that dss did not respond in timely and authoritative manner on their requests for guidance 5 report of secretary general strengthened and ified security management system for the united nat ions a59365 6 recommendation head2right department of safety and security should to provide timely comprehensive and authoritative guidance to unov security and safety section b settle the determination as to who is the desig nated official and chief security adviser for austria and c limit the number of persons to whom the chief f security reports to rec 02 20 dss sought clarification on instances where request s for guidance were not met in timely fashion and stated that the designation of t he do and the chief security advisor are forthcoming with regards to recommendation 2c t his matter will be made clearer in the finalized reporting guidelines oios will record the recommendation as implemented when we receive confirmation from unov that dss had respond ed timely to requests for guidance notification of the designation of the do and chief security adviser as well as copy of reporting guidelines from dss limiting the number f persons to whom chief of security reports to 21 overall oios was of the opinion that there d been little change in security management at unov after the establishment of dss the major changes at unov were mainly derived from the implementation of security strengthening projects in conjunction with hmoss b enhanced hmoss 22 unov sss received supplementary budget of 16 million to strengthen security arrangements in vic following the upgrade of hmos s in 2004 these amounts were funded by the four vbos according to the agreed costshari ng ratios as shown in chart 1 above 23 in 2004 sag contracted through unido an exte rnal securityconsulting firm to assess as to whether there were any omissions in unovs pr oposal in their response to hmoss as well as the relevance of unovs planned projects members of sag and the chief of security reviewed the report and concluded that it largely validated their own analysis and subsequently made little changes to the hmoss plan sag maintai ned that the report was very useful as it provided sound basis for discussions with the aus trian authorities in particular urging them to take quick action to cooperate with unov in imp lementing hmoss projects the suggestions and comments in the report that were t included in the hmoss proposals are summarized in annex 1 of this report the reasons f or not implementing these aspects of the h moss were not documented 24 the most controversial issue among the vbos in implementing hmoss appears to be unovs proposal to relocate the commissary that is considered not essential to business from the vic unov sss was concerned that the heavy traffic customers and delivery vehicles and the large number of nonvbo staff mem bers that received access rights to vic including opec and osce personnel present security risks the other vbos including the iaea who is managing the commissary disagreed wit h the proposal the iaea commissary advisory committee expressed its concern that the r elocation of the commissary may create second soft target unless it was protected in th same degree as the vic the sag explored 7 measures to mitigate the threats including recommen dations made by the external security consulting firm to have loadingunloading site fo r commercial deliveries outside vic however the negotiations with the austrian authori ties to provide site near vic were unsuccessful agreement had been reached as yet among the vbos on the relocation of the commissary and unov faced difficulties in implement ing the identified mitigating measures recommendation head2right the designated official for austria needs to assess the residual risks resulting from the onsite commissary and report to the secretarygeneral through the department of safety and security if t he residual risks would significantly jeopardize the safety and security of united nations personnel at vienna international centre the justifications for any other noncompliance of hmoss should also be clearly documented rec 03 25 unov accepted the recommendation and will implement it by july 2006 oios will record the recommendation as implemented when the d esignated official completed the risk assessment and residual risks are communicated and accepted by all stakeholders c security strengthening projects 26 the expected completion date for the hmoss pro jects had been continuously revised from the initial date of december 2004 to june 2006 and the implementation rate for hmoss projects was only 28 percent 6 as of august 2005 27 whilst the implementation of hmoss projects to taling 36 million or 23 percent of the approved supplementary budget only 1 percent imple mentation rate as of 31 august 2005 might have been dependent on cooperation with the austrian authorities the implementation of the remaining 77 percent of projects was within the control of unov sss other sections in unov and the three vbos 28 other reasons that may have contributed to the low implementation rate are the lack of continuity in leadership at unov sss with three chief of security in the last two years b coordination challenges among the parties invol ved ie unov sss general support section information and technology service human resource management service and unidos building management services and c overestimation of costs in the approved budget 29 unov had taken some measures to address the abo ve factors since january 2005 the leadership of unov sss appeared to be stabilized wi th the appointment of new chief of security in august 2005 the chief of security app ointed consultant for period of six months to assist him in the coordination and proje ct management of hmoss related projects at vic however the progress report used for moni toring purposes did not accurately state the parties involved and did not clearly indicate the p arty responsible to take action as the projects progressed oios is not making any recommendation b ecause unov subsequently took the 6 as per hmoss progress report of 31 august 2005 p repared jointly by unov sss sag and unov budget section 8 necessary action to update the hmoss progress repo rt on monthly basis and reports now indicate the party responsible to take action as we ll as the date from which the task had been outstanding d organizational structure and shift management unov sss organizational structure 30 unov sss planned staffing was increased from 90 to 155 as per the approved supplementary budget to ensure compliance with hmo ss subsequently the chief of security in his review of the sections structure endeavoured to streamline the reporting lines after referring to the organizational structure of other oahs and regional commissions the chief also solicited views and comments from securi ty supervisors and security officers the new organizational structure proposed an increase in the number by two g7 security i nspectors four g6 security lieutenants and ten g5 security sergeants b dedicated unit for provision of security serv ices for conferences known as the conference squad with 10 security officers and c counter surveillance emergency response team with 14 security officers 31 whilst oios concurs with the chief of security that the existing organizational structure had to be reviewed the proposed structure did not take the new hmoss requirements changes in vic infrastructure and recommendations i n the external security consultant report into account 32 unov sss should reassess its operational requi rements taking into consideration the location of security posts duration of security co verage and number of security officers required in these locations as well as reconsider the rationale of maintaining some of the existing operational requirements that are detailed in annex 2 of this report oios estimated that unov could achieve savings as much as 250000 per biennium 7 from such an exercise b shift management 33 the new organizational structure maintains the existing pattern of shift management ie combination of eighthour shifts and twelvehours s hift the dutyshifts system for security officers varied for duty stations there was howev er trend with duty stations in europe such as icty and unog having eighthour shifts whilst d uty stations in africa such as unon and ictr are on twelve hours shifts oios was of the pinion that restructuring of the section presented good opportunity to reevaluate the adv antages and disadvantages of the shift system taking into account its impact from healt h perspective alertness of the staff to perform security functions staff welfare as well as financial implications to the organization such as overtime and night differentials 7 please refer to annex 2 for computational details 9 recommendation head2right unov security and safety section should reassess i ts operational requirements taking into account the headquarters minimum security standards and its shift system and adjust its stru cture and deployment of security officers accordingly and consistent with i ts requirements and environment rec 04 34 unov accepted the recommendation and will implement the recommendation by july 2006 unov is in the process of reassessing the op erational requirements and restructuring the section accordingly which include introducing steady eighthour shifts oios will consider the recommendation implemented upon receiv ing the results of unov sss re organization exercise that adequately considered th operational requirements in accordance with hmoss human resource management job descriptions 35 job descriptions of security officers were inc omplete and mostly outdated oios made recommendation because unov took action and was in the process of updating it at the time of the audit b medical testing for security officers 36 security officers had undergone psychological t esting prior to the release of firearms to them however there was periodical testing on t he use of illegal drugs and controlled substances as practiced at headquarters as requi red by stai20032 recommendation head2right unov security and safety section should clarify wit h department of safety and security the requirements to conduct per iodical testing for the use of illegal drugs and controlled substances for its sec urity officers rec 05 37 unov accepted the recommendation and will implement it by july 2006 oios will consider the recommendation implemented upon receiv ing confirmation from unov sss that the periodical testing for use of illegal drugs and controlled substance is conducted for its security officers c overtime 38 the conditions governing the compensation for vertime work as per appendix b of the staff rules for vienna was not updated and only we re applicable for general service staff of unido unov however applied the provisions for it s staff paragraph 1b of the appendix b stated that work in excess of the basic work week performed af ter 2000 hours or before 0600 hours on scheduled work day on the sixth or seventh day of the work week or an official holiday is special overtime double rate oios noted that security officers working on official holidays as part of their normal tw elvehour shift duty were not paid overtime 10 they were merely given credits for time off at sing rate this is deviation from the practice in other duty stations where staff members worki ng on official holidays are compensated with overtime at double rate recommendation head2right unov should update appendix b to the staff rules an d provide appropriate compensation for overtime work performe d by security officers on united nations official holidays rec 06 39 unov disagreed with the recommendation it recogniz ed that there are differences between unov and other duty stations this does h owever not mean that unov general service staff are not appropriately compensated fo r overtime work and argued that appendix b had been agreed upon by all vbos and respective s taff councils its provisions are linked to number of other matters such as salary surveys an d overall conditions of service applicable to the duty station and for all staff in the genera l service category and not only for those serving in unov sss given that changing appendix b is not within the purview of unov unov requested that the recommendation be withdrawn 40 oios recognise that the revision of appendix b will require agreement from other vbos however the existing appendix b had not been updat ed since february 1977 with its contents only applicable for unidos staff if the existing appendix b is applicable to unov then the nonpayment of overtime to security officers workin g on official holidays is in contravention to paragraph 1b of appendix b ther efore unov should give consideration to the applicability of conditions in appendix b to ov staff if applicable it should be practiced and if not then revision is required oios will also contact ohrm for clarification d training 41 oios is pleased to note that unov sss had arran ged for security awareness training for all its security officers to refocus the attention of these officers to the presence of threats and their roles as security officers however oios fo und that unov sss has not established training directives and policies to ensure security officers receive relevant and adequate training to execute their functions 42 in the first nine months of 2005 and out of the 9826 training hours 766 hours were devoted to nonsecurity related courses though some basic security training had not been conducted except for security officers in the fire and safety platoon there had been physical trainings and fitness assessments for secu rity officers 43 there were also controls to ensure adequate training opportunities among security officers some received training hours that exceede d 160 hours while others received as little as 25 hours or none at all unov sss informed oios that dss is developing standard training programme for security offices however until such programme is finalized unov sss needs to identify and prioritize the type of training as well as determine the number of training days required for its security fficers to ensure security officers receive relevant training within operational constraints 11 recommendation head2right unov security and safety section should develop t raining policy indicating the type of training required and minimu m required training days for its security officers rec 07 44 unov accepted the recommendation and will implement it by july 2006 according to dss standard training programme is scheduled fo r july 2006 for systemwide implementation once completed unov sss training programme will be derived from it oios will record the recommendation as implemented when unov sss training policy and programme had been established f provision of security and safety services access control 45 there was single access policy for vic the unov security pass office issued ground passes to staff affiliates and interns base d on emails internal memorandums from vbos and nonvbos eg osce opec although the pass office has list of personnel who can request ground passes for staff but was d not updated regularly and therefore is outdated also the pass office did not maintain co pies of requests and other supporting documents 46 data input controls were inadequate to ensure d ata integrity in the unov badge system and conference system although there was user ac cess table the pass office assigned common user name to pool of shortterm camera ope rators whom were recruited during peak conference periods as result camera operators whom issued ground passes to conference participants could not be identified 47 oios reviewed the list of 16541 valid ground p asses in circulation and noted that 4909 were issued without expiry dates the pass office d id not use the facility available to verify the accuracy of information in the pass system oios id entified 539 cases in which ground passes had expiry dates beyond the staff members contract expiry dates and 56 ground passes had validity period beyond the recommended period of 5 years 48 oios noted that the security

the mandatory reporting by programme managers of allega tions of misconduct to oios investigation division should be considered all c ases of serious misconduct andor criminal behaviour should be conducted by oios 53 oios noted that there was inadequate mechanism to prevent unauthorized deleting of the electronic copies of these cases in the incident da tabase since unov sss has already taken

inves tigation division develop guidelines indicating the protocols for receiving c omplaints conducting investigations issuing reports and following up on reported complaints as well as recruitment and training of security investigati ve officers rec 09 13 54 unov accepted the recommendation and mentioned that within the new organizational structure of unov sss the special services platoon will be divided into two separate units one of which will consist of one sergeant and two s ecurity officers working solely on investigations unov sss has also requested oios in vestigation division id in vienna in july 2005 to provide an investigation course and w ith the oios ids assistance develop guidelines for investigations oios had not been ab to do so in 2005 due to the non availability of

wardens in the vic the training provided was limit ed to general introduction to evacuation procedures without any practical training on first aid skills andor basic fire fighting knowledge due to lack of training equipment recommendation head2right to ensure that fire wardens can effectively dischar ge their roles in cases of emergencies unov security and safety section sh ould provide fire wardens with basic fire fighting knowledge rec 1 0 56 unov accepted the recommendation and will implement it by july 2006 whilst unov sss had conducted theoretical training exercise wit h majority of staff unov sss is now in possession of special environmental non pollutant and user friendly noncarcinogenic fire fighting training device this equipment stimulates various types of fires such as computer monitor fires wastebasket fires practical trainin g for fire wardens has been included in the training plan for 2006 and all evacuation team memb ers fire wardens will be trained by end of

vienna based internatio nal organizations vbos 57 iaea unido and ctbto were satisfied with the s ecurity services that unsss provided although there were instances in which vb disagreed or questioned the effectiveness of some proposed security measures dertaken by unov sss they felt that their concerns and reservations had been properly d ealt with in the sag also all vbo representatives interviewed expressed their agreeme nt to the principle of not interfering with the daytoday operations of security management in vic since it is the mandate of unov 14 h asset management and weapons controls firearms and ammunitions 58 unov sss managed 1400 nonexpendable assets va lued at 12 million included were 188 firearms oios surprise count of weapons rev ealed the following the list of

sensitive surveillance equipment 59 the head of the special services platoon is the custodian as well as the user of the sensitive surveillance equipment such as secret lis tening devices logs were not maintained to account and monitor the use of the devices and ther was lack of segregation of duties between user and custodian recommendation head2right unov security and safety section should strengthen its weapons and ammunitions controls conduct surprise checks to im prove enforcement of established procedures introduce segregation of du ties between the user and custodian of sensitive surveillance equipment and m aintain logs to account and monitor the use of equipment rec 11 60 unov accepted the recommendation but mentioned tha t the lieutenant of the special services platoon will remain the custodian of the s ensitive surveillance equipment as is the case in ny and other oahs however following the r ecommendation unov will maintain logbook to account and monitor the use of the devic oios would like to clarify that maintaining logbook without any segregation of du ties between the user and the custodian is ineffective from an internal control viewpoint alt hough some oahs have the same control weakness in this area oios has made similar recomm endations to recently audited oahs oios will record the recommendation as implemented when the sopguidelines are updated to incorporate the improved weapon and ammunition cont rols 15 v further actions required on recommendations 61 oios monitors the implementation of its audit r ecommendations for reporting to the

members of the sag and cccs egbert c kaltenbach director internal audit division ii office of internal oversight services annex 1 external security consultings firm comments on uns ss response to hmoss requirements that were not included in the august 2005 hmoss pl an hmoss requirements external security consulting firms comments 1 the optimum security strategy shall be implemented through standard physical security measures that focus on rigorous layered perimeter security coupled with tight access control system the lack of security entrances to individual buildi ngs and links between buildings places greater emphasis n the effectiveness of the site perimeter security any f ailure in or breach of the perimeter security would allow an attacker free run in the vic unovs comments this danger is recognized strengthening of perimeter security especially veh icle screening and establishment of csertquick response team and mobile patrol plan along the security perimeter are the priorities 2 security services shall have exclusive control over all issuance of passes and shall ensure that conference participants contractors affiliates members of nongovernmental organizations media and other groups of people are screened in an appropriate manner commercial organization would not allow conferenc participants the uncontrolled access currently prov ided unovs comments conference members represent member states and are screened like staff members nd delegates 3 while still subject to security controls such facilities as reception pass and id offices commissaries and mail operations shall be located away from principal buildings and ideally outside the main security perimeter the mail including all hand screening should be m oved to the perimeter of the site from f365 as an alt ernative the mailrooms should be hardened against blast and chemical and biological contamination unovs comments this is recognized and remedial action will be taken 4 specific assessments of the security of executive floors shall be undertaken as well as of other higher risk occupational groups with view to implementation of targeted protective measures this should also apply to other areas where the sam executives could be known to be restaurant car p arking etc unovs comments this is recognized and remedial action will be taken 5 commercial deliveries shall take place offsite or by vehicles precleared for access to loading docks if the commissary is not relocated the following m easures should be considered off site deliveries and screening with deliveries t site by vehicles comprehensive screening of all deliveries at the si perimeter and strict scheduling of all deliveries coupled with security vetting of the supply chain unovs comments this is recognized and remedial action will be take n annex 2 examples of security postings that needs to be reco nsidered include but not limited to the following assignment of one security officer at the entrance of the commissary during its opening hours 1 both iaea and unov management representatives d explained that the need for security officer is primarily to ensure that only authorized personnel entitled to purchase tax free goods are allowed to enter the commissary oios is of the opi nion that this is not security section responsibility and can be performed by nonsecuri ty personnel furthermore the access to commissary is controlled by type of ground pass iss ued and the security officers on patrol can respond quickly to any security needs at the commis sary total cost of this

in year 2 it appears to oios that the opening of wig gate is mainly for the convenience of staff rather than an operational requirement furthermore unov sss had not obtained the consent from the austrian authorities to the armed post location at this gate which is outside the vic perimeter total cost of this post is estimated to be of working days in year x 7mths12mths x 2 5 hours per day x
