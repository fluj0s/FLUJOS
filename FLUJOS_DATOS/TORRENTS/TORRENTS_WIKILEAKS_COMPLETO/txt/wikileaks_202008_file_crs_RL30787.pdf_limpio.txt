manualparliamentary reference sources house of representatives introduction house procedures are not based solely on the rules that the chamber adopts at the outset of each new congress the founda tions of house par liamentary procedure also include constitutional mandates principles of parliamentary practice set forth in jeffersons manual provisions of law that have the force and effect of rules published precedents reflecting authoritative rulings and interpretations of the foregoing authorities and informal practices they also include committee rules memorandums of understanding be tween committees regarding committee jurisdiction and the rules of each partys caucus or conference this report identifies and describes documents published by the house or organs and offices thereof that provide an official record of these parliamentary authorities members usually cite these documents when raising point of order or defending against one they may be grouped into three classes the first comprises the texts of the chief authorities governin g parliamentary procedure in the house these authorities which are presented in the house manual1 with annotations by the parliamentar ian include the constitution jeffersons manual the adopted rules of the house and provisions of law that have the fo rce and effect of rules rule making statutes second group of official reference docum

the respective committees and compiled in each congress by the house committee on rules in print rules adopted by committees of the house of representatives memorandums of understanding often called letters of agreement between committees regarding committee jurisdiction floor procedure in the u s house of representatives from the house committee on rules how our laws are made from the office of the house parliamentarian and the rules of the democratic caucus and of the republicanconference adopted by the resp ective bodies and prepared by each for its own members this report begins by reviewing some principles of house procedure that condition the way in which these parliament ary reference sources can be used the body of the report describes the format of each parliamentary reference document and the content of the authorities it contains ma ny of the descriptions of printed sources also are illustrated with sample pages that show the format of the document and are annotated to indicate special features and component s although some of these illustrations do not reflect th most recent current ed ition of the document from which they are taken the format and other features they illustrate are retained in the current editions boxes following the description of each authority present information on how to locate it in various documentary sources both in printed form and through the internet in these access boxes the names of websites appear in bold type the appendices of the report summarize the information contained in the access boxes appendix furnishes citations for each printed reference document covered in this report and for related congre ssional research service crs products appendix b summarizes house parliamentary reference information available through the internet official guidance on house parliamentary procedure is available from the office of the house parliamentar ian 57373 crs staff 75700 also can assist in clarifying house rules and procedures principles of house parliamentary procedure the house applies the regulations set forth in its various parliamentary authorities in accordance with several princi ples that remain generally applicable across the entire range of procedural situ ations among these principles may be listed the following 1 house procedure is governed by multiple authorities not by chamber rules alone 2 the house has constitutional power to make its own rules of procedure 3 house rules are generally not selfenforcing 4 the house rarelyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30787crs3 2 titles ix of pl 93344 88 stat 298 as amended disregards its precedents and 5 the house adheres to many practices that have developed without being forma lly adopted each of these principles is discussed below house procedures are determined by multiple authorities although the rules of the house may be the most obvious authority governing house parliamentary procedure they are as the introductory discussion has already shown by means the only one the authorities by which the proceedings of the house are regulated are not mutually exclusive rather any concrete procedural situation is affected by the interaction among them as result the course taken by any proceedings in the chamber will pend on all the differe nt parliamentary authorities that may be pertinent to the specific circumstances constitutional rulemaking authority of the house article i of the constitution gives the hous the authority to determine its rules of procedure this constitutional rulem aking authority affects house procedure in two different ways first except in the case of matters prescribed by the constitution itself the house can determine for itself the substance of the rules that will govern its internal procedures the house exercises this rulemaking power at the beginning of each congress when it adopts the chambers rules including any amendments to or rules additional to those of the previous congress the house also uses its rulemaking pow er in this sense when it adopts special rules and when it enacts rulemaking statutes special rule defines specific procedure for considering an individual m easure on the floor rulemaking statute is law that includes provisions gove rning house procedures typically by prescribing rules for the consideration of class of measures specified by the act itself for example the congressional budget act of 19742 contains rulemaking provisions that among other things speci fy the content of the congressional budget resolution and set terms fo r its consideration special rules and rulemaking statutes have the same standing and effect as the rules of the house because they are both created through an exercise of the houses constitutional rulemaking authority when the house uses rule to set terms for considering measure it typically adopts the rule immediately pr eceding consideration of the measure in questi on when congress enacts law containing rulemaking provisions it typically includes in the statute declaration that the provisions are enacted as an exercise of the rulemaking authority of each house at the beginning of each congress also the house provides for the continued effectiveness of existing rulemaking statutes as part of the same action by which it adopts its general code of chamber rules further way in which the houses rulemaking authority affects its procedure is that the house can determine when its adopted code of rules including rule making statutes should not govern its ow n proceedings in practical terms thishttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30787crs4 3 when point of order is raised there are few situations when the chair does not make ruling for example the chair does not rule on the points of order established by the unfunded mandates reform act of 1995 pl 1044 109 stat 48 when member raises point of order against considerin g measure containing unfunded mandates the house votes on whether to consider the asure after 10 minutes of debate see crs general distribution memorandum unfunded mandates procedure in the house by richard s beth january 31 2000 vailable through the author 4 us congress house constituti on jeffersons manual and rules of the house of representatives of the united st ates one hundred tenth congress 109th cong 2nd sess hdoc 109157 compiled by john v sullivan parliamentarian washington gpo continuedprinciple allows the house by unanimous c onsent to take parliamentary actions that violate its adopted rules or by twothirds vote to suspend the rules for consideration of measure moreover by majority vote the house can adopt special rule waiving points of order th at members could nor mally raise under the rules of the house or under rulemaking statute house rules are generally not selfenforcing rules of the house as well as other authorities that have the force of chamber rules such as rulemaking statutes and special rules are normally enforced by members raising points of order point of order is claim stated by member from the floor that the house is violatin g or about to violate some house rule precedent or other procedural authority when point of order is raised the chair the speaker when in the house proper the chairman when in committee of the whole normally rules on its validity of ten providing an explanation of the parliamentary rationa behind the ruling3 if the chair sustains the point of order the house cannot proceed with the action the point of order assails as the next section describes the ruling of the chair in such cases normally stands as precedent of the house the chair may also enforce house ru and other sources of procedural authority by refusing to entertain proposed action that these authorities do not permit in some circumstances the chair might take the initiative to rule such an action out of order or to make an nnouncement to the house regarding proper procedure for example the chair ofte n reminds members of rules of decorum during debate in many circumstances however the chair does not take initiative to call to the chambers attention that violation of house rules is taking place under these conditions unless some member raises point of order the house can proceed in ways contrary to the requirements of its procedural authorities in addition points of order and rulings of the chair occur only on procedural questions raised pursuant to rules and precedents of the house the chair will not rule on point of order asserting violation of constitutional requirements for the chair has authority only over adopted rules and not over the constitution it is the practice of the house that the judgment of the chamber on constitutional matter is to be settled by the vote of the body on the substantive question with respect to which the constitutional question is raised4httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30787crs5 4 continued 2007 sec 628 hereafter cited as house manual similarly parliamentary ac tions undertaken on the basis of rules of party caucus or conference are not enforceable on the house floor and the same is often true of practices that have developed without being form ally adopted while party caucus and conference rules and practices that are informal in this sense form part of the basis of house procedure they ar not produced through an exercise of the chambers constitutional rulemaking authority and hence do not have the same standing as the rules of the house caucus or conference rules are created and enforced by one party and informal pr actices evolve over the years as custom finally rules of procedure adopted by each house committee generally cannot be enforced on the house floor though they can be enforced in the committee that adopts them the house rarely disr egards its precedents the published precedents of the house set forth how the chamber has interpreted and applied the chambers rules most precedents are formed when the chair rules on point of order deciding ither to sustain or overrule in principle any member could appeal ruling of the chair to the house itself which would then determine the question itself by majority vote this proceeding would constitute an exercise of the constitutional authority of the house over its own rules and the resulting determination of the house would also constitu precedent in practice however the house almost never entertains appeals of rulings of the chair and even when it does it seldom reverses the chair in fact the majority usually votes at once to lay any appeal on the table an action that has the effect of confirming the ruling of the chair precedents also can be created when the chair responds to parliamentary inquiry or when the house makes pro cedural decision by majority vote eg to adopt certain type of special rule precedents influence the manner in which current house rules are applied by relating past decisions to the specific case before the chamber in specific cases it may often be necessary to consult the published precedents for guidance on how each rule has been applied in this way the published precedents of the house function in practice both to complement and supplem ent the rules of the house precedents accordingly are analogous to case law in their effect just as attorneys in court will cite previous judicial decisions to support their argument s members will cite precedents of the house to support their poi nt of order or to defend against one similarly the chair will often support rulin g by citing the decisions of predecessors historically the house rarely disregards its precedents precedents do not carry equal weight those based on the chairs disposition of points of order or on decision of the house by majority vot have more weight than those based on the chairs response to parliamentary inquiries in addition more recent precedents generally receive greater weight than earlier ones and precedent that is part of an evolved pattern will have more weight than one that is isolated inhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30787crs6 its effect moreover all precedents must be evaluated in the historical context of the rules and practices at the time they were tablished because of the need to consider these various principles members needing to find precedents to support or rebut an argument might wish to seek the official advice of the parliamentarian of the house 57373 the house adheres to many informal practices some house procedural actions are undertaken on the basis of practices that have evolved over the years and become accepted custom without being formally adopted which can be called i nformal practices inasmu ch as practices that are informal in this sense ar not mandated by any authoritative statement they cannot in general be enforced on the house floor through point of order in practice however these informal practices are rarely challenged on the house floor many are described in documents that digest the practice of the house or compile its formal precedents contemporary examples of house procedures determined by these informal practices include 1 the speakers recognition of members for oneminute and special order speeches and 2 giving members of the committee or subcommittee reporting bill priority recognition for offering floor amendments the house manual and authorities it contains house manual the house manual compiles in one volume the text of all the principal parliamentary sources that have authoritative force in house proceedings accompanied by annotations by the parlia mentarian of the house that summarize precedents and practices pertinent to each provision the authorities included in the manual are the constitution of the united states portions of jeffersons manual of pa rliamentary practice the adopted rules of the house rulemaking statutes especially those governing the congressional budget process and those contai ning congressional disapproval provisions the formal title of this document is constitution jeffersons manual and rules of the house of representatives and it is usually spoken of simply as the house manual house rules manual or house rules and manual it also is often referred to as jeffersons manual in fact however as the preceding list shows this colloquial reference is misnomer for th procedural manual actually prepared by thomas jefferson constitutes only one element of the contents of the volume an edition of the house manual is published by the government printing office as an official numbered house document in each congress usually at some point during the first session the edition fo r each congress bears house document number from the preceding congress because the house typically authorizes ithttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30787crs7 during the preceding congress thus for example the manual for the 110th congress is designated hdoc 109157 subsequent sections in this part of th report discuss the veral parliamentary authorities incorporated in the house manual and identify other reference sources in which each is also found the remainder of the present section describes features of the manual that appear uniquely in this reference source these include single comprehensive index to all the authorities contained in the manual the annotations by the parliamentar ian of the house to the provisions of each authority summarizing pertinent precedents that bear on each provision and preface that presents summary of changes to house rulesadopted since the last congress organization and indexing the house manual is organized in numbered sections that run throughout the manual in single sequence often with gaps between the end of one section and the st art of the next these normally remain constant from edition to edition which f acilitates citation nd reference across editions for this reason citations to the manual are usually given not by page number but instead by section number manual section numbers are also listed at the top of each page as discussed below house rules were recodified in the 106 th congress in revised structure that re duced their number from 52 to 28 at that time as result section numbers nece ssarily changed in the portion of the manual devoted to those rules the extensive index of the house manual also provides citations by section number this index breaks major t opics into subheadings and under each subheading the topic of each provision cited is identified by descriptive specification citations under the subject heading civil ffices for example are identified by the following entries may be removed by impeachment and members not to be appointed to certain the index should be thoroughly examined in order to find all pertinent citations for example information on motions to suspend the rules is indexed under two subject headings rules suspension of and suspension of rules parliamentarians annotations annotations prepared by the parliamentarian of the house appear throughout the house manual these annotations often referred to as the par liamentarians notes typically follow the clause or other provision of procedural aut hority to which they apply they describe the history of the respective provision nd provide useful information about its contemporary application th ey explain current practice and briefly describe some of the most important precedents citations to important precedents are pr esented in parentheses throughout the annotations these citations refer the read er to various official publications setting forth precedents which are described later in this report citations appear in the following formats httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30787crs8 congre ssional record the date and except in the case of

pa rliamentarians nnotations has great practical value for several reasons first it allows the reader to see the relationship between the operation of specific clause s in the authority annotated and the precedents second because the di scussion is updated each time the house manual is published it references some important precedents that are not included in earlier compilations or digests of precedent last the citations provided in parentheses can be timesaving research tool for reader s seeking precedents related to specific clause of house rules or of the other parliamentary authorities

act of 1970 this requirement was incorporated into the rules of the house in 1971 see rules of the house of representatives in house manual sec 791procedural provisions of statute as already noted the constitutional gr ant to each chamber of congress of authority over its own rules permits the house to establish procedural regulations though simple resolutions which are adopt ed through action of the originating chamber alone in certain cases nevertheless the house institutes procedures through provisions included in statutory measures bills and joint resolutions which can become effective only through agreem ent between both houses and presentation to the president because these procedures are created through an exercise of each chambers constitutional rulemaking power they have the same standing as house and senate rules statute that contains rulemaki ng provisions in this sense usually also incorporates provision often entitled xercise of rulemaking power which asserts the rulemaking authority of each chamber by declaring that the pertinent provisions shall be considered as part of the rules of each house and are subject to being changed in the same manner as in the case of any other rule of such house that is for example by adopti on of simple resolution of the house10 the major legislative reorganization acts of recent decades exemplify rule making statutes for they include provisions with effects on procedures of the house generally most statutory rulemaking provisions however specify legislative procedures to be followed in the house and the senate in the consideration of specified matters some of these estab lish expedited procedur for congressional action on specified proposals from the executiv branch that the statute permits to take effect either only with congressi onal approval or only in the absence of congressional disapproval others principally deri ved from the congressional budget act and related statutes regulate the congressional budget process the house manual includes provisions from all three ki nds of rulemaking statute with annotations by th parliamentarian legislative reorganization acts the major legislative reorganization acts that contain provisions currently regula ting house procedure are the legislative reorganization act of 194611 and the legislative reorganization act of 197012 many of the provisions of these acts that established legisla tive procedures have since been incorporated into the rules of the house13 the parliamentarians annotations to the pertinent pr ovisions of house

contents appear ed under the heading congressional disapproval provisions cont ained in public laws this section of the manual sets forth over 50 excerpts from statutes that define special pro cedures for congress to follow in disapproving or approving sp ecified actions of the executive branch or independent agencies procedures of this kind typically establish expedited or fast track procedures to permit the house and the senate to enact joint resolution in disapproval or approva l of actions of the specified kinds these provisions of law are type of rulemaking statute because they create procedures that have the force and effect of rules of the h ouse senate or both through an exercise of the constitutional rulemaking power of the two chambers the house manual terms these privileged procedures inasmuch as they make the specified approval or disapproval measures privileged for consideration the manual seems to be the only readily available document to contain compilation of these various privileged procedures in some cases however the manual includes the rulemaking provisions that govern procedur in either the house or the senate in others only those provisions th at affect house procedure are given many of these statutes have been infrequently used and the parliamentarians annotations in this part of the manual are fewer than in other places the provisions included in the manual include some drawn from at least one statute that like those desc ribed in the next subsecti on regulates the congressional budget process namely the balanced b udget and emergency deficit control act of 198514 other wellknown examples incl ude sections 2903 2904 and 2908 of the defense base closure nd realignment act of 199015 which govern congressional consideration of recommenda

the ch ief purpose of this measure is to set congressional spending revenue and deficit targets for the fiscal year and to allocate spending budget authority and outlays subject to those targets among budgetary functional categories in recent years however budget resolutions have often included supplementary procedural regula tions to govern subsequent action on spending bills or other budgetrelated measures httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30787crs21 21 sconres 21 110th cong sec 206bthe budget resolution is concurrent reso lution which is form of measure that becomes effective upon agreement between the two houses procedural provisions in budget resolutions accordingly resemble rulemaking provisions of statute in that they operate with the same force as pro cedural rules of the respective houses even though they are established through pro cess that involves the concurrence of bodies other than the respective houses like stat utes that contain rulemaking provisions therefore budget resolutions that contain procedural provisions typically also include language asserting these provi sions to be adopted as an exercise of the constitutional authority of each house over its own rules and in recognition of the right of each house subsequently to alter them throug h its own internal procedures these provisions are accordingly considered in th is section of the report even though they are not compiled in the house manual some procedural provisions in budget resolutions have been made applicable only for the coming years budgetary action but others have been established as permanent procedures and are subsequently altered or abolis hed only by further action in subsequent budget resolution procedural provisions in budget resolutions have most often concerned procedure in the senate nd have often appeared in budget resolutions as result of action by the senate some of them nevertheless have had bicameral applica tion neither these procedur provisions as whole nor only those applicable in the house however are comprehensively compiled in any single source instead they may best be identified by examining the texts of adopted congressional budget resolutions for successive years many of these procedural provisions institute new points of order that like those established by the budget act itself ar available against budgetary measures or

the principles presented by that precedents that follow individual precedents are presented in numbered subsections and accordingly may be cited by chapter and number for example deschlers precedents chapter 20 section 311 these subsections typically are h eaded by catchline identifying the subject of the precedent followed by headnote in bold type stating the principle established or illustrated after which the proceedings that constitute the precedent are set forth the proceedings are often introduced w ith sentence or two followed in many instances by the full text of the procedur exchange that established the precedent with citation to the congressional record if the same proceedings illustrate more than one principle each principle will be set forth as headnote in its own subsection with the same or partially the same pro ceedings set forth under each some precedents are followed by parliamentarians note that clarifies or amplifies the principle established by the precedent or directs the reader to other parliamentary reference sources while consolidated index covering all volumes of deschlers precedents has yet appeared each chapter is headed by an index to precedents contained in that chapter this index directs readers to the relevant section number for each precedent in addition the chapters of deschlers precedents correspond to those of procedure in the house

precedents includes chapter on the discharge rule which did not exist during the period covered by hinds precedents the content of each series is presen ted in sections that are numbered sequentially throughout each respective series individual sections are usually cited by volume series and number eg iv hinds 4823 or vii cannon 1530 although the house manual cites them by volume and number alone

however present individual precedents each such section describes the procedural exchange constituting the precedent usually quoting the ruling of th chair and often other portions of the proceedings and provides citations to the congressional record other sources may also be cited such as house rules house committee reports and especially in hinds precedents the house journal and predecessors of the record most sections carry headnote in bold type stating the principle discussed or illustrated where several consecutive sections all illustrate the same principle however the headnote appears only for the first section in the group conversely and in contrast to deschlers precedents proceedings that illustrate more than one principle are typically set forth in only one section but with multiple headnotes sections that provide general discussi on or background bearing on more than one principle may also carry mo re than one headnote information about specific pr ocedural topics can be located using the detailed table of contents in each volume in ddition the comprehensive index to both series volumes 911 is arranged by topic and broad topics are broken down into numbered

vol 141 january 30 1995 p h849memorandums of understanding regarding committee jurisdiction standing committees often devel op memorandums of understanding sometimes referred to as letters of agreement that set forth an agreement between committees about how jurisdiction over specifi c policy issues will be divided these memorandums which are usually prepared at the beginning of new congress are addressed to the speaker of the house in the form of letter from the chairmen of the committees involve d in effect memorandum of understanding advises the speaker on the referral of measures addressing specified policy issues when the jurisdictional mandate of committees may be unclear or overlap house rules empower the speaker to refer legislation to committees and the parliamentarian of the house acts as the agent of the speaker in the performance of this function referral decisions are based principally on the statements of jurisdiction of each standing committee set forth in house rule x and on relevant precedents34 additionally however the speaker and the house parliamentarian will in practice honor memorandums of unde rstanding in deciding the referral of legislation these memorandums of unde rstanding are therefore an important parliamentary reference source for questi ons about jurisdiction over specific policy issues some memorandums of unde rstanding are inserted in the congressional record especially at the start of new c ongress others however are not made available publicly and compila tion of them or digest of their effects is published it could be argued that memorandum s of understanding have increased in importance as result of rules changes adopted by the house in the 104th congress 19951996 one of these eliminated joint referrals and provided instead that the speaker designate committee of primary jurisdiction when referring measures to more than one committee35 this change made it important which committee is designated the primary committee at the time of referral hence memorandums of understanding developed in the 104th congress and since have sometimes specified which committees should have primary ju risdiction over par ticular issues another rules change in the 104th congress abolished three standing committees and transferred their jurisdiction to other standing committees some of the committees that received new jurisdiction developed memorandums of understanding about jurisdiction over the issues in ques tion reprinted belo w is memorandum of understanding from the 104th congress between the committees on national security and transportation and infrastructure whic h exemplifies this form of agreement36httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30787crs40 congressional record house january 30 1995 memorandum of understanding the speaker pro tempore under previous order of the house the gentleman from pennsylvania mr shuster is recognized for 5 minutes mr shuster mr speaker i submit for members attention the following letter from myself and the chairman of the committee on national security mr spence regarding jurisdiction congress of the united states house of representatives washington dc january 4 1995 hon newt gingrich speaker house of representatives washington dc dear mr speaker as chairman of the committee on transportation and infrastructure and the committee on national security we wanted to advise you of our mutual agreement concerning the division of jurisdiction over the merchant marine due to the dissolution of the committee on merchant marine and fisheries rule x clause 1k of the rules of the house for the 104th congress provides jurisdiction to the committee on national security over 7 national security aspects of merchant marine including financial assistance for the construction and operation of vessels the maintenance of the us shipbuilding and ship repair industrial base cabotage cargo preference and merchant marine officers and seamen as these matters relate to the national security the new rule x clause 1q provides the committee on transportation and infrastructure with jurisdiction over 12 measures relating to merchant marine except for national security aspects of merchant marine this split in jurisdiction in what was previously entirely within the committee on merchant marine and fisheries is based on the fact that while various aspects of the merchant marine and related activities are transportation matters th at are handled in the executive branch by the department of transportation certain aspects are so closely tied to national security that primary jurisdiction should be within the committee on national security for example the maintenance and control of the national defense reserve fleet and the ready reserve fleet would be within the jurisdiction of the committee on national security however it may not be clear in all cases to which of the two committees particular bill should be referred in general matters relating to merchant marine activities will be referred to the national security committee if the national security aspects of the matterpredominate over transportation and other merchant marine aspects while present programs of the maritime administration have both national security and transportation implications we agree that primary jurisdiction over the annual authorization for the maritime administration would be in the committee on national security primary jurisdiction over the annual authorization for the federal maritime commission would be in the committee on transportation and infrastructure shipbuilding is subject that has particularly strong connection with national security because of the implications for our defense industrial base we agree that the national shipbuilding initiative including the loan guarantee program under title xi would be within the primary jurisdiction of the committee on national security in addition the congress likely will be requested to approve legislation to implement an international agreement to eliminate shipbuilding subsidies worldwide while this is generally laudable goal the contents of this agreement must be examined in the context of its longterm effect on the shipbuilding industrial base of particular concern is the question of whether us based shipyards are disadvantaged by this agreement to the point that transition from naval construction to commercial construction is impossible we agree that as between the committees on national security and transportation and infrastructure primary jurisdiction over implementing legislation for this agreement should reside with the committee on national security jurisdiction over the state and federal maritime training academies is granted in the rule specifically to the committee on national security with respect to the provision in rule x clause 1k9 concerning merchant marine officers andseamen it is understood that measures whose predominant purpose is the maintenance of well trained merchant mariner manpower pool capable of meeting sustainment and surge sealift requirements will be within the jurisdiction of the committee on national security shortages of qualified us mariners to serve during the mobilization for desert storm highlighted the need to consider these problems from national security standpoint jurisdiction over the coast guard is provided to the committee on transportation and infrastructure by rule x clause 1q1 this confers upon the transportation and infrastructure committee authority over all matters handled by the coast guard that were previously within the jurisdiction of the merchant marine and fisheries committeethis letter may not address all merchant marine issues that will come before you we will continue to work with you toward resolution of other issues as they arise finally it is understood that this agreement does not in any way alter or limit the jurisdiction of the committee on transportation and infrastructure or of the committee on national security over matters discussed herein which were properly within the respective committees jurisdiction prior to the dissolution of the committee on merchant marine and fisheries sincerely floyd d spence chairman committee on national security bud shuster chairman committee on transportation and

publicly available form either in print or on the internet rules of internal organizations of the house the chief institutional elements that make up the internal structure of the house of representatives are the committees and the party conferences known in the case of the democratic party as the caucus the committees especially the standing committees established by house rules are chiefly responsible for developing the substance of legislative proposals and one of the chief functions of the party conferences is to assign their respective members to leadership and committee roles each committee and each conference has deve loped its own rules which in the modern practice are written and adopted by each individual group although these rules of the individual groups are not per binding on the house as whole their provisions often have effects on the way proceedings in the house occur and to that extent they must be considered as among the procedural authorities by which the house is regulated committee rules of procedure many provisions of house rules especi ally those of house rule xi regulate proceedings in and action by the committees of the house in addition however clause 2 of rule xi requires that each standing committee adopt its own written rules of procedure which it must publish in the congressional record within 30 days of its membership being elected at the start of new congress these rules of procedure cover important aspects of committee proceedings such as quorum and voting requirements markups and preparation of committee reports the status of these committee rules is clarified by the parliamentarians annotations accompanying rule xi in the house manual rule xi requires that the rules adopted by committees must be consiste nt with the rules of the house and do not supersede those established by house rule xi committee rules can be enforced in the committee that adopts them but gene rally are not enforceable on the house floor in procedure in the house the house parliamentarian explains that point of order does not normally lie in the house against consideration of bill by reason of defective committee procedures occurring prior to the time the bill was ordered reported to the house such point of orde r if made in the house may be overruled on the ground that the rules of particular committee are for that committee to interpret unless they are in direct conflict with the rules of the house or unless the house rules specifically permit the raising of such objections37 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30787crs42

for the coming new congress after the november congressiona l election upon adoption the rules are printed and distributed to members belonging to the respective conference ordinarily the printed versi ons present only the text of the rules without annotations or references typically th printed copies generally are issued only to the members of the respective party and are not made availabl more publicly the rules of the conferences are created only by authority of the respective parties in the house not through an exer cise of the constitutional power of the full house to determine its rules as result these rules are not directly enforceable on the house floor and the documents containi ng them are not official parliamentary reference sources of the house neve rtheless conference rules are binding on members of the respective parties insofar as action in the respective organizations is concerned in some cases in addition thes rules govern actions that may be taken in the proceedings of the house by members and leaders of the respective party for this reason an understanding of house proceedings can ofte n be facilitated by reference to these rules important components of these rules are provisions governing the selection and terms of party floor and committee leaders the assignment of members to committees and meetings of the conference itself some of these rules also address topics of procedure on the floor and in housesenate conference committees and accordingly can affect how the chamber as whole considers legislation for example rule 38 of democra tic
