agreements were reached before deadline of july 1 2005 the 2002 trade act also provided for an automatic twoyear extension of that deadline if certain conditions were met during the first half of 2005 an issue for the 109th congress was whether or not to disapprove the twoyear extension trade promotion authority in brief trade promotion authority tpa formerly called fasttrack authority is an arrangement involving the executive and legislative branches that recognizes the distinct constitutional responsibilities of those branches regarding trade negotiations and trade policy by virtue of the constitutional power to conduct foreign affairs the president has authority to negotiate and enter into agreements with foreign countries including those agreements dealing with trade and tariff policy at the same time the constitution gives congress the primary power over trade policy under article i and the congress decides congressional research service the library of congress crs2 whether or not to approve statutory changes that are called for under trade agreements that the president has negotiated the basic provisions of tpa were established in the trade act of 1974 pl 93618 for limited period of time those provisions were renewed periodically most recently under the trade act of 2002 under tpa congress provides that if trade agreement is reached by given deadline it will consider legislation to implement the trade agreement under expedited procedures that prohibit amendments limit debate and set deadlines on congressional action as condition for these procedural restraints congress requires the president to consult with appropriate congressional bodies before and during the negotiations notify congress before beginning any negotiations and before entering into trade agreement provide reports as specified and meet other conditions as provided1 congress also places restrictions on the purpose of trade agreement and on language in an implementing bill through these provisions congress sets trade negotiating objectives and is informed of progress in the negotiations and the president is assured that trade agreement will receive timely upordown vote in congress tpa extension in the trade act of 2002 and subsequent action httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22102 under the 2002 act as amended2 congress approved tpa for trade agreements entered into before july 1 2005 but also approved an automatic twoyear extension of tpa to cover trade agreements entered into before july 1 2007 as long as two conditions were met first the president had to request the twoyear extension by april 1 2005 together with the request the president was required to submit 1 description of all major trade agreements that have been negotiated and might be considered under tpa and the anticipated schedule for submitting those agreements for congressional approval 2 description of progress in negotiations to achieve the purposes and objectives that congress approved in the title and statement that this progress justifies continuation of negotiations and 3 statement of the reasons why the extension is needed to complete the negotiations in effect these provisions would require the president to justify how he had used tpa until then and to describe how he might use it over the next two years on march 30 2005 the president submitted report of approximately 260 pages that contains the request for tpa extension3 the report provided an overview of the administrations trade policy and related that trade policy to trade agreements concluded under tpa and to trade negotiations in progress lengthy appendices included detailed descriptions of freetrade agreements ftas that had been concluded under tpa provisions and of ftas under negotiation4 as well as comprehensive summary of each concluded fta and how each fta made progress in achieving the tpa objectives 1 see crs report rl31974 trade agreements requirements for presidential consultations notices

information on negotiations in progress see crs issue brief ib10123 trade negotiations in the 109th congress by ian f fergusson and lenore m sek crs3 second condition for the twoyear extension of tpa was that neither house of congress adopt an extension disapproval resolution before july 1 2005 the 2002 trade act included the language for such disapproval resolution it stated that an extension disapproval resolution could be introduced in either house of congress by any member and disapproval resolution had to be referred in the house of representatives to the committees on ways and means and on rules although there is provision on committee referral in the senate the prescribed procedure appears to presume referral to the committee on finance which has jurisdiction over trade matters in the senate under the 2002 trade act expedited procedures 19 usc 2192d and would apply to floor consideration of extension disapproval resolutions the act however provided that it was not in order for 1 the senate to consider any extension disapproval resolution not reported by the committee on finance 2 the house of representatives to consider any extension disapproval resolution not reported by the committees on ways and means and on rules or 3 either house of the congress to consider an extension disapproval resolution after june 30 2005 given these provisions the committees could take various actions on disapproval httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22102 resolution committee could vote to adopt motion to report disapproval resolution favorably or unfavorably see next section for committee action on extension disapproval resolutions in 1991 in such cases the resolution could be brought to the floor also committee could vote down motion to report or simply not take up the resolution at all in these cases resolution would be stopped in committee on april 6 2005 senator byron dorgan introduced extension disapproval resolution sres 100 which was referred to the senate finance committee in his submission statement senator dorgan indicated he believed that the finance committee would not allow the resolution to go to the senate floor5 in late june 2005 senator dorgan and eight other senators sent letter to senator charles grassley chairman of the senate finance committee calling for the release of sres 100 to the full senate for an upor down vote6 by the deadline of june 30 2005 the finance committee had not acted on s 100 and there had been disapproval resolution introduced in the house since both conditions for the twoyear extension had been met the extension became automatic tpa was extended to trade agreements entered into by june 30 2007 in press statement on july 1 2005 us trade representative rob portman said that the extension of tpa showed congressional

promotion authority and the us trade agenda press release july 1 2005 crs4 prior vote on tpa extension twoyear extension of tpa then called fasttrack authority was considered only once before under the omnibus trade and competitiveness act of 1988 pl 100418 congress approved fasttrack authority for trade agreements entered into before june 1 1991 and provided for twoyear extension the provisions in the 1988 act were almost identical to those in the 2002 act in 1988 the twoyear extension was principally intended to allow more time for the ongoing multilateral trade negotiations uruguay round in the world trade organization wto by the time thenpresident george h w bush requested the twoyear extension however he had notified congress of his intent to negotiate north american free trade agreement nafta that agreement not the wto negotiations became the center of the debate on the twoyear extension8 the debate was also influenced by the political situation at the time the president was republican and both houses of congress were controlled by the democratic party the president requested the twoyear extension on march 1 19919 disapproval resolutions were introduced in the house h res 101 on march 6 1991 and in the senate sres 78 on march 13 1991 on march 7 1991 the chairmen of the senate httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22102 finance committee and of the house ways and means committee sent letter to the president saying that the president should address some concerns about environmental standards worker rights and similar issues before congress voted on extension of fast track procedures the house majority leader sent letter to the president with similar intent on march 27 1991 on may 1 1991 the president responded with an extensive action plan that addressed the concerns raised on may 9 1991 the house majority leader introduced resolution hres 146 that the president be accountable in meeting the action plan and other objectives on may 23 1991 the house defeated its disapproval resolution by vote of 192 231 but approved hres 146 by vote of 3288510 the next day the senate defeated its disapproval resolution by vote of 365911 these actions indicated that while congress did not want to prevent the twoyear extension it planned to closely monitor the negotiations particularly with respect to nafta 8 for more information on the earlier debate on extension of

146 amended favorably reported by voice vote and reported the measure as amended 11 the senate finance committee ordered reported unfavorably the disapproval resolution sres 78 by 315 vote crs5 implications for us trade policy and negotiations to understand the implications of the issue of tpa renewal for us trade negotiations it might be helpful to look at the reason why expedited procedures for implementing bills were approved in the first place during multilateral negotiations in the 1960s the kennedy round the administration negotiated two nontariff trade agreements without explicit authority from congress the prevailing view in congress was that the president had overstepped his delegated tariffcutting power in negotiating these nontariff trade agreements and congress decided not to enact legislation to implement the two nontariff trade agreements this result showed that the two branches of government would have to be more collaborative if trade agreements in the future were to be negotiated and brought before congress with any likelihood of approval the compromise reached in the 1974 trade act was that congress would guarantee an upor down vote without amendment as long as the president consulted with congress and followed its directives in the negotiations central question in considering extension of tpa is whether or not trade policy that promotes the negotiation and approval of trade agreements is in the national interest httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22102 supporters of trade agreements argue that the agreements offer opportunities for us exporters in markets that otherwise would be closed to them and provide consumers with wider selection of lowcost products they also state that trade agreements increase the level of trade which helps the national economy to grow opponents of trade agreements argue that the agreements are often biased toward the business community and do not give enough consideration to other important objectives such as saving workers jobs or protecting the environment some opponents believe that certain trade restrictions should be left in place to protect domestic industries another question is if congress decides that negotiation of trade agreements should be part of us trade policy is tpa necessary for those negotiations trade negotiators generally view tpa and its assurance of an upordown congressional vote as important if not critical for their credibility in trade negotiations they argue that many foreign countries may not elect to negotiate with the united states if tpa is not in effect this is because without tpas ban on amendments congress can alter an implementing bill and thereby possibly change the nature of the agreement or the balance of concessions achieved supporters of tpa argue that substantial changes might require renegotiation and might even kill the agreement on the other hand opponents of tpa are reluctant to give power to the president to conclude trade agreement that congress cannot change they argue that the ban on amendments under tpa is an abdication of the constitutional role of congress to regulate foreign commerce some opponents also claim that the consultation requirements of tpa have been ineffective because the president has consulted indepth with only small number of members it is generally believed that the expedited procedures of tpa probably have the greatest effect for negotiations involving large number of countries the united states is currently participating in multilateral talks in the doha round of negotiations in the world trade organization wto these talks which began in 2001 and are probably at least year from conclusion involve 148 wto member countries because of the complexity of such talks renegotiation of an agreement among 148 countries would be tremendously difficult so us negotiators see tpas ban on amendments as crucial to maintaining any final balance of concessions in an agreement with twoyear extension crs6 of tpa the current negotiations would continue and the new deadline of june 30 2007 would effectively set the deadline for signing an agreement in the wto without tpa negotiations could have continued but with clear deadline and the possibility of amendments in congress other countries might have reconsidered the scope and timing of further talks similar arguments apply to free trade area of the americas ftaa negotiations on an ftaa began in 1994 and 34 countries are participating talks so far have been slow and difficult and some might argue that because of the difficulty of these negotiations tpa is important because any renegotiation would be highly difficult on the other hand others might argue that tpa does not matter much because it is unlikely that an ftaa can be reached by the extended deadline june 30 2007 for smaller regional or bilateral negotiations the effect of tpa on any set of trade negotiations might depend on how economically or politically controversial those negotiations are the more controversial the talks the greater the possibility that substantial amendments would be considered and the greater the effect of any ban on amendments with tpa for example nafta was highly controversial and it is likely httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22102 that without the expedited procedures of fasttrack authority tpa an implementing bill would have been substantially amended in comparison the freetrade agreement with jordan was negotiated without tpa and the implementing bill was changed little during congressional consideration several smaller regional or bilateral trade agreements are now under negotiation and they were not concluded in time to qualify for tpa without the twoyear extension most if not all might be concluded in time to qualify for tpa with the twoyear extension how important might the tpa expedited procedures be if the administration concludes these agreements and submits implementing bills to congress under those procedures it is difficult to say agreements under negotiation include freetrade agreements ftas with thailand panama the united arab emirates and oman countries in the andean region and countries in southern africa negotiations probably would have continued with or without tpa with tpa implementing bills will be considered under expedited procedures without amendment without tpa bills would have been considered under normal legislative procedures and would have been amendable some of the negotiations have controversial aspects such as claims that worker standards are not adequate or arguments that us apparel makers and us sugar producers will face damaging competition from foreign producers some are controversial because they have stronger political than economic rationales twoyear extension of tpa could have been more important for some of these negotiations than for others with tpa extended for two years new negotiations might be considered for example the administration might propose fta talks with additional countries in the middle east as part of the administrations proposal for middle east free trade area although time could be an important consideration if tpa had not been extended the administration probably would have been more restrained in pursuing new trade negotiations or might have pursue less controversial negotiations regardless of whether or not tpa was extended trade agreements entered into before june 30 2005 an fta with five central american countries and the dominican republic and an fta with bahrain already qualified for expedited procedures for an implementing bill
