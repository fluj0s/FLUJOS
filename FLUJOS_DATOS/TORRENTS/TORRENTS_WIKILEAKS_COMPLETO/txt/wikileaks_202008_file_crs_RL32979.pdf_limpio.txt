summary prior to january 1 2005 alcohol fuel blenders qualified for 52 tax exemption against the excise taxes otherwise due on each gallon of blended mixtures mixtures of 10 ethanol nd 90 gasoline this exemption which was scheduled to decline to 51 on january 1 2005 reduced the gasoline excise tax for gasohol from 184 to 132gallon the reduction was r ealized at the time when the gasoline tax was otherwise imposed typically when the fuel was loaded from the terminal onto trucks for distribution the 52 exemp tion could also be claimed later ie when blenders filed their in come tax return as 52 ex cise tax credit per gallon of alcohol used to make fuel mixture whi ch was also scheduled to decline to 51 in tandem with the exemption on january 1 2005 this credit however was not as valuable as the exemption because 1 it was taxable as income 2 was not available instantaneously as the fuel was blended blenders had to wait until their income tax returns were filed to reduce their tax liability by the amount of the credit and 3 the tax credit was not refundable it was only available to th extent of tax liability because the primary benefits from alcohol fuels were realized through an exemption rather than tax credit revenue losses from the exemption or reduced excise taxes accrued to the highway trust fund htf the american jobs creation act of 2004 pl 108357 restructured the basic tax subsidies for alcohol fuels 1 the blenders income tax credits were eliminated and 2 the blenders excise tax exemption was replaced by an instant excise tax credit of the same amount 51gallon of 9010 mixture which is also equivalent to 51 per gallon of ethanol in the mixture these tax reforms went into effect on january 1 2005 as before the excise tax credit is claimed ag ainst the 184 per gallon excise tax on gasoline so that the actual excise tax paid and remitted to the treasury is 133 the tax is reduced by 51gallon just as with the exemption when income tax effects are considered however the new excise tax credit has greater economic or subsidy value than th exemption before it because income tax deductions are taken at 184 rather then 133 in other words by labeling the tax reduction as an excise tax credit rather than an excise tax exemption the tax law treats the blenders as paying the full exci tax of 184 gallon rather than 133 per gallon at 25 marginal income tax rate the additional 51 deduction is valued at 17gallon of blend or 17gallon of et hanol which means that the total aftertax subsidy for alcohol fuel mixtures is effec tively 68gallon of ethanol rather than the nominal rate of 51 by nominally increasing the excise tax on gasohol by 51gallon an extra 1500 million in fy2006 is projected to be allocated into the htf from the general fund which implies that htf expenditures and budget deficits can be expected to be higher than under the exemption in ddition to the alcohol fuel mixture excise tax credit there are three other federal tax subsidies that are available for the production and use of alcohol trans portation fuels but are little used comprehensive energy policy legislation h r 6 as passed by the senate includes renewable fuels

plan intended to address what was pe rceived as severe problems in the countrys energy markets 2 more recently regulatory subsidies for ethanol fuels the federal oxygenates and reformulated fuels requirements under the cl ean air act as well as numerous state subsidies have been added which have also in creased the market for ethanol fuel still the excise tax exemption has provided much of the economic stimulus to the industryalcohol fuels tax incentives after the 2004 reforms introduction president carters 1978 energy tax act in troduced the excise tax exemption for alcohol fuel blends at 100 of the ga soline tax which was then 4gallon to achieve energy and more recently certa in environmental and agricultural policy objectives1 in 2004 this exemption which was 52gallon and was scheduled to decline to 51 on ja nuary 1 2005 reduced the gasoline excise tax for gasohol from 184 to 132gallon the reduction was r ealized at the time when the gasoline tax was otherwise imposed typically when the fuel was loaded from the terminal onto trucks for distribution the 52 exemp tion could also be claimed later ie when blenders filed their in come tax return as 52 excise tax credit per gallon of alcohol used to make fuel mixture whic h was also scheduled to decline to 51 in tandem with the exemption on january 1 2005 from 19782004 this exemption from the motor fuels excise taxes provided the major subsidy to the ethanol fuel industry without the exemption the ethanol fuels industry would either not exist or be substan tially smaller2 the exemption however which effectiv ely lowered the excise tax on the blended fuel reduced revenues for the highway trust fund by an estimated 14 000 million through fy2004 as consequence th congress enacted the american jobs creation act of 2004 pl 108357 also known as the jobs bill which restructured the basic tax subsidy for cohol fuels it replaced the excise tax exemption with new excise tax credit th alcohol fuel mixtures excise tax credit although the two incentives are equivalent in gross beforetax terms they are both equal to 51 per gallon of ethanol in teractions between the excise tax credit and the income tax system increase the valu of the incentives under this restructured or reformed system in addition to the ne w alcohol fuel mixtures excise tax credit current federal tax law provide s for small ethanol producer credit and several other tax incentives that although little used might further benefit alcohol fuels in the future the senate version of hr 6 the ergy policy act of 2005 proposes to not only expand the small ethanol producer cred it but to introduce renewable fuelshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32979crs2 3 the jobs bill also introduced parallel or quivalent system of incentives for biodiesel section 40a of the irc also provides for ex cise tax credits against the 244gallon tax on diesel fuel for mixtures of biodiesel this excise tax credit is 50gallon of recycled biodiesel and 100gallon for virg in agribiodiesel section 40a also provides 50gallon income tax credit 100 for agribiodiesel fo r use or retail sale of pure 100 biodiesel 4 moreover the proposed renewable fuels mandate new regulatory subsidy will if enacted in hr 6 also provide larger benefit than the tax subsidystandard which is effectively an ethanol standard requirement that gasoline suppliers refiners and blenders blend at least 8 billion gallons of renewable fuels per year in producing gasoline such requirement if enacted would more than double the amount of ethanol blended with gasoline above the current projected baseline level of ethanol us and significantly increase federal tax revenue losses this report explains the provisions of the new alcohol fuels mixtures tax credit and compares the tax benefits under the new credit with the tax benefits under the old exemption an example illustra tes the mechanics of the new credit and compares it with the old exemption the second section examines the revenue and highway trust fund implications of the new tax incentive both with and without renewable fuels standard the final section discusses the remaining thr ee tax subsidies for alcohol fuels which although little use d are nevertheless part of the current federal tax laws and might be used in the future the alcohol fuel mixtures excise tax credit under the new alcohol fuels mixtures ta x credit 40 of the internal revenue code irc gasohol blenders may claim 51gallon tax credit for alcohol used to produce qualified mixture mixture of alcohol and gasoline or mixture of alcohol and any other special motor fuel3 unlike most tax credits which are cla imed against income tax liability because the income tax otherwise owed is reduced or credited by the amount of the credit the new alcohol mixtures credit is claimed against the motor fuels gasoline excise tax however both approaches reduce the effective excise tax burden on each gallon of ethanol used to make 9010 gallon of mixture by the same amount 51 gallon of blend or 51gallon of ethanol regardless of whether the reduction is called tax credit or excise tax exemption this new excise tax credit which became effective on january 1 2005 will replace the ol d excise tax exemption as the basic tax incentive claimed on most sales of fuel ethanol it will provide the biggest subsidy to the industry4 as under the previous exemption to qualify for the full 51 tax credit the alcohol must be at least 190 proof 95 pure alcohol determined without regard to any added denaturants or impurities the credit is 3778 per gallon if the ethanol is between 150 and 190 proof credit is provided for alcohol below 150 proof this mixture credit is available only to the blender who must not only produce the mixture but must either use the mixture as motor fuel in trade or business or sell it for use as fuel the blender may be th producer the terminal operator or thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32979crs3 5 although blends of gasoline with bioma ss derived methanol would also qualify under the tax code such blends are disqualified unde r the clean air act because of the associated increase of emissions of ozone forming pollutants 6 natural gas liquids are those components of wellhead gas ethane propane butanes pentanes natural gasoline condensate etc that are liquefied at the surface in lease separators field facilities or gas processing plants 7 currently nineteen states have either banned limited or are phasingout mtbe see crs report rl32787 mtbe in gasoline clean air and drinking water issues by james mccarthy and mary tiemannwholesaler distributor or marketer technically both et hanol and methanol qualify for the exemption as long as they are not derived from petroleum natural gas coal or peat in practice however virtually all fuel alcohol is etha nol produced from corn very little if any methanol is produced from wood and other biomass or renewable sources because it is generally uneconomic5 currently most methanol is produced from natural gas is too expensive as blended motor fuel and does not qualify for the tax breaks as did the exemption before it the new federal tax credit for alcohol fuels also applies to certain fuel dditives called oxygenates provided they are produced from renewables such as corn and not from foss il fuels such as natural gas etbe is compound derived from chemical reac tion between ethanol and isobutylene byproduct of both the petroleum refini ng process and natural gas liquids6 in this reaction the ethanol is chemically transf ormed and is not present as separate chemical in the final product in 1995 the irs ruled that blends of etbe ethyl tertiary butyl ether and gasoline would also qualify for the reduced partial excise tax exemption in effect these rulings ensu red that the oxygenate required under the clean air act would also qualify for the tax subsidies allowing etbe to qualify for this tax exemption was intended to fu rther stimulate the production of ethanol allowing etbe to qualify for the federal tax subsidies reduces the growth of mtbe methyl tertiary butyl ether its main co mpetitor etbe costs more to produce and therefore without the tax subsidies coul d not otherwise compete with the less costly mtbe the recent banning and phasingout of mtbe by many states california new york and connecticut and others re duces the competitive advantage of mtbe and also increases the demand for ethanol as an oxygenate7 the credit for methanol the mixtures credit is also available for methanol blended with gasoline at the rate of 60 pe r gallon of methanol the equivalent of 60 on 9010 blends if the alcohol is at least 190 proof and 45 if the methanol is between 150 and 190 proof credit is av ailable for either ethanol or methanol that is less than 150 proof as noted bove the alcohol in methanol cannot be produced from any fossil fuels it must be produced from organic or biomass materials how the new tax credit works as already discussed the new alcohol fuel s mixtures excise tax credit is claimed against the excise tax primarily the gasoline excise tax it reduces the excise tax otherwise owed and remitted to the federal government so despite the reforms ofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32979crs4 8 the lust fund finances the cost of cl eaning up spills from underground fuel storage tanks all taxable transportation fuels are assessed the 01 lust fund tax except for liquefied petroleum gas or propane 9 variety of offhighway fuel uses eg farming business uses eg construction equipment and government uses eg police departments and school districts are tax exempt 10 before 1993 only liquid fuels were subject to the various transportation fuels taxes fuels that were liquid at the time they entere d into the tank of the vehicle the omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1993 pl 10366 introduced tax on cng 11 also from jan 1 1993 to dec 31 2004 mixtures of 77 or 57 cohol either ethanol or methanol received prorated exemp tion 77 ethanol blends qualified for 4004 exemption they are taxed at 14396 per gall on and 57 ethanol blends qualify for continuedthe alcohol fuels tax incen tives in 2004 the basic incentive the 51gallon tax credit is still connected with the gasolin excise tax and other motor fuels excise taxes understanding how the tax credit wo rks requires brief explanation of the structure of the current federa l excise taxes on motor fuels the structure of motor fuels excise taxes virtually all transportation fuels are taxed under compli cated structure of tax rate s and exemptions that vary by type of fuel gasoline diesel propane etc and transportation mode or how the fuel is used cars trains buses airp lanes etc gasoline used in highway transportation the fuel used more than any other is taxed at rate of 184 per gallon composed of an 183 highway trust fund rate which gene rates most of the revenue for the federal high way trust fund htf and 01 rate that is earmarked for the leaking underground storage tank trust fund lust8 diesel fuel for highway use the fuel used mostly by trucks is taxed at 244 per gallon also consisting of two components 243 rate that is allocated into the htf and 01 that goes into the lust fund in addition special motor fuels gasoline substitutes jet fuel railway diesel fuel motorboat fu and virtually ever other transportation motor fuel that is not specifically exempt are also subject to tax9 compressed natural gas cng has since 1993 been s ubject to an excise tax of 4854 per mcf thousand cubic feet marking the onset of the taxation of gaseous transportation fuels10 excise tax exemption the tax subsidies for alcohol fuels were restructured the excise tax exempti on became an excise tax credit under the american jobs creation act of 2004 pl 108357 enacted on october 22 2004 the reforms became effective on january 1 2005 before the restructuring of the alc ohol fuels tax incentives in 2004 the most important tax incentive for alcohol fuel s the one most responsible for the development of the alcohol fuels market was the partial exemption from the otherwise standard excise ta x rates on gasoline diesel nd other transportation fuels this exemption was 52 per gallon in 2004 and scheduled to decline to 51 beginning on january 1 2005 before it is was replaced by the alcohol mixtures excise tax credit thus mixtures of 90 gasoline and 10 alcohol typically called gasohol were taxed at 132 per gallon they were exempt from 52 of the tax 11httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32979crs5 11 continued 2964 per gallon exemption they are taxed at 15 436 per gallon the 57 and 77 blends correspond respectively to the 20 and 27 oxygen content standard for gasoline sold in ozone nonattainment areas and carbon monoxide nonattainment areas under the clean air act caa as amended in 1990 the c aa requires that all gasoline sold in the winter months in the 40 car bon monoxide co nonattainment areas contain at least 27 oxygenate oxygenates add oxygen to gasoline and make the fuel burn more completely and more cleanly this part of the program be gan on nov 1 1992 the caa also requires that all gasoline sold in 9 ozone nonattainment ar eas be reformulated gasoline containing at least 2 oxygenates reformulated gasoline in volves more complex and extensive change to the chemical properties of fuel to 1 reduce emissions of volatile organic compounds which form ozone 2 reduce emissions of toxic compounds such as formaldehyde and 3 keep emissions of nitrog oxide from increasing 12 alcohol blended with diesel fuel or any one of the other special motor fuels is also partially exempt from tax the exemption for gasohol blends also applies to blends of diesel and biomass derived alcohol and blends of special motor fuel and biomass derived alcohol whether ethanol or methanol in all these cases the exemption equated to 52 per gallon of ethanol for 2004 which is the same as 52gallon income tax credit12 example table 1 compares the net aftertax valu of the new 51 gallon alcohol fuel mixture excise tax credit column 3 as it is applied on 9010 blends 90 gasoline 10 ethanol with the old 51gallon ex cise tax exemption column 2 on those same blends for perspective these are compared with the tax on gallon of pure gasoline the example assumes the ethanol is 190 proof subsidy value is measured in terms of its effects on the marginal costs of supplying fuel relative to the unsubsidized shift in the marginal cost curve under the 184gallon gasoline tax the model is described in th appendix in greater detail note first that there is difference between the new excise tax credit and the old excise tax exemption in the actual excise tax paid or remitted to the treasury row 3 whether the reduction in taxes per ga llon of 9010 blend is provided by the an excise tax exemption and or excise ta x credit the amount actually paid to the treasury is 133gallon there is differe nce however in the subsidy value between the two ways of reducing the excise taxes in particular table 1 shows that the new alcohol fuels excise tax credit has higher subsidy value than the excise tax exemption in effect under the pre2005 tax law as the sixth row third column shows the netafter tax subsidy value of the new excise tax credit pergallon of 9010 blend is 68gallon as compared to 5 1gallon under the exemption thus the value of the excise tax credit is 17 greater or 333 greater than the value of the exemption per gallon of ethanol th subsidy value would be 10 times that amount or 68gallon rather than 51gallon httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32979crs6 table 1 comparison of the net aftertax subsidy value of the new mixtures tax credit with the old excise tax exemption credit or exemptionold excise tax

deductibility of the excise taxes against income tax liability higher excise tax results in greater tax deductions and smaller tax this figure assumes 25 marginal income tax rate see the appendix for more detail the higher subsidy value under the exci tax credit is due to the deductibility of excise taxes as an expense against th income tax the 2004 reforms changed the terminology of tax subsidy rather than claiming an instant exemption of 51gallon blenders can now claim an instant credit of 51gallon however the substitution of tax credit for an equivalent exemption means that blenders are treated nominally as paying the full 184gallon excise tax they will get higher income tax deductions which increases th effective amount of the new tax credit assuming marginal income tax rate of 25 the rate usually assumed by the joint tax committee and other analysts the value of the new tax credit increases by 17 per gallon or by 333 thus the ffective value of the tax credit is not 51gallon but 68gallon httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32979crs7 13 brian francis gasoline excise taxes 19332000 statistics of income bulletin internal revenue service federal excise taxes reported to or collected by

highway trust fund implications from fy1932 when it was first enacted until fy2003 the gasoline tax has generated over 400000 million in gross tax revenues billions more have been generated from the tax on diesel and other special highway motor fuels13 n t revenues have been about 25 or about 100000 million less due to the deductibility of the excise taxes as cost of doing business leaving net total of about 300000 million in fy2003 the year for which the latest data are available the gasoline tax alone generated 20100 million in tax revenues for the highway trust fund 86 billion more were generated from the excise tax on diesel and millions more were generated from the excise taxes on other highway motor fuels in total the htf collected 33700 billion in excise tax r eceipts in fy2003 about 90 from motor fuels taxes and most of that from the gasoline tax14 these totals include receipts generated from the taxation of gasoline bl ended with alcohol almost all ethanol which totaled in gross terms bout 4100 million in fy2003 about 3000 million net due to about 1000 million in income tax offsets but while the excise tax on gasoline cohol blends genera ted billions in tax revenue the lower tax rate due to the ex emptions tax rate of 131 in 2003 due to an exemption of 53 tax rate of 132 in 2004 due to an exemption of 52 meant that these blends did not generate as mu ch revenue for the htf as they would have otherwise had the ethanol blends been ta xed at the same rate as pure unblended gasoline from 1978 when the excise ta x exemption for alcohol fuels was first enacted to fy2004 it is estimated that th exemption cost the federal treasury approximately 14000 million in fo regone federal re venues in net terms ie gross excise tax receipts less income tax receipts gross receipts ie losses to the htf would have been about 18600 million for fy2003 for example had ethanol blends been taxed at 184gallon inst ead of the actual 131gallon because the exemption was 53gallon gross revenue s for the htf would have been about 1400 million higher the net revenue ss was 350 million or 25 less again because the lower tax rate implied smaller income tax offset the above effects on the htf exclude add itional losses in receipts due to tax code provision enacted in 1990 and repealed by the 2004 jobs bill which allocated 25 of the taxable portion of the excise tax on ethanol blends the 131 in 2003 to remain in the general fund irc 9503 b pr ovided that part of the taxable portion of the tax on gasohol blends the 131 for 9010 blends the 14342 for 92377 blends and the 15422 for 94357 blends was not allocated to the htf in 2003 but was instead allocated into the gene ral fund more specifically for the 9010httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32979crs8 blends the law in 2003 provided that 31 of the 131 tax remain in the general fund for blends containing less than 10 ethanol 25 remains in the general fund and is not allocated into the htf for 2003 about 700 million was allocated to the general fund instead of the htf under this provision thus the total htf revenue loss resulting from the alcohol fuels exemption was about 2100 million for fy2003 revenue effects of the new alcohol fuels mixtures tax credit the substitution of tax credit for an exemption against the excise taxes will increase revenues to the htf and redu ce revenues by the same amount for the general

long as any cooperative income flows through to the patrons as patronage dividends basically net income profits are allocated back to the cooperative patrons members and in effect federal tax law treats cooperatives as partnershi ps rather than corporations prior to the 2004 jobs bill the only credits that were allowed to be passed through to the patrons were the rehabilitation credit the energy credit and the reforestation tax credit the 2004 amendments added the small ethanol producer cr edit to the list of cred its allocable to the patrons which effectively reduces each patron s dividends by proportionate share of the credits based on the patrons share of etha nol production or total business done with the cooperative or some other allocation criteriamust use it in trade or business or to the seller who must sell it at retail to the ultimate user as long as it is placed in th fuel tank of the buyers vehicle in all these cases the alcohol may be either etha nol or methanol but must not be produced from fossil fuels effectively limiting the tax credit to ethanol from corn the market for these straight or neat fuels is very small the credit for straight alcohol fuels was not amended by the jobs bill small ethanol producer tax credit current law provides for an income tax credit of 10 per gallon 420 per barrel for up to 15 million gallons of nnual ethanol production by small ethanol producer defined as one with ethanol production capacity of 30 million gallons per year or less about 2000 barrels per day this credit which was enacted as part of the

the buyers trade or business for use as fuel in the buyers trade or bus iness or for sale at retail where such fuel is placed in the fuel tank of the retail cu stomer casual offfarm production of ethanol does not qualify for this credit the small ethanol producer credit is limited in the same way as the blenders tax credit the am ount of the credit is reduced to take into account any excise

forma tions synthetic fuels etc this is the alternative fuels production tax credit so known as the 29 tax credit because it is part of internal reve nue code section 29 whic h in 2004 was 647 per barrel of oil equivalent certain types of alcohol fuels either et hanol or methanol produced synthetically from coal or lignite coul d qualify for this nonrefundable tax credit alcohol fuels pr oduced from biomass do not qualify for this credit although gas produced from biomass does qualify ther is little if any production of liquid synthetic fuels from coal in the united stat so that based on current information this credit is not claimed on alc ohol fuels used in transportation16httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32979crs12 technical appendix this technical appendix calculates the economic or subsidy value of the new alcohol fuels excise tax credit as compared to the old excise tax exemption and the nonsubsidized 100 gasoline that subsid value is measured as the difference in marginal costs for profitmaximizing gasoline supplier preincome tax profits with unit excise tax such as gasoline tax is 1πbpq c q t q 1 where p is price q is output c q is total cost function and t1 is unit excise tax maximizing beforetax profits with respect to output q leads to the πb following condition 2δπ δbqp c q t 10 which implies that3 pc q t 1 ie profit maximization leads the firm to pr oduce at that point where price p is equal to the marginal cost cq and the excise tax t1 in other words in competitive market profit maximizing firm facing unit tax on gasoline faces higher marginal cost curve by the amount of the tax the ma rginal cost curve shifts up or is higher than the nontaxed marginal costs by 184gallon pure income or profits tax t is complete ly neutral it does not affect the profit maximizing level of output under thes conditions as is shown next 4πapq c q t q t 11 5δπ δaqp c q t t 110 which implies that6 pc q t 1 equation 6 is the same as equation 3 because the 1 t term cancels the equilibrium level of output and price is unaffected by the pure business income tax even with the imposition of unit tax such as the 184 gasoline taxhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32979crs13 now however assume that there are two unit excise taxes t1 is the excise tax per gallon actually paid and t2 is the excise tax rate deductible for purposes of the income tax then the afte rtax profit function becomes 7πapq c q t q tpq c q t q 12 8 pq c q t q t tt 112 finding the level of q that maximizes pr ofits lead to the following condition 9δπ δaqp c q t tt t 1012 which reduces to10 pc q t t t t 121 where p and cq are as before price and marginal costs and t1 t t2 1 t is the shift in the marginal cost curve after allowance for the deductibility of excise taxes as an expense against the income tax to illustrate when gasoline distributor is paying 184 gallon t1 184 and deducting the same amount against the income tax t2 184 then the tax terms in equation 10 become 11tt t t1111 note that because t1 t2 the 1 t terms cancel and the shift in marginal cost is simply t1 184 this is also true when gasoline blender is paying 133 because of the exemption the blender is also deducting 133 against the income tax and the shift or increase in marginal co sts equals the amount of the tax 133 however when t1 and t2 differ as they do under the new restructured alcohol fuels tax incentives then the shift in marginal costs is defined by equation 10 under present law ie since january 1 2005 t1 133 but t2 184 thus assuming the marginal corporate income tax rate is 25 t 25 the tax term in equation 10 the shift or incr ease in marginal costs becomes 12133 25 184 1 25 13 133467514 116 that represents the increase in marginal costs under the ne w alcohol fuels excise tax credit row 4 column 3 in table 1 this is 68 less than the increase under the gasoline tax and 17 less then the increase in costs under the old exemption the subsidy value is 68gallon rather than 51gallon
