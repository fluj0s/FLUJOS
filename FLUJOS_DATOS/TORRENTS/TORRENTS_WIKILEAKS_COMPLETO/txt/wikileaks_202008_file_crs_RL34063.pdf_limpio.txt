understand eligibility for v health care the v as enrollment process and its enrollment priority groups unlike medicare or medicaid v health care is not an entitlement program contrary to numerous claims made concerning promises to military personnel and veterans with regard to free health care for life not every veteran is automatically entitled to medical care from the va 17 prior to eligibility reform in 1996 provisions of law governing eligibility for v care were complex and not uniform across all levels of care all veterans were technically eligible for hospital care and

for the treatment of ve terans with nonserviceconnected disabilities it also established copayments from veterans for this care 55 under current law the v is authorized to collect from thirdparty health insurers to offset the cost of medical care furnished to veteran for the treatment of nonserviceconnected condition56 if the v treats an insured veteran for nonserviceconnected disability and the veteran is also determined by the v to have copayment responsibilities the v will apply the payment collected from the insurer to satisfy the veterans copayment debt related to that treatment under the current copayment billing process in cases where the cost of veterans medical care for nonserviceconnected condition appears to qualify for billing under reimbursable insurance and copayment the v medical facilities sends the bill to the insurance provider the veterans copayment obligation is placed on hold for 90 days pending payment from the thirdparty payer 53 this law allowed the va to increase the copayment amount for each 30day or less supply of medication provided on an outpatient basis other than medication administered during treatment for treatment of nonserviceconnected condition accordingly the va increased the copayment amount from 2 to 7 the medication copayment charge for each subsequent calendar year after 2002 is established by using the prescription drug
