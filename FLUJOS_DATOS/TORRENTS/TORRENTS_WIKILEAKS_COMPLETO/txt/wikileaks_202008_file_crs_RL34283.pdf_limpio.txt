higher education opportunity act hrept 110803 similar to the occurrence during the 109th congress during the first session of the 110th congress the reauthorization of the hea became heavily intertwined with the budget reconciliation process as both the senate help committee and the house education and labor committee reported reconciliation recommendations that made numerous changes to programs and provisions contained in the hea the college cost reduction nd access act ccraa of 2007 pl 11084 was signed into law on september 27 20073 the ccraa made significant changes to the federal family education loan ffel program the william d ford federal direct loan dl program pell grant program and the federal need analysis formula notably the ccraa also reauthorized the pell grant program through fiscal year fy 2017 the higher education reconcilia tion act hera passed as part of the deficit reduction act of 2005 pl 109171 which was signed into law on february 8 2006 extended several program authorization provisions within the ffel and dl programs4 sweeping amendments affecting some of the heas major programs have been adopted throug h the two aforemen tioned reconciliation measures in addition significant changes to the student loan programs were enacted as part of the ensuring continued ccess to student loans act ecasla of 2008 pl 110 227 which addressed concerns about the availability of student loans given current economic conditions including changes to loan terms and the lender of last resort provisions5 as result of hera ccraa and ecasla the current reauthorization bills are less focused on some of the larger hea programs than has typically been the case in other reauthorizations it should also be noted that changes adopted through the ccraa were passed by the full senate on july 20 2007 four days prior to the passage of the senate hea reauthorization bill thus some of the provi sions contained in s 1642 were addressed in the ccraa these provisions are noted where applicable this report provides sidebyside co mparison of the hea reauthorization proposals in the senatepa ssed version of s 1642 and the housepassed version ofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34283crs3 hr 4137 to current law the sidebyside generally corresponds with the organization of s 1642 thus the provisions included in table 1 correspond to the layout of s 1642 to locate pa rticular program or provision in table 1 it is suggested that you locate the programpr ovision in the table of contents which includes specific page number for all hea titles both existing and proposed titles as well as the major programs and pr ovisions that are being reauthorized the report begins with brief overview of the titles and major programs of the hea and includes short summary of the larger issues and proposed changes in s 1642 and hr 4137 for each title unless otherwise noted the proposed changes identified in the section that follows are contained in both the senate and house reauthorization bills it is important to note that the sidebyside comparison which is presented in table 1 is intended to provide summary of th larger issues and changes addressed in the two bills as they compare to current law thus this analysis does not attempt to capture all of the changes that would be made by the proposed bills the phrase similar to senatehouse provision is used in table 1 to denote that the proposed provision in one bill is substantively comparable to the other bill and there are major differences unless otherwise not ed finally s 1642 and hr 4137
