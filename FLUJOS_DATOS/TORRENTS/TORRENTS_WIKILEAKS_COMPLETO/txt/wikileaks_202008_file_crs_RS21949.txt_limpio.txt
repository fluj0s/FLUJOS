government and finance division summary on september 22 2004 the office of federal housing enterprise supervision ofheo made public report that charged fannie mae the governmentsponsored httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21949 enterprise that plays leading role in the secondary mortgage market with not following generally accepted accounting practices in several critical areas which allowed fannie mae to conceal losses reduce volatility in reported earnings present investors with an artificial picture of steadily growing profits and meet financial performance targets that triggered the payment of large bonuses to company executives fannie maes initial response was to argue that ofheos charges involved not improprieties but merely differing interpretations of highly complex accounting standards however on december 15 2004 the securities and exchange commission sec after finding inadequacies in fannies accounting policies and methodologies supported ofheo and directed fannie mae to restate its accounting results since 2001 shortly thereafter the companys ceo and cfo resigned in may 2006 fannie mae reached settlement with ofheo and the sec agreeing to pay 400 million in civil penalties undertake number of remedial steps related to internal controls and oversight of accounting systems not increase the size of its mortgage portfolio without ofheos approval and be enjoined from future violations of securities laws in december 2006 fannie issued the restatement which reduced reported earnings for 20012004 by 63 billion this report will be updated as events warrant background fannie mae and freddie mac the two governmentsponsored enterprises gses that dominate the secondary mortgage market are huge and complex financial institutions that play key role in the financial system most home mortgage loans made each year are purchased by one or the other of the gses and either held in portfolio or repackaged and sold as mortgagebacked securities mbs large quantities of gse bonds are held by insured banks pension funds and investors of all types although gse debt is not guaranteed by the government the government sponsored status of fannie and freddie leads market participants to put faith in an implicit guarantee belief that the treasury will never allow either gse to default on its obligations crs2 the savings and loan crisis of the 1980s was painful demonstration of the risks inherent in mortgage markets over thousand sls failed because their longterm revenues from mortgage loans fell below their cost of funds the interest they paid to savers when interest rates are volatile holders of mortgages and mbs face variety of financial risks and these risks are now concentrated in the two gses although both institutions manage risk with sophisticated financial techniques far beyond the capacity of any sl the accounting problems at fannie mae and at freddie mac in 20031 raise serious questions the accounting irregularities to date have been portrayed as byproduct of managements wish to persuade investors that despite the volatile nature of the mortgage market the firms earnings are steady predictable and insulated from sudden changes other things equal higher volatility in earnings will drive investors to demand higher interest rates to compensate for the risk of holding gse debt which would lower the profitability of the mortgage portfolios both gses hold there has been indication that accounting has been manipulated to conceal fundamental financial problems in the two firms as was the case at failing firms like enron and worldcom however given the size of the gses and their importance to the financial system there is clearly public interest in improving accounting transparency and rigor httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21949 why fannie maes financial statements were manipulated in may 2006 ofheo published its final report on its special examination of fannie mae2 major finding is that improper accounting practices were largely driven by managements desire to achieve profit targets expressed as earnings per share or eps that would trigger maximum bonuses fannie mae had three compensation plans linked to eps figures two affected only small group of top executives but another called the annual incentive plan had over 800 beneficiaries achieving the targeted eps numbers became an overriding goal at fannie mae accounting personnel received explicit instructions as well as constant exhortations regarding the importance of the figures the ofheo report presents numerous internal communications that discuss which particular manipulation would be best suited to hit the target in particular quarter or year it was also important not to exceed the target because bonuses were capped if earnings appeared likely to exceed the target figure ways were found to defer recognition of current earnings to future periods in summary fannie maes accounting systems and policies were designed to produce the results that management wanted and not to provide investors with an accurate picture of the firms financial condition the image management tried to project of firm whose financial results were predictable and stable was false in 2002 and 2003 when interest rates dropped to very low levels fannie mae incurred large losses due to an increased rate of mortgage prepayments the magnitude of those losses although not large enough to threaten the safety and soundness of fannie mae provides evidence that the enterprises interest rate risk exposure during the period was significant 1 see crs report rs21567 accounting and management problems at freddie mac by mark jickling 2 report of the special examination of fannie mae may 2006 340 p available on the ofheo and fannie mae websites crs3 and is inconsistent with the image of fannie mae as very lowrisk institution promoted by senior management3 the accounting issues the 2004 ofheo report4 identified and the rudman5 and may 2006 ofheo reports confirmed number of major accounting problems at fannie mae several dealt with the failure to comply with specific accounting rules and more general critique focused on weaknesses in the firms accounting processes corporate culture the tone at the top and failure of the board of governors to provide effective oversight these issues are summarized below derivatives accounting sfas 133 derivatives including futures contracts options forwards swaps and caps are financial instruments whose value is linked to changes in some economic variable most often interest rates fannie mae uses derivatives extensively to manage interest rate risk derivatives accounting is governed by sfas 1336 under sfas 133 the fair value of all financial derivatives must be calculated markedtomarket at the end of each accounting period changes in fair httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21949 value from the previous accounting period must be reported as current income unless the derivatives are used for hedging if derivative is used to hedge an asset as in the example above the value of that asset the hedged item will move in the opposite direction to the derivatives value thus fall in the price of the hedged asset will be offset by gain in the derivative or vice versa under sfas 133 the firm can recognize as earnings both the change in the derivatives value and the offsetting change in the hedged items if the gains and losses are closely correlated the net effect on reported earnings will be very small or zero ofheos 2004 report analyzed number of derivatives transactions in detail and found numerous specific practices that do not conform with sfas 133 common theme is the inappropriate use of shortcuts that produce the desired result of perfectly effective hedges that will have impact on the bottom line ofheo found that fannie maes failures to follow sfas 133 were consistent with the objectives of minimizing earnings volatility and simplifying operations7 the rudman report concludes that fannie mae deviated from the clear requirements of sfas 133 in numerous and important respects and concurs with ofheos assessment of fannies motivation amortization of purchase discounts premiums and fees sfas 91 when fannie mae buys mortgages or mbs it does not pay the exact amount of unpaid 3 ibid p 48 4 office of federal housing enterprise

mark jickling available from author 7 ofheo report of findings to date p 122 crs4 premium balance outstanding on the loans if the interest rate or coupon rate paid by the borrower is above current market interest rates the loan will sell at premium above the unpaid balance if the coupon rate is below current market rates the loan is less valuable and will sell at discount to calculate the effective yield on the loan fannie mae must take these premiums and discounts into account loan bought at premium is less valuable than the coupon rate would imply and vice versa for loans purchased at discount under sfas 91 financial accounting standards board fasb rule the amount of these premiums and discounts must be amortized or recognized over the estimated life of the purchased loans or mbs the amounts recognized appear on the income statement as an adjustment to current interest income ofheo found that fannie mae did not follow this standard in consistent manner but chose to apply it as needed to produce the financial results management wanted in the fall of 1998 as central banks struggled to contain global financial panic interest rates fell dramatically the drop in rates adversely affected fannie and freddie by accelerating the rate of mortgage prepayments the effect of the speedup in prepayments on fannie maes earnings was 400 million expense which according to sfas 91 should have been recognized and charged against 1998 earnings however fannie chose to recognize httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21949 only 200 million and deferred recognition of the other half the deferred 200 million became known within fannie mae as the catchup ofheo claimed that fannie used inordinate flexibility in its handling of the catchup amount and used it as an accounting reserve or cookie jar that gave it wide discretion to report or defer amortization income in order to obtain the accounting results it wanted fannie adopted polices specifically intended to manage the catchup position as buffer to sudden changes in interest rates and the resultant volatility of amortization accounts8 ofheo put forward two explanations for fannie maes failure to follow sfas 91 first management sought to create the impression that the companys operations were stable predictable and low risk second the report analyzed fannie maes earnings in 1998 and concludes that if the full 400 million had been charged against earnings top executives would not have received bonuses linked to earnings per share target levels9 the rudman report found that the desire to meet the bonus target provides the only plausible explanation for the 1998 accounting maneuver classification of securities sfas 115 fannie mae holds large portfolio of debt securities mostly mortgagebacked bonds how these securities are valued affects earnings the value of bonds falls when interest rates rise and climbs when rates fall fluctuations in the value of bond portfolios should be reported in current income unless the bonds are to be held to maturity in which case the price changes do not matter since they do not affect the interest and principal payments the holder receives sfas 115 requires firms to classify bond portfolios as either holdtomaturity htm or availableforsale afs bonds in the latter category must be revalued at every accounting period and changes in value reported as current income ofheo finds that fannie mae did not properly apply this rule but chose the classification that would produce the financial results it wanted 8 ofheo report of findings to date p 13 9 ibid pp 1012 crs5 structural problems in accounting operations and review the 2004 ofheo report found significant problems with the way fannie maes accounting results are generated and reviewed individuals involved in the process were encumbered by heavy workload weak technical skills and weak review environment10 the rudman report is even more critical accountants were unqualified resulting in haphazard implementation of accounting rules and failed to understand or carry out their roles in making accounting policy accounting systems are described as grossly inadequate11 the rudman report notes at the outset however that the remedial steps taken by fannie mae since 2004 essentially encompass all the recommendations that reports authors would have made12 the supplemental agreement on march 8 2005 fannie mae entered into supplemental agreement to correct further accounting problems identified by ofheo13 among the accounting issues and the relevant fasb standards are valuation of mortgage loans held in portfolio sfas 65 improper classification of securities as either hold to maturity or available for sale sfas 115 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21949 policies regarding sale and repurchase of securities called dollar rolls sfas 140 failure to account for certain purchase and sale commitments relating to mortgage assets as derivatives sfas 149 and an accounting policy related to pools of mortgagebacked securities fasb interpretation 46 according to the rudman report fannie mae has diligently pursued its obligations under the ofheo agreements14 the restatement on december 6 2006 fannie mae issued restatement of earnings covering the period from january 2002 through june 2004 earnings were originally misreported by total of 91 billion but because some of the errors understated earnings the net effect was to reduce retained earnings over the period by 63 billion the largest item in the restatement was unreported derivatives losses totaling 79 billion 10 ibid p 168 11 rudman

take number of actions to address problems identified in the report fannie mae will 1 correct its accounting practices related to sfas 91 and 133 2 supplement its capital surplus by an amount equal to 30 of the required minimum capital 3 review staff structure responsibilities independence compensation and incentives 4 appoint an independent chief risk officer and separate key business functions now performed jointly by certain individuals or departments and 5 put in place new controls and policies to assure adherence to accounting rules on november 15 2004 fannie informed the securities and exchange commission sec that it could not file thirdquarter earnings report because its outside auditor kpmg had declined to sign off on the financial statements on december 15 2004 the chief accountant of the sec issued statement that fannie maes accounting was not in compliance with sfas 91 and 13315 the sec directed fannie mae to restate its financial statements for the period from 2001
