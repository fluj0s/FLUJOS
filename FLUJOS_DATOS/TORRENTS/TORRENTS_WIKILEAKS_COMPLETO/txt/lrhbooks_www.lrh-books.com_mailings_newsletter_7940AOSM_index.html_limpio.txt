dianetics date the freedom of the material which we know i try to look far enough in the future to forecast and predict what might be so as to not do too many things wrong you must allow some percentage and as i look into the future i see that we are handling here material of potential control and command over mankind which must not be permitted at any time to become the monopoly or the tool of the few to the danger and disaster of the many and maybe in this i am simply being overly proud conceited or optimistic but i would never for moment step back from the role of being conceited just to be approved of or just to be wrong in prediction and i believe that prediction is right and i believe that the freedom of the material which we know and understand is guaranteed only by lightness of organization maximum of people good training and good reliable sound relay of information and if we can do these things we will win this excerpt was taken from anatomy of the spirit of man congress the truth about insanity and psychosomatic illness an article by l ron hubbard excerpted from the anatomy of the spirit of man congress lectures insanity appears to be that thing of death wish of such strength and magnitude that the person will see almost everything die around him in an effort to carry it out and sanity returns when the person decides again to live and out of all these years of study and observation thats really all i know about insanity because i have seen preclears in much more serious condition than an insane person seemed to be in i have seen them with all the manifestations that an insane person had and yet they were not insane i have seen them with engrams in restimulation that would have killed an elephant and they were still sane i have seen them so nervous and shaking that they were practically shaking the threads out of their sleeves and they were still sane but they wanted to live and so by themselves or with the help of an auditor they overcame the ghosts and things that go boomp in the night but that person wanted to live and so that person was sane that person was willing to take responsibility for some part of his difficulties and so that person was sane and so that person could recover what we call the insane desire to die and they might have some very minor thing wrong with them but they desire to die and that is the vector that they go as far as psychosomatic illness is concerned i have felt that psychosomatic illness was overrated and i would continue to feel that it was overrated until i found man who did not have one and i have begun to believe that psychosomatic illness is misnomer and it should simply be called unwanted sensation or unwanted absence of sensation and to classify it as illness was to make it unsolvable because illness infers that some bugs or some malfunction of organs or something else is basic causation and we find that psychosomatic illness is apparently simply unwanted sensation or lack of sensation and that psychosomatic illness comes about when an individual is called upon to prove something and fails so much so that if you were going to process chronic somatic you could do this fascinating thing you could say to an individual what have you got that would prove it see youre not talking about thing you just ask him all right what have you got thatd prove it and hell have an answer and hed look himself over and he my head that proves it ive got body thats the reason because people were mean to thats why i have body you can ask person and solve the entire service facsimile that was described in 1952 simply by asking that person what would it get you out of what would it get you into you ask him these questions alternately oh yes you have bad arm all right now whatll that get you out of now whatll it get you into okay fine whatll it get you out of all right fine whatll it get you into fine thats fine and then you could finish it up if you had that flat with all right what can you prove with it and youd find out he had whole category of things he could prove with this psychosomatic illness so i think that in treating psychosomatic illness we are running straight up against the computation of thetan that he ought to have some sensation and that any sensation is better than sensation and that he should have something with which to gain little sympathy and to prove his lack of guilt because when we touch these buttons all of these fancy psychosomatic illnesses that are so beautifully described and cataloged endlessly fade away l ron hubbard
