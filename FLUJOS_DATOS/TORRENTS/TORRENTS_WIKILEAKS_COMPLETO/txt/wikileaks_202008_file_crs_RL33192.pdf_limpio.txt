administration in the 1980s has been whether nuclear cooperation with the prc would be necessary to advance us diplomatic security and economic interests there were tensions in the framework for bilateral relations that informed us considerations of peaceful nuclear cooperation while the prc under the rule of the communist party of china already possessed nuclear weapons the prc also has had record of nuclear proliferation to countries such as pakistan and iran 2 the united states and the prc have not been allies nonetheless in 1970 president nixon began rapprochement with communist party ruler mao zedong and both countries cooperated in various areas during the cold war until the disintegration of the soviet union in 1991 nuclear cooperation involves weighing risks and benefits the risks include nuclear proliferation and upgrading technology and knowledge that also might have military uses the benefits involve expanding engagement building mutual confidence and enabling us businesses to compete for potentially lucrative nuclear power contracts increased nuclear power in chinas electricity generation also could have slight impact on its demand for oil and emission of greenhouse gas g16g158g140g149g142g138g155g561g18g152g160g142g155g561g15g138g155g148g142g157g561 after prc rulers led by deng xiaoping began to reform the economy in 1978 china announced plans for purchasing foreign nuclear power reactors to provide energy for economic modernization according to those initial plans china desired total of 10000 megawatts of nuclear power or 5 of total electrical capacity by 2000 the acquisitions were estimated to be worth 1020 billion 3 however by 1999 nuclear power accounted for only about 1 of electricity generation in china4 in april 2004 vice president dick cheney visited beijing and discussed with politburo standing committee member and prc vice president zeng qinghong chinas plans to build 24 to 30 nuclear power reactors by 2020 at the cost of 15 billion for each plant presumably china would then draw 45 of its electricity from nuclear power expanded from 12 in 20035 on february 28 2005 westinghouse submitted bid to sell four nuclear power

cooperation agreement with china linked possible us nuclear exports to china with its reported nuclear proliferation practices particularly in pakistan7 before an agreement was finalized senators gordon humphrey william roth and william proxmire wrote to cretary of state george shultz in december 1983 they urged that an agreement be drafted so that none of the provisions of the nuclear nonproliferation act of 1978 would be waived they also wrote that the agreement should include explicit pledges by china not to transfer any nuclear weapons equipment or information to any nation to support the us requirement for recipients to accept the international atomic energy agency iaeas safeguards on nuclear exports and to enter into an agreement with the iaea to place chinas civilian

states and said that we do not engage in nuclear proliferation ourselves nor do we help other countries develop nuclear weapons13 that promise left question about any future activities later on january 19 1985 prc vice premier li peng issued an additional nonproliferation pledge saying that the prc does not and will not in the future help any nonnuclear states to develop nuclear weapons and that china would abide by commitments to the iaea14 still questions remained about whether there would be written pledges and whether any such assurances would be publicly issued by china itself rather than the united states expressing its interpretation of an understanding reached with china either verbally or in writing

unique among agreements for peaceful nuclear cooperation concluded since the 1978 nuclear nonproliferation act it is the first such agreement with nuclearweapon state and it is with country that has not until recently supported non proliferation measures although the agreement was initialed in april 1984 we needed to clarify certain matters related to implementation of chinas nuclear policies those discussions concluded successfully last month major threat to our nonproliferation objectives is the potential for maverick suppliers to undercut the safeguards and other controls established through international cooperation and consensus in the past chinas policies were cause for concern because it ne ither adhered to that consensus nor accepted other nonproliferation norms emphasis added adelman also noted that few of the major provisions in the agreement were subject to long and difficult negotiations we have had detailed discussions on what it means in practice not to assist other countries to acquire nuclear explosives we understand that chinas policy will be implemented in manner consistent with those basic nonproliferation practices common to the united states and other major suppliers the united states sought chinas acceptance of iaea safeguards on us supply under the agreement but they adamantly refused to accept that condition emphasis added finally adelman argued that the agreement for us exports provided for mutually acceptable arrangements in the future to be established prior to approval of us exports that will include exchanges of information and visits by us government personnel to relevant sites in china where material or equipment subject to the agreement will be stored or used he also contended that reprocessing of us origin material cannot take place without us consent he concluded that it will be important to ensure that the specific arrangements provide adequate confidence that any material or equipment subject to the agreement will be used only for purposes consistent with the agreement17 emphasis added adelman also submitted acdas nuclear proliferation assessment statement that detailed the reagan administrations justification for the agr eement with china pursuant to section 123a of the atomic energy act18 acda reached favorable net assessment of the adequacy of the provisions of the proposed agreement to ensure that any assistance furnished thereunder will not be used to further any military or nuclear explosive purpose it also concluded that execution of the proposed agreement would advance the nonproliferation program policy and objectives of the united states g18g155g152g149g146g143g142g155g138g157g146g152g151g561g5g152g151g140g142g155g151g156g561 in contrast thomas roberts acting chairman of the nuclear regulatory commission nrc wrote memorandum to president reagan that offered different assessment he referred to reviewing not only the state departments proposed agreement but also an accompanying agreed minute he wrote that he agreed with the state department that the agreement met the legal requirements of section 123 of the atomic energy act and the nuclear nonproliferation 17

roberts wrote of concerns about t he adequacy of certain assurances provided by the prc he wrote that we also note that although we believe the requirements of section 123 are satisfied we would have preferred that the agreement contain clear statement of us consent rights for the subsequent reprocessing or enrichment of u ssupplied nuclear reactor fuel or fuel used in ussupplied reactors such statement would eliminate the potential for future misunderstandings our final observation is that the agreement contains provision which would expressly qualify the authority of the congress to enact subsequent legislation affecting the activities covered by the agreement previous agreements for cooperation with other countries have not contained such provision the provision could reduce the flexibility of the united states in the future 19 g8g152g155g150g138g149g561g21g158g139g150g146g156g156g146g152g151g561 on july 24 1985 president reagan submitted to congress the agreement between the united states and the peoples republic of china c oncerning peaceful uses of nuclear energy pursuant to sections 123b and 123d of the atomic energy act of 1954 as amended in his transmittal message reagan did not refer to the nrcs concerns the memorandum cited above was classified at the time he noted that the proposed agreement was the first peaceful nuclear cooperation agreement with communist country and the only such agreement with another nuclearweapon state because cooperation with the united kingdom and france was covered by us agreements with the european atomic energy community or euratom the president first cited chinas ambitious plans for substantial number of nuclear power stations he pointed to chinas steps to clarify its nonproliferation and nuclear export policies including premier zhaos statement but reagan did not mention prc practices he referred to bilateral talks rather than statements or agreements and said that we can expect that chinas policy of not assisting nonnuclear weapon state to acquire nuclear explosives will be implemented in manner consistent with the basic nonproliferation practices common to the united states and other suppliers as benefits for us interests the president wrote that the agreement would have significant positive impact on overall uschina relations provide the united states and its companies an opportunity to participate in another aspect of chinas energy programs with possible substantial economic benefit and further the nonproliferation and other foreign policy interests of the united states reagan argued that the agreement would not constitute an unreasonable risk to common defense and security he noted that he was submitting the agreement to congress without exempting it from any requirement

30 days of continuous session under section 123b to be followed by 60 days of continuous session under section 123d of the atomic energy act chaired by re presentative dante fascell the house foreign affairs committee held hearing on july 31 1985 secretary of energy john herrington acda director kenneth adelman ambassador for non proliferation richard kennedy and assistant secretary of state paul wolfowitz testified members debated number of issues raised in particular by representative edward markey chairman of the house energy and commerce subcommittee on energy conservation and power who testified and submitted his legal analysis of the proposed agreement21 safeguards and prior approvals representative markey raised objections about the agreement saying that it contained the same lax terms as the draft that was initialed in 1984 objections based on lack of guaranty that safeguards will be maintained for us nuclear materials and equipment to ensure peaceful use lack of guaran ty of prior approval by the united states of any reprocessing enrichment or alteration of nuclear material and concerns about chinas nuclear exports and technical assistance with other countries he asserted that instead of obtaining tightening of the language of the agreement the administration reportedly has spent the last year providing itself with classified assurances that the shadowy chinese technicians purportedly working at pakistans renegade kahuta uranium enrichment plant have disappeared and that china is longer exporting unsafeguarded supplies of heavy water and lowenriched uranium to other threshold nuclearweapon states such as argentina and south africa it is not enough that the administration satisfy itself on this count 22 unilateral understanding of verbal assurances representative markey also contended that the assurances from china were actually assurances in secret memorandum or nonpaper of the state department in his written statement he reported that ambassador kennedy reportedly resorted to the device of writing down his own classified understanding of chinas new improved nonproliferation policy while declining to sign this ingenious document responsible chinese officials reportedly nodded their assent and kennedy raced back to washington to report this triumph of diplomacy to the president ambassador kennedy testified that the chinese understood us legal requirements said they had plans to undertake activities in question and were concerned about whether the united states would give timely response kennedy also testified that the chinese made it clear that when they say that they will not assist other countries to develop nuclear weapons this also applies to all nuclear explosives acknowledging that it was in question 23 during meeting of the committee to markup legislation in november 1985 deputy assistant secretary of state james devine confirmed representative dan burtons assertion of confidential summaries of discussions that were not in writing devine said that the prc assured us orally that they would require safeguards on their own exports 21 house committee on foreign affairs proposed nuclear

proposed agreement did not reconcile with all the requirements of the atomic energy act and so the president should re submit the agreement with exemption from the criteria for safeguards and prior consent as stipulated in the proxmire amendment to the export administration act that amended the atomic energy act congressional procedure in his legal memo representative markey wrote that the agreement did not satisfy the requirements of section 123a1 and 123a7 on safeguards and prior approval24 section 123d provides further that an agreement for cooperation exempted by the president pursuant to subsection from any requirement contained in that subsection shall not become effective unless the congress adopts and there is enacted joint resolution stating that the congress does favor such agreement representative markey advised that after asking the president to resubmit the agreement with an exemption from the strict terms of those sections the congress would then be in position to make an affirmative decision as to whether the benefits of this particular agreement outweigh the damages which would flow from deviating from united states longterm nonproliferation policy china as nuclear power in the hearing representative william broomfield pointed out that china was already nuclear weapon state representative markey later noted that the agreement stated that transferred material facilities or components and material used in or produced through the use of the supplies shall not be used for any nuclear explosive device or research specifically on or development of any nuclear explosive device or for any military purpose but did not provide for safeguards to ensure this intent proliferation risk as for the risk of nuclear proliferation to other countries representative markey urged his colleagues at the hearing to obtain top secret classified briefings from the nrc and the central intelligence agency in order to understand some unresolved questions that the nrc and others have with respect to the retransfer of nuclear materials and technology he referred to suspected temporary suspension in chinas cooperation with pakistans nuclear program to coincide with the proposed agreement progress in nonproliferation policy representative henry hyde said that the notion of consultations which are provided by article 8 does provide the right to visit and to exchangenot simply talk he argued that getting closed society to open up and allow us this opportunity to visit and exchange and the potential to influence their policy seems to move forward representative benjamin gilman also asked hasnt negotiation of this agreement served our nonproliferation interests by helping china adopt more supportive approach to nonproliferation nonproliferation standards representative stephen solarz asked even in worse case scenario where the chinese reneged on their commitments or it turns out that their understanding of the commitments differed from ourselves and they utilize some of the technology we transferred for the purpose of he lping other countries develop nuclear weapons could they not have done that anyway even without this agreement if so what do we lose by approving this agreement when potentially it might work in bringing them into the 24 representative edward markey legal analysis of the agreement for peaceful

in terms of full scope safeguards and other things in turn representative markey asked if we decline to establish by both law and practice clear objective standard on what basis then do we turn to the pakistanis or to the south africans or to the indians or to the libyans or anyone else in the world and say there is still an objective standard for nuclear restraint he argued that we have to decide whether we want nonproliferation policy or policy of selective proliferation exception for china representative markey differed with the administration on whether china should be treated as an exception concerning the question of safeguards stating that we insisted that the united kingdom weapons state and our closest ally accept safeguards as part of our nuclear cooperation agreement so why not the chinese he said that under the provisions of the atomic energy act the peoples republic as nuclear weapons state is exempted from the iaea safeguards requirement however contrary to the agreements erroneous implication china is not altogether exempted from safeguards requirements precluding application of laws representative lawrence smith raised the question of whether the agreement waives the appropriate provisions of american law and makes only the agreement the underlying document on which violation could be claimed representative markey agreed that committing the united states to the nuclear cooperation agreement with china would provide the sole operative language for determining violations and nuclear transfers referring to the precedent of congressional debate in 1980 about whether the nuclear nonproliferation act of 1978 applied retroactively to an agreement for uranium exports to india representative markey asserted that this agreement ensures that subsequent language by the united states congress affects the activities covered by the agreement prejudice representative markey objected to the lack of guaranty of us prior approval for any reprocessing or enrichment of nuclear materials by china along with language to consider the activities favorably precedent representative markey also asked what the future holds if this vague elastic and unverifiable framework of cooperation becomes the standard for nuclear negotiations with other countries necessity for diplomacy and trade representative ted weiss said i think members of the congress fully appreciate the importance of cooperation diplomatically and strategically with the peoples republic of china as well as increased trade relations with the prc but i dont think that necessarily requires us to forego the requirements of law adopted by us after very careful consideration unresolved disputes and credibility representative dan burton raised the issue of chinas unresolved dispute with and threats to use force against taiwan he also raised the question of whether china could be trusted to enter into an agreement

warranted and exim bank considerations of loans for us exporters to china were returned to normal that year congress responded to the administrations determination not to impose sanctions by adding language on persons in the exportimport bank act as amended by section 1303 of the national defense authorization act for fy1997 pl 104201 enacted on september 23 1996 57

constructed however the ap1000 received final design approval from the nuclear regulatory commission nrc on ptember 13 2004 the nrc approved the design certification in december 2005 as standard plant that could be built in the united states without further review the 1100megawatt ap1000 is an improved version of existing westinghouse commercial nuclear power plants westinghouse pressurized water reactors use light ordinary water to help sustain the chain reaction in the reactor core and to carry away the resulting heat the heated water circulates under pressure in closed loop through heat exchangers that make steam to drive electric generators this basic westinghouse pressurized water technology is dominant in the us nuclear power industry and through licensing arrangements in most of the world technological benefits that china might gain from purchasing the westinghouse reactor as opposed to its french competitor are likely to be modest china already has four operating commercial reactors supplied by areva using update d versions of french reactors originally built under nowexpired westinghouse license in the competition for the latest contract in china both westinghouse and areva contended that they offered the most advanced designs available 56 timothy p carney us to fund chinese agency aiding iranian and pakistani nukes human events online march 2 2005 57 for detailed

sale on chinas nuclear weapons program china has been nuclear weapons state since 1964 and already has reactors designed for producing weapons materials light water reactors such as the westinghouse and areva designs are poorly suited for weapons production in contrast to the prc situation the united states opposes russias light water reactor construction in iran because iran is not nuclear weapons state and appears to be using its nuclear power program as pretext for developing other nuclear fuel cycle facilities that could be used to make weapons indirect benefits that the westinghouse contract might provide to chinas already existing nuclear weapons and nuclearpowered submarine programs ar inherently difficult to assess while there might not be significant concern about specific technology transfer to civilian nuclear power plants there are general concerns about any dualuse transfers to china particularly with involvement by prc nuclear engineers in the westinghouse projects staff member for senate banking committee chairman richard shelby was q uoted as saying there is an inevitable tension that exists between the desire to suppo rt us commercial interests abroad on the one hand and the requirement to ensure national security is not endangered through the advancement of those commercial interests 58 westinghouses commercial interest in the prc contract are considerable the project would give the company the opportunity to build working model of the ap1000 design and gain foothold in the potentially large chinese nuclear power market although new commercial nuclear power plants have been ordered in the united states since 1978 several us utilities are now studying the feasibility of new reactors and the successful construction of the ap1000 design in china could be an important factor in their decisions nuclear power incentives included in the energy policy act of 2005 pl 10958 have further increased interest in renewed us reactor construction because the prc contract envisions series of four reactors westinghouse could also cover some of its first of kind engineering foake costs for the ap1000 and gain some production economies which could help reduce the price for future buyers some foake costs for the ap1000 are also expected to be paid by the department of energys nuclear power 2010 program westinghouse and other nuclear suppliers have long contended that new nuclear power plants could be competitive if sufficient number of identical reactors were built in series

mou that granted the deal to westinghouse secretary bodman said that the agreement would lead to multibillion dollar sale that could create as many as 5500 jobs in the united states he also said that westinghouse agreed to transfer technology to china that could lead to the construction of many more nuclear power reactors in china over 1520 years while nuclear power provided 15 of energy that share could increase to 4 if china completes construction of 30 new reactors over 15 years 59 while the plan is ambitious nuclear power would be limited source of power generation in china 58 timothy
