summary throughout the united states there exists substantial variation both across and within states in perpupil expenditures on elementary and secondary education perceived inadequacies in the amount of funding provided for education and concerns about the equity of its distribution have led to education finance systems being challenged in the courts in many states mostly on state constitutional grounds while much of the responsibility for resolving education finance policy issues has been relegated to the states the congress has identified federal role in influencin g the amount and the distribution of education expenditures across school districts education finance incentive grants are allocated according to one of the four allocation formulas authorized under esea title i part for providing federal education funding to the states for the education of disadvantaged pupils the education finance incentive grant formula is unique in that it accounts for various characteristics of states elementary and secondary education finance system in determining states grant allocation in addition to the number of disadvantaged children funds are awarded under the formula according to variables that account for the average level of perpupil expenditures in the state and the degree to which the states education finance system minimizes disparities in the distribution of expenditures across local educational agencies for fy2002 793499000 has been appropriated for the allocation of education finance incentive grants under title ia this report estimates the amount of funds that will be awarded to each state according to the formula and also describes how the grants reward states that have education finance systems with characteristics favored by the formula this is accomplished by comparing estimated education finance incentive grant awards to states with what states otherwise might have received had the funding appropriated for allocation according to the education finance incentive grant formula been awarded proportionally under the other three title ia formula grants our estimates show distinct but modest reward or incentive to

act of 2001 esea section 1001education finance incentive grants under esea title i throughout the united states there exists substantial variation both across and within states in perpupil expenditures on elementary and secondary education much of this variation has to do with the disparate systems employed by the states for organizing and funding local educational agencies leas or school districts the number and type of districts vary from one state to another with some states having only one district and others over thousand some states have only unified districts elementary and secondary combined while others have mix of unified elementary only secondaryonly and other special purpose districts states also differ in how they derive and allocate funding for elementary and secondary education some states rely heavily on locally derived funding for education primarily generated from property taxes others provide substantial amount of state funding usually derived from income or sales taxes typically locally derived funding is retained within the district from which it is generated with the amount of funding per pupil tending to vary from one district to another according to locally approved tax rates and property values state funding tends to be allocated either evenly across districts on perpupil basis or used to provide proportionately more funding to poorer districts funding disparities in many states school finance systems have resulted in the legality of such systems being challenged on state constitutional grounds though not always with success1 while much of the responsibility for resolving education finance policy issues has been relegated to the states the congress has identified federal role in influencing the amount and distribution of education expenditures across school districts esea title i improving the academic achievement of the disadvantaged authorizes the appropriation of federal funds to be distributed to states and leas for purposes to include ensuring that all children have fair equal and significant opportunity to obtain highquality education and reach at minimum proficiency on challenging state academic achievement standards and state academic assessments and distributing and targeting resources sufficiently to make difference to local educational agencies and schools where needs are greatest2 to accomplish these purposes the congress has authorized four formulabased grants under esea title i part basic grants concentration grants targeted grants and education finance incentive grantshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31256crs2 3for discussion and analysis of the education finance incentive grant program as authorized under pl 103382 see crs report 94968 education for the

authorized the allocation of education finance incentive grants under pl 103382 the improving americas schools act iasa of 1994 which amended and extended the esea however the congress had never appropriated funding for the allocation of grants3 the 107th congress amended and extended the authorization to allocate education finance incentive grants under pl 107110 the child left behind act of 2001 and appropriated 793499000 for the allocation of grants during the 20022003 school year4 education finance incentive grants are to be allocated to states according to formula that rewards states with higher perpupil expenditures and less disparity in the distribution of expenditures across districts it penalizes states that have lower per pupil expenditures and greater disparity in the distribution of education expenditures the formula for awarding grants to states accounts for state perpupil expenditures as portion of state percapita income adjusted relative to national averages and the equity of expenditures across leas within state as well as state average perpupil expenditures and the number of disadvantaged children residing within the state as is done in the basic concentration and targeted grant formulas subgrants are awarded to leas within the states according to formula with weights applied to either the number or the proportion of disadvantaged children enrolled in district weights are greater in states with greater disparities in their school finance systems education finance incentive grant formula state grants the education finance incentive grant formula is distinguished from the other title ia formulas in that states grant allocation is determined not only by the number of eligible children in the state and state expenditure factor but also by characteristics of its elementary and secondary education finance system the state grant formula contains four variables population factor an expenditure factor an effort factor and an equity factor funds are allocated to states proportionally according to the product of the population factor the expenditure factor the effort factor and 130 minus the equity factor after accounting for minimum state grant amount5 each variable is described belowhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31256crs3 5continued without applying any weighting factors 6the bounds under this formula are marginally narrower than for the other three title ia formulas where they are 32 and 48 for fy2002 the expenditure factor for puerto rico is set at 34 of the percentage that puerto ricos perpupil expenditures is of that of the lowest states except that this percentage shall be at least be 775 this percentage is set to increase annually reaching 100 in fy2007 for fy2002 the expenditure factor for puerto rico is 2635 of the national averagepopulation factor the population factor is the number of children aged 5 to 17 as counted in the esea title i basic grant formula this includes children from families below the poverty line children in families receiving temporary assistance for needy families tanf payments in excess of the poverty income threshold for family of four and children in institutions for neglected and delinquent children or who are being supported in foster homes with public funds whether or not they are from family below the poverty line this factor has the greatest effect of the four in determining the size of each states grant expenditure factor the expenditure factor is defined as 40 of the average perpupil expenditures in the state but is constrained between 34 and 46 of the average perpupil expenditures in the united states6 the expenditure factor is measure of the level of perpupil expenditures in the state and is unadjusted for state or regional economic conditions constraining the expenditure factor between these bounds limits its effect in determining states grant award for those states whose expenditure factor otherwise would be beyond these bounds effort factor the effort factor is calculated using state and national data and is measure of average perpupil state and local expenditures for elementary and secondary education as proportion of state percapita income relative to national averages of perpupil expenditures as proportion of percapita income this factor is calculated using data averaged over the 3 most recent years with the result limited by the bounds of 095 and 105 an effort factor greater than 10 indicates that states perpupil education expenditures as proportion of state percapita income are greater than the national average while an effort factor less then 10 indicates that the states education expenditures are less than the national average the effort factor is distinguished from the expenditure factor in that for each state the effort factor depicts the portion of each individuals income devoted toward the education of each child relative to the national average whereas the expenditure factor merely depicts perpupil expenditures on average bounding the effort factor between 095 and 105 limits its effect in determining states grant allocation for those states whose effort factor otherwise would be beyond the bounds for instance the effort factor in the state with the highest effort factor west virginia is reduced from 138 to 105 and the effort factor in the state with the lowest effort factor utah is increased from 0785 to 095 the bounds of 095 and 105 reduce the effort factor to 105 in 17 states and raise it to 095 in 17 states the effort factor for puerto rico is set at that of the lowest statehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31256crs4 7this weighting factor is employed to reduce the measured level of disparity from what otherwise would be the result in instances where spending on behalf of highneed pupils from poor families is higher than spending for other pupils otherwise there would be disincentive for states and leas to spend more on highneed pupils from poor families than on other pupils and this would counterbalance the intended effect of the education finance incentive grant 8a special rule applies to the equity factor in that for states that meet the disparity standard described in 34 cfr 222162 essentially if disparities in current expenditures or revenues per pupil are more than 25 excluding leas above the 95th and below the 5th percentiles as of the day preceding the enactment of the child left behind act of 2001 and for states with only one lea the equity factor shall not be greater than 010 in such instances we have assumed that the equity factor shall be the lesser of states calculated equity factor or 010 the equity factor was set at 010 for three states meeting the disparity standard alaska kansas and new mexico and at 00 for three singlelea jurisdictions district of columbia hawaii and puerto ricoequity factor the equity factor is measure of how evenly perpupil elementary and secondary education funding is distributed across leas within state this factor is determined by taking the coefficient of variation in lea perpupil expenditures with leas weighted according to total enrollment and with title i eligible pupils weighted by factor of 147 the coefficient of variation is measure of dispersion and is calculated for set of observatio ns by dividing the standard deviation by the mean it is useful for comparing relative dispersion across sets of observations each with different mean as in this instance with lea perpupil expenditures in each state dispersed around different mean lower coefficient of variation reflects greater equality in order for the effect of the equity factor variable to be greater in states with lower disparities than in those with greater disparities the equity factor is subtracted from 13 when included in the education finance incentive grant formula under the formula the equity factor is calculated using expenditure data only for school districts with enrollments greater than 200 to eliminate distortions that might be caused by very small districts which in many cases have very high per pupil expenditures in our calculations we also excluded expenditure data for vocational and special education districts that might have exceptionally high perpupil expenditures8 education finance incentive grant formula lea subgrants education finance incentive subgrants to leas are to be allocated according to formula that increasingly weights title ieligible pupils as either their total number or their proportion of lea total enrollment increases in addition there is greater rate of increase in the weights applied to title ieligible pupils in states where expenditures per pupil are more equal across leas than in states where perpupil expenditures are less equal lea subgrants are to be determined using the greater of the weighted number of title ieligible pupils as determined according to scale based on number of eligible pupils constituting various proportions of total enrollment or according to scale based on the count of eligible pupils in an lea the coefficients used to weight title ieligible pupils in the allocation of lea subgrants according to both methods are presented in table 1 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31256crs5 table 1 weights for determining lea subgrants based on number of eligible children as of total enrollment eligible children in leastate equity

between 7852 and 35514 2500 3375 4500 greater than 35514 3000 4500 6000 an example will help illustrate how lea subgrants would be calculated if state had an equity factor of 015 the weights in the center column would be used for calculating lea subgrants for all leas in that state to determine particular leas subgrant one would first calculate the weighted pupil count based on the proportion of title ieligible children in the lea if for example there were 1000 pupils in the lea and 310 were eligible for title i then weight of 1000 would be applied to the first 155 pupils ie the first 1558 of title ieligible pupils weight of 1500 applied to the next 66 pupils those between 1558 and 2211 of all eligible pupils weight of 3000 applied to the next 80 pupils those between 2211 and 3016 of eligible pupils and weight of 4500 applied to the remaining nine pupils those constituting between 3016 and 3824 of eligible pupils this would result in weighted pupil count of 5345 pupils next the weighted pupil count would be calculated based on count of the number of eligible children under this method weight of 1000 would be applied to each of the 310 pupils ie those constituting less than the first 691 title ieligible pupils for weighted pupil count of 310 the greater of these two pupil counts 5345 would be used to determine the lea subgrant if this hypothetical lea were in state with an equity factor either less than 010 or greater than or equal to 020 then the weights in the other respective columns would be used estimates of state grants we now turn to estimating the education finance incentive grants to be provided to each state for fy2002 after reserving 1 of the appropriated funds for thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31256crs6 9the small state minimum applies to nine states alaska delaware idaho montana new hampshire north dakota south dakota vermont and wyoming 10the state minimum is up to 035 for all funds allocated under the education finance incentive grant formula but is only up to 025 for substantial majority of the funds allocated under the other three title ia formulasoutlying areas and the bureau of indian affairs these estimates are presented in table 2 along with each states expenditure effort and equity factors as well as per pupil grant amounts as previously noted while each states grant is dependent largely upon the number of title ieligible pupils in the state the expenditure effort and equity factors determine the amount of states incentive according to characteristics of its education finance system for several small states however the small state minimum effectively determines the size of states grant irrespective of states expenditure effort or equity factors9 while table 2 displays the expenditure effort and equity factors and estimated grant allocatio n for each state it is difficult to perceive how the interaction of the variables in the education finance incentive grant formula determines each states grant allocation to illustrate what might be termed the incentive effect of the formula we estimate the difference between the amount of funds that will be awarded to the states as education finance incentive grants and the amount that otherwise might have been be awarded to the states hypothetically had the same amount of funds been allocated proportionally across the other three title i grants basic concentration and targeted grants which as previously mentioned do not account for relative effort or equity in states education finance system this resulting difference may be considered the incentive provided through the grant allocation formula for states to maintain elementary and secondary education finance systems with relatively higher levels of perpupil expenditures and greater evenness in the distribution of perpupil expenditures across leas these estimates are provided in table 3 as can be seen in table 3 there is wide variation from state to state in the difference between what will be allocated under the education finance incentive grant formula and what otherwise would be allocated were such funds awarded instead under the other three title i grant allocation formulas for instance the estimated grant amount is 324 higher than it might otherwise have been for south dakota while it is 145 lower than it might otherwise have been for illinois however while the incentive effect for south dakota is large this grant amount and that for eight other small states is determine d by the small state minimum rather than by the incentive effects of the grant formula10 of the states for which the small state minimum is not applicable the greatest incentive effect is for iowa at 179 table 3 clearly indicates that the education finance incentive grant formula is redistributative in nature providing more funding than otherwise might be available to those states with moderate to high perpupil expenditures and those with lower disparities across leas in the level of state and local perpupil expenditures at the expense of those states that fund elementary and secondary education at lower level or with greater disparities across leashttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31256crs7
