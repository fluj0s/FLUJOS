this report focuses on several key topics centennial initiative president bushs national park centennial initiative seeks to add up to 3 billion for national park units over 10 years through 1 an additional 1000 million annually in discretionary funds 2 public donations of least 1000 million annually and 3 federa l match of the pub lic donations with up to 1000 million annually legislation to establish mandatory matching program along the lines of the presiden ts initiative has been introduced hr 2959 and s 1253 while hr 3094 and s 2817 w ould take different approach maintenance backlog attention has focused on the npss maintenance backlog estimates of the backlog have increased from an average of 425 billion in fy1999 to 961 billion in fy2007 it is unc lear what portion may be attributable to better estimates or the ddition of maintenance work not done on time the nps has been defining and quantifying its maintenance needs through comprehensive condition assessments of facilities the results are being used in part to determine the allocation of maintenance funding and to identify assets for disposal hr 1731 seeks to eliminate the nps annual operating defi cit and maintenance backlog science in the parks various sciencerelated activities pertain to park management one involves monitoring and protecting air quality the regional haze issue another is possible comme rcialization bioprospecting of unique organisms found in some park units the nps is developing proposal on benefits sharing agreements for using the results of research on organisms in parks third sciencerelated issue is research in the parks the nps receives funds for natural and cultural research programs security the nps has sought to enhance secu rity of park units with efforts focused on national icons and park units along internati onal borders evaluations of park police and security operations have been mixed several bills pertaining to immigration reform and border security contain provisions to enhance security at park units along us borders the pres ident is seeking additional funding for fy2009 for park police and law enforcement wild and scenic rivers the wild and scenic rivers system preserves free flowing rivers which are designated by congress or through state nomination with approval by the secretary of the interior the nps manages 37 river units totaling 30437 miles the nps and ot her federal agencies with management responsibility prepare management plans to protect river values management of lands within river corridors is sometimes controversial in part because of the possible effects of designation on private lands and of corri dor activities on the rivers pl 110229 established the eightmile wild and scenic river legislation

service nps in the department of the interior doi manages 391 units including units formally entitled national parks and host of other designations1 the system has more than 84 million acres2 the nps had an appropriation of about 239 billion for fy2008 for fy2009 the administration requested 240 billion fy2009 ppropriations have not been enacted to date the nps estimates its vel of employment at 20739 ftes for fy2008 and seeks funding for 21649 ftes for fy20093 the nps statutory mission is multifaceted to conserve preserve protect and interpret the natural cultural and historic resources of the nation for the public and to provide for their use and enjoyment by the public the use and preservation of resources has appeared to some as cont radictory and has re sulted in management challenges attention centers on how to balance the recreational use of parklands with the preservation of park resources nd determine appropriate levels and sources of funding to maintain n ps facilities and to manage n ps programs in general activities that harvest or remove resources from units of the system are not allowed the nps also supports the preservation of natural and historic places and promotes recreation outside the system through gr ant and technical assistance programs the establishment of seve ral national parks preceded the 1916 creation of the national park service nps as the park system management agency congress established the nations firs t national park yellowst one national park in 1872 the park was created in the thenterritories of montana and wyoming for the benefit and enjoyment of the people and placed under the exclusive control of the secretary of the interior 16 usc 2122 in the 1890s and early 1900s congress created several ot her national parks mostly from western public domain lands including sequoia yosemite mount ra inier crater lake and glacier inhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33484crs2 addition to the desire to preserve nature there was interest in promoting tourism western railroads often recipi ents of vast public land gran ts were advocates of many of the early parks and built grand hotels in them to support their business there also were efforts to protect the sites and structures of early native american cultures and other special site s the antiquities act of 1906 authorized the president to proclaim na tional monuments on federal nds that contain historic landmarks historic and prehistoric struct ures and other objects of historic or scientific interest 16 usc 431 most nationa l monuments are managed by the nps for more information see crs report rs20902 national monument issues by carol hardy vincent there was system of national parks and monuments until 1916 when president wilson signed law creating the nps to manage and protect the national parks and many of the monuments that organic act provided that the nps shall promote and regulate the use of the federal areas known as national parks monuments and reservations to conserve the scenery and the natural and historic objects and the wild life therein and to provide for the enjoyment of the same in such manner and by such means as will leave them unimpaired for the enjoyment of future generations 16 usc 1 president fr anklin d roosevelt greatly expanded the system of parks in 1933 by transferring 63 national monuments and historic military sites from the usda forest service and the war department to the nps the 110th congress is considering legisla tion or conducting oversight on many npsrelated topics severa l major topics are covered

repor t rl 33525 recreation on federal lands coordinated by kori calver t and carol hardy vincent current issues centennial initiative by carol hardy vincent to be ready for the npss 100th anniversary in 2016 the administration and congress have proposed multiyear initiatives to strengthen visitor services and other park programs the national park centenni initiative first announced by president bush in august 2006 seeks to add up to 3 billion in new funds for the parks over 10 years through joint publicprivate ffort the initiative has three components 1 commitment to add 1000 million annually in disc retionary funds 2 challenge for the public to donate at least 1000 million annually and 3 commitment to match the public donations with federal funds of up to 1000 million annually in furtherance of the first compone nt of the initiative for fy2009 the administration requested add itional funds within the li ne item operation of the national park system specifically the administration is seeking total of 213 billion in park operations for fy2009 an increase of 1609 million over the fy2008 level of 197 billi on fy 2009 appropriations for nps programs have not been enacted to date the administration also had sought and received an increase in park operations for fy2008 the first ear of the centennial initiative for the third component of the initiative the president proposed establishing mandatory program with 1000 million annua lly for 10 years to match private donations companion legislation hr 2959 and s 1253 has been introduced to create mandatory program along the lines of the presidents initiative the bills would establish the national park cent ennial challenge fund in the treasury consisting of cash donations and matching appr opriations from the general fund of the treasury the match may not exceed 1000 million for each of 10 years beginning with fy2008 the funds are ava ilable without furt her appropriation to finance signature projects and programs these projects and programs will be identified by the nps director as helpin g prepare the national parks for another century of conservation pres ervation and enjoyment another house bill hr 3094 also woul d establish nationa l park centennial fund in the treasury but would take diffe rent approach it would consist of 300 million annually over 10 years the funds would be available beginning withhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33484crs4 4 house committee on natural resources national park cent ennial fund act hrept 110 795 to accompany hr 3094 p 10 hereafter hrept 110795 5 for many years the annual interior appropriations laws typically have rescinded this authority for the pertinent fi scal year in the fy2009 nps budget submissi on the administration proposed permanently canc eling this contract authority 6 hrept 110795 p 12 7 hrept 110795 p 5 8 another house bill hr 1731 to establish national park centennial fund is described in the maintenance backlog section primary intent of th fund would be to eliminate the nps maintenance backlog fy2009 and would be available without fu rther appropriation the administration is to include list of proposals for f unding in its annual budget submissions to congress the proposals must be consistent with certain criteri and initiatives set out in the bill the bill specifies seven park initiatives in the areas of education diversity support for park pr ofessionals envir onmental leadership natural resource protection cultural resource pr otection and health and fitn ess matching funds would be required but the secretary of the interior may accept donations for centennial projects and programs the bill also provides 300 million offset for the centennial fund by repealing secti on 9 of the land and water conservation fund act4 that provision of law currently provides 300 million of nnual contract authority for federal land acquisitions5 in its cost estimate on the bill the congressional budget office estimates that this provision would have effect on direct spending because that contract authority is not presently used by the nps and cbo does not expect that it will be over the 20092018 period6 central issue of debate has been how to finance the centennial fund under hr 3094 as introduced the centenni fund was to consist of 1000 million annually with the funds derived from f ees for commercial activities on doi lands the secretary of the interior would have been required to promulgate regulations to establish new fees or increase existing fees for commercial activities including leases another approach was proposed during the markup of the bill by the committee on natural resources an amendment was offered to open the arctic national wildlife refuge to energy pr oduction to pay for the centennial fund7 that amendment was not agreed to still another financing mechanism is contained in s 2817 which would establish centennial fund with 1000 million annually essen tially over 10 years section 8 of the bill entitled offsets pr ovides for financing the fund with certain revenues from offshore oil and gas activities in the gulf of mexico and from the establishment and sale of special posta ge stamps like hr 3094 the bill also contains provisions requiring the admin istration to submit annually list of proposals for funding which must be cons istent with certain criteria and seven initiatives and allows the secretary of th interior to accept donations for projects and programs8 house and senate committees have held hearings on these legislative proposals one issue of discussion has been the role of philanthropic corporate foundation andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33484crs5 9 list of the approved projects and programs is on the nps website at httpwwwnpsgov2016other private donors in raising money for th parks some observers believe that nonfederal funding has been successful in expanding and enhancing variety of important park programs and is necessary to supplement shortfall in federal appropriations other observers are concer ned that nonfederal funding will lead to commercialization of national parks and excessive private influence over park operations related issues of debate at the hearings included whether to first seek private contributions and then provide federal match whether to provide federal funding without private matching re quirement and whether to allow noncash contributions other issues of discussion were how to finance the centennial fund the role of the nps and congress in dete rmining projects eligible for funding and which if any categories of funding eg natural resource protection to specify in legislation in furtherance of the third component of the administrations initiative the fy2008 appropriations law pl 110161 included 246 million to match private donations on april 24 2008 the nps released list of 110 projects that would be eligible to receive this funding to gether with 269 million in partnership contributions9 the appropriations committees and the administration have expressed that the fy2008 appr opriation is interim funding to initiate the program and an expectation that legislation will be enacted to create ten year program the administration has not request ed an annual appropriation fo r this matching program but rather seeks 1000 million per ear in mandatory funding the fy2009 budget resolution s conres 70 contains deficitneutral reserve fund for the national park centennial fund it would allow the chairman of the house committee on the budget to make adjustments to the amounts in the budget resolution to accommodate legi slation establishing the ce ntennial fund so long as that legislation were ficit neutral maintenance backlog by carol hardy vincent the nps has maintenance responsibility fo r buildings trails recreation sites and other infrastructure there is debate over the levels of f unds to maintain this infrastructure whether to use funds from other programs and how to balance the maintenance of the existing infrastructure with the acquisition of new assets congress continues to focus on the agencys deferred maintenance often called the maintenance backlog essentially main tenance that was not done when scheduled or planned doi estimates deferred maintenance for the nps for fy2007 based on varying assumptions at between 612 billion and 1311 billion with midrange figure of 961 billion fiftysix percent of the total deferred maintenance was for roads bridges and trails 19 was for bu ildings and 25 was for other structures while the other federal land management agencies the forest service fs bureau of land management blm and fish and wildlife service fws also have maintenance backlogs congressional and administrative attention has centered on the nps backlog for fy2007 the fs estimated its backlog at 566 billionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33484crs6 10 estimates are from doi and the fs and refl ect only direct project costs in accordance with requirements of the federal ccounting standards advisory board 11 us dept of the interior office of budget internal memorandum washington dc received march 11 2008 12 us dept of the interior national park service budget justifications and performance information fiscal year 2008 washington dc 2007 p overview2while doi estimated the fws backlog at between 224 billion and 303 billion and the blm backlog at between 038 billion and 046 billion the four agencies together had combined backlog estimated at between 1439 billion and 2226 billion with midrange figure of 1833 billion according to the agencies10 the nps and other agency backlogs have been ttributed to decades of funding shortfalls the agencies assert that continuing to fer maintenance of f acilities accelerates their rate of deterioration increases their re pair costs and decreases their value for fy2009 the adminis tration proposed 4715 million for total maintenance including cyclic regular and deferred maintenance fy2009 appropriations have not been enacted to date the request would be an increase of 10 from the 4303 million appropriated for fy2008 the administr ations budget focused on funds for cyclic maintenance with request for an additional 228 million for this purpose the administration is seeking these funds as way to prevent deterioration of facilities which increases the maintenan ce backlog however the budget did not specify the total portions of the maintenance request for deferred maintenance and for cyclic maintenance according to the doi budget office the administration is seeking 1897 million for nps deferred maintenance fo r fy2009 the appropriation for fy2008 was 2221 million about the sa level as ten years ago 2230 million for fy1999 over the ten ear period the appropriation peaked in fy2002 at 3642 million11 other funding for deferred mainte nance is provided through the nps construction appropriation fee r eceipts and the highway trust fund it is not possible to determine the total requested or appropriated for deferred maintenance for fy2009 from public documents doi estimates of the nps backlog have increased from an average of 425 billion in fy1999 to an average of 961 billion in fy2007 it is unclear what portion of the change is due to the add ition of maintenance work that was not done on time or the availability of more precise estimates of th backlog further it is unclear how much total funding has been provided for backlogged maintenance over this period annual presidential budget re quests and appropriations laws typically do not specify funds for backlogged mainte nance but instead combine funding for all nps construction facility operation and regular and deferre d maintenance in fy2002 the bush administration had proposed to eliminate the nps backlog estimated at 49 billion in 2002 over five years the nps budget justification for fy2008 stated that there had been an almost 5 billion fede ral investment in addressing the facility maintenance backlog12 the figure reflected total appropriations for line items of which deferred maintenance is only part specifically according to the nps it consis ted of appropriations for all nps facilityhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33484crs7 13 other legislation to create national park centennial fund is discussed above in the section entitled centennial initiativemaintenance nps construc tion and the nps park roads and parkway program funded through the federal highway adminis tration it also included fee receipts used for maintenance the nps has been defining and quantif ying its maintenance needs these efforts like those of other land mana gement agencies include developing computerized systems for tracking and prioritizing maintenance projects and collecting comprehensive data on the c ondition of fac ilities the first cycle of comprehensive condition assessments of nps facilities was completed by the end of fy2006 the nps uses two industry standard measurements of its facilities the asset priority index api is rating of each assets importance to the nps mission the facility condition index f ci quantifies the c ondition of facility by dividing the deferred maintenance backlog by the current replacement value of the facility these ratings are used in part to determine the allocation of maintenance funding among nps facilities they also are used to determine whether to retain assets given their condition and uses the nps like the other land management agencies is identifying for disposal assets that are not critical to the agencys mission and that are in relativel poor conditi on as one way to reduce the maintenance backlog legislation relating to the maintenance backlog of the nps has been reintroduced in the 110th congress hr 1731 seeks to eliminate the annual operating deficit and maintenance backlog in the na tional park system by the 2016 centennial anniversary of the nps the bill proposes the creation of the national park centennial fund in the treasury to be comprised of monies designated by taxpayers on their tax returns if monies from tax returns are insufficient to meet funding levels established in the bill th ey are to be supplemented by contributions to the centennial fund from the general fund of the treasury for fy2008 there would be deposited in the centennial fund 2000 million with an increase of 15 each year though fy2016 the fund is to be av ailable to the secretary of the interior without further appropriation as follows 60 to eliminate th nps maintenance backlog 20 to protect nps natural re sources and 20 to protect nps cultural resources after october 1 2016 money in the centennial fund is to be used to supplement annual appropriati ons for park operations the bill also would require the government accountability office gao to submit to congress biennial reports on the progress of congress in eliminating the nps defic it in operating funds and on the funding needs of national parks compar ed with park appropriations among other issues13 three bills that are on the senate calendar also relate to the nps maintenance backlog s 2807

quality the regional haze issue in the 1977 amendments to the clean air act congress established national goal of protecting class i areas most thenexisting na tional parks and wilderness areas from future visibility impairment and remedying any existing impairment resulting from manmade air pollution newly designated parks and wilderness areas can be classified as class i only by state actions they do not automatically become class i areas one program to control this regional haze is the prevention of significant deterioration psd program it provides that permits may not be issued to major new facilities within 100 kilome ters of class i area if federal land managers such as those at the nps assert that the emissions may cause or contribute to change in the air quality in class i area 42 usc 7457 in june 200714 the us environmental protection agency proposed changes in the psd rules to refine several aspects of the method that may be used to determine whether air quality in class i areas would be degraded by proposed activity proponents of the change contend that current rules are excessively restrictive opponents assert that the change would allow increased emissions from coalfired power plants in class i areas the nps monitors one or more air quality indicators at 60 park units and uses data from numerous state and local air quality monitoring stations located close to park units from these combined sources the nps rated 141 park units in its 2006 performance report covering the period 19962005 and concluded that 86 of the units showed stable or improving air quality trends generally 82 met national ambient air quality standards and 97 met visibility goals15 in august 2006 the national parks conservation ssociation released new report asserting that air pollution is among the most serious and wideranging problems facing the parks today weve made some important dvances but much more remains to be done16 the report includes 10 recommendations to
