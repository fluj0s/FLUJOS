resources science and industry division february 27 2007 abstract the energy policy act of 2005 pl 10958 enacted on august 8 2005 expanded some of the existing tax subsidies for the oil and gas industry and created several new ones the oil and gas tax incentives in epact05 were added on top of several existing special tax subsidies for oil and gas the industry also beneﬁts from provisions of current tax law that are not strictly tax subsidies or tax expenditures but that nevertheless provide advantages for and reduce eﬀective tax rates of the oil and gas industry the remainder of this report discusses these tax provisions in detail the ﬁrst section below discusses the origin and evolution of the oil and gas tax subsidies that were incorporated into the 2005 act the second section summarizes each of the oil and gas tax subsidy provisions in the 2005 energy act and reports its corresponding revenue loss estimate section three describes other oil and gas tax subsidies those that existed before epact05 and were generally not aﬀected by it the ﬁnal section describes several tax provisions that beneﬁt the oil and gas industry these are not tax subsidies per they are not considered to be tax expenditures but are deemed by some observers to confer excessive or unfair beneﬁts for the industryhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33763 order code rl33763 oil and gas tax subsidies

current status and analysis summary the clean energy act of 2007 hr 6 was introduced by the house democratic leadership to revise certain tax and royalty policies for oil and natural gas and to use the resulting revenue to suppor t reserve for energy efficiency and renewable energy title i proposes to repeal certain oil and natu ral gas tax subsidies and use the resulting revenue stream to support the reserve the congressional budget office cbo estimates that title i would repeal about 77 billion in oil and gas tax subsidies over the 10year pe riod from 2008 through 2017 in house floor debate opponents argued that the cut in oil and natural gas s ubsidies would dampen production cause job losses and lead to hi gher prices for gasoline and other fuels proponents counterargued that record prof its show that the oil and natural gas subsidies were not needed the bill passed the house on january 18 by vote of 264123 this report presents detailed review of oil and gas tax subsidies including those targeted for repeal by hr 6 the energy policy act of 2005 epact 05 pl 10958 included several oil and gas tax incentives providing about 26 b illion of tax cuts for the oil and gas industry in addition epact05 provided for 29 billion of tax increases on the oil and gas industry for net tax increase on the industry of nearly 300 million over 11 years energy tax increases comprise the oil spill liability tax and the leaking underground storage tank financing rate both of which are imposed on oil refineries if these taxes are subtracted from the tax subsidies the oil and gas refinery and distribution sector received net tax increase of 1356 million 2857 million minus 1501 million epact05 was approved and signed into law at time of very high petroleum and natural gas

other fuels opponents also complained that th proposal for the reserve does not identify specific policies and programs that woul d receive funding proponents of the bill counterargued that record profits show that the oil and natural gas incentives were not needed they also contended that the language that would create the reserve would allow it to be used to support variet of research and

industry these are not tax subsidies per they are not considered to be tax expenditures but are deemed by some observers to confer excessive or unfair benefits for the industry policy context and analysis tax incentives for oil and gas supply have historically been an integral if not the primary component of the nations ergy policy the domestic oil and gas industry was granted three tax code pref erences or subsidies 1 expensing of intangible drilling costs idcs and dry hole costs introduced in 1916 2 the percentage depletion allowance first acted in 1926 coal was added in 1932 and 3 capital gains treatment of the sale of oil and gas properties3 these tax subsidies reduced marginal effective ta x rates in the oil and gas industries reduced production costs and increased investments in locatin g reserves increased exploration they also led to more profita ble production some accelerati on of oil and gas production and more rapid depletion of energy resources than would otherwise occur partially in response to tax incentives but also due to the low cost of discovering and developing the huge new resource base th ere were discoveries during the 1930s of vast reserves in texas which led to period of overproduction of oil and gas and concomitant declines in pri ces which led to demand to prorationing under the texas railroad commission4 beginning in the 1970s and through much of the 1990s energy tax policy shifted away from fossil fuel supply and m oved toward energy conservation through both energy efficiency and the development of alternative and renewable fuels however rising and repeated spikes in petroleum prices that began around 2000 andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33763crs3 5 stripper well is one that produces small quantities of oil and natural gas the tax law currently defines this limit as 15 barrels of oil or the equivalent amount of natural gas per day the oil and gas industry defines it 10 barrels per day or less 6 although tax bill was passed that reduced taxes on oil and gas the 106th congress did enact package of 500 million in loan guarantees for small independent producers which became law pl 10651 in august 1999 7 after some existing energy tax incentives expired in 2003 the 108th congress enacted retroactive extension of several of the provisi ons as part of the working families tax relief act of 2004 pl 108311 that law which reduced revenues by about 13 billion over 10 years was enacted on october 4 2004 about 5 billion in energy tax incentives both expansion or liberalization of some of the more popular energy tax provisions as well as some new energy tax incentives were part of the american jobs creation act of 2004 pl 108357 enacted on october 22 2004were repeated over the next six years com bined with high and spiking natural gas prices an electricity crisis and bl ackouts caused policymakers to focus on increasing energy production and supply of many diverse energy sources including oil and gas the tax incentives for the oil and gas industry in the epact05 originated in the106th congresss effort in 1999 to help th ailing domestic oil and gas producing industry particularly small producers deal with depre ssed oil prices this situation fostered proposals for economic relief throug h the tax code particularly for small independent drillers and pr oducers proposals focused mainly on production tax credits for marginal or stripper well oil5 but they also included carryback provisions for net operating losses and othe r fossil fuel supply provisions6 subsequent comprehensive energy policy legislation including hr 4 in the107th congress proposed an expanded list of oil and gas tax incentives the energy tax breaks in this bill the securing americas future ener gy act of 2001 as approved by the house on august 1 2001 were larger in term s of tax revenue loss than any other comprehensive energy policy legislation pro posed during this period they also were larger than those proposed in epact05 335 billion of energy tax cuts compared with the 145 billion loss eventually enacted under pl 10958 interest in incentives and subsidies wa s boosted by the belief that much of the crisis was caused by insufficient domestic production capacity and supply all the early bills appeared to be weight ed more toward stimula ting the s upply of conventional fuels including capital inve stment incentives to stimulate production and transportation of oil and gas thes proposals were furt her repackaged and expanded into the first broadly based energy bills and comprehensive energy policy legislation such as hr 6 in the 109th that evolved further and ultimately b ecame epact057 the house approved the confer ence report on july 28 2005 and the senate on july 29 2005 clearing it for the presidents signature on august 8 pl 10958 the 2005 act became law at time of very high prices for crude oil petroleum products and natural gas nd record oil and gas

gas producers which however may be very largeextant tax subsidies and ot her tax advantages and 3 impose sizeable new taxes on the industry such as windfall profit tax8 public and congressional outcr did lead to paring back of one of the tax subsidies liberalized in the 2005 act twoyear amortization rather than capitalization of geological and geophysical gg activity costs including those associated with abandoned wells dry holes9 this exploration subsidy was the largest upstream tax subsidy as opposed to downstream or refinery subsidy in terms of federal revenue loss enacted under the 2005 act although it was and still is relatively small tax subsidy the tax increase prevention and reconciliation act pl 109222 signed into law in may 2006 reduced the value of the subsidy by raising the amortization period for major integrated oil companies from two years to five years still faster than the capitaliza tion treatment before the 2005 act but slower than the treatment under that act indepe ndent nonintegrated oil companies may continue to amortize all gg costs over two years this relatively minor cutback has not muted the calls for rolling back oil and gas tax subsidies as petroleum prices and industry profits remain somewhat high particularly those of the biggest oil nd gas companies on september 1 2006 the house democratic leadership reportedly sent letter to the house speaker proposing rollback of all of the 2005 energy act tax subsidies10 on october 25 2006 then house democratic leader nancy pelosi urged the congress to repeal those tax breaks many bills were introduced in the 109th congress to pare back or repeal the oil and gas industry tax subsidie s and other loopholes many of the bills focused on the oil and gas exploration and development ed subsidy expensing of intangible drilling costs idcs this subsidy which has been in existence since the early days of the income tax is available to integrated and independent oil and gas companies both large and small alike11 it is an exploration and development incentive which allows the immediate tax writeoff of what ec onomically are capital costs that is the costs of creating capital asset the oil and gas well on september 18 2006 senators wyden and bennett introduced bill s 3908 to give consumers discount on the purchase of more fuel efficient vehi cles that would have been paid for by reducing the idcs deduction for major integrated oil companies comprehensive energy legislation s 2829 unveiled by senate democrat s on may 17 2006 would have not only eliminated expensing of idcs but would have also reduced several other tax benefits or loopholes to the il and gas industry such the foreign taxhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33763crs5 12 there is an important economic distinction between subsidy and tax benefit as is discussed elsewhere in this report firms re ceive variety of tax benefits that are not necessarily targeted subsidies or tax expend itures because they are available

the conference agreement for title xiii of hr 6 the energy tax incentives act of 2005 july 27 2005 continuedcredits the latter are not subsidies or tax expenditures in the strict sense of special tax measures unavailable generally but as discussed below some consider these unnecessary tax benefits nonetheless12 hr 5234 focused on repealing three of the seven fossil fuel tax provisions in the 2005 act temporary expensing of equipment costs for crude oil refining the small refiner exception to percentage depletion and the amortization of geolog ical and geophysical gg costs hr 5218 would have denied oil and gas co mpanies the new domestic manufacturing deduction under irc 199 there is speculation that in the 110th congress the democratic leadership in both the house and senate will begin to examine these breaks more closely particularly because many of their legisl ative priorities such as cutting back the increasingly heavy burden of the alternative minimum tax will have to be paid for13 oil and gas tax provisions in epact05 and their revenue effects epact05 included plethora of spending tax and deregulatory incentives to stimulate the production of conventional nd unconventional oil and natural gas such as gas from alaska deep water oil and gas in the outer continental shelf and oil from marginal wells or private and federal lands these incentives include tax breaks royalty relief streamlined permitting procedures and other measures the tax incentives include approximately 145 billi on over 11 years of incentives to both stimulate domestic production and distribution of fossil fuels and reduce the demand for these fuels through energy efficiency and production of alternative and renewable fuels title x iii sub title b of epact05 includes the tax incentives for fossil fuel supply for production transportation and di stribution of oil and gas as well as capital incentives for expanded refinery capacity the subtitle does not include coal supply incentives which are subsumed in the electricity infrastructure subtitle although many of the oil and gas tax incentives in epact05 are production tax credits and other such upstream produc tion incentives some are capital incentives for natural gas infrastructure accelerated depreciation of natural gas pipelines in total the tax incentives alone are wo rth about 26 billion over 11 years to the industry an average of about 250 million year in tax breaks14httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33763crs6 14 continued jcx5905 subtitle b thus applies specifically to the oil and gas industry including the refinery industry for increased supply incentives tax incentives are provided again mostly by liberalization of existing tax code provisions the incentives are both production incentives ie tax benefits are based on quantities of oil and gas and capital incentives ie tax benefits ar based on magnitude of capital investment such as pipelines both unconventiona l and conventional oil and gas supply are targeted for tax cuts amortization of geological and geophysical expenditures firms engaged in the exploration and velopment ed of oil and gas incur variety of costs prior to actual extracti on the tax treatment of these upstream ed costs differs depending on the speci fic type of activity and depending on whether they are incurred by an integr ated or nonintegrated ie independent producer an independent producer is defi ned by internal revenue code irc 613ad as described below ed costs may be generally categorized as four types first there are the geological and geophysical costs gg these are exploratory costs such as for seismic surveys associated with deter mining the precise location and potential size of mineral deposit second type of cost is the mineral acquisition or lease rights expenses the costs of buying or leas ing the land under which deposits are thought to exist such as lease bonuses if property is considered prospective for containing economically recoverable deposits of oil or gas the firm drills exploratory and if ccessful subsequently development wells to ascertain the magnitude of the deposits these activities have associated various types of drilling costs tangible drilling costs the third type of ed costs are amounts paid for tangib drilling and nondrilling equipment such as drilling rigs casings valves pipelines and other tangible machinery and equipment that have salvage value finally there are intangible drilling costs or idcs as they are frequently called idcs are amounts paid by the lease operator for fuel labor repairs to drilling equipment materials hauling and supp lies they are expenditures incident to and necessary for the drilling of wells and preparing site for production of oil and gas for example roads may ve to be constructed to move in derricks and other types of drilling equipment often camp may have to be built with residences to house employees the power for the equipment and the water supplies are also idcs idcs also may include th cost to operators of any exploratory drilling or development work done by c ontractors under any form of contract including turnkey contract in general as noted above prior to epact05 all four types of costs gg costs mineral rights tangible equipment and intangible drilling costs associated with dry hole were expensable ie deduc tible in the year in which the well was determined to be dry under the 2005 act both integrated and independent producers were required to amortize the g g component of the dry hole costs overhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33763crs7 15 the 2006 amendment constitutes reduction in the tax benefits and was part of the compromise for allowing the gg costs of succ essful wells to be amortized over two years rather than capitalized 16 the term amortization is also used in tax parlance as referring to the depreciation of intangible property such as patents and copyrights two years this reduced the incentive for ggs associated with dry hole but increased the incentive for ggs associated with most successful wells this provision became effective for gg amounts paid or incurred in taxable years beginning after the date of enactment twoyear amortization of gg costs is still allowed for i ndependent producers but as result of provision in the tax increase prevention and reconciliation act pl 109222 enacted in may 2006 integr ated producers must now amortize such costs over five years15 amortization means that the costs are deducted evenly the same absolute dollars are taken as deductions every ear over specified period of time in this case two or five years it is also called straightline depreciation16 determination of independent producer status for purposes of the oil depletion deduction firms that extract oil gas or other minerals are permitted deduction to recover their capital investment in mineral reserve which depreciates due to physical and economic depletion or exhaustion as the mineral is recovered irc 611 depletion like depreciation is form of capital recovery an asset the mineral reserve itself is being expended to produce income under the income tax such loss in value or cost is deductible there are two methods of calculating this deduction cost depletion and percentage depletion cost depletion allows for the recovery of the actual capital investment the costs of discovering purch asing and developing mineral reserve each year and over the period during which the reserve produces income the taxpayer deducts portion of the adjusted basis original capital investment less previous deductions equal to the fraction of the estimated remaining recoverable reserves that have been extracted and so ld under this met hod the total deductions cannot exceed the original capital investment under percentage depleti on the deduction for recovery of capital investment is fixed percentage as set by law of th gross income ie revenue from the sale of the mineral under this method tota l deductions typically exceed despite the limitations the capital invested to acquire and develop the reserve irc 613 states that mineral producers must claim the higher of cost or percentage depletion the pe rcentage depletion rate fo r oil and gas is 15 and is limited to average daily producti on of 1000 barrels of oil or its equivalent in gas for producers of both oil and gas the limit applies on combined basis for example an oilproducing company w ith 2006 oil production of 100000 barrels and natural gas production of 12 billion cubic feet the st atutory equivalent of 200000 barrels of oil has average daily production of 82192 barre ls 300000 365 dayshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33763crs8 17 both the number of stripper wells and oil out put from such wells is reported in american petroleum institute basic petroleum data book vol 26 2 section iv table 3 august 2006 percentage depletion is not available to integrated major oil companies it is available only for independent produ cers and royalty owners beginning in 1990 the percentage deple tion rate was raised on production from marginal wells oil from stripper wells those producing more than 15 barrels per day on average and heavy oil this rate starts at 15 and increases by one percentage point for each whole 1 that the reference price of oil for the previous calendar year is less than 20 per barrel s ubject to maximum rate of 25 this higher rate is also limited to independent producers and royalty owners and for up to 1000 barrels determined as before on combined basis including nonmarginal production small independe nts operate nearly 400000 small stripper wells in about 28 states about 78 of the nearly 510000 producing wells in the united states output from stripper wells represented about 16 of tota l domestic production about 850000 barrels per day in the united states in 200417 the percentage depletion deduction is limited to 65 of the taxable income from all properties for each producer second limitation the 100 netincome limitation which applied to each individual property rather th an to all the properties was retroactively suspended for oil and gas production from marginal wells by the working families tax relie f act of 2004 pl 108311 through december 31 2005 the 100 netincome limitation also had been suspended from 1998 to 2003 the difference between percentage depleti on and cost depletion is considered subsidy it was once tax preference item for purposes of the alternative minimum tax but this was repealed by the energy policy act of 1992 pl 102486 the percentage depletion allowance is available for other types of fuel minerals at rates ranging from 10 coal lignite to 22 uranium and for mined hard rock minerals the rate for regulated natural gas and gas sold under fixed contract is 22 the rate for geopressurized methan gas is 10 oil shale and geothermal deposits qualify for 15 allowance the netincome limitation to percentage depletion for coal and other fuels is 50 compared with 100 for oil and gas under code section 291 per centage depletion on coal mined by corporations is reduced by 20 of the excess of percentage over cost depletion for purposes of percentage depletion before epact05 an independent oil producer was one that on any given day 1 did not refine more than 50000 barrels of oil and 2 did not have retail operation grossing more than 5 million year irc 613ad epact05 raised the 50000 barrel daily limit to 75000 in addition the act changed the refinery limitation from actual daily pr oduction to average daily production for the taxable year accordingly the average daily refinery runs for the taxable year may not exceed 75000 barrels for this purpose the taxpayer would calculate average daily refine ry runs by dividing total refinery runs for the taxable year by the total number of days in the taxable year this is effective for taxable years ending af ter the date of enactmenthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33763crs9 18 under the double declining balance method of calculating depreciation deductions the annual deduction is fixed percentage 200 or double

produce the lowsulfur diesel fuel the 25 limit is phased out propor tionately as refiners capacity increases from 155000 to 205000 barrels per day section 179b allows small refiner to also claim

tax credit in the case of refineryhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33763crs11 19 two of the nine special tax subsidies for oil and gas in epact05 were for unconventional gases and synfuels from coal under the 45k tax credit these provisions are discussed because the 45k tax credit has been important to the development of unconventional gases such as coalbed methane and tight sands gas however its revenue losses are subsumed under the coal category of table 1 largely because in recent years the provision has benefitted primarily the coal industry by increasing the demand for coal organized as cooperative both the cr edit and the expensing deduction may be passed through to patrons for both incentives small business refiner is taxpayer who 1 is in the business of refining petr oleum products 2 employs not more than 1500 employees directly in refining and 3 has less than 205000 barrels per day averaged over the year of total refining capacity the incen tives took effect retroactively beginning on january 1 2003 epact05 provided that cooperative refineries that qualify for 179b expensing of capital costs incurred in complying with epa sulfur regulations could elect to allocate all or part of the deducti on to their owners determined on the basis of their ownership interests the ection is made on an annual basis and is irrevocable once made the provision became effective as if included in 338a of the american jobs creation act of 2004 which introduced the tax credit modification and extension of credit for producing fuel from nonconventional source for facilities producing coke or coke gas19 section 45k of the internal revenue code irc provides for production tax credit of 3 per barrel of ilequivalent in 1979 dollars for certain types of liquid gaseous and solid fuels produced from selected types of alternative energy sources socalled nonconventi onal fuels and sold to unrelat ed parties the full credit is available if oil prices fall below 2350 per barrel in 1979 dollars the credit is phased out as oil prices rise above 2350 in 1979 dollars over 6 range ie the inflationadjusted 2350 plus 6 both the credit and the phaseout ranges are adjusted for inflation multiplied by an inflation adjustment factor since 1979 with an inflation adjustment factor of 2264 meaning that prices as measured by the gross domestic product deflator have more than doubled since 1979 the credit for 2005 production was 679 per barrel of oil equivale nt which is the amount of the qualifying fuel that has british thermal unit btu content of 58 llion the credit for gaseous fuels was 123 per thousand cubic feet mc f the credit for tight sands gas is not indexed to inflation it is fixed at the 1979 level of 3 per barrel of oil equivalent about 050 per mcf in 2005 the reference price of oil which was 5076 pe r barrel still below the inflation adjustment phaseout threshold oil price of 5320 for 2005 2350 multiplied by 2264 the full credit of 656 pe r barrel of equivale nt was available for qualifying fuelshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33763crs12 qualifying fuels include synthetic fu els liquid gaseous and solid produced from coal and gas produced from either ge opressurized brine devonian shale tight formations or biomass to qualify for the credit synthetic fuels from coal must undergo significant chemical transformation defined as measurable and reproducible change in the chemical bondi ng of the initial components in most cases producers apply liquid bonding agent to the coal or coal waste coal fines such as diesel fuel emulsions pine tar or latex to produ ce solid synthetic fuel the coke made from coal and used as feed stock or raw material in steelmaking operations also qualifies as synthetic fuel as does the breeze small pieces of coke and the coke gas produced during the c oking process depending on the precise btu content of these synfuels the 45k ta x credit could be as high as 26 per ton or more which is significant fraction of the market price of coal qualifying fuels must be produced within the united states the credit for coke and coke gas is also 3 per barrel of oil equi valent and is also adjusted fo r inflation but the credit is set to base year of 2004 making the nominal unadjusted tax credit less than for other fuels the section 45k credit for gas produced from biomass and synthetic fuels produced from coal or lignite is ava ilable through december 31 2007 provided that the production facility was placed in serv ice before july 1 1998 pursuant to binding contract entered into before ja nuary 1 1997 the

terminated on december 31 2002 and the facilities had to have been placed in service or wells drilled by december 31 1992 the section 45k credit is part of the gene ral business credit it is not claimed separately it is added together with several other business credits and is also subject to the limitations of that credit the section 45k credit is offset or reduced by certain other types of government subsidies that taxpayer may benefit from government grants subsidized or taxexem pt financing energy investment credits and the enhanced oil recovery tax credit that may be claimed with respect to such projects finally the credit is nonrefunda ble and cannot be used to offset taxpayers alternative nimum tax liability any unused section 45k credits generally may not be carried forward

the operation of the alternative minimum tax the energy policy act of 2005 made veral amendments to the section 45k tax credit first the credits provisions we re moved from 29 of the tax code to new

subs idies may not be justified based on economic theory and considering the high il and gas prices over much of the policy period they are not large when measured relative to the indus tries gross product which measures in the hundreds of billions of dollars20 another misconception is that industry was the beneficiary of many and significant tax breaks before these provisions were enacted the industry did benefit historically from significant tax subsidies however most of these had been either eliminated or pared back since the 1970s tax increases subtitle f of epact05 describes the four tax increases or revenue offsets two of the tax increases modification of th 197 amortization and an increase in the excise taxes on tires are negligible ra ising taxes by just under an estimated 200

tank l ust trust fund rate which would be expanded to all fuels the total oil and gas industry tax in creases are roughly 28 billion over 11 years for net increase in taxes on the industry of about 200 million according to the jct estimates however because the oil spill liability tax and the leaking underground storage tank financing taxes are excise taxes on oil and petroleum products and are imposed on oil refineries the net effect of the 2005 act on the oil and gas refinery sector was tax in crease of about 13 billion over 11 years other oil and gas tax subsidies the energy policy act of 2005 expanded so but not all of the preexisting tax subsidies for oil and gas and introduced several new ones thus some of the recent proposals to roll back tax subsidies to oil and gas focus on the

rrentlaw tax provisions and incentives that may apply to nonoil and gas businesses but that may so confer tax benefits to the oil and gas industry there are numerous such provisions in the tax code which some have called loopholes they are not st rictly considered to be tax expenditures complete listing of them is beyond the scope of this report however four examples which have been under discussi on as possible revenue raisers follow to illustrate the point for example the current system of depreciation generally allows the writeoff of equipment and structures somewhat faster than would be the case under both general accounting principles and economic theory the jct treats the excess of depreciation deductions over th alternative depreciation system as tax subsidy or tax expenditure in fy2006 the jct timates that the aggregate ec onomywide revenue loss from this accelerated deprecia tion deduction including the expensing under irc 179 is 67 billi on certain but unknown fraction of this revenue loss or tax benefit accr ues to the domestic oil and gas industry but parate estimates are unavailable second example is the deduction fo r domestic production or manufacturing activities under irc 199 which as noted bove is the target of hr 5218 109th congress enacted under the american jobs creation act of 2004 pl 108357 also known as the jobs bill the domestic production deduction irc 199 generally allows taxpayers to receive deduction based on qualified production activities income resulting from domestic production the deduction is 3 of income for 2006 risi ng to 6 between 2007 and 2009 and 9 thereafter it is subject to limit of 50 of the wages paid that are allocable to domestic production during the taxable year the revenue impact of this provision is anticipated by the jct to be loss of 48 billion of fede ral revenue in fy2007 and 76 billion over the first 10 years of its life certain as yet unknown fraction of the tax benefits from the deduction will accrue to the domestic oil and gas industry the deduction applies to oil and gas or an primary product thereof pr ovided that such product was manufactured produced or extracted in

to foreign countri this section of the tax code is intended to prevent the double ta xation of foreign source income income earned abroad by us residents and cor porations however many countries in which domestic us oil companies conduc t business either through branches or foreign subsidiaries impose levies that are not strictly considered to be creditable income taxes which may have the eff ect of going beyond prevention of double taxation of foreign source income it may actually lead to reduction of taxes on domestic source income provision in the senate version of hr 4297 109th congress would have denied the foreig n tax credit under certain conditions for major integrated oil companies with gross receipts in excess of 1 billion the foreign tax credit would have been denied
