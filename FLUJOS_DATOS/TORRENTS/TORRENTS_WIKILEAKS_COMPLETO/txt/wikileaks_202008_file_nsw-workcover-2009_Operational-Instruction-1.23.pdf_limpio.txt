obtain suitable employment from some other person unless the scheme agent has notified the worker of this requirement note 2 careful consideration needs to be given by the scheme agent as to what are reasonable steps for the worker reasonable has been defined as endowed with reason and not excessive macquarie dictionary extending this further means that consideration must be given to the grounds or cause for workers actions this means co nsidering all of the circumstances surrounding the worker ie an assessment of reasonableness of workers decision depends upon the workers knowledge at the relevant time for example if scheme agent imposes requirement that worker is to make pplication for certain number of jobs every week without fail and the worker continuously faces rejection and possibly humiliation in undertaking these applications it may mean that this approach ceases to be reasonable steps for the worker however an example of where the steps may not be reasonable is where worker visits factories requesting employment on light duties rather than seeking employment that is consistent with their capacity it may also include circumstances where the worker had indicated unwillingness to be retrained or to undertake work consistent with their capacity and skills and evidence of the ongoing support to assist the worker to return to suitable employment during and for

reason or good sens macquarie dictionary this means considering all of the circumstances surrounding the worker at the relevant time whether worker has acted unreasonably is determined by what is

worker is not suitably employed evidence that the worker has unreasonably rejected suitable employme nt worker cannot unreasonably reject suitable employment if it is not suitable employment in the first place section 43a of the 1987 act makes it clear that there is more to suitable employment than just what worker can physically do note as ted above careful consideration needs to be given by the scheme agent as to what is unreasonable for the worker at the relevant time for example acceptance by worker of voluntary redundancy in circumstances in which suitable employment retrain ing or redeployment was offered cannot without more lead to finding that worker unreasonably rejected suitable employment also there is unreasonable refusal of suitable employment when worker resigns in circumstances where actual suitabl employment is being offered to the worker or evidence that having obtained suitable employment the worker unreasonably gave that suitable employment away note as noted above careful consideration needs to be given by the scheme agent as to what is unreasonable for the worker at the relevant time for example if worker obtained suitable employment that started out with the employer agreeing to take into account the work restrictions certified by the workers nominated treating doctor though in reality the worker was asked or pressured to work in conflict with those restrictions and as consequence resigns from that suitable employment this should not be seen as unreasonably rejecting suitable employment and evidence of the ongoing support to assist the worker to return to suitable employment during and for the period that the worker was not suitably employed and in receipt of partial incapacity weekly compensation benefits section 52a1c the worker has sought suitable employment but has failed to obtain suitable employment primarily because of the state of the labour market rather than because of the effects of the workers i njury the scheme agent must have evidence of the state of the labour market that is reasonably accessible for t he worker taking into account the workers certified restrictions note if relying on section 52a1c the scheme agent bears the onus of establishing the state of the labour market pertaining to the worker and evidence that the workers failure to btain suitable employment is primarily because of the state of the labour market nd not because of the workers i njury note 1 if there is suitable employment that the worker can do in the reasonably accessible labour market taking into account the workers restrictions then at law the worker is totally incapacitated therefore section 52a cannot apply note 2 the word primarily in the law suggests that the state of the labour market must be the major and single most important cause note 3 if there are jobs in the workers labour market that are suitable employment but the worker does not obtain the job because an employer prefers an able bodied person to worker with restrictions operational instruction document name operational instruction 1 23 prepared by agent operations version 10 issue date december 2007 revision 0 review date december 2008
