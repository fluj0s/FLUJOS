representatives the bill as in troduced generally leaves blank the provisions with respect to the senate with notation that the text is to be supplied by the senatehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22226crs2 1 riddick and fruman riddicks senate procedure precedents and practices s doc 101 28 101st cong 2d sess at 12181220 1992 2 see for example the ethics reform act of 1989 pl 101194 title x section 1001 103 stat 1781 1989the senate if it desire s could possibly change its rules through legislation such as this vehicle or could change its own internal rules through the more common practice of the passage of nate resolution1 when changing internal congressional rules by way of legislation it has been suggested legislative practice to expressly note within the law that the changes made by legislation are made pursuant to the exercise of the house or senates express cons titutional authority to make the ru for its own proceedings and therefore may be changed amended or repealed by simple resolution2 the legislation addresses fa irly widerange of statutory and rule provisions dealing generally with 1 disclosu re and reporting of lobbyin g activities by professional lobbyists 2 potential postemploy ment conflicts of interest 3 ethical practices in the house of representatives involving member nd staff travel paid for by outside private third parties and 4 attempts to exert in fluence on certain employ ment decisions outside of congress based on par tisan considerations the provisions of title i concerning lobby ing disclosure apply to the registration and reporting statements of professional lobbyists under th lobbying disclosure act of 1995 and as currently structured would appl with equal weight to those lobbying the house or senate these provisions would require quarterly rath er than semiannual filings and reports by c overed professional lobbyists section 101 would require electronic filing by such lobbyists section 102 rather than merely paper filings as are done now and would require the establishment and maintenance of searchable database of lobbyist filings and disclosures by the cl erk of the house and secretary of the senate section 103 in an effort to assist with greater public accessability of the reports and their usefulness to the public and the medi the new provisions regarding lobbying would also require specific iden tification by lobbyists of the covered executive branch and legislative branch officials whom they have contacted sec tion 104 would require disclosure of all past legislative or executive branch employment by lobbyist section 105 would specifically require the disclosure and reporting of expenses for grassroots lobbying campaigns funded and engaged in by otherwise registered lobbyists section 106 and would require greater disclosure of the identity of the individual member organizations of certain lobbying co alitions as the actual clients of l obbyists as opposed to merely identifying the coalitions them selves as the client section 107 the additional disclosure of g rassroots lobbying expenditure s in section 106 would appear to apply only to those lobbyists or organiza tions which are currently required to register and to file under existing law that is onl those who are compensated particular amount to engage in sufficient direct lobby ing contacts and thus the expenditure of funds on grassroots lobbying campaigns only would not separate ly qualify one as lobbyist and would not separate ly subject person or an organization to the registration and reporting requirements the provisions of title ii of the bill would extend the current oneyear cooling off period in the socalled revolving door or pos temployment conflict of interest law 18 usc 207 to two years section 201 of th bill such that highlevel governmenthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22226crs3 3 false certification or false statement made to the clerk of the house under such provision regarding required disclosure if knowingly and in tentionally false or made with an intent to deceive may also be subject to existing crim inal provisions such as 18 us c 1001officials and members of congress leaving g overnment service woul d not be allowed to lobby their former agencies departments or offices for two years after leaving the government section 202 of th bill provides new procedures for granting and disclosing conflict of interest wa ivers in the executive branch of government 18 usc 208 and section 204 of the bill would add statute to criminalize attempts by members officers or employees of congress to influence priv ate or public employment decisions on the basis of party affiliation thr ough withholding taking or th reatening to withhold or take official action on any matter sections 203 and 205 of the bill would change internal congressional rules to require at sec tion 203 members of the house to disclose negotiations or arrangements for future private employment if conflic t of interest or the appearance of conflict of interest may exist while section 205 would also change internal congressional rules to expressly pr ohibit the taking or threatening to take or withhold official action on the basis of ones partisan affiliation or campaign support or contributions with respect specifically to the issue of officially connected congressional travel paid for by outside private th ird parties the legislation pproaches the issue by amending the internal congressional rule s governing such conduct to 1 require knowledge by the recipient of the travel expens that the source for such payments is permissible under congressional rules 2 clarify the requirement that registered lobbyist or agent of foreign principal is not only prohibited from paying for the expenses of such travel but is also prohibited from planning organizing arranging or financing such trip or having the trip and expenses organized at the reque st of the lobbyist or foreign agent and 3 require that the outside sponsoring person or organization has not accepted funds from any source specifically earmarked for the purpose of financing the travel expenses section 301 this is accomplished in the legislation by way of requiring written certification to be received by the member of the house or officer or employee of the house from the person providing the travel expenses section 301 and subjecting such certification to specific civil penalties for false certifications section 3023 t h legislation would also require more detailed description of the travel expenses received by members and staff in the currently require d disclosures of such travel and expenses as well as more detailed description of all meetings tours events and outings during such travel section 303 finally the i ssue of privately funded travel expenses is addressed by requiring the adoption of rule authorizing the committee on standards of official conduct in the house to develop and revise guidelines on what constitutes reasonable expenses on such privately fina nced travel for members officers and employees of the house the legislation expressly indicates an intent to deal with the overall costs of transporta tion food and lodging section 304 but the proposed guidelines could also be directed in the c ontext of reasonableness at the purposes and activities of such privately f unded expenses and the length of stays in relation to the purposes of such trips all of the provisions in this part other than the penalties for false certification are accomplished by way of change s to house rules and would thus require similar language or similar provision to change senate rules in this legislation or separate senate resolution to be effective in the senatehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22226crs4 4 the expenses for incidental recreational ac tivities during any officially connected trip such as the costs for golf or skiing are not considered necessary expenses of such travel under house or senate rules and thus fall within th general prohibitions on gifts of 50 or more from private sources in both house and senate rules house rule xxv clause 5b4c senate rule xxxv clause 2d3 expe nses for such things as golf or tennis in an amount of 50 or more may commonly be accepted under congressional rules other than from certain personal friends or relatives only in the case of char itable fundraising event when the tournament is the fundraiser and member accepts an unsolicited offer of free attendance senate rule xxxv clause 1d3 house rule xxv clause 5a4c or in the case of political fundraising event when the expenses are paid for by the sponsoring political organization house rule xxv clause 5a3b and 5a3giii senate rule xxxv clause 1c2 and 1c7c as to charitable events the house and senate rules differ as to the permissibility of acceptance of nonlocal expenses of travel fo r such recreational charitable events which the senate prohibits senate select committee on ethics senate ethics manual 108th congress 1st sess at 45 2003 but which the house may llow under certain circumstances house rule xxv clause 5a4ciiiiit may be noted that with respect to the issue of officially connected travel the legislation does not address specifically the issue of what are necessary expenses of travel in relation to accepting privately fina nced expenses for recreational activities such as allowing an outside private third part to pay for ones golfing skiing fishing or tennis during such officially connected trav it should be emphasized however that the current existing rules in both th house and the senate expressly prohibit the receipt of expenses or reimbursement s for incidental recreational activities in an amount of 50 or more from any private source and not merely from lobbyists or foreign agents during and in relation to officially connected travel4 title iv of the bill in section 401 dir ects oversight of the lobbying disclosure provisions by the comptroller general and in section 402 increases penalties for lobbyists failures to comply with the law sections 403 and 404 apply to internal house of representatives proceedings concerning hearings and in section 404 appointment and duties of an ethics task force and apply only to the house of representatives with comparable provisions for the senate
