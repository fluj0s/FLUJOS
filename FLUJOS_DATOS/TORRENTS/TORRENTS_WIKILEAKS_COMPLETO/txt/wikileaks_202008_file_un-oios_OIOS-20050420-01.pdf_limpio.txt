ae200435501 executive summary from july to october 2004 oios conducted an audit of the office of high commissioner for human rights use of office for project services unops the audit covered activities with total expenditure of 24 million in 2003 and 2004 ohchr has accepted the recommendations made and is in the process of implementing them memorandum of understanding at the time of the audit unops was managing six fi eld offices on behalf of ohchr under memorandum of understanding unops still retained fund balance of between 08 million and 14 million to pay for past expenditures of g lobal projects which unops had previously managed and which reverted to ohchr in 2 003 as oios recommended ohchr requested unops to provide updated accounts for all unopsmanaged global projects and agreed to inform unops on the future use of any rem aining balances from global projects unops will respond to any request by ohchr to final ise and confirm the remaining fund balance of the global projects previously managed b unops formal performance indicators existed ohchr ins tead relied on matrix of ohchr and unops responsibilities for the various functions s uch tool however is not substitute for performance indicators oios reiterates its previou s audit recommendation that performance indicators be established ohchr will agree with unops on the indicators to be used to determine performance unops agreed to join ohchr i n establishing performance indicators to monitor agreed outputs or review arrangements as planned in the mous financial and accounting arrangements ohchr used operating reserves in case of funding sh ortfalls claiming that the controller had verbally endorsed this practice both unog and the controller clarified to oios that the use of operating reserves had only been approve d on an exceptional basis and for specific case ohchr agreed to seek written confirmation from unog under which circumstances cash balances can be temporarily transferred from ne project to another ohchr should ensure that unops uses funds only for their specifi c purpose within the allocation it was unclear how contingent liabilities which ma result from early termination of activities with limited duration contracts of unops staff for service in ohchr projects would be covered ohchr committed to agree with unog and unops on way s to cover these contingent liabilities unops did not always provide reliable or timely inf ormation to ohchr unops attributed this partly on its conversion to new financial in formation system as of january 2004 however this lack of financial information has bee n problem since the first mou in 1998 the lack of financial information and inconsistent financial information affected ohchrs planning and forecasting ohchr however also did not submit certified financial reports to unog on time unops stated that it had taken measures to improve its reporting ability but unog commented that the delay in financial reports still persisted ohchr requested unops to submit the final certified 2004 financial statem ents by 31 march 2005 and resume regular reporting as of march 2005 ohchr should follow up with unops on timely financi reports and should certify and submit them to unog without delay arrangement of unops recruited personnel unops believes that staff if recruited for ohchr pr ojects are to be considered as internal candidates for purposes of recruitment and promotio n to secretariat posts because ohchr selected the candidate oios concurs with unogs po sition that staff members holding unops letters of appointments are not internal cand idates when applying for posts ohchr replied that unops recruited staff members wo uld be informed of their status as external candidates april 2005

aud it of the ohchrs use of office for project services the audit was conduct ed in accordance with the international standards for the professional practice of internal auditing 2 ohchr is committed to strengthening the united n ations human rights programme and providing support to the united nations treaty monitoring bodies and special mechanisms established by the commission on human rights it provides advisory services and technical assistance when requested and encourages governmen ts to pursue the development of effective national institutions and procedures for the protection for human rights ohchr has established over 20 field presences to ensure t hat international human rights standards are progressively implemented and realized at the count ry level both in law and practice 3 unops is an arm of the united nations which pro vides project management services where the has mandate services may include s electing and hiring project personnel procuring goods and services organizing training nd managing financial resources 4 ohchr has been reviewed number of times over t he past few years including by oios the joint inspection unit and the board of au ditors as part of the current audit oios looked at previous recommendations to determine whe ther they had been or were in the process of being implemented by ohchr 5 the audit findings and recommendations contained in this report were discussed at the exit conference held on 28 october 2004 with the puty high commissioner and with the chief and staff of the administrative section ohch r oios also held separate meetings with pertinent unops and unog officials on 2 decemb er 2004 and facilitated tripartite meeting among officials of ohchr unops and unog on 3 december 2004 draft of the report was shared with the deputy high commissi oner ohchr the regional director unops geneva office and the chief of financial reso urces management services unog on 2 february 2005 whose comments which were recei ved on 1 march and 28 february 2005 are reflected in the final report in italics ohchr has accepted all of the recommendations made and is in the process of imple menting them ii audit objectives 6 the main objectives of the audit were to determi ne compliance with the terms of the current memora ndum of understanding mou b reliability of financial and accounting informa tion c compliance with regulations and rules and d satisfactory performance of services by unops 2 iii audit scope and methodology 7 the scope of the audit covered the most recent f inancial statements for 2003 interim financial reports for 2004 and the current mou wh ile oios reviewed on test basis the terms of the mou financial and accounting arrangem ents and project personnel relative to the services rendered oios focused on financial is sues because of problems oios identified early on in the audit according to ohchrs 2003 nnual report activities implemented through unops totaled 115 million in expenditure total funds available were 125 million for 2004 the sixmonthly interim stateme nts as of 30 june 2004 were not available instead unops presented financial information up t hrough 31 august 2004 on projectby project basis for both field presences and the glob projects this financial information showed total expenditure of 125 million and total cash funds available of 117 million 8 the audit activities included review and asses sment of internal control systems interviews with relevant staff of ohchr at geneva united nations office at geneva unog and unops review of relevant documents nd analyses of applicable data the audit reviewed the current mou to determine whether it included adequate language identifying the services to be provided funding chanisms and performance indicators or other qualitative criteria iv audit findings and recommendations overall assessment 9 based on the audit oios concluded that financia l management controls needed to be improved by unops and ohchr unops needs to provide more timely and reliable financial information to ohchr and ohchr should str ive to fill any vacant financeadministrative posts further since sever entities are involved in or impacted by the mou the risk of misinterpreting or misunderstandin g of facts or information is increased consequently oios believes all should make an effo rt to ensure that the terms of the mou and concomitant responsibilities are understood and adhered to the officials present at the oios facilitated tripartite meeting resolved severa l of these issues memorandum of understanding 1 terms 10 ohchr and unops first entered into mou in 199 8 the mou was an interim agreement pending completion of joint evaluation by ohchr and unops the interim mou subsequently was revised and incorporated certa in recommendations that had been made in previous oios audit am19991281 manag ement audit of ohchr headquarters administration the most current mou dates from 20 may 2003 and outlines broad services that unops can provide including management of implementation of ohchr project perations in the field b recruitment process and administration of proje ct personnel c contracting of consulting firms and contractors for services and works d procurement of equipment supplies and commodit ies and implementation of training activities and fello wships 3 11 unops currently manages six field offices on be half of ohchr they are angola burundi bosnia and herzegovina colombia democrat ic republic of congo and serbia and montenegro fry at the time of our fieldwork seventh field office in sudan was imminent we were told that during the period unde r audit operations in croatia and the solomon islands had been closed and that iraqi acti vities had been suspended 2 global projects 12 unops had also managed so called global project s which ohchr said had in the meantime been transferred to unog unops still ret ains the fund balance of these global projects which as of 30 august 2004 was estimated to be between 08 million and 14 million however unops had not been formally auth orized to retain the balances of the global projects unops wanted to keep the global p rojects balance not for operational purposes but rather as cushion to pay for past xpenditures that are only being charged now eg salaries from 2002 being charged in 2004 ps also wanted to retain the balance in case shortfall occurred 13 the fact that at the end of 2004 the fund bala nce of the global projects which reverted to ohchr in 2003 was not even roughly known confi rms certain weaknesses in unops financial reporting furthermore it is difficult t understand that salaries and other cost incurred in 2002 continue to be charged to the proj ects throughout 2004 as matter of priority unops needs to determine the exact fund b alance of the global projects concerning the use of such balance as reserve for future cas h shortfalls oios does not have problem with this as long as ohchr has formally agreed to such use for example in form of rider to the current mou recommendation head2right the administrative section ohchr should request ops to determine the remaining fund balance of the global projects previously managed by unops and agree with unops on its future use rec 01 14 ohchr accepted the recommendation and requested tha t unops provide updated accounts for all unopsmanaged global projects ohc hr stated they expect to receive the final certified accounts from unops by 31 march 200 5 as specified in the mou ohchr agreed to inform unops on the future use of any rem aining balances from global projects as soon as they have been established unops replie d that they would always respond to any requests by ohchr to finalise and confirm the remai ning fund balance of the global projects previously managed by unops oios will record this recommendation as implemente d when it receives from ohchr copy of the final cer tified accounts by 31 march 2005 and information on the use of remaining balances for gl obal projects 3 performance indicators 15 ohchr and unops had not established formal perf ormance indicators to monitor agreed outputs or review arrangements as planned in the mouse annex 1 of the mou identified matrix or distribution of responsibili ties of the various functions for ohchr and unops while oios believes this matrix is useful i t is not substitute for performance indicators 4 16 an oios review performed in 2001 recommended th at unops establish metrics in order to measure performance during the current au dit unops when asked for support of more responsiveness in hiring and putting staff on the ground provided anecdotal information about its quickness in hiring staff but nothing to substantiate this oios is not questioning whether unops did and does place staff within min imal time period but believes that more formal documentation even spreadsheet with tim elines would be beneficial oios reiterates its recommendation made in an earlier au dit report that performance indicators be established 17 the scope of the audit did not include site vis its to field offices managed by unops under this mou consequently oios did not assess t he efficiency and effectiveness of the operations and services provided in the field howe ver the mou calls for an annual joint review of the efficacy and efficiency of the arrang ement entered into by ohchr and unops oios was told that joint evaluation exerci was to be undertaken but had to be postponed due to unforeseen circumstances it is visioned that this exercise will still take place an assessment using objective criteria eg performance indicators would help both ohchr and unops to identify areas for improvement s well as areas in which unops performed well oios recommends that this joint eva luation exercise which is requirement of the mou be taken as soon as practicable recommendation head2right the administrative section ohchr should agree with unops on performance indicators for the services to be provi ded by unops and ensure that they are regularly monitored to measure unops performance against agreed outputs and arrangements under the mou rec 02 head2right the administrative section ohchr should arrange fo r the required joint evaluation with unops as soon as practicable rec03 18 ohchr accepted both recommendations and stated that they would agree with unops on the indicators to be used to determine per formance in addition ohchr also plans to hold joint review with unops during 2005 unops agreed to join ohchr in establishing performance indicators to monitor agre ed outputs or review arrangements as planned in the mous unops confirmed that joint valuation was being prepared with target date of may 2005 oios will record recommendations 02 and 03 as imp lemented when it receives from ohchr list of performance i ndicators and confirmation of the joint evaluation review that has taken place 4 support costs 19 according to the mou ohchr shall pay unops sup port costs at rate of 8 per cent of project expenditures implemented by unops the mou and the supporting materials are silent on how the rate of 8 per cent was arrive d at since ohchr has not done cost analysis to determine the appropriateness of the cu rrent rate that unops charges ohchr needs to review the unops rate along with the rate that unog plans to charge for their own services recommendation head2right the administrative section ohchr should review the 5 appropriateness of the unops programme support cost s rate of 8 per cent rec 04 20 ohchr agreed to request unops to indicate what is c overed by the 8 per cent management fee ohchr stated that the overall issue would be dealt within broader forum involving unog and unhq in the context of trust fun d reform unops welcomes the principle of periodic reviews oios will record recommendation 04 as implemented when it receives from ohchr copy of the results of the re view of the rate of programme support cost charged by unops b financial accounting arrangements 1 funding mechanism 21 in terms of funding mechanisms unops managemen t raised the issue of whether unops could revert to its earlier practice whereby it received funds directly from donors unops used to receive contributions directly from d onors for unopsadministered projects bypassing the unhqunog treasury offices and accoun ting records following the instruction of the controller in memorandum da ted july 1998 and an oios audit recommendation donations have been places in tr ust funds specified for human rights activities 22 unops reasoned that if funds went directly to u nops the funding process might be expedited when funding delay occurs it can affe ct the project implementation however there have been various reasons for delays in fundi ng previous oios audit of unog administered trust fund contributions determined th at one reason was unogs delay in crediting funds to the appropriate account during the current audit unog informed oios that contributions are recorded in most cases on the same day that the implementing office ie ohchr confirms how the contributions are to b credited unog concluded that time lag exists relating to the funding problems of unops another reason for the funding delay was the failure of unops to provide timely fi nancial reports to ohchr which in turn delayed transmittal of certified financial informat ion to unog for recording purposes consequently unog may stop the release of funds til proper financial information is received 2 borrowing of funds 23 ohchr told oios that it tries to retain reaso nable carryover of funds from the preceding year as cushion according to ohchr th controller and unog has agreed to the use of operating reserves in case of shortfalls oios discussed this with the controller on 10 november 2004 who stated that thi s endorsement would only have been done on an exceptional basis furthermore unog claims that they agreed to use op erating reserves on an exceptional basis in the case for th extension of contracts for 25 international staff working for the ohchr colombia office from th period of 1 july to 31 december 2004 24 during the audit unog stated that transfer f cash is normal between projects when there are small unspent balances that could be offs et over further remittances unog continues to affirm that cash balances cannot be transferred from one project to another and that unops should only incur expenditures based on the authori zed allocations issued for the project 6 25 unops told oios that it will borrow against t he global projects where necessary to implement services in the field since unops doe s not consider what it is doing as borrowing but actually as cash management there re accounting entries tracking this unops views ohchr money as fungible and regards fun ds for the field and the global projects as the same unops stressed that it would not borrow from other clients to subsidize ohchr projects unops believes that borrowing agai nst reserve should be acceptable as long as the reserve is adequate and donor pledges h ave already been made oios agrees with unog that if financial commitments are maintained within the authorized allocation there should be need to use balances from other projec ts 3 blocking of funds for salaries 26 there has been some confusion and some disagre ement whether funds required to cover salaries and other staff costs may or must be obligated at the beginning of the project or otherwise set aside according to ohchr memorandum from the chief administrative section ohchr dated 23 november 2004 unops had the practice of blocking funds for the entire duration of an ald activities of limite d duration contract leaving very limited funds for activities in the 1 st and 2 nd quarters this would mean for example if pro ject had total budget for salaries of 120000 the full mount would be blocked immediately even though salaries are paid on monthly basis and act ual cash would not be required until later in the year given that about 80 percent of unops expenditure is salaryrelated practice of blocking the full amount of staff cost could indeed disrupt smooth implementation of the projects unog held the view that financial rule s do not require obligating salaries 27 since unops activities of limited duration ald in accordance with staff rule 3094 do not foresee the payment of termination in demnity the main contingent liability that could arise if an appointment had to be terminated because of funding shortfall would be 30 days salary in lieu of notice in the view of ios if other provision has been made this liability could be covered from the operating reserve 28 at the tripartite meeting the issue of blockin g funds was discussed it was decided that this practice would be reviewed further by the interested parties in order to resolve the problem subsequently the regional director unop s wrote that in accordance with the practicethe official financial report issued by unops finance does not show obligations for payroll costs for international staff recruited under the 100 200 and 300 series of the staff rules the official financ ial reports show the most updated information from the official unops ledger includin g normally the last payroll payments of the month preceding the date of issue of the report oios reiterates that the three parties involved need to agree on how contingent liabilitie s resulting from early termination of ald contracts would be covered recommendations head2right the administrative section ohchr should ensure tha t unops uses funds in accordance with the authorized allocation and should seek written clarification from the financial resources manageme nt service unog under which circumstances cash balances can be temp orarily transferred from one project to another rec 05 head2right the administrative section ohchr should seek confi rmation from the 7 financial resources management service unog that c ontingent liabilities in case of early termination of ald tracts of unops staff members working on ohchr projects will be covered b the operating reserve or should authorize unops to set aside proj ects funds accordingly rec 06 29 ohchr agreed to seek written confirmation from unog on th circumstances leading to cash balances being temporarily transfer red from one project to another oios will record recommendation 05 as implemented when i t receives from ohchr copy of this written clarification ohchr accepted that most ohchr international staff in the field would longer be on unopsald contracts for thos who remain on ald contracts ohchr unops and unog will agree on how to cover an possible contingent liabilities in the event of early termination oios will record recommendation 06 as implemente d upon receipt from ohchr of copy of document showing how any contingent liabilities arising from early termination of ald contracts could be co vered 4 financial statements 30 the mou requires four specific categories of f inancial reports which unops shall submit to ohchr 1 project specific monthly finan cial reports reflecting expenditures by budget line by the 10 th of the succeeding month 2 project specific inte rim yearly financial reports by budget line by the succeeding january 3 final official yearly financial report reflecting expenditures by budget line by the succe eding april and 4 sixmonth financial statements on the status of the total funds receive d from ohchr expenditures and unspent balance problems in receiving timely financial informat ion 31 ohchr is to certify the sixmonthly statements and submit them to unog but there have been problems concerning this action for exa mple unog did not receive the 30 june 2004 certified statements until early november 2004 further in july 2001 the controller instructed unog to withhold remittances to unops hchr informed oios that it had problems receiving financial statements on time or getting sufficiently detailed financial statements such as monthly disbursements reports r else received reports that were inconsistent from one period to the next oios was told part of the problem was unops conversion to new financial reporting system in j anuary 2004 ohchr said that lack of consistent reliable financial information affects their planning and forecasting ohchr also is deeply concerned that it is being held accountab for unops reporting failures 32 in discussions with unog oios learned that the unops new york office had submitted the sixmonthly statements for the period ended 30 june 2004 to ohchr by at least 30 july 2004 according to ohchr there was misund erstanding as they did not submit statements to unog due to confusion over the requir ed format 33 during the tripartite meeting unog stated that it would be satisfied if ohchr submitted the sixmonth and yearend statements in timely as required by the mou ohchr requested unops to provide consistent financi information that would allow it to assess its financial position unops has agreed to provide besides the four financial reports stipulated in the mou between ohchr and unops mont hly financial reports reflecting information from unops official ledger although ll parties at the tripartite meeting had 8 agreed to resolve the issue on the timeliness and dequacy of financial reporting unog in their comments on the draft audit report stated th at the delay of submission of financial reports still persists unops stated that they wer committed to provide timely financial reports and that they had taken appropriate measure s to improve their reporting ability ohchr requested unops to resume regular reporting s of march 2005 ohchr should follow up with unops to ensure timely issuance of f inancial reports and should certify and submit them to unog without delay dispatch oios w ill follow up on this issue in the planned audit of ohchr financial administration in 2005 b discrepancies in financial reports 34 in an earlier audit oios noted that financial information from unops was lacking for almost two years for example as of 30 november 1 999 sixteen months after the 1998 mou took effect unops had not submitted any monthly st atements of project expenditures to ohchr consequently it was impossible tracing the funds provided to unops for human rights activities from initial receipt to final dis bursement while unops had improved by virtue of the fact that reports were made detailed information was not always available or was not always precise from the reports oios had seen some numbers related to the global projects were estimated further oios received tw versions of the final 2003 report one from unops new york and the other from the annual r eport and the numbers did not match however ohchr said that the final statements produ ced by unops new york may be revised by ohchr and which may explain the discrepa ncies these statements are the ones certified by ohchr and submitted to unog oios had been concerned that unog which is copied on the unopsprepared statements by unops would enter data into imis that may not actually be the final data unog said that it nly entered data that was certified by ohchr and wanted copies of statements directly from unops in order to know that the statements were available 35 the new york office of unops prepares the sixm onth and fullyear financial statements which include the remittances and expen diture of the field and the global operating projects the scope of our audit did not allow s ite visit to the field therefore oios cannot conclude whether the expenditure is reported proper ly and made in accordance with appropriate rules it is ohchrs responsibility t ensure that all expenditure is properly documented and incurred in accordance with proper f inancial controls the expenditure upon which the 8 per cent support cost to unops is based is incurred by unops although aies authority to incur expenditure are issued the tailed supporting documentation is kept in the field by unops since there is independent veri fication of this expenditure by ohchr it should consider arranging for spot checks of the do cuments to verify the accuracy of unops financial information such as inclusion of that fu nction in ohchr hq field inspections this arrangement could be added to the mou 5 delegation of authority 36 problems in financial management of unops admin istered projects may affect ohchrs request for delegation of authority to manage its own trust funds currently unog has the ability to intervene if financial informati on is not forthcoming which acts as control however the fact that the amount of the existing g lobal projects transferred to unops and its use could not be readily ascertained is cause for concern oios appreciates that the status of the global projects will be reviewed as agreed by the parties at the tripartite meeting 9 recommendation head2right the administrative section ohchr should arrange f or spot checks of field expenditures of unops administered projects i n order to verify their accuracy rec 07 37 ohchr agreed with the recommendation to monitor expenditu res of unops administered field offices and to undertake s pot checks in the field oios will record this recommendation as implemented when it receives information on how ohchr will monitor expenditures in the field of fices and the outcome of spot checks carried out in the field c arrangement of project personnel staffing 38 oios was told primary reason an entity would use unops is its flexibility in hiring staff unops can provide ald contracts which do t require break in service after eleven months break in service can be disruptive to oh chrs programmes while ohchr is involved in the selection of candidates the letter s of appointment are issued by unops who legally is the staff members employer unops ohchr and unog have diverging views on the status of such unops staff recruited for work in ohchr operations this uncertainty about the staff members status can aff ect staff morale as well as unops ability to engage staff 39 unops maintains that such staff members are to be considered as internal candidates for recruitment and promotion purposes for secretari at posts the regional director unops said that the status of staff within the c areer pattern depends exclusively on the nature of the process leading to their recruitment he argued that the selection process is the controlling factor in determining whether one is co nsidered internal or external since ohchr proposes the candidate to unops with unops h andling the rest of the process unops believes that such candidate is internal i rrespective of which entity administers their contracts 40 oios discussed the issue of internal candidacy with the unog director of administration and the unog acting chief human re sources management service who stated that staff with unops contracts are not cons idered internal candidates because they have not gone through the unog recruitment and prom otion processes according to ohchr staff they also do not consider unops staff internal candidates for ohchr posts 2002 ruling by olaohrm clarified that should t he posts encumbered by staff working in the office of the high commissioner for human ri ghts under unops letters of appointment be advertised in accordance with the pr ovisions of stai20024 which defines the expression internal candidates these staff mbers would be considered external candidates and would have to compete with internal candidates whose applications would be transmitted earlier than those of external candidat 41 oios shares the view that staff who do not hol d letter of appointment are not internal candidates when applying for posts re gardless of ohchrs involvement in the selection process otherwise the requirements and procedures of the staff selection 10 system could be circumvented oios wishes to point out however that women staff members serving with other entities of the commo n system may under certain conditions have the same eligibility to apply for positions as internal candidates stai20024 section 55 b ii recommendation head2right the administrative section ohchr should request u nops to inform current and newly recruited unops staff memb ers working for ohchr about their status as external ca ndidates when applying for posts in the rec 08 42 ohchr agreed with the recommendation and stated that in the future unops would only employ project personnel or staff for shortterm missions who would be informed of their status as external candidates oios will record this recommendation as implemented when it receives from ohchr copy of i nformation that unops provides to project personnel or staff for shortterm missions on their status as external candidates when applying for posts in
