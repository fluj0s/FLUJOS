are not us citizens should be eligible for federa lly funded public aid has been contentious issue for the past decade this debate occurs at the intersection of two major policy areas immigration policy and welfare policy1 the 107th congress enacted significant changes in us immigration policy it so took up reauthorization of changes made by the 1996 welfare reform law the pe rsonal responsibility and work opportunity reconciliation act pl 104 193 including revision of the rules governing noncitizen eligibility for public assistance that it established and legislation covering programs with major restric tions on noncitizens eligibility eg food stamps medicaid the question of how immigrants in the united states are treated arose in all of these contexts and is now an issue in the 108th congresshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31114crs2 2 changes made by the 1996 welfare reform w potentially affecting eligibility for these programs are not covered in this reportthis report deals with the four major federal meanstested benefit programs the food stamp program the supplemental secu rity income ssi program temporary assistance for needy families tanf block grant programs and

four programs overview of existing eligibility law pre1996 program policies prior to the major amendments made in 1996 there was uniform rule governing which categories of noncitizens were eligible for which government provided benefits and services and single statute wher the rules were described alien eligibility requirements if any were set forth in the laws and regulations governing the individual fe deral assistance programs summarizing briefly lawful permanent residents ie immigrants and other noncitizens who were legally pr esent eg refugees were generally eligible for federal benefits on the same basis as citizens in programs where rules were established by law or regulation thes included major public assistance programs like aid to families with dependent childre n afdc the predecessor of tanf the ssi program food stamps and medicaid with the single exception of emergency medicaid unauthorized illegally present aliens were barred from participation in all the major federal assistance progra ms that had statutory provisions for noncitizens as were alie ns here legally in mporary status ie non immigrants such as persons admitted for tour ism education or employment however many health ducation nutrition income s upport and social service programs did not include specific provisions regarding alien eligibility and unauthorized aliens were potential participants2 these programs included for example the special supplemental nutr ition program for women infants and children the wic program child nutrition programs in itiatives funded through the elementary and secondary education act the earned income tax credit eitc community and migrant health centers and the social services block grant ssbg programhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31114crs3 3 in this report federal meanstested benefits are temporary assistance for needy families tanf medicaid supplemental security income ssi and food stamps these are the four programs designated as such under the terms of the 1996 welfare reform lawthe 1996 welfare reform law title iv of the personal responsib ility and work pportunity reconciliation act of 1996 pl 104193 established co mprehensive new restrictions on the eligibility of noncitizens for m eanstested public assistance3 with significant exceptions for those with substantial us work history or military connection for legal permanent residents l prs resident as of enactment of the law august 22 1996 they generally barred ligibility food stamps and ssi or allowed it at state option medicaid and tanf for food stamps and ssi benefits

status then made ineligible unless they became citizens or qualified under another status and nonimmigrants and undocumente d aliens were barred post1996 revisions the 1996 changes made in the alien ligibility rules prove d controversial particularly the termination of benefits fo r recipients who were receiving benefits or legally resident as of the date the new welfare law was enacted august 22 1996 the ssi termination date for these recipients was extended from august 22 1996 to september 30 1997 by pl 10518 si gned june 12 1997 more extensive modifications to the new alienage rules were then included in pl 10533 the 1997 balanced budget act signed into law on august 5 1997 it amended the welfare reform law to provide that legal immigrants who were recei ving ssi as of august 22 1996 continue to be eligib regardless of whether their claim was based on disability or age additionally those who were here by august 22 1996 and subsequently become disabled were made eligible for ssi food stamp eligibility was expanded by provisions of pl 105185 the agricultural research extension and ducation reform act of 1998 eligibility was extended to several gr oups of lprs who were here as of august 22 1996 elderly 65 persons not including t hose who become 65 after august 22 1996 individuals receiving government disability benefits including those who become disabled after augu st 22 1996 and children persons who were under 18 as of august 22 1996 until they become adults amendments in pl 10533 and pl 105185 extended th period of food stampssimedicaid but not tanf eligibility for refugees and asylees from five to seven yearshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31114crs4 4 because most potential disabled food stamp r ecipients also are ssi recipients and must pass the generally more

r eceiving food stamps was 216 new york florida and xas followed with 167 1 23 nd 106 respectively of all noncitizens receiving food stamps in 2001 the level of noncitizen enro llment in assistance programs is affected by the restrictions imposed under the 1996 welfar reform law as revised in 19971998 by states choices to extend or deny c overage when given the option and to some degree by individuals perception of their eligibility status and their election to participate or not among the public at rge confusion remains over what classes of noncitizens are eligible for which progra ms in part because the 1996 welfare law used the phrase qualified alien not term in immigration law that encompasses variety of classes of nonc itizens who must meet additional specified conditions18 moreover despite narrowly dr awn regulations from the former immigration and naturalization service now the us citizenship and immigration services in the department of home land security on what constitutes public charge many believe that receiving public benefits may adversely affect noncitizens immigration status or poten tial to sponsor immigration petitions for family members these factors may be inhibiting participation among eligible noncitizens summary of the debate the restrictions placed on noncitizens eligib ility for major federal meanstested public assistance have been controversial since they were put in place by the 1996 welfare reform law and despite the si gnificant revisions enacted in 1997 1998 and 2002 calls for total or partial restoration of noncitizens ligibility for fe deral benefits continue proponents of restored eligib ility for noncitizens make veral arguments foremost advocates note that lprs many of whom are now denied eligibility are legal residents who work and pay taxes as result they contend they should be able to draw on the federal public assistance safety net if need arises or misfortunes occur in this regard some also assert that the 40quarter substantial work history test for lpr eligibility is too stringent second important argu ment relates to the perceived complexity of the current ligibility rules for noncitizens advocates maintain that the rules are so complex varying as they do among programs and classes of noncitizen s that many eligible noncitizens are discouraged from applying or believe themselves ineligible in addition they point out that many of the children in lprheaded households are us citizen s and are concerned that the ineligibility of their parentscaretakers is keeping childrens participation low in the assistance programs that are important to their h ealth and wellbeing finally proponents of change contend that continued inelig ibility for some noncitiz ens who were herehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31114crs10 before the 1996 law is unfair and that th sponsorshipdeeming rules are sufficient to control substantial abuse of access to public assistance supporters of current law often reference the public charge ground for exclusion of immigrants and argue that the united states should not admit immigrants if they do not have the financial means employment skills or the family resources to support themselves they maintain th at lprs and their sponsors should take responsibility for the lprs support and not ex pect the federal government to do so they point out that citizen children are eligible for federal assistance even if their parents are not and that low pa rticipation is not the fault of the law itself lastly they note that adjustments for the most compelling cases the elderly the disabled children and many of those resident and on programs ro lls before welfare reform were made in the 19972002 revisions to th original provisions of welfare reform law critical component of the debate is th cost of revising the existing noncitizen eligibility rules although the costs would vary markedly depending on the particular provision there are concerns that restorin g public assistance programs to noncitizens will deepen the federal deficits states that are not able to have deficit budgets argue that the cost burden merely shifts to them while others point out that the states have the option of denying the benefits legislation in 107th congress several significant legisl ative proposals expanding noncitizens eligibility for tanf ssi and medicaidsc hip were before the 107th congress this subject also was key issue in the comprehensive legislation reauthorizing agriculture department programs hr 2646 the farm bill because the bill

proposals to expand nonc itizen eligibility for tanf and change sponsor deemingrepayment requirements provisions of the reported version of hr 4090 were subsequently incorporated into larger bill hr 4737 which was passed by the house on may 16 when the senate finance committee marked up its substitute version of hr 4737 on june 26 2002 however it included provi sions that would have given states the option to use tanf funds to assist ll lprs including those who have arrived on or after august 22 1996 it would have re quired states taking this option to deem immigrants income to include income of sponsors for purposes of determining eligibility for only 3 years after entry essentially making the deeming rules for the postprwora immigrants comparable to those for the preprwora immigrants these deeming rules would not have pplied to minor children of sponsored immigrants legislation to reauthorize tanf reached an impasse in 2002 and the original tanf law expired on october 1 2002 tanf

several b ills hr 1143 h r 1528 s 582 s 940hr 1990 and s 2052 had already been introduced that addressed medicaidschip these bills generally would have given states the option of extending medicaid and schip coverage to lowerincome lprs to the extent they are not already covered and pregnant nd postpartum lpr women and their children other legislation in terms of the supplemen tal security income ssi program hr 3625 noted above would have ended current bars against ssi eligibility for lprs and ended the sponsor repayment requirement for ssi benefits but there was action on legislation to expand ssi cove rage of noncitizens on related matter the family sponsor immigration act of 2001 pl 107 150 provides that where citizen or permanent resident has petitioned for permanent resident status for an alien and the petitioner has died before the alien has been granted this status and if the attorney general determines for humanitarian reasons that revocation of the petition would be inappropriate close family member other than the original petitione r may be allowed to sign the necessary affidavit of support legislation in the 108th congress the issue of expanding medicaid and schip coverage to lprs who are pregnant women and children arose during the debate over the prescription drug legislation that ultimately became pl 108173 the senatepa ssed version of s1 the prescription drug and medicare improvement act of 2003 included provision that would have given states th option to cover lprs who were pregnant women and children under the medicaid nd schip programs the housepassed prescription drug bill hr 1 did not include this provision to expand noncitizen eligibility for medicaid and schip the senate struck all after the enacting clause and substituted the text of s 1 when it passed its version of hr 1 on july 7 2003 when the conference report on hr 1 wa s filed hrept108391 on november 21 2003 however it did not have the provi sion to expand noncitizen eligibility for medicaid and schip as the senate considers hr 4 the gislation that would reauthorize tanf possible amendments on noncitizen eligibility are likely to come up again there are two competing versions of hr 4 that would reauthorize tanf one passed the house in february 2003 and the other was reported by th senate committee on finance in october 2003 although both vers ions are silent on noncitizen eligibility provisions related to other major programs affected by restrictions on the eligibility of noncitizens medicaid and the supplemental security income ssi program as well as tanf are possible amendments to hr 4 when it comes before the senate one set of concerns is focused wh ether eligibility should be extended to refugees and asylees who have exhausted their timelimited benefit eligibility for all major programs except food stamps the 107th congress restored food stamp benefits for refugees and asylees and some have argued that ssi benefits for refugees and asylees should not be timelimited th fiveyear limit for refugees and asyleeshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31114crs14 receiving tanf however is consistent with the general timelimited policies of tanf

of nonqualified aliens it consists of other noncitizens including unauthoriz ed illegal aliens nonimmigrants ie aliens admitted for temporary purpose such as education or employment short term
