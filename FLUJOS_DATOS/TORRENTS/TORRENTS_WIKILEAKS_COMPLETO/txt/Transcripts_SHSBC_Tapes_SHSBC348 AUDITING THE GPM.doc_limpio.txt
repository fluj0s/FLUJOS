auditing the gpm lecture given on 23 october 1963 thank you all right who is this what date audience october the 23rd october the 23rd what year audience ad 13 ad 13 who said 63 shoot him anyhow all right well your generalyour general course of auditing affairs right nowive been giving you series of highly general lectures here just in the last few and i hope youve been able to make something out of thembits and pieces and scraps you know trying to give you some kind of viewpoint let you take little broader look at exactly what youre doing and show you some of the anatomy of what youre attacking the human mind is very interesting mechanism and people can get quite goofy on the subject nearly every human being is so deeply enmeshed so pressed down into life and livingness opposed by so many present time forcesand opposing himself so many other forces actions personalities considerationsthat he finds it almost impossible to view this thing called the human mind he more likely views human opposition he more likely views human problems he more likely views human considerations he views such things as inhumanity he views such things as justice he views such things as rightness right conduct such things as honesty dishonesty criminality in other words hes involved not in the human mind but in sociology do you see that so when pavlov or freud comes along the primary motivation for his work is obtaining some sort of an isness of his immediate environment and his immediate conflicts let call to your attention that all of those things i have just named are potential ris in gpmsall of them being dramatized to greater or lesser degree the being himself is being solution not living being therefore there has been view of this thing called the human mind there has only been view of the particular ris which person is confronting or which he is being one immediately sees highly circumscribed horizon he sees this horizon right close in to the individual you see the life and livingness of well mothers are bad and fathers are brutal and so forth study of the mind is study of the ri called father see dont you see how this is and therefore hes going to study the mind and actually he has made an identification between the thing called the mind and the ri father this is the whatsit that hes not been able to itsa this is the thing hes in conflict with so he wants to know more about the mind i remember myself asking question of this sort of thing i was sitting down banging away on an electric typewriter throwing out about hundred and twentyfive words minute of copy and so forth and i had to characterize somebody and i sat back and i said well what the devil is characterization anyway i think that was one of the primary entrance points to study of the mind i would have been very happy to know what character was so that i could characterize characters more easily in stories see this was not very pressing reason to understand character of the human mind but then in actual fact ive never had reallya very pressing reason to do so which of course gives one much broader viewpoint i have personal reasons along in this particular line but these personal reasons take the human mind as solution of lesser magnitude in other words the solution of the human mind is simply small milestone on much longer road but the situation as you see life and an understanding of life on this particular planetand probably on most planetsis simply from the viewpoint of person so immersed in life that he sees only those facets which impinge upon him and upon which he would like to impinge and that to him is his entire horizon that is his complete view and he has further view of the human mind than that i imagine pavlov had it in for dogs i imagine dogs played very very large part in pavlovs gpms im sure he had an ri called dogs as little boy he might have been bitten by dog do you see as being many little boys in many times hes probably been bitten many many times by many dogs so he was sure trying to understand dogs maybe at some time or another why hed been put on solid diet of calves brains or something like this so that who knows who knows what these would have been the fellow isnt available to us at this particular moment to go over his lineups you may run into him someday itd be intriguing to know what was the horizon of pavlov that caused him to see the mind as physiological entity which ran exclusively on punishments even though he added rewards and punishments in his manuscript well what was his horizon and freud living in ain the midvictorian ages surrounded by the hushhush whenif woman ever stepped on the steps of horse car and had displayed an ankle below undoubtedly nonsanitary skirts that they had in those daysthat skirt rising out of the dust an additional two inches and displaying that ankle could have caused scandal throughout the entire town you see just this balderdash of this particular time you see second dynamicit must not exist you see and he takes this terrifically repressed second dynamicwell who knows what went on there in freuds background that brought him to viewpoint to view the mind as repression of second dynamic equals insanity and why did he pick out childhood probably he had an ri called children or something like that you see hes probably caught and was dramatizing within sphere of less than five or six ris his general view of the mind however led off into perimeters which are quite interesting he considered such things as life in the womb he considered such things as birth trauma and so forth he merely considered them he never demonstrated they existed he thought of great many things and some of his studentsundoubtedly said more than he wroteand some of his students became interested in past lives such as jung druidism and that sort of thing well its interesting that when the past lives came up in the subject of psychoanalysis that it became exclusively the english druid period i think thats very fascinating in other words past lives equal chaps painted blue jumping about the oak trees you see that was the totality of past lives its fascinating you actually would have to work very hard on preclear to get him to recall this period particularly if hed never been in england during that period now here we have thenhere we have the limited viewpointthe limited viewpoint and the only reason im calling this to your attention is so that you can see that that is not the only viewpoint and so that you in teaching people and looking at things yourself might possibly be able to bootstrap yourself out of too great fixation along certain lines too great motivation for knowing about the mind which is not germane to the mind see motivated to know all about the mind because of schoolteachers well you see in actual fact you will wind up specializing in ris called schoolteachers and you wont know very much about the mind you might not even realize that its an ri now to make statement like that to you is sweepingly invalidative its horrible to make statement like that to you and id never make statement like that to you if i hadnt made it to myself can one look further than one is looking that is the question i am asking you can you look further than the horizon you are now looking at in the field of the human mind can you extend your vision sufficiently as to escape your own aberration that is the mark of genius and yet you can do it you can recognizeand oddly enough i know how well you can do this because its almost hallmark of scientologists matter how hard you are dramatizing some tiny portion of your beingness you is still saying boy am i dramatizing screaming like mad at somebody or other and yet while screaming still say you know i must have overts and withholds from this bit or i wouldnt have thatthis much of an opinion you see that actually is the mark not of selfcriticism but of selfenlightenment and an individual who is capable of this selfinspection and so on theres great deal of hope for that individual but the individual who is always convinced completely of his own sincerity of his own dramatizations im afraid theres not much hope for him and if you wanted to describe somebody who was totally sunk in humanism who was totallygone totally wog and so forth you would describe that person as incapable of realizing his own aberrations or realizing that he had any aberrations you know the man who asserts that hes totally sane is always the insane man the rest of usthe rest of us always have little glance over our own shoulders and wonder if sooner or later were not going to act little potty at some time or another you know but this divine doubt never enters at all into the scope of thinkingness of the very insane what characterizes them is their fantastic rightness they are completely certain of their own sanity and in some brands of insanity completely certain of everyone elses insanity these are total certainties with regard to these fellows the scientologist to marked degreenot because i have told him tobut just by the process of knowing greater truthshas rather uniformly attained this particular aspect and its odd to think of the fact that some of the greater schools of philosophy and some of the greater schools of wisdom have taught that one thing as the highest possible peak of attainable wisdom on the part of being the highest possible peak they call it in various ways youll find it described in various ways but it always amounts to the fact that they are capable of the divine doubt they are capable of slight view of themselves they are capable of selfinspection they are capable of realization about themselves as imperfect these various things have of course sawed through and become operations at various times so that there have also been schools which said when you know youre absolutely insane why then of course you are totally sane and when youve realized that youre completely bats why then we know that you are all right you know theyve exaggerated this thing to degree but any piece of wisdom can be exaggerated into lowerscale mockery but its interesting that we have attained something which in the field of the stoics or other schools of greek philosophy would have been considered to be very very high point of wisdom and any of you walking through the states of greece of twentythree hundred years ago or something like that would have been looked on as very very very wise being indeed see saying more than you say doing more than you do you see not even auditing anybody this would be very selfevident so you perhaps have not looked at scientology from the viewpoint of philosophic attainment and yet you have attained philosophic level which is superior to and described as one of the great high levels of philosophy while still scrambling around and thinking that you actually dont know much and youve got long ways to go do you see that well now thats actually added that is simply an added bonus that wasnt part of the philosophic level but that you know you have long way to go implies that you know something or have some feeling of where there is to go see so now that is greater level of wisdom you have some feeling about there are greater levels to go to well im afraid that that was totally absent in all former schools at your lowest level you have attained this bit of selfdoubt this bit of selfinspection thisthis attitude which was the highest peak of former philosophies and yet you additionally know that you have long way to go and you also then must have feeling that there is something to go to so therefore you must then understand something of the wholeness of being and that has never been understood in the whole world of philosophy the potential of being that is completely neglected subject we read man is evil we read man is this we read man is that man is born of and dies in we read this philosopher and that philosopher and that religious preacher and this writer and we read the koran and we read the bible and we read the early teachings that christ imbibed we read indian philosophies of some kind or another all of these thingsall of these things have very debased idea of the character of man they do not perceive him to be anything that he is if you ever wanted to read tale of liesis description of the beingness of man written in other times and places and periods what is man oh man tsk what is mans potentialis completely new field what is his potential now they say thatonce in while poet comes along and he says he can attain to the heights of stars or something like thisjust talking in some metaphorical veinbut actually doesnt embrace the real beingness of man what is the total potential beingness of being and that is subject that you are grappling with and that is the subject which you actually grapple with in auditing if you are not grappling with that subject and are only grappling with the fact of how do i prevent myself from being impinged upon certain types of characterizations in life and how do i myself impinge upon certain aspects of lifeif youre still involved in that and trying to audit im afraid that you will have many failures in auditing youll have some successes but youll still have many failures in auditing let give you an idea of that failure in auditing could stem from this basis now dont think this is uncommon you have great deal of difficulty with horses see youve got lot of trouble with horses and youve had big auditing win on the subject of horses so you promptly and immediately audit nothing but horses on your pc that means immediately that your aspect or your viewpoint of the human mind must be that of just life and livingnesslittle symbols that dont amount to hill of beans you see this is person ho is so thoroughly in contest with the environment about him that only those factors in the environment about him that are dangerous to him could be dangerous to anybody its lack of flexibility its an inability thenlet show you where the auditing failure is it would be an inability expressed like this little girl comes inlittle child comes in and shes crying and shes shaking with terror and so forth and she says thatshe says the windthe wind is moaning past her window and you as an auditoryou as an auditorthis is piece of life and livingness not piece of session you seebut you as an auditor happen to rather like wind and you rather think thats pleasant sound and you conceive danger in it whatsoever so therefore because you have that different viewpoint then you say to her oh nonsense wind is pleasant sound now theres great danger in doing this but let point out to you you have absolutely done nothing for that little girl except knock her itsa down do you understand in other words if your knowingness about life is totally based on what you yourself are afraid of or given sensation with and so forththats totally based on that aloneand you have additional perception that other people might be upset about different and other things then you actually can never extend yourself out of the ris youre sitting in far enough to understand what the other person is going through you have to at least be able to saythis doesnt require much theres great difficulty here its just something that you should recognize you should be able to sayyou should be able to say well joe over there or bill over there dont like women this is silly but they dont like women and know that they dont like women and although you have an opinion that this is silly of them not to like women to still be able to understand that they dont like women if you havent got that viewpoint you will never permit them to itsa any difficulty with women do you see how that would limit the auditor and its on these little mathematics alone that you can adjudicate the success of an auditor in other words is he capable of understanding that wind could frighten somebody when it doesnt frighten him see can he understand that there are other conflicts for other people see on that aloneon that alone you see you could get auditing failures if he hasnt grasped it and auditing successes if he has grasped it pete comes in pete is just going all to pieces pete is in shreds well what is the matter pete oh my god its my car what about your ear pete i just worry worry worry worry worry all the time about my car i keep it in locked garage and so forth but i just know its going to be stolen and i just went out few moments ago and found that i had left the ignition keys in the ignition and the door unlocked the guy is shattered hes practically in tears now person who cant project himself seeyou didnt even have to project yourself but just understand that he might be sitting in bunch of other ris than youve got seeis liable to handle this situation like this well your cars insured isnt it well yes well you keep it in locked garage dont you well yes well all right what are you worried about now lets get onto something thats really aberrative he just let him sitting there in wild present time problem because all these concerns are goofyeven yours see these concerns are not usual they are not ordinary there is average set of concerns which makes person sane or another average set of concerns which makes person insane there are such common denominators theyre all batty and the difference between scientologist is he can see that his concerns might be little batty he hasnt automatically assumed that because he has these concerns they are therefore the average concerns of the human race now fellow who didnt have any ris about lost property would have pete come in petes in shreds he starts in the session and so forth well what happened what happened pete whats the matter tone arm is high and the guy is shaking and looks ashen what happened well ii just went out and i found id iehleft the caruhand the ignition keysii have left them in the ignition theyve been sitting thereulpall morningulp and youd say well oh is that what youre worried about what is the carcar worried about is it losing things umproperty umproperty property huhhuh property well give some way that youve safeguarded property pete oh well haha god oh yes and ever since and so on and so on and so on and so on and so on and so on and so on tone arm action tone arm action tone arm action see everything going along fine present time problem evaporates and you get the session underway and youre all set in fact youve probably got your session if youre not running r4 youve got your session in the bag see all because you didnt assume that he was batty for worrying about something that wouldnt have worried you now your gap gets wider and wider the better you get the better off you get as case the wider this gap gets so its something to shed if you have it and shed what little of it you do have because you very readily get to case gap between your viewpoints and pcs viewpoints when all of his considerations along in this line look completely batty youll get to point sooner or later where the fact that he eats and has to knock off for lunch will seem very very foolish to you but because you have been there yourself youre not liable to cut his itsa line on the subject of being hungry by saying well thats silly how could anybody get hungry because you know that you could get hungry see but this gap gets wider and your gap already is sufficiently great that mixing in amongst even scientologists you here at saint hill were reported at the congress of shining up to point where everybodyanybody could spot where saint hiller was in the audience see whether they knew them or not its quite interesting this comment has come back to in other words the saint hillers are head and shoulders above scientologists who are head and shoulders above raw meat your gap is already pretty wide you dont ever know how wide your gap isthats whats interestingbecause you are always in the condition you are in at the moment you are in it theres very seldom any comparative data i was looking over the factors of growth in scientology and these factors by the way would startle youtheyd startle you they are not necessarily represented by the accounts sheets of organizations or something like that but they certainly are represented on the dispatch lines of organizations and opening up old folders of dispatches and going back just two or three years and looking at what was being said and worried about two or three years ago is illuminative its startling the various factors present are longer present in organizations many of those factors are longer present in organizations they have been surmounted organizations and the people running them particularlymainly the people running themhave moved up above concerns of that particular level and theyre longer worrying about these lines theres various things that they have shed coming up the line there are various problems which the organizations had at that time theres the frequencies to dispatch and that sort ofsay of five years ago and what was containedthese things look like something from another planet these are the factors of growth and these factors are very very easily measured when you look back and have comparative stick with which to measure them but you seldom have very much to measure it by unless perhaps youyou wrote diary many years ago lets say you had diary and you start running into this diary and that sort of thing and you say good heavens you see or how amazing or ill be darned you know this would give you some type of aspect you very often will experience this from an auditors chair you run out whole gpm out of pc that completely changes all of their considerations and the pc goes waltzing alonglife pretty shifted seewithout any real recognition of the degree of shift see but just simply take up the new values which are there and go on rolling along with these new values and theyve simply discarded the liabilities of the old values and they arent matter of comment this will very often baffle you as an auditor because its process of negative gain you very often will feel somewhat slapped in the face because of this very thingnegative gain its very interesting phenomenon and an auditor has to live with this thing and be able to confront it this fellows not been able to sit up hes always had badly curved spine or something like this and hed always sit up like this and you get to running down the bank particularly running some gpms or something like that and you all of sudden get to that series which have that degree of influence on the body and all of sudden the fellow starts to sit up and you never again hear about the curved spine he doesnt mention the curved spine he doesnt even think usually to tell you how nice it is not to have curved spine and the reason he doesnt tell you how nice it is not to have curved spine is now he has not got curved spine to the degree that he has level of comparison with having curved spine because youve also wiped out the experience of having curved spine and youre going to face that as auditors and sometimes its really going to baffle you ive had it happen to and i still neverthat doesnt totally leave cold even today see change persons whole conduct aspect in some sphere of existence in just hatful of ris or something like this you know just improve it utterly knock down barriers in all directions theyre just shining now you know well lets take some subject like miserliness you know before they were always worried to let anybody know they had sixpence you know and they were always afraid to give anybody anything this is all vanished see theyre now completely sensible on the subject they have more money too you see and never have single word said on the subject of gee im glad im longer wrapped up in all that miserliness see never have word said on the subject if you want to be paid as an auditor your observation has got to be terrific because itsnine times out of ten will only be your observation that thanks you oh people are basically very appreciative and they say soandso and soandso and soandso and they talk about it and that sort of thing but every now and then you strike one of these things of the curved spine see you know guys always been going along this way you know at the end of some session or several sessions all of sudden theres vestige of this and you never hear word about it youve wiped out all anxiety about it youve wiped out all interest in it youve wiped out all communication lines about it and its gone now at the same time you occasionally hit somebody and youtheyre up against the gun and if theyve got some present time comparison let us say theyre going to be operated on for lumbosis see and they are going to be operated on and somebody is going to tear out the whole epiglottis and reverberate it you see and so on and you come along as an auditor and you cure it up and they dont have to be operated on now theyve got the doctor or somebody is still nagging them you see to have lumectomy you see and they are now happy that they dont have to have this additional duress you see thats slightly different now that person is liable to thank you every time they see you see because its being driven home from some outside source dont you see but just the fact that they couldnt read or couldnt see or something like this and nobodysthere isnt any exterior bang on it and you they can read now they can see or something of that particular kind that doesnt matter bitapparently of course they are basically appreciative theyd be terrified if they thought they would be returned to that condition but they just neglect to say anything about it you had somebody here in the last few months who had gone blind he was really blind man we made him see again and by george you never heard very much about it i never heard anything about it and right down to the last moment right down to the last moment nobody ever said thank you ron for returning my sight because it was there dont you see there was point in doing so i wasnt even sitting there waiting to be appreciated particularly but i was struck by the fact that the subject was never mentioned see you very often run into this so therefore you better be able to observe because occasionally youll pull off miracle and nobody will ever find out about it but you now when you go into this on the basis of pete and his car keys youll have vast quantities of trouble just because you cannot conceive that anybody would be upset about the car keyswhich is the threat of somebody stealing his carand you find out hes never even had car stolen in this lifetime see and you say well balderdash see well you wont let him itsa it see thats one of the main basic mechanical penalties of this kind of thing all right now lets take somebody as he goes up the line he goes up the line and he gets into more extended perimeter more extended view of existence and here is existence spread out in front of him and he can understand that that person over there feels sad because that person over there has an aberration about something which demands sadness when certain circumstance is encountered being able to perceive just that you can get lots of tone arm action if you can achieve that you can achieve tone arm action well youre never sad about having eaten too many chocolates or eaten up all the chocolates let us say see youre never sad about this this does not make you cry in fact you think this is quite ridiculous in fact you dont even really like to eat chocolates because they put on weight or something like that see so this person is cryingthis person is crying and theyve eaten up all the chocolates well this is quite mad you immediately pronounce it as being quite mad and so you do you might even be led to process it because you know they are mad but you sooner or later are going to make little bit of mistake about this kind of thing because your own incredulity on the basic situation that having eaten up all the chocolates should make somebody crydoesnt seem sensible to you now it doesnt have to be sensible to you the only thing that has to be sensible to you is that other beings immersed in life have different viewpoints and different ris which cause them to feel differently about different things thats the only thing you have to conceive of if you can conceive that you can get tone arm action off most anybody you see in the field of writing in the field of writingthis is very poor thing but its anecdotal and it might amuse you fellow by the name of eric somebodyorother went out to hollywood well this is athis in the old days was horrible place to be transported to anyhow with all the glamour and glitter and so forth and it was particularly appalling for writer because writer always has the idea that he can write and he has proven it by having written and published you see but everybody in hollywood has the idea that hecan write without the small step of having proven it or published it so you see all directors are writers and all producers are writers and all accountants are writers and all the actors are writers dont you see everybodys writer and writing actually is fine art and its quite craft but because youre surrounded by all these writers you see you always get all kinds of writing suggestions you see and so on and they are quite insane well i remember this fellow erie went out there and uhi think he was western writer or maybe that wasnt the same chaphe was western writer and they put him to writing musical comedies and he was going along and when he first got there why he was very unhappy man and he had sort of filtered on down the lines and he had become the quasi level of success that people who stick with hollywood used to become andran into him one day and i said well doesnt it sometimes get on your nerves eric all the advice you getgratuitous advice and he said he said i have finally gotten used to it he said i have finally gotten used to it now he says when they tell to put fire engine in beauty shop i put fire engine in beauty shop total apathy on the subject see total apathy on the subject were notim not advising you to assume this total apathy on it well all right so he gets tone arm action on that so heso he gets upset about eating chocolates all right illsilly to mebut ill go ahead and ill process him on eating chocolates let point out to youlet point out to you that this would be somebody who was asserting that his entire existence should be the entire existence of everybody else dont you see and so asserting it would then combine into resignation on his part to accept this other existence matter how batty it looked let point out to you that is the wrong direction to go thats the wrong direction to go you forward this through understanding if you understand the mechanics of the mind then you actually dont resurrender any aspects of it at all you truly understand the mechanics of the mind you understand that this guy is sitting in different goal and has different ris so then he of course has different viewpoints and different reactions thats all his experiential track added up to his postulated track gives him these gpms and ris and gives him certain behavior pattern and that behavior pattern is understandable because he has got bunch of ris well even if youre running level i ii or iii type processes on the bloke nobody is telling you you cant understand this then of course it rather leads you to understand that some of youryour favorite ideas about the environment in which you live and that sort of thing that these things are borne home upon you by the ris that youre sitting in well nothing quite increases that understanding like having few hot ris run off of you and you all of sudden say oh ho yeah yourthe right pt gpm and down the line ohoh well theres an ri hohoho theres an oppterm there an oppterm toads tumpf through your mind flashes the terror and horror and so forth of gardens of going anywhere near ponds of being in damp atmosphere or anything else heres this confounded oppterm toads give you an idea that it doesntyou dont have to relive your whole life in order to deaberrate which is the dianetic idea you dont have to relive that whole life in order to deaberrate an auditor operating rapidly and competently just competently running r4 could in actual factcould in actual fact take all of these terrors fixations upsets and yalpyalps that this person had been worrying aboutyou know i mean the real obsession that this person was sitting inin the course of few little motions of the tone arm the blowdown and the little pumping as the pc cognites and the rocket reads as it compares within the space of ten minutes have listed it found it done the courtesy steps and totally discharged it to fear of toads see now that fear that ris duration the duration of that one ri might have been many many many lifetimes the duration of the pair i should say better seemany many many many lifetimes think how many engrams are contained in all those lifetimes think of how many other aberrations and complications think of how much else but you hit it dead center its toads it wasnthe wasnt afraid of gardens because of rose thorns or he wasnt afraid of ponds because he had drowned in themthis hed always kind of sort of thought hes afraid of them because they have toads in them all is explained the thing asises and bow that lays the terminal to viewwell what did he have to be in order to handle toadswhich you may get before or after it whichever one youre runningand he finds out that thisthis is his basic fixation all the time of to notto be imperceptive you see so he gets an unperceiving person that was his solution and he always thought it was because he couldnt confront life that he had trouble with his eyes and he has always thought it was this and he has thought it was that and hes thought it was ten thousand thousand other things but its just an unperceptive person and one is an unperceptive person because then wont seeone wont see toads between the pair theyre all explained and packages that would have turned freud pale are just gone in that flash of an eye that is what it consists of yet that pair of ris might have lived for many many many many many lifetimesit takes long time to form up an ri either side or pair well take look at this if you have an understanding of the actual mechanics of the mind and how the mind is put together and if your understanding of that is both objective and subjectiveyouve seen somebody recover from these ris you see youve seen somebody recover by blowing them and you yourself have had an experience of few cognitions and taken look at it yourself and so forththis enormously would improve this ability to see that another being is sitting in the same mechanics but with different significances and that in actual fact is all you need to perceive as an auditor same mechanics different significances same patterns same pattern type of goals and everything else but theyre different significancessignificances are all different one fellow has as top gpmhas top gpm to catch butterflies and another fellow has as the top gpm you see to swim under the sea you see this gives you entirely different sets of ris and even if you had two people side by side each one of whom had top gpm to catch butterflies you would still have in those two people different sets of ris even if two people have the same goal theyve got different sets of ris so they have different interpretation of significances in that same goal all of this is basically dissertation im trying to give youtrying to give you viewpoint here ofperhaps youll be able to see the pc that youre dealing with more clearly from this point of view perhaps in looking back on your past auditing you will see why you just never under gods green earth did anything for mamie glutz that famous personwhy you never did anything for her and you begin to realize that she talked all the time all the time all the time about her feet hurting her and you realize that you just could never conceive anybody being that worried about anybodys feet hurting see and it just was not something you would have naturally itsaed so of course on this ptp of mamie glutz you never got any itsa at all and therefore you never got any tone arm action you never discharged the ptp so you never did anything for mamie glutz this explains to you then differences amongst pcs and differences amongst auditors getting results on pcs see it explains it in this particular breadth so anyway an auditoran auditor looking over case if he is real expert if hes real real pro he should knowhe should know very very well the layout of that bank he should know that if you take thirty bricks and lay them in string end to end with bit of gap between themand i didnt tell you in the last lecture the bricks are long way to you see they string out the long wayand the long way laying them out there in the longest line they would possibly make with gap between themthirty bricks and those bricks as you come up from the early track are dichotomiesone to the next one to the next one to the next one to the next and these things just roll on up and every one of them has twentythirty ris in the thing and those things are fitted together these are the gpms these are the goals and so forth and that these have wound into them implant gpms and theres free track floating out alongside of them and that the pc as he sits in present time is sitting in terminal and is confronting an oppterm of that line and is in one of these bricks and that every one of those bricks dismantles into the component parts and basically that the first one at pt the latest one on the line the thirtieth brick at pt can be found and when found will be found sometimes to be cut off in fact most of the time its only half brick he hasnt had time to grow whole brick see and the pcthe pc can be moved forward can be moved up to the top terminal of the present time gpm now formedthe latest one formed you seecan be run back down the track ri to ri to ri to ri gpm to gpm to gpm to gpm that this can happen that it can be done accurately and that the potential beingness of the individual can be recovered by doing that action as difficult as that action might sometimes prove once youve seen that what ive said just in the last few words you actually are looking at the totality of this thing called the human mind that is all thats in it thats important there are so many gimmicks in it there is so much glossy hardware in it there are so many data theres so much fact there is so much livingness done by the pc that it doesnt look like red herrings it looks like blizzard of red herrings when you try to see this thing at all see now what ive just told you is what is there to see and its the only important things there ive just spent three months chasing every red herring i could possibly chase to make sure of the totality of the gpm i know about every kind of implant anybody ever invented anyplace and theyre about as aberrative as pinch of snuff theres time fouling up time track jamming gpmimplants theres motion implanting implants theres implants that havethat are just absolutely salted with false ris and so forthwhole gpms implanted strings of twenty thirtyit was accident you see that they chose twentyeight goals in one helatrobus series seestrings of gpms from beginning to end you see all of them matched up various things and so on betweenlives implants wipeout stations traps all the liabilities of life in this universe and when we shake it all down you conceived there was an opposition so you invented the solution to it they invented lot of solutions but on this particular solution there was an exact balanced solution you then accumulated enormous quantity of mass because you werent there it was and you didnt do any asising of it at all it was just an automatican automatic response it was noninspected action you knew what to do the engram has some of this in it too but not to this degree at all the order of magnitude is fantastically different an ri in gpm oh i dont know hundred million five hundred billion engrams its some order of magnitude of this character see how long do you think itd take you to run million engrams see well you probably run hundred million engrams with one ri takes you ten minutes to run an ri gives you some comparative idea of how far processing has advanced in finding the true state of affairs in the mind see well you look at all this thing you look at all the mischance and adventure and all of the fallings from grace and its certain that your environment did influence you to postulate certain goals and its certain that your environment did cause you to influence you to postulate certain terminals and its certain that your environment was pesky enough along some particular line to finally compose an oppterm but you had to select it out and compose the oppterm yourself even though youre having nothing to do with it thats all very certain this is all very trueand that you are now mocking them up thats all very true but the truth of the matter is you made your own bed of spikes i dont care how fancy the pinwheels were see i dont care how fancy the spider traps were i dont care how bogy the bogies were see i dont care how many times you were lynchedfive hundred lifetimes youd be walking down the street you hadnt committed the murder you were unjustly arrested and illegally hangedpainfully aberrative value pish you see actually thetan doesnt consider anything valuable except his own postulates he sheds everything else and he sure hangs on to his own you see the enemy never even named itself the enemy might have had goal to capture chicago see or something like this and thats what they call themselves that was their gpm but in order to get them as an oppterm the thetan had to say the invaders or some other such designation the enemy doesnt even name themselves i mean you even make your own oppterms its pretty gruesome when you come right down to think of it so its your own postulate there in the oppterm so youre fighting your own postulate in the oppterm that gets to be pretty grim when you get to thinking about it and if you dont think one of these risone of these ris doesnt possess beef get one out of line sometime or another get the whole force of somatics of an ri of your own these cases of arthritis these cases of lumbosis these cases of citizenitis birds up here in the hospital being carved up into fresh porkpardon long pigthese birds up here being hacked on and slitted and anesthetized and emergencywardtenedthese characters you knowthese characters are not suffering from bad livers bad spines or any other confounded thing you see theyre not suffering from these things theyre suffering from riitis its fantastic you get one of these things out of line up against your heart sometime or anotheryour chest let somebody skip goal on you sometime if you want toif you want to get real reality on things let them skip whole gpm and go from to spit you see to whirl to whirl opposes to spit uuhruhruhr how many are missing in between there you know they dont oppose each other and all of sudden after the session notice that you have coronary thrombosis in an advanced state you know these little divers they put in fish bowls you know that they have the stream of bubbles coming out of their helmets you know that sort of thing well thats the way your bloodstream must look to cause that much somatic see puckle puckle puckle puckle puckle coronary thrombosis mantrue advanced case if medico got ahold of you at that particular moment hed examine you man hed have you in with eegs and pdqs hed blanch ive already seen medicos blanch on just running an engram ran guy through measles one time got himdoctor took his temperatureran him through measles engram halfway through why the doctor stopped and took his temperature again he was running temperature i dont know hundred and two hundred and three something like this and the doctor immediately went into screaming fit and says im sorry i have to order this patient to bed at once i said im sorry this is my consulting room at the moment sit down and finished off the engram doctor took the temperature of the patient it was normal the patient felt fine the doctor thought hed gone crazy because hed even seen the spots of measles all the symptoms of measles had been turned on and turned off complete with temperature well if an engram can do that what do you suppose gpm can do im not now talking about an ri im talking about whole gpm see just missed clean and clear well ill let you in on something youre going to miss whole gpm on any pc you operate at some time or another you just cant avoid it happening so you better begin to understand and stop because the amount of worry which is going to start entering your skull in the absence of the understanding of what is going on will completely unman you or unwoman you the essencethe essence of the situation is comprehension know the tools of your trade and know whats happening and also know that there is perfect method of inspecting zone or area that you yourself cannot visually see only the pc can see this zone or area until you get up to begodhelpus you wont be auditing then youll be giving planets little additional revolutions you get up there we got need for you up there too we know of three or four planets that need lot of additional revolutions in fact we have ten or fifteen times the revolutions planned for them crosswise at right angles to the way theyre now going now thatsthats secret i shi should take that off the tape thats secret but the pointthe point is here your comprehension must be up to your line of action you must realize that there is way of looking at it and taking look at the pc and seeing where his gpms are located and what the gpms are and what each one is except by the systems of processing you can see it through meter and the recognition of the pc who may or may not see them pc starts itsaing them and so forth well he can go so far in itsaing them without plowing himself in hes itsaing them hes still getting ta action well you let him go ahead but youre huuh you knowyou know what youre dealing with you know what the mechanics of it are and you very readily become experienced in knowing whether its in line or out of line or what youre doing theres certain tests that you can lay in and you must also become completely completelynot resigned tobut completely expectant of few misses you start running it perfectly and you worry yourself silly an auditor couldnt live with himself at all because its impossible ill give you some kind of an idea of how difficult it is found pt gpm it was obviously the pt gpm it checked out beautifully did goal opposeran it out very fine itvery nice ran out the next gpm ran out the next gpm found and ran out the next gpm found and ran out the next half of gpm thats two and half gpms seetwo and half gpms now includingi mean in addition to this quote present time gpm case all of sudden is unburdened enough pc suddenly looks up and says you know i never have accepted the present time gpm as my gpm oh theres some english family that my family was connected with at one time or another they had beautiful coat of arms it was this enormous rook who was about ten times as big as the castle sitting on this little tiny turret see and the motto was be surprised at nothing thats good one to adopt thing ran beautifully was giving beautiful tone arm action but this is the case of dont repair case as long as the case runs you see as long as that case was running without any difficultyno repair nothing pc didnt say anything well in the last couple of sessions going down the line we all of sudden started to have tone arm which was parking itself at 55 and 575 here was trouble tone arm action was diminishing something was wrong gpm had been missedsomething is wrong however still didnt make any trouble for the pc because still getting within the limits of permissible tone arm action and ris and making it all right till all of sudden its the pc who itsas it says i never have accepted the present time gpm as my gpm oh all right very good took the second gpm from present time which had already been run out but which was obviously an actual accurate gpm or it would have wound the pc around telegraph pole assumed that it must therefore be the second or some such order and although it had been found by opposing wrong gpm it still was the second gpm did goal oppose list against it of page and half long found the right present time gpm prepchecked italmost blew the meter apart such fantastic tone arm actionwent up counted the number of ris in it heres the trick for you how many ris has this thing got in it has it got five six you see truncated present time gpm would not have the full complement of reliable items so well how many does it have that gives the pc some idea of how to list it is it up to the crossoverthe middle of it or is it up to the top or is it still on the winning side you see toward the bottom gives the pc an idea of where to list how many ris has it got in it has it got two four six eight ththththth how many ris the pc says ththi think six yes and six is rocket reads theres six ris in this gpm fine lets list for the top terminal and bang bang bang and the pc gave the first service facsimile found on the pc slightly different wording but there it was rocket reading like bat man just going tobingetybang and it just checked out as the top formopposed it opposed it opposed it opposed it in three hours and about half or something like that of auditing found that top gpm on repair basis found it found all of its ris and two ris that had been missed in the second gpm the two top ris had been missed because they were too closely connected with the missing gpm threw out the old present time gpm it now proved to be gpm even though items had been found items had been found but theyd been pulled out of implants and from other actual gpms thats where its items came from there was whole phony gpm sitting there already listed see the other one now in place pc running like startled gazelle tone arm moving between 20 and 30 longer assuming the heights of 55 or 50 or anything like it thats about three hours and half for the whole operation all right there must have been lotlot of auditing going on there yes there was an awful lot of auditing but it was basically this pc said i have never accepted the present time gpm as my gpm and im sure that this was as much surprise to the pc as to the auditor the pc up to this time had more or less bought it but had some dim objection but coming up scale enough to actually recognize but didnt accept it dont you see so there was correction which could be done but only when it had to be done and only when it was pointed out by the pc that it was going awry interesting oddly enough learned something else at the same time all of your long ri listsall of your long ri listsare from wrong items we already knew that with 3m2 we knew but we knew it this way you look up the line plot and find an item ticks if the item ticks then the list it came from is incomplete thats the rule well actually you can do that little bit better if youre listing list and your pc arc breaks the item istends to be rather longthe list tends to be rather long and you dont seem to be able to find anything and nothing will stay in the pc is arc breaking on overlisting and that sort of thingyou are listing from wrong item that solves actually long lists in listing for gpms quickly for the auditor itll help an auditor an awful lot to know that these are little gags of one kind or another they actually become very forceful rules we knew before how you did thisyou checked the items out but that checkout is not actually totally reliable pitsituation because it might be suppressed its only when you run into long item list and when you run into long item list and you cant find an item on it and the pc is arc breaky and hes tired of listing and finds it hard to list just assume youre listing from wrong item and correct the list just before the list that you did extend it dont you see get the right item on this the case will just run off like this and your tone arm action is quickly and immediately restored all this is rules of the game tricks of the trade ways to make this cat jump and when you get right down to it from the word go you have to be auditing every minute but what is it that tells you do you know that there have now been four mistakes on the present time gpm four at one time bunch of ris out of the second gpm were run as the first gpms ris all right that was gotten rid of and got over that another time tried to go up into pt with this present time gpmthat is get closer to pt find items that were apparently missing and read that items were missingso ran bunch of irrelevant items which didnt even belong in that gpm see earlier had made two mistakes of minor nature but nevertheless this all added up into patchup patchup patchup well fine but the pc getting tone arm action of flying nature all the way and the ease is only being patched up when the case has to be patched up and the case isnt being worried to death all the time now how can one go ahead and do that by knowing the anatomy of case not worrying about this case but just knowing the anatomy of the case and having some idea of the number of lousy mistakes that you can make in running r4m2 and just accepting that as liability since its not really the auditors liability its the inability of the pc to perceive sufficiently to let your meter read just below that level of perception your meter always reads just below the pcs ability to perceive your meter can read more than the pc it is subitsa that you read just below what the pc can perceive nownownow look at this look at this because theres another piece of this your meter is not under any circumstances going to read deeper than the pc subitsa level if the pc has got you see can readpc can itsa at certain level and then the meter can run at subitsa level and itsa just below that levelthat is constant distancethe distance between what the pc can itsa and the subitsa line do you understand thats constant distance and when the pc cant itsa something at all of course the meter cant itsa it at all dont you see so as the pcs ability to itsa improves of course your meters ability to subitsa improves dont you see so until youve got that well improved dont start cussing your meter just recognize whatwhat this limitation is until thats improved youre going to make mistakes its inevitable that youre going to make mistakes because youre running there at subitsa level which is unbelievably close to the surface and youve got gpms piled in like mad and in actual fact the present time gpm was not available in this case until half of the gpm it was pinned tothe third from the tophad been run because they are so close togethertheir harmonic is so closethat they were entangled and smashed together couldnt be sorted out when you run half of it all of sudden it sorted out pc at this time makes the announcement ive never accepted the present time gpm thats because the other one is now free so its knocking on the corner of the skull saying hey tsk tsk so the pc says i wonder if theres something wrong with this because that seems to be knocking around here do you see so inevitably inevitably you are going to make mistakes if you want to call them that in running r4m2 inevitably because you can only run as deep as the meter can subitsa thats all the deeper you can run on the case and the case is so jammed up and the itsa is so close to the top particularly when you start the case that of course perception is very difficult now if the perception of this is very very difficult how thorough does your information on what it consists of in its basic mechanics have to be are you in any position at all to be fumbling around with what are the basic mechanics of gpms and the mind and so forth and what does the mind really look like are you in any position to be fumbling around with that when you already got these troubles of the pc cant itsa any corner of it and the thing is so jammed up and overcharged that we cant subitsa with the meter worth nickel on it and were making mistakes withthereat the same time do we have any time to be coping with noncomprehension of what were handling well the easy part of all this simply hangs up on this one fact the comprehension of it is simple because its anatomy is very simple the mind could be very fancy you could probably write billions of words describing the number of phenomena and significances and odd bits and types of this and that in the mind and theyre all very interesting curiosa and very accomplished auditor would know about an awful lot of them because he would have run into them at one time or another but few minutes ago in this lecture i was able to sum up everything in the mind in relatively few wordsthat is everything in the mind that has any bearing on aberration or is touched by auditing when auditing is successful and its just little hatful of stuff its just your thirty bricksthe goals that sort of thing but those bricks can get tangled up with the implant gpms you know they all have goals and theyll rocket read too they actually derive their force and rocket reads by the way from the actual gpms you got these various things there they are stretched out your pcs got them except the probability of his twenty thirty brickseven though hes lived them and laid them outthe probability of those things being in string or being undisturbed of all the items being neatly in the proper brick of all the bricks being separatethe possibility of this occurring is not remote but nonextant theres slightest possibility that this is going to be the condition of the bank when you begin to operate on the bank its jam mess jam mess the gpms have helped jam it but the pc has been enthusiastic in jamming it too one way or the other these things have gotten pulled out this way and pulled out the other way and pulled off some other way and chipped up this side and hauled down that side and so forth oh theyre all neat and when you audit them they go all together like welloiled clickityclick machine if youve got gpm eighteen and youve run everything down to gpm eighteen then you can find the topthe top oppterm and the top terminal and every ri in it just as neat as you please right down to the goal as an ri the whole thing will blow down and blow up and thats the end of it oh yes itll all performitll very very neat but your difficulty comes when the eighteenth brick from the beginning of time is pulled up in advance of the present time gpm and your listing for the present time gpm finds the eighteenth brick to be god you see something like this you know good sound present time gpm you know crunch present time gpm to not use my powder puff so often you know theres ways of recognizing these things and when youwhen you get this stuff really down why youll see what these things but it goes together just like that theres less to learn about it than building mechanical toy or building little block house out of kids blockstheres less to learn about it than that but the point is learn it and respect what youve learnedunderstand what it amounts to and then youve understoodyouve understood all the basics of existence this is what somebody is doing this is how he did it and this is whats wrong with him this is what youre untangling and this is what youre straightening out and so forth and solid command of this delivers fantastic amount of ease into your hands at whatever level of auditing this guy comes in hes going rrww rrww and smmmmllldaadaadaaraa and so forth and this is only level ii youre doing and so forth lets do an arc break assessment on list 4 phrasing it in some way or anotherhas goal of yours been disturbed you know goal of yours that has mass with it has that been disturbed itll register in some fashion or another and pat some gpm back into place see straighten out some ris that he doesnt even know are ris you could get very very smooth at this kind of thing you could practically put him back together again without auditing anything dont you see you should be able to handle these things well but basically you should be able to understand these things and you should be able to understand the mind as the mind as mechanical piece of stuff not as bunch of significances and not as divine creation which is given man to speed his learning and thinking and has made man into the being he is today lord of all creation just deliver some of that understanding into your hands and youll have lot of luck with pcs and so forth and you will be disabused at once of tremendous worry over your pc because youll be able to perceive much more rapidly whats wrong and at the same time deliver into your hands lot of power to get results over your pc and those two things are very desirable as i think you will agree thank you
