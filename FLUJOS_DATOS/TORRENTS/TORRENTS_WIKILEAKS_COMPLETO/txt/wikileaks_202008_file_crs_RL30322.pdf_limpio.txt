information privacy for online transactions the term information privacy refers to an individuals claim to control the terms under which personal information is acquired disclosed and used in the united states there is comprehensive legal protection for personal information the constitution protects the privacy of personal information in limited number of ways and extends only to the protection of the individual against government intrusions however many of the threats to the privacy of personal information occur in the private sector any limitations placed on the data processing activities of the private sector will be found not in the constitution but in federal or state law there is comprehensive federal privacy statute that protects personal information held by both the public sector and the private sector federal statute exists to protect the privacy of personal informat ion collected by the federal government the private sectors collection and disclosure of personal information has been addressed by congress on sectorbysector basis with the exception of the childrens online privacy protection act of 1998 none of these laws specifically covers the collection of online personal information the federal government currently has limited authority over the collection and dissemination of personal data collected online president clintons information infrastructure task force supports industry standards for privacy protect ion the federal trade commission act prohibits unfair and deceptive practices in commerce and the commission has brought enforcem ent actions to address deceptive online information pract ices in june 1998 the federal trade commission presented report to congress titled privacy online which examined the information practices of over 1400 commercial web sites and found that the vast majority of online businesses have yet to adopt even the most fundamental fair information practice the commission issued new report to congress in july 1999 on selfregulation and online privacy and found that the vast majority of the sites surveyed collect person information from consumers online and that the implementation of fair information practices is not widespread the ftc issued new report in may 2000 after another survey of web sites notwithstanding measurable gains since the 1999 report to congress majority of the commission found that selfregulation alone without some legislation is unlikely to provide online consumers with the level of protection they seek and deserve and recommended that congress consider

the resolution of issues related to the privacy and security of online personal information1 privacy is thus thrust to the forefront of policy discussions among businesses governments and citizens twentytwo years ago the privacy protection study commission recommended steps be taken to strike proper balance between the individuals personal privacy interests and societys information needs2 this paper discusses some potential threats to the privacy of online personal information3 and efforts by businesses governments and citizens to respond to them the paper also provides an overview of the legal framework for the protection of personal information threats to the privacy of personal information arise primarily as result of the widespread increase in the availability and use of computers and computer networks the corresponding increase in the disclosure of personal information by internet users to web sites the routine collection of personal information about online users by web sites and the utilization of online personal information for direct marketing and advertising purposes the potential harm that can occur from unauthorized disclosures of such information has been well documented4 increased availability of online personal information has contributed to the growth of the information industry technological safeguards such as encryption are viewed as tools to enhance computer security and protect privacy encryption also has the potential to impede the ability of law enforcement and national security agencies to access electronic communications5 for discussion of

the use of online personal information for commercial purposes because of the power of computer networks to quickly and inexpensively compile analyze share and match digitized information electronic information is potentially much more invasive information that is stored electronically often can be linked by use of the same key such as the social security number the widespread use of the social security number for secondary purposes eg credit financial motor vehic health insurance etc has contributed to this phenomenon computers make information multifunctional as vast amounts of consumer information are collected generated sorted disseminated electronically and perhaps sold with or without consent how valuable the information is depends in part on how descriptive it is and how it can be used the federal trade commission and the department of commerce recently held public workshop on online profiling to assess the impact of online profiling the practice of aggregating information about consumers interests gathered primarily by tracking their movements online and using the profiles to create targeted advertising on web sites18 one result of these technological advances has been the rapid growth and expansion of the information industry basically there are three major participants in the information industry government entities federal state local direct marketers and reference services19 generally each of them gathers and distributes personally identifying information the information may be gathered for one purpose and sold for another public records held by government entities contain personally identifying information such as name address and social security number government records are generally publicly available and often represent significant sources of revenue for government agencies direct marketers rely on lists designed to target individuals who are likely to respond to solicitations to determine who should be solicited for particular product service or fund raiser frequently they rent preexisting lists from list brokers who group information such as similar interests characteristics and purchasing habits the list may be obtained from consumer surveys warranty or response cards and customer purchase data the lists may also be merged with other lists or with information from other sources such as public records and magazine subscriptions reference services gather information from variety of sources compile it and then make it commercially available20 common users of reference services include law firms privat

group of individuals eg household is acquired disclosed and used23 others urge the construction of market for personal information to be viewed differently than other commodities in the market24 constitutional protection s in the united states there is comprehensive legal protection for personal information the constitution protects the privacy of personal information in limited number of ways and extends only to the protection of the individual against government intrusions constitutional guarantees are not applicable unless state action has taken place many of the threats to the privacy of personal information addressed in this paper occur in the private sector and are unlikely to meet the requirements of the state actio n doctrine as result any limitations placed on the data processing activities of the private sector will be found not in the federal constitution but in federal or state statutory law or common law the federal constitution makes explicit mention of right of privacy and the zones of privacy recognized by the supreme court are very limited the fourth amendment searchandseizure provision protects right of privacy by requi ring warrants before government may invade ones internal space or by requiring that warrantless invasions be reasonable however the fourth amendment cannot be translated into general constitutional right to privacy that amendment protects individual privacy against certain kinds of governmental intrusion but its protections go further and often have nothing to do with privacy at all25 similarly the fifth amendments selfincrimination clause was once thought of as source of protection from governmental compulsion to reveal ones private papers26 but the court has refused to interpret the selfincrimination clause as

degree may be construed to protect the liberty of persons in their privacy rights in cases that implicate fundamental rights or those implicit in the concept of ordered liberty such as marriage procreation contraception family relationships child rearing and education30 in an important decision in whalen v roe31 the supreme court recognized right of informational privacy whalen concerned new york law that created centralized state computer file of the names and addresses of all persons who obtained medicines containing narcotics pursuant to doctors prescription although the court upheld the states authority it found this gathering of information to affect two interests the first was an individual interest in avoiding disclosure of personal matters the other the interest in independence in making certain kinds of important decisions32 these two interests rest on the substantive due process protections found in the fifth and fourteenth amendments in the supreme courts october 1999 term it addressed the constitutionality of the drivers privacy protection act of 1994 dppa which regulates the use and disclosure by state motor vehicle departm ents of personal information from motor vehicle records33 in reno v condon the court unanimously held that the dppa is valid exercise of the commerce power and does not violate the tenth amendment34 the dppa prohibits state departments of motor vehicles dmvs and others to whom the dmvs provide information from disclosing drivers personal information name address phone number vehicle description social security number etc without the drivers consent dmvs that violate the act are subject to civil penalties the drivers information that the dppa regulates is used by insurers marketers and others engaged in interstat commerce to contact drivers with customized solicitations and therefore this information in this context constitutes an article of commerce subject to regulation under the commerce power the court held that the dppa does not violate the federalism principles reflected in the tenth amendment although the court found that compliance with the dppa will require time and effort on the part of state employees the dppa did not commander states in enforcing federal law applicable to private entities the dppa regulates state activities directly rather than seeking to control the manner in

enforce the core principles of privacy protection with these fair information practice principles and indust ry guidelines as background the commission conducted survey of commercial sites on the world wide web although the commission has encouraged industry to address consumer conc erns regarding online privacy through selfregulation the commission did not find an effective selfregulatory system the survey results found that the vast majority of online businesses had yet to adopt even the most fundamental fair information practice noticeawareness moreover trade association guidelines submitted to the commission did not reflect industry acceptance of the basic fair information practice principles nor contain with limited exception the enforceme nt mechanisms needed for an effective selfregulatory regime in the 1998 report the commission concluded that greater incentives were needed to encourage self regulation and ensure widespread implementation of the basic privacy principles in the specific area of childrens online privacy the commission recommended that congress develop legislation placing parents in control of the online collection and use of personal information from their children in response to the concerns over the privacy of childr ens online personal information the 105th congress passed the childrens online privacy protection act of 199854 to prohibit unfair and deceptive acts and practices in connection with the collection and use of personally identifiable information from and about children on the internet the act specifies that operators of websites or online services directed to children or an operator who knowingly collect personal information from children 1 provide parents notice of their information practices 2 obtain prior parental consent for the collection use andor disclosure of personal information from children with certain limited exceptions for the collection of online information eg email address 3 provide parent upon request

authorizes state attorneys general to enforce compliance with the final rule by filing actio ns in federal court after serving prior written notice upon the commission when feasible the final rule was issued in october 1999 and became effective april 21 200055 the commission issued new report to congress in july 1999 on selfregulation and online privacy56 that assessed the progress made since its 1998 report and set an agenda for commission actions to encourage implementation of online privacy protections the commission found notable progress in selfregulatory initiatives and that online businesses were providing significantly more notice of their information practices however it also found that the vast majority of the sites surveyed collected personal information from consumers online and that the implementation of fair information practices was not widespread the ftc found the emergence of online privacy seal programs truste57 bbbonline58 and other online privacy seal programs to be promising development in selfregulation these programs require their licensees to abide by codes of online information practices and to submit to compliance monitoring in order to display privacy seal on their web site however the commission found that only handful of all web sites currently participate in online privacy seal programs and that as result it was too early to judge how effective these programs will be in light of its preferred approach to privacy protection through selfregul ation the commission concluded that legislation to address online privacy was not appropriate at the time instead the commission developed an agenda to address online privacy issues and identified areas where industry could improve on continue to encourage widespread adoption of fair information pract ices ensure that companies adhere to the core privacy principles and educate consumers about privacy protection on the internet the ftc issued new report in may 2000 after another survey of web sites59 as chairman pitofsky stated in the report the issue before the commission was not whether selfregulation succeeded or failed but rather whether the progress of online implementation of fair information practice principles continues to suggest that legislation is warranted notwithstanding measurable gains since the 1999 report to congress majority of the commission

harbor with presumption of adequacy and data transfers from the european community to them could continue orga nizations would come into the safe harbor by self certifying that they adhere to these
