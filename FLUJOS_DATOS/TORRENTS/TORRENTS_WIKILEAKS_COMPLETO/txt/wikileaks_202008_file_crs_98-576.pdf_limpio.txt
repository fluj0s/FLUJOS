ago the loss in annual income in areas immediately aff ected by desertifi cation was estimated at 42 billion year including losses of about 5 billion in north america efforts addressing both desertification and drought culminated in the convention to combat desertifica tion which tered into force on d ecember 26 1996 ratifying countries meet in conferences of the parties cop to address treaty implementation the sixth cop is pl anned for october 1931 2003 new committee for the review of the implemen tation of the convention will meet from november 1829 2002 to review reports from

onsequences and remedies desertification is the degradation of land in arid semiar id and dry subhumid areas collectively known as drylands wh ile the causes of dese rtification are varied and complex it is generally attributed to combination of climatic variations and human activities that tax the nds ability to support vegetation1 the chief climatic problem is drought while some comm only cited manmade factors include population pressure overgrazi ng poor irrigation deforest ation overcultivation and overuse of water supplies in the past drylands gene rally recovered from drought but contemporary human activities in many areas may undermine their recovery complicating the problem is that desertification is not the same everywhere and key factors are sitespecific among the contributing factors in particular area are the natural environment natura l and other disasters local and international economic conditions land laws and customs nd technologies employed on the land while land degradation nd poverty often are linked the nature of the relationship is unclear some experts c onclude that land degr adation is primary cause of poverty in the most arid countries but it also has been asserted that the relationship is circularla nd degradation leads to poverty which leads to land degradation in continuing cycle ma ny observers agree that the confluence of poverty and land degradation contribute to diverse social problem s including famine civil strife and mass migration the economic loss from desertification is substantial several years ago the united nations environment programme unep estimated the loss in annual income in areas immediately affected by desertification at pproximately 42 billion year including losses of about 5 billion in north america unep also concludes that there may be higher indirect economic and social costs outside the affected areas such as from the migration of environmen tal refugees and losses to national food production2 diverse remedial measures exist to halt desertification including reducing grazing rotating productive activity such as agriculture afforesting areas providinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98576crs2 3 ibid

administration fact sheetsalternatives to fuelwood for energy or pr oviding alternative livelihoods to people in arid areas these measures may be difficult or controversial to implement in particular areas because they may require ch anges in longstanding practices several years ago the unep estimated the cost of combating desertification at between 10 billion and 22 billion annually for 20year program3 regional implications desertification threatens approximately one quarter of the land in the world and about billion people in both developing nd developed countries desertification often is associated with africa where 73 of the drylands are moderately or severely desertified but it afflicts regions all over the world in recognition of the global nature of the problem the treaty contai ns four regional annexes for combating desertification in africa asia latin am erica and the caribbean and the northern mediterranean moreover north america has higher proportion of drylands affected by desertifica tion74than africa howeve r africas significantly larger dryland area and its weaker economic conditi ons have made it harder for african countries to deal with desertifica tion accordingly combating desertification has been priority of africans in di scussions about the environment some 18 developed countries including th united states are directly affected by desertification by one estimate 37 of the united stat consists of arid semi arid or dry subhumid land sceptible to desertification4 these lands are located in 17 western states stretching from mexico to canada desertification in the united states has been associated with western grazing and water management practices the united states has long history of managing its drylands and combats drought through variety of programs and institutions the indirect effects of desertifica tion abroad have been widely noted desertification may pr ompt increased us foreign aid and in some cases migration to the united states it also may redu ce trade and other business opportunities and threaten the sustainability of agricultural production that feeds the worlds increasing population united nations convention to combat desertification history and origins in 1977 the united nations adopted plan of action to combat desertification at conference on desertification in nairobi kenya under the plan

efforts desertification was among the major issu addressed but not resolved by the 1992 united nations conference on envi ronment and development unced5 the conference recommended that the united nations general assembly establish an intergovernmental negotiating committee inc d to draft by june 1994 treaty to combat desertification afri can countries in particular supported this proposal and

strategies nd priorities for comba ting desertification action programs are to be developed in consultations among affected countries donors and intergovernmental and nongovernmental organizations the treaty identifies items that must be and others that might be incorporated in action programs for example action programs must include longterm strategies provide for effective participation of local

countries other organizations may partic ipate voluntarily as did the united states before becoming party to the treaty primary function of the cop is to review reports of the parties on treaty complian ce and make relate d recommendations the treaty establishes entities to support the cop it creates permanent secretariat to handle various administrative functions such as arranging meetings preparing documents and transmitting informati on at its first session the cop decided to locate the secretariat in bonn germany in addition co mmittee on science and technology is tablished to provide the cop with information and advice on scientific and tec hnological issues related to combating desertification the cop also may establish ad hoc panels through the committee on science and technology to advise on particular issues the committee on science and technology maintains roster of experts c onsisting of nominations by parties to the treaty from which the ad hoc panels are co mposed several such panels have been created to date such as the ad hoc panel on early warning systems to help the cop mobilize and channe l funding the treaty creates global mechanism rather than directly provide financial resources the global mechanism is to inventory relevant programs and provide financ ial advice and information on funding to parties and others it seeks to mobilize and channel money to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of resour ces spent in developing countries on desertification it is ad ministered by the international fund for agricultural development the treaty also spells out the financial respons ibilities of countries for instance affected devel oping country parties are to mobilize adequate financial assistance to support their national action programs and devel oped country parties are to mobilize financial resour ces to support these efforts international and domestic status international status countries affected by sertification are developing and carrying out action programs that spell out how to combat desertification in particular area these plan s are seen as the foundation fo r addressing sertification and their implementation is evaluated by the parties to the treaty criteria for developing these programs are spelled out in the five regional annexes to the treaty to date 42 national action pr ograms and 4 subregional action programs have been submitted to the secretariat from the count ries covered by the different regional annexes this includes 24 national pr ograms from african countries and 4 subregional programs from african areas where combating desertification is priority due to its severity on that continent the conference of the parties to the tr eaty has held five annual meetings to

the implementation of programs to combat desertification as part of efforts to achieve sustainable development in africa the draft plan contains an agreement to provide fina ncial and technical support to africa to implement the desertification treaty among other actions how to finance antidesertification effort s under the treaty and the role of the global environmental facility in this regard have been key issues of debate among parties to the treaty established in 1991 the gef helps developing countries fund sustainable development pr ojects that protect four specific global environment problem areas13 the four focal areas for funding projects are biodiversity climate change international waters and the oz one layer project s addressing land degradation as they relate to these four areas also have received funding the gef reports that between 1991 and 1999 it sp ent more than 350 million on projects focused on deforestation and desertification many developing countries have b een advocating the creation of gef desertification focal area to raise the profile of the issue and to increase resources for implementing antidese rtification projects at december 2001 meeting the gef council supported designating land degradation which compasses deforestation and desertification as an dditional focal area for funding projects this decision will be presented for approval to the gef ssembly at its october 2002 meeting the council also recommended that the gef secr etariat take into account the results of the fifth conference of the parties to the desertification treaty relating to addressing the povertyenvironment nexus when it deve lops program for the new focal areahttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98576crs8 at may 2002 meeting the council noted that the gef would need to work closely with the global mechanism created unde r the treaty in assisting developing countries with funding sustainabl land management projects many developing countries also suppor t designating the gef as th funding mechanism for the desertification treaty as means of providing direct funding for antidesertification efforts the unite d states the european union and other countries have opposed designating the gef as the funding mechanism asserting that it would not increase funds for the treat and would require amendment and re ratification of the treaty how to finance activities worldwide unde r the desertification treaty and the related role of the gef likely will be subject of further deliberation at the world summit on sustainable development the preparatory committee could not agree on key aspects of financing issues so tent ative language on securing financing was noted in the draft plan the tentative nguage calls on the second assembly of

calls on the second assembly to consider making the gef financial mechanism for the treaty as complement to the role of the global mechanism established by the treaty to mobilize resources related

became party on february 15 2001 in sending the treaty to the senate for advice and consent the clinton administration asserted that the us obligations would be met by current law and ongoing assistance programs conseque ntly implementing legislation was not introduced or requested at that time further the resolution of ratification agreed to by the senate contained the understanding that changes to existing us land management practices and pr ograms would be required to meet us obligations under certain articles of the treaty at th time the us dealt domestically with arid lands and

resources such as technology to countries affected by desertification after signing the treaty but before becoming party the united states made relatively modest contributions to the united nations in support of the desertification treaty the contributions ranged from 15000 in fy1995 to 125000 in fy2000 after the us ratification of the treaty for fy2001 the us contribution increased to 11 million which was prorated because the united states was party to the treaty during only part of that year in fy2002 the united states contribution was 17 million these amounts are based on ited nations scale of assessments adjusted for differences in membership between the united nations and the treaty itself the united states agency for interna tional development usaid handles the majority of us activities abroad in suppor t of the desertifica tion treaty estimated at 90 million annually few usaid programs have stated objective of combating desertification rath er desertification is addressed through pr ograms pertaining to sustainable agriculture natural resour ce management biodive rsity conservation forestry management and integrated wa ter resource management these programs are implemented in diverse regions but primarily in africa focus is on building the capacity of communities and local institu tions to use new technologies and tools to improve management of lands and re sources usaid also provides input into technical issues related to desertifica tion and reviews action plans of developing country parties14 since becoming party to the treaty the state department has focused on issues related to the effective functioning of the treaty secretariat which handles the treatys administrative functions the partment also has supported the idea of creating desertification focal area in the global environmental facility to make it easier for the gef to direct money to antidesertification activities however the department has resisted effo rts to designate the gef as the funding mechanism for the treaty15 the resolution of ratification agreed to by the senate contained proviso that two years after the treaty entered into force for the united states and biennially thereafter the secretary of state is to report to the senate committee on foreign relations on treaty implementa tion and benefits to the united states among other issues thus the first such report is due on february 15 2003
