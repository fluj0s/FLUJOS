activities sometimes states establish taxes to fund specific purposes other times taxes may be credited to the states general treasury to be used for any state purpose one type of tax that is commonly relied on by many states to fund portion of their shar of medicaid program costs is tax on health care providers these taxes called provider taxes are required to comport with certain federal laws established by congress in 1991 and modified in 2005 and 2006 the 1991 law set rules for provider taxes and for two other medicaid funding mechanisms to minimize state practices that were viewed as ways for states to circumvent their statefederal shared responsibility for funding the medicaid program subsequent changes to federal law and to the administrative procedures governing the use of provider taxes have represented continuing struggle between ensuring the shared financin g responsibility for medicaid while balancing states rights and need to raise funds for state programs and medicaid providers1 new rules issued in february of 2008 conform the administrative regulations to the legislative changes made by congress in 2005 and 2006 as well as make other changes to the procedures for approving provider taxes the rule changes become effective in april of 2008

providerspecific tax amendments pl 102234 this bill grappled with several medicaid funding mechanisms that were sometimes used to circumvent the statefederal shared responsibility for funding the cost of the medicaid program under these funding methods states collect funds through taxes or other means from providers and pay the money back to those providers as medicaid payments while claiming the federal matching share of those payments states were essentially borrowing their required state matching amounts from the providers once the state share was netted out the federal matching funds claimed could be used to raise provider payment rates to fund other portions of the medicaid program or for other nonmedicaid purposes in some cases provider groups initiated the process by approaching the state and requesting that one of the financing programs be implemented in exchange for improved payment rates funded by the federal matching amounts at the time that the 1991 law was deliberated many of the provider taxes on the books specifically targeted only those providers that accepted medicaid payments because those were the only providers for whom it would be rou tine and legal to pay back the borrowed funds through medicaid payments the 1991 law sought to address some of the mechanisms that allowed these arrangements to work with respect to providerspecific taxes the 1991 law requires provider taxes be broad based and uniformly applied to all providers within specified classes of providersin other words states cannot limit the provider taxes only to medicaid

medicaid expenditures and prohibits states from direct or indirect guarantee that providers receive their money back or be held harmless for the purpose of claiming federal matching payments the specified classes of providers used to ensure that tax programs are broadbased are those that provide the following inpatient hospital services outpatient hospital services nursing facility services other than servic of intermediate care facilities for the mentally retarded services of intermediate care facilities for the mentally retarded physicians services home health care services outpatient prescription drugs services of medicaid managed care organizations including health maintenance organizations preferred provider organizations and such other similar organizations as the secretary may specify by regulation2 other classifications of health care services as specified by the secretary3 requiring that all providers within class be taxed as opposed to only medicaid providers dampened the ability of states to establish such taxes the reason is that medicaid providers could easily be held harmless by inflating medicaid payments other providers could not be repaid so simply and therefore would be more likely to oppose the imposition of such taxes recent changes to law include provision in the deficit reduction act of 2005 dra pl 109 171 which altered one of the specified classes of providers the medicaid managed care organizations class was changed to all managed care organizations the tax relief and health care act of 2006 trhca pl 109432 included provision changing the rules exempting taxes from scrutiny of their hold harmless provisions those rule changes are described more fully below g20g142g144g158g149g138g157g146g152g151g156g561 federal regulations further define the rules with which medicaid provider taxes must comply most regulations have been in place since not long after the 1991 law was enacted4 following the passage of trhca and dra the center for medicare and medicaid services issued new 2 the deficit reduction act of 2005 dra pl 109171 modified this class of providers by changing medicaid managed care organizations to all managed care organizations this change further broadened the group upon which tax could be imposed thereby reducing the potential for abusive tax programs 3 number of other classifications are described in the regulations at 42 cfr 43356 4 the rules regarding provider taxes can be found at 42 cfr part 433 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22843g15g142g141g146g140g138g146g141g561g18g155g152g159g146g141g142g155g561g22

states tax to determine whether taxpayers are held harmless positive correlation test medicaid payment test and guarantee test taxes that fail any of those tests are determined to have hold harmless provision in violation of the law 5 positive correlation test is used to determine whether state or other unit of government imposing the tax provides directly or indirectly for nonmedicaid payment to the taxpayers in an amount that is positively correlated to either the tax amount or the difference between their medicaid payment and the tax amount the medicaid payment test is violated if all or any portion of the medicaid payment to the taxpayer varies based only on the amount of the total tax payments the guarantee test is violated if the state or other unit of government imposing the tax provides directly or indirectly for any payment offset or waiver that guarantees to hold taxpayers harmless for all or portion of the tax g21g138g143g142g561g10g138g155g139g152g155g561 the administrative rules however waive the application of those hold harmless tests when the tax is applied at rate that produces revenues that are less than or equal to between 55 and 6 of the revenue received by the taxpayer this threshold has been referred to as safe harbor trhca changed the threshold under which tax programs could avoid being tested for violations of the hold harmless rule the rule in effect before thrca allowed for taxes on providers of 6 or less of their revenue to forego scrutiny of hold harmless provisions thrca changed the threshold so that for fiscal years beginning on or after january 1 2008 through september 30 2011 taxes at or below 55 of revenues could forego such scrutiny after that period the threshold would revert to 6 of revenues

of changes to the centers for medicare and medicaids cmss policies for reviewing health carerelated taxes two of the changes implement provisions enacted in trhca and dra as described above there are

revise the threshold for determining if tax program is required to undergo test to determine whether provider is being held harmless for the tax payment and clarify use of the term revenues 2 clarify standards for determining the existence of hold harmless arrangement 3 codify one class of health care services permissible for establishing health care provider taxes and 4 remove obsolete language in addition few other notable changes are made all of which are described in more detail below

changes made by thrca the new rule changes the threshold under which tax programs could avoid scrutiny of hold harmless provisions from 6 of taxpayers revenue to 55 for fiscal years beginning on or after january 1 2008 through september 30 2011 in addition the regulation further specifies that the revenues against which the 55 threshold should be applied are net operating revenues the former regulation had not specified the type of revenues against which to apply the threshold test g18g142g155g150g146g156g156g146g139g149g142g561g140g149g138g156g156g142g156g561g152g143g561g156g142g155g159g146g140g142g156g561 as described above dra broadened one permissi ble class of services from the services of medicaid managed care organizations to those of all managed care organizations the regulation makes changes to conform with the dra ch ange it further specifies that all services of mcos regardless of payer source will be considered permissible class of health care items or services for the purpose of the taxes this is to reduce incentives for mcos to reorganize to separate their business lines thereby isolating medicaid business for the purpose of imposing medicaid taxes only on the subsidiary of the mco the preamble of the proposed regulation notes that this practice was found to be occurring 7 g5g149g138g155g146g143g162g561g156g157g138g151g141g138g155g141g156g561g143g152g155g561g145g152g149g141g561g145g138g155g150g149g142g156g156g561g157g142g156g157g156g561 several clarifications are made in the application of three tests to determine if tax includes prohibited hold harmless positive correlation testone clarification involves the determination of whether tax includes direct or indirect nonmedicaid payment to the tax payers that is positively correlated to the tax amount or to the difference between the medicaid payment and the tax amount in the past the use of the term positively correlated raised disagreements about allowable taxes tax programs disallowed by cms were subsequently reinstated by an appeals board because the positive correlation test was not applied in strict statistical manner this regulation would allow finding of hold harmless for payments and taxes that are correlated even when there is not strict correlation in mathematical sense this change would ensure that cms is able to apply the positive correlation test in the broadest manner possible allowing that positive correlation can exist even if the correlation varies over time the correlation changes or if the payment to the taxpayer is conditional on the payment of the tax the preamble of the proposed rule argues for the need for flexibility and subjectivity in the review of 7 proposed regulation with comment period was published on march 23 2007 72 federal register 13726

harmless plans that could be created the medicaid payment testunder the medicaid payment test hold harmless arrangement exists if all or any portion of medicaid payment varies based only on the amount of the tax payment the new rule adds clarification to allow for finding that medicaid payment varies based on the tax payment when payment is conditional on the tax payment the preamble of the proposed rule states that because medicaid payments are required by statute to be based on efficiency economy and quality of care payments conditioned solely on the payment of tax are considered to be in violation of that law the guarantee testunder the existing regulation tax arrangements that include direct or indirect guarantee that holds taxpayers harmless for any portion of their tax costs are considered to be in violation of the hold harmless prohibition the new rule further specifies that the hold harmless rule is violated if tax arrangement includes direct or indirect guarantee of direct or indirect payment of any portion of their tax costs the new rule includes number of other changes as well it removes all references to transition periods that expired in the early 1990s it standardizes the terminology used for referring to the tax amount and the payment amount across all of the hold harmless tests the purpose of this change seems to be twofoldto reduce confusion raised by using slightly different terms in different places for the same thing and to utilize terms that are sufficiently broad to allow for the maximum amount of flexibility for the agency in applying the hold harmless tests it makes parallel changes to the provisions implementing the hold harmless prohibition for bona fide provider donations hhs estimates that the imposition of the rule would reduce federal medicaid outlays by 04 billion over the fiveyear period beginning in 2008 the congressional budget office estimates the impact to be reduction in federal outlays of 06 billion over the same period states however in responding to survey conducted by the staff of the house committee on oversight and government reform estimate their loss of federal medicaid funds to be over 5 billion for the period an amount more than 10 times the hhs estimates 8 g17g153g153g152g156g146g157g146g152g151g561g157g152g561g157g145g142g561g20g158g149g142g561 opposition to the rule was expressed in letter from the american public human services association and the national association of state medicaid directors to the acting administrator of cms 9 the letter raised concerns that the rule reduces

specific provisions were raised as well based on their survey of state medicaid directors the majority staff of the house committee on oversight and government reform conclude that the fiscal and programmatic impacts of cmss recent regulatory changesincluding the provid er tax regulationare far more extensive than has been understood and warn against making such changes without fully understanding the impact on medicaid programs and beneficiaries their results echo the objections of governors and hospital associations expressing the concern that the administrations recent rule changes would have significant impact on medicaid financing that could potentially harm access to medicaid services for medicaid beneficiaries finally congress has taken action as well as part of hr 2642 the supplemental appropriations act of 2008 the war supplemental signed into law on june 30 2008 moratorium is placed on much of the final regulation until april 1 2009 that law halts the
