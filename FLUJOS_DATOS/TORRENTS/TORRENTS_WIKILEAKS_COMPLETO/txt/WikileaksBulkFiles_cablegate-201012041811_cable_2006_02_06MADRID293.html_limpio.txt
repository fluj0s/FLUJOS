prosecutor forced to quit 1 u attorney general candido conde pumpido forced the chief prosecutor of spains national court eduardo fungairino to step down for alleged mismanagement of terrorism cases under his supervision fungairino highlyrespected 26year veteran of the national court will move to position with the supreme court and retain role in terrorism cases fungairinos deputy jesus santos will take over duties as chief prosecutor at least on until successor is named conde pumpido remonstrated fungairino for failing to secure supreme court confirmation of the sentences of alqaida members convicted in september 2005 thus allowing two terrorists to exit prison after having served only half of their sentences and for failing to push for the completion of the 2004 madrid train bombing investigation however fungairinos supporters claim that the zapatero government removed fungairino because of his strong opposition to negotiated settlement with eta negotiations that may require the cooperation of the national prosecutors office 2 u the story immediately developed political overtones with the socialistleaning pais running lengthy descriptions of fungairinos failings and incompetence and serving as platform for conde pumpidos version of events conde pumpido accused fungairino of failing to consult with colleagues and of dominating judicial relations with the us department of justice and with eu counterparts the centrist mundo which is strongly antieta ran headline declaring that fungairino was removed for impeding government negotiations with eta mundo suggested that conde pumpido decided to dismiss fungairino because he had blocked the banned eta front group batasuna from holding public meeting despite hints from zapatero that such meeting might be allowed in the interest of steering eta towards the political arena the opposition popular party and centerright judicial organizations rose to fungairinos defense while centerleft groups and basque nationalist organizations hailed the dismissal early release of convicted terrorists 3 u the main failure cited by conde pumpido the early release of convicted terrorists is troubling but responsibility for the issue rests with several actors under spanish law detainee must be released after serving half their maximum prison term if the sentences have not been confirmed by the supreme court the problem in this instance is that many of the detainees in the barakat yarkas case were held in pretrial detention for nearly four years time that counts towards their sentences since many of those convicted received jail terms of eight or fewer years see full listing in 5 the halfway point came nearly immediately after their september 2005 convictions giving the notoriously slow spanish legal system little time to win confirmation of the convictions by the supreme court it was up to both the prosecutors office and the supreme court to shuttle the cases through and they failed to do so in time to prevent the release of two alqaida cell members the government is expected to move quickly now to prevent further releases comment 4 sbu the embassy has enjoyed close collaborative relationship with fungairino for many years while it is true that he sometimes seemed to have difficulty delegating responsibility he was also seen as key leader by many spanish prosecutors and brilliant legal strategist it appears that his personal and political differences with conde pumpido were the main cause of his removal though the inability to prevent the early release of the terrorist convicts is difficult to defend regardless of the political motives surrounding fungairinos removal his departure will hurt usspain judicial cooperation at least in the short term fungairino was devoted antiterrorism activist who pursued close cooperation with the usg and with eu allies in terrorism cases one piece of good news is that fungairino will reportedly remain member of the usspain bilateral counterterrorism experts working group where he has played positive role in smoothing over conflicts generated by differences in the us and spanish judicial systems also jesus santos fungairinos temporary replacement is well and favorably known to the embassy however this does not outweigh the loss of so valuable an interlocutor in the national prosecutors office terrorist sentences possible release dates 5 u status of terrorists convicted in barakat yarkas case note halfway marks vary because pretrial detention times madrid 00000293 002 of 002 varied said chedadi 8
