rundown on processes lecture given on 19 february 1963 here we are this is the what whats the date male voice 19th february 19th ad 13 saint hill special briefing course one lecture i have little bit of news for you tonight of course theres nothing but good news pouring in here from all sides now and amongst these good newses we found goal in z unit today now that goal by the way was really found in australia but nobody has been able to get it to fire so nobody would do anything with it and it wasnt until all the tone arm action came out of the goal list that the goal itself started to fire and i think thats the way it was and then they got the goal firing and proved it up and so hes away and one goal was found sunday not necessarily germane to the course at large to give you lot of data about staff clearing you wouldnt care about that you see because after all thats just instructors and people of that sort but in actual fact theyre making very good headway as of right this minute we have one two three four five i think it is something on the order of five goals found out of which i think three are actually listing and only about three more people on the staff to go so you see thats coming up close to clean sweep for the staff on clearing this staff probably will be clear within six weeks or something like thatfirstgoal clears starts happening fast doesnt it now in the z unit i havent got the actual statistics in front of but in z unit we have quite few goals being listed on out to clear and all those are moving very well indeed except one that made colossal blunder the auditor bought sell the pc said something like this tremendously intelligent brave goodlooking wonderful person that was i think was the first item up or something like this so the pc said oh thats hohohoho thats hohohoho you know thats and the auditor says of course thats you and immediately lists it as terminal the knucklehead and that gpm just is not running well its all out of gear and so forth because of course the thing is an oppterm the first item up if it is very hightoned item is an oppterm always thats the first one you find always an oppterm if its high toned item if its lowtoned item its the pc because thats the state his goal has gone down into in other words youre looking at the dwindling spiral of the goal and if you dont pay attention to that youre going to get in trouble because pcs go on big sell see they say haha marvelous philanthropic cherished individual oh yes thats you see the hell it is ever never its never never never never never thats the oppterm the pcs goal is dirty little funking rat see something like that thats his terminal rather and his goal is to be good guy see well the first one up if its dirty little rat see something like that thats going to be the terminal and wonderful sterling beautiful adored saintly personthats going to be an oppterm you get that dont let any pc sell you otherwise now you cant use this significance as your final test its whether or not it turns on more mass if its said wrong if its said right it turns on less mass sometimes the pc cant tell very well but you say the terminal to the pc consider committing overts against consider it committing overts either way say it about three times one way and three times the other way one of them will turn on more mass than the other and that one is wrong so watch this in other words the only ballup weve got in z unit is somebody who went straight through his knucklehead and bought big sell on the part of the pc and listed the first item found wrong way to and of course four items later they suddenly run out of items nothing is going right lists dead end the item comes up in the wrong places all kinds of things happen all of them very difficult to handle and so forth and its all traced back to that original blunder of listing something wrong way to oddly enough those goals in z unit which we have had checked out very carefully and those items which have been checked out very carefully by instructors all of those goals are running very well but just before this we had period when we werent checking out the items and do you know that hardly any of those are running well theyre running raggedly compared to those whose items were checked out so that tells us that auditors have been buying occasionally occasionally would fake up the fact that read was there the pc says oh well this is my item something like that well to show you how tough were getting these days an auditor in z unit ran list and only went twentyfour items beyond the last rs or rr see on 3monly went twentyfour didnt go twentyfivegot fivehundredword infraction sheet thats the way it is actually the thing dogged out if hed put about one more item on there it probably would have rocket read another auditor had slight drift up of the ta during the last twenty five didnt note it on the report said that it was flat on the report five hundred word infraction for false auditors report this is the way things are these days you just have to face up to it united states has gone tyrannical russias gone tyrannical the world has gone tyrannical so sbthe saint hill special briefing course has got to keep up the pace thats the way it is the difference is is theyre trying to ruin people and were trying to clear them theres slight difference of polarity in whats going on here and if we win they lose providing they dont join us and were longer trying to join governments were trying to keep the governments sensible enough so that they can eventually join us this is our spirit on the matter were being nice the truth of the matter is everything else in the world is looking very fine ive given you an overlong report on how goals are going here at saint hill but i thought you would be tremendously interested i know i am and ive got my eye on all of these cases and i dont know what you people are doing dogging around down there in the x and the and the 0 and the b units i dont know i think weve got somebody thats that far away from getting into the z unit and some of you very few of you have been here much longer than you should have been here in these lower units and you want to get up there into that z unit and get your goal whistled up and so forth you wont get anyplace playing around in these lower units i mean we ran arc straightwire on you long time ago and we didnt win so were not going to get anyplace till you get in the z unit just make up your mind to it twotwelve original for source lists is the way its going these days all of you expected to have that wiped off your checksheets im afraid were going backwards now were going back to 212 and the 212 original issue is the right way to do it 212a simply tells you how you list down better from an ri thats all but how you find items the original issue of 212 so you havent even got the satisfaction of saying well new checksheets you see new checksheets we want you back on the old checksheets see its the old checksheets twotwelve is what you need to crack the uncrackable case and thats what its for and that takes rock slammer out of circulation does lot of other beneficial things so its very valid technique but its use is relegated 100 percent to just that minor role you cant run this person on 3m so you do 212 and this person is rock slammer you cant keep him insession at all you run him on the original version of 212 and you will find out that they will take off in other words if you cant readily find somebodys goal put them on 212 212a was refinement in listing from ris and that is still with us everything you have learned is now valid this is the first time this has ever happened on the saint hill briefing courseits the first time everything on your checksheets you need the checksheets dont need any changing im going to give you few more lectures and bulletins and so forth and consolidations on this sort of thing but it in actual factit is merely consolidating information and replacing existing tapes and bulletins and im afraid thats all thats going to happen that is very dramatic were in for the long haul here youve got lot of time to learn this you understand some people will still be learning this hundred years from now i can tell you that with accuracy but it neednt be you here on the saint hill briefing course so get busy with yourget busy with your checksheets and lets get away and at least get up into the w unit huh all right now ive already given you considerable amount of data here concerning 212 and so on and 3m but what i think i ought to talk to you about is the interrelationship of processes what processes are for and what they do and all that sort of thing theres new scale of processes out in recent bulletin that tells you the valid processes which are done and taught in academies now there isnt any reason for to have list of these things in front of because i know these things too well and im going to go into these various processes and just tick them off one after the other this is not necessarily in their order as given but these are the valid processes which you ought to have very very good grip on because you will need every single one of them and first and foremost amongst theselisted by the way first not because its the easiest thing to run but because its the lowest grade of case will respond to itis the cchs now the cchs done the way they were being done in 1962okaying peoples physical origins you know acknowledging physical origins running these things not as grind but up to flat point of about three and changing off to the next process and so forththose are the cchs and theyre cchs 1 2 3 4 but there are also some variations to these cchs that you would find very very valuable and youre going to find these extremely valuable someday you realize that as you run spot the wall and so on on people and your meter there isgot lot of tone arm action seeyou realize dont you that this person is so unaccustomed to the physical universe that they have an awful hard time trying to follow direction now if you had great deal of trouble with casenow i mean great deal of trouble you justnothing can happen and so forthyouve got the cchs and what you do in essence even though you dont run the cchs on meter is run the tone arm action out of the cchs now you can do that by checking the pc from time to time on tone arm to get his tone arm read what youre doing there is hauling this fellow up to point where hes enough in present time that he can follow an auditing direction now this in essence takes care of the case who cannot follow an auditing direction and you as auditors are far far too prone to underestimate the ability of case to run now i know this because ive from time to time picked up cases that have been pronounced absolutely unrunnable theres nothing can happen with these cases you see and i remember psychotic girl she was pronounced psychotic by one and all everybody was unanimous on this particular subject and in actual fact she would comply with every auditing command i gave her now that is all you want here is not condition of whether people are crazy or not crazy were not in that business were not in the business of whether people are crazy or not crazy its just method of calling dirty names anyway the psychiatrists have idea whos crazy and whos sane and so forth its just matter of saying this fellows good and the us government wants to get him out of the way so hes crazy its just matter of expediency it says masse we dont agree with this particular person he sees spiders on the ceiling and we dont therefore hes crazy has nothing to do with anything we are doing nothing nothing nothing just forget those classifications we dont care how potty this guys ideas of the physical universe are you know he just might have come down here from the martian scout command or something like this and they probably have very very odd ideas you see the quality the significance of the fellows ideas are business of the auditors i couldnt try to give you better rundown on it i mean i couldnt say it sufficiently emphatically its just business of the auditors fellow walks down the street saying gibbergibbergibber gibbergibbergibbergibber and talking to somebody thats over on his right well yes everybody agrees theres something very eccentric about this persons conduct but actually the auditor has business with that at all the whole test is whether or not this person will sit across the table from you and answer an auditing command that is asked him that is the whole thing now there isnt even any wiggles on this theres getting away from this you understand dont refine that one down you see you realize im talk 9 rather incoherently because i myself have had difficulty getting this point across for many many years and its an old point im trying to get across you know they say well he says it to himself and then he repeats circuit which says it to him and therefore hes not following the auditing command we say to this fellow put your hand on the table and the fellow puts his hand on the table we dont care if it took him while to do it but he will put his hand on the table we ask this person we say to this person who dont you like and the person thinks for moment we dont care much how long he thinks or how clearly he says it but hes on the subject dont you see and he says oooh uhwuhwuhwuhwuh my brother george i dont like him all right now thats an answer to the auditing command we dont care if he goes this way all the time hes doing it or picks bugs off of himself while hes doing it or if he acts with perfect sanity while hes doing it or says in beautiful mellifluous tone of voice while he answers it he can actually answer that we say to him who else dont you like and he thinks for moment and he says well my wife i donti dont like my wife and so on thats all see that is our total requisite its not whether or not the fellow can hold the cans some fellows get shaky hands and so forth if they get too shaky why take his shoes off and strap them to the soles of his feet we dont care about that either you understand its can this fellow answer an auditing question now if he can answer listing auditing question and if he can tell you what his goals are in life and we come right down the line on his goals in life and we can get those and we can somehow or another read those on the meter we actually have business running anything but 3m on that fellow you understand thats the only honest thing to do you understand if we can get his goalget his goal list it get it to fire so forth make clear you get that there isn1 any point doing anything else if he can do it you can do it well now lets take this fellow at the other end of the line and we say to this fellow now who dont you like and he says gob gob gobble gobdudadadowhoo whooo and we say well is that somebody you dont like oh gaga woowoo you say well do you talk american or english or french or something like that and he says yes yes yeah well yeah who where hes not answering the auditing question you get the brutality with which im defining this thing yeah lot of pcs sit there and say lets see who or what would to be catfish oppose let see maybe it maybe its oppose catfish maybe it is so on maybe i better answer it for while to oppose catfish lets see how that works out havingness is getting down i think i better run little havingness people do that sort of thing when theyre being audited by some auditor who is low on control that character is perfectly auditable go ahead and clear him get him in brace make him do it but were talking now about this other fellow and he says who dont you like and he says gobgob gaa what are you going to do youre going to do the cchs you got that thats what it takes now also theres another side test on this thing if the individual in giving you items or goals and so forth just continuously doesnt get any tone arm action you understand and there is way we can get tone arm action we cant get our rudiments in or anything like that and yet by making him spot the walls we can get lot of tone arm action you have another excuse for another type of process which is cch sort of process and thats rudiments and havingness you get that this fellowhell answer your auditing questions but he never gets any tone arm action on list and you cant really find anything and its all very tough youve got another class of processrudiments and havingness now lets go back to cchs for moment that goes down into unconsciousness you can find somebody in one of these states of coma that they talk about in the hospitals and we cure those or do something with them i mustnt use the word cure because the american medical association objects to anybody curing anything it has become illegal to cure anything i hope you appreciate that because they cant its now illegal to do so i dont mean to be bitter about these people you understand im just being factual in fact im being rather kind anyway theyve got this hospital nailed down you see and theres somebody there in coma do you know that you can actually by the way never make rash promise to person like this like ill come back and see you tomorrow when you dont know you can because do you know that if you dont come back and see them tomorrow theyre liable to kick the bucket its happened get ahold of their hand and you can actually get into complete communication with them you say squeeze my hand once for yes twice for thats good gag you ought to try it sometime on an unconscious person they cant talk theyre in coma theyre an accident victim something like this you say squeeze my hand once for yes twice for and then ask them two or three simple questions are you in pain you see and theyll gogive you signal yes or or something like this and you can go on in rather interesting communication line thats with somebody who is incurably gone which is quite interesting to you can get into communication with these people they cant talk in other words theyve lost control of their vocal chords but they can get some kind of muscular response going it takes you little while to get into communication with them sometimes but they will get more and more in communication with them with you and you can go on from there now theres type of cch which is like 8c only you monitor the persons hand and you can monitor it around on the bed you know you can put it up here on the pillow and on the sheet and on the blanket and on the side table and so on you say touch the side table and they touch the side table youre monitoring their hand and oddly enough itll give them an orientation which will bring them out of their coma dont go changing processes its rather heartbreaking affair go along on the same process until you have stabilized bit of change take the other hand perhaps youre playing it off the cuff you understand youre making up your own cchs because this person is unconscious in bed and you cant contact them vocally and you cant check up on your auditing command vocally youve got to be smart so how many cchs can you work out well you can the way to work out how you would do it is to do something like this take doll and put it down on bed and the doll isnt going to respond either and youre going to how many cchs can you run on this doll thats lying in the bed now there is level above that theres person who cannot talk whos totally inarticulate who cant get around in life you know workaday world and that sort of thing these are heartbreakers theyre spastics people of this particular character idiots very very rough to do i wouldnt kid you on this level theyre very very tough to handle you do regular cchs with these people and just carry on acknowledging them real well and so forth but above all never lose your temper never become impatient and flatten what you start and dont run things that are flat too long and youll have some wonderful success with these cases but you have to stay in communication with them now remember this the worse off case is the easier it is to have an adverse effect upon the case the old effect scale see now thats very important because that tells you that an unconscious person may very wellwho is in coma let us say for two weeks or something expire on the breaking of one auditor promise it has happened ill give you an idea this girl said ill come back and see you every day at this hour and also ill come back and see you tomorrow and ill stay with this with you until youve recovered and the medicoswell i dont know if they had medicos or monkeys in charge of this hospital theres not much difference and the medicos wouldnt let this auditor back into the hospital the next day the patient was recovering although still in coma the coma got much lighter much lighter and the person was beginning to heal beginning to straighten out and the medicos barred the person out the auditor had promised to be back the next day wasnt permitted to go into the room and the person lingered around for day or so and died the person was recovering and died broken promise thats all it amounted to i have other evidence on that not just that now thats how little it takes to have an adverse effect upon an unconscious person now how about spastic or person who is classified as moron the common concept of these people is they dont know anything ah but the thing which you do every day out here in auditingjust that moment of you know something on the order of the guy says the session hasnt started for him and you say oh well well take it up in the rudiments something like that look thats too steep for moron youd just blow him to pieces now it isnt that case is bad off who is blown to pieces by this but this would really really ruin him an auditors frown tiny impatience you just have worked and worked and worked and worked to get this guy to lift his hand you know and put it in yours and so forth and he looks little petulant for moment and you yourself become impatient and you say oh damn it give that hand youve ruined him byebye case you understand the worse off case is the easier it is to affect them adversely if you run by that rule you will also see that at those times when normal usual runofthemill pc is being bit bzzh and they all go bzzh at one time or another in sessionat that moment when he apparently is able to stand up to anything because hes maybe being cross with the auditor hes being nasty or hes being this remember that at that moment he is the most easily affectedin the most easily affected state that effect is very heavy extremely heavy all you have to do is frown at him and he practically spins in well youve got reality on that well it works similarly the worse off the more introverted the more upset the case is the more careful and cautious the auditor has to be about maintaining good even friendly discipline toward the pc now on an assist all this applies now there are various kinds of assists there are as many kinds of assists as there are dianetic auditing and everything else you ought to have seen an hda running childs somatic out here few weeks ago of course im t 4 out mary sue dianas nanny got little bit enthusiastic and shoved diana around and actually chipped tooth now mary sue was quite worried about this as you can see since it was permanent tooth and she used about four or five varieties of assist and finally blew the somatic finally blew it 100 percent she decided that shed better blow it 100 percent so that the tooth could grow back bit of enamel see well how manyhow many assists were there well the first thing was she withholding anything about it and then touch it touch it touch it touch it and oh i dont know any one of the infinite variety of contact and communication assists and next day second session took the child down to the exact place that it happened made the child touch the tooth to the porcelain bathtub where it had been cracked see oh boy that kid was very gingery took her to the actual spot see all of sudden blew the thing high wide and handsome oh yes and another sequence of itshe made the child scan through the whole incident lock scanning of all things and got through the incident lot of timesthrough and through and through and through and through and through and through and then contact on the bathtub and then pow there goes the somatic well anyway on assist almost anything goes but this doesnt go sticking somebody in something wit h too great an enthusiasm when the person is in bad condition lets take an auto accident case and this auto accident case is just about gone hes in comatose state and so forth now trying to get too much done in too little time with that case will give you lose about the best thing you can do about the best thing you can do is put the case in some sort of contact with the environment and give the case thennow in other words the automobile accident was then and youre now in now but even so to lay hard and fast rule down about this is difficult because i know of case that was run through the engram of being hit and run over while riding bicyclecar ran over boya little boy on bicycle his father stood there and while the child was unconscious ran him through the engram over and over and over and finally the kid that had fractured skull and everything else opened his eyes and brightened up and the father ran him through it few more times and the kid was all right that sounds adventurous doesnt it well it probably was adventurous but remember auditing in that way is what you can get away with so theres any of these varieties of assists but assist is something that directly attacks the condition in which the person is now we know right away that attacking specific condition is well its fraught with many perils let put it that way its not always smooth road this fellow has cold you say with great enthusiasm all right ill cure your cold see well all right you use some system or method or something of the sort any of the old processes and you just lay an egg thats all you just didnt get there cold is still on hes snoring and having an awful time few days later you uncover another person hes got much worse cold and you do the same thing and the cold goes off just right now and doesnt reappear see well thats the liability of it its whether or not the gpm is keyed in to that thing thats the whole thing if its keyed in on that cold you havent got prayer in other words youd have to run gpm item to get the cold off but i ran into girl on tv one timei told you this story beforeand just with one question of straightwire blew the cold you see and i think it was whos left you in the last few days or something like this and oh my boyfriend george tabang and off went the cold see id noticed that when loved ones are parted they normally come down with colds missing terminal in front of them you know anyway assist assiststhese are thethese are the wide wild horizon they normally consist of contact and getting person out of something and into present time and thats more or less the definition of an assist its something that uses some type of contact whether contact with the bank or with the physical universe or both and it usesor it uses the mechanism of time track to try to get the person up to present time well sometimes he comes right up to present time and the rest of it drops away and sometimes you have to hit the point where hes stuck and bring it up but the more you hit subjective process the more you use subjective processes in an assist the less successful you will be you get that the objective process just on an assist level is more productive so that if younow you can split them up you can use 75 percent objective and 25 percent subjective you see lets getthe fellows oh i have an awful time ive got my hand caught in the door and here it is it still hurts and here it is two days later and it still hurts and you say well im going to help you out on this do you remember the door and so forth and get him you know into it and then use lot of get him out of it see as much getuse about three to one actually little bit of get him into it and lot to get him out of it you see that that characterizes the assist and youll have very successful assists if you do that you say now what door was it oh well lets see what door was it my bedroom it was the frontno it was the bedroom front front door yes it was the front door the front door you say good now hows your hand well he says well it hurts right across there you say all right now take your other hand and touch the places it hurts now thats good touch that place and that place and that place and that place and that place good now you always balance assists touch the other hand see get that hand going ill bet you forgot that one mary sue on yourill bet you didnt take the tooth on the other side female voice oh yes i did oh yes she did she did hah leave it to dianeticist anyway so its touch this hand and then touch that hand and touch this hand now what about that door what about time of day was it and when was it well it was tuesday i guess about four oclock oh wednesday oh it was monday see theyre lost on the time track he finally says yeah it was tuesday it was tuesday about four oclock in the afternoon and you say all right well good touch that hand and touch that hand and so forth and touch that hand you know how you doing nowt1 well just the little pains across there so forth well now whatwas there anybody around when that happened oh house was empty there wasnt anybody presentexcept my wife well yeah my wife was present she was standing right there as matter of fact and you say all right well thank you very much all right touch that hand and touch that hand touch that hand and that you know give itget the idea see spring him and give him some havingness and we get up to the next level which is rudiments and havingness now what canactually can you do with rudiments and havingness well im here to tell you you better learn how to run rudiments and havingness as valuable process because youre going to need it on every raw meat process you ever do because the guy isnt inis insufficiently educated to be processed at the time you pick him up hows that oh youre going to be good enough as an auditor to get somebody to reel off list but along about the time youve got him reeling off the list left and right why he isnt answering the auditing question and he thinks hes got to go home now and he gets up out of the chair and he leavesthat isnt very safe way to go about it if you gave somebody couple of rudiments and havingness sessionsim not talking about you doing private practice in the hgc or something like thatgive this person couple of rudiments and havingness sessions just any kind of rudiments doesnt much matter what things he actually could tell you clean up the problem rudiment for instance you know just clean that up good then give him some havingness and then clean up the problems at the end of the game well that would do lot for him but actually you want this fellow to be able to run the mid ruds and you want him to be able to run havingness so im talking now about whats therapeutic in rudiments and havingness well you clean up the problems rudiment and give him some havingness and clean up the problems rudiment and close the session thatd be very valuable but youre trying to get this fellow drilled in so that he can be audited and so that hes getting used to it in other words most people arent used to being audited if you would ever notice this and although they break into it rather easily andmost of you being good auditors have not ever had much trouble with thisthe pc finds it rather strange and rudiments and havingness session one or twowhen youre going on long haul like clearing breaks the pc into it the pcs capable now of doing things that he was notdidnt think he could do before he can remember something can confront problem he can look at the walls he can feel better do you see that thats the practical use of the rudiments and havingness you can always make somebody feel better if you use the one rudiment of problems and run his havingness and then clean up his problems and then maybe run some more havingness and then close down the session something like that i dont care what model you put this thing on it rather runs the pattern of an assist when youre using it therapeutically dont discount it as valuable process because it is all by itself valuable process but you wind up at the other end with an educated pc hes educated just to this degree he knows that hes got to sit there he isnt wrestling with his own bank while hes finding out about auditing now do i make my point he isnthe isnt wondering whats this fellow going to do whats this fellow going to do and at the same time youre asking him some of the most challenging overwhelming questions you ever heard of well the kind thing to do is just you know take up his problem and find out about it not chatty thing see we want this to be disciplined session because what youre trying to teach him is discipline and you want him to squeeze the cans and you want him to answer up and when you say whats that you know he says whats what and you say well i got read right here whats that problem youre thinking about oh he says to himself hey what do you know i think this and he sees it on the meter there what do you know probably pretty good you know wow you know hes thinking all these things to himself well gosh you know if youre trying to check out somebodys goal or find an item or 2 12 item or something like this and this guy is all involved with the physical universe and hes all involved with his bank and at the same time he says whats the meter i mean whats he doing with the meter two and half hours somebody reported was taken to clean up the emeter in an endsession rudiments some time ago and the fellow came around and wanted to know what was an emeter that was the main thing now in other words familiarization you can use rudiments and havingness with familiarization putting in the big mid ruds for period of time put them in for since yesterday or something like that you see and then run his havingness and put in the big mid ruds again and close the session something like that this is also known as shortsessioning if you have got the idea that session takes place per day youre nuts session takes place during that period which elapses between start of session and end of session and thats the only thing there is to session thats how long session is and thats what makes session and that is actually the basic session so that you can actually run couple of sessions on somebody or three or four sessions if youre doing an hgc you can run two sessions in the morning and two sessions in the afternoon i myself if i were just breaking in new pc would run two sessions in the morning on rudiments and havingness as easy as that you see and in the afternoon why start listing something like his goals by this time he knows all about what im doing and hes not going to be upset with or the form of auditing you see this value to rudiments and havingness because it really exists as value now havingness processes are rather boileddown lately you can get almost any processany pc there is on touch that object or feel that object or notice that object very few pcs fall outside this category of havingness there is just those three its very funny but they seem to reach almost any pc pretty well you ought to put those up to the front of your list as the first three tested and then get fancy with the other ones afterwards and you normally will succeed with the first or second one makes it very easy but the point is you want to get result you want to get result with your rudiments and havingness the main result you want with raw meat is the person becomes disciplined to sitting there and receiving auditing and its pretty crazy trying to give somebody highlevel processas i think it was motts over in new york mentioned this to from the new york organization and he said something to the effect of youre laying the pearls of ophir out in front of this pc and they dont know anything about it at all you know youre doing highlevel process and they havent even learned theyre supposed to answer the auditing command so thats very valuable in rudiments and havingness very valuable to indoctrinate the pc little bit with auditing and they also serve as problems intensive varied over to where you only clear the problem and dont just think thats practice drill because it isnt now theres another practice drill called arc straightwire whats this arc straightwire well its the first time i ever turned off neurosiswas with arc straightwire or some equivalent of it it wasnt called arc straightwire then but as time went on it became arc straightwire and i still was able to turn off neurosis or two with it now were talking carelessly when were saying neurosis what do we mean neurosis well lets put it just this way the fellow feels hes gettinghes going to get worse and worse and worse and its all going to get worse and worse and worse and theres bottom to it you know hes just going to keep going down forever well you run an adequate amount session or twoof arc straightwire and the person becomes aware of the fact that something is stopping him from getting worse and in view of the fact that something is stopping him from getting worse his hope resurges but i have seen people you know strictly on the bugspulling bugs off themselvesturn sane right in front of my eyes on arc straightwire what are thewhats the commands the same command as in the end of self analysis neednt be any vast change about it you could work out from the cause angle better commands and so forth perhaps you could say recall time you communicated with something or somebody recall time you felt some affinity for something or somebody recall time you thought something or somebody was real or you know that type of command but it isnt so much the command its confrontingness its confrontingness on the three principal buttons that make up life and understanding and an individual will suddenly understand little bit more about himself that has ceiling of course you cant run this for days and days and weeks and weeks and expect to get very much out of it its one of these oneshot propositions somebody is feeling pretty spinny run little arc straightwire on them and they feel lot better but its something that stops the spin more than anything else it isnt universally workable it isnt an unlimited process that goes on forever but it is valuable process and it jolly well better not be dropped out of the lineup because its valuable has its uses also it has very good training use you can run this thing and run it and run it its unlimited to the degree that it can be run forever but it wont produce results forever you get the idea it goes up to flat spot and thats that but you can keep on running it and the guy recalls the same things only one thing id like to make remark on is once in while in academies and so forth you see arc straightwire being run in this particular line this is really crazy the guy says recall something thats really real to you and the pc says yes and recall time you felt some affinity pc says yes and the auditor says all right hey whats all this you know you find out after while this guy starts stacking up with missed withholds and things and he starts going out of communication and he starts getting upset so you have to remember when youre running process like that not to take these yes answers the guy says yes well of course the question actually didnt demand he say anything but yes so you have to ask the second question you say what was that oh that was my mother all right you say thats good in other words find out what stay in communication with the pc without nagging the pc now theres another type of assist has loomed over the horizon in the last few months has been what we will call primary buttons suppress invalidate and it comes under the heading of prepcheck assist and all you do is flatten suppress and invalidate theyre just the two buttons and youll find out that if you were giving fivehour intensive if you can imagine such thing to somebody who had been all loused up like fire drill why if you just flattened these two buttons in those five hours you would have done lot for the pc those are primary rudiments theyre one and two just suppress and invalidate and they work wonders they really do i mean you can just take those two for instance i find increasingly today when im trying to get the pc to go on listing i just give him suppress and invalidate and dont give him anything else and before he can get invalidate clear hes listing again so the devil with it why put in the rest of them so those are primary as far as the rudiments are concerned are suppress and invalidate and they make an intensive but it gives us prepcheck and we enter into the level of whatthis whole category called prepchecking now what is prepchecking well its preparatory to clearing and you will always find its preparatory to clearing youll always have to do it as preparatory to clearing or somewhere in clearing youve got to do it so it becomes very necessary skill and there you see it prepcheck assist in its most fundamental form you say start of session since yesterday has anything been suppressed you flatten that permissively repetitively then clean it on the meter or dont clean it at all itll just depend on the pc and then you go on and hit invalidate and get that as long as the pc will answer that and you say all right fine end of session or whatever you care to you find out you have quite remarkable effect but thats sort of an assist sort of proposition well thats actually all prepchecking consists of is just cleaning up these buttons prepchecking is different than fast checking and the only thing that you repetitively use in fast checking is suppress you always get that in repetitively without consulting the meter unless of course youre really trying to unload goal and then you take your last three lefthand buttons this is trick you didnt know you take your three buttons over here on the left suppress fail to reveal and careful of those are your basic suppress type of buttons theyll prevent the read everything elsewell theres couple of them are middle groundbut the rest of them create read or steal read but these things just make the read disappear entirely and they dont even come up you dont even see it on the button sometimes in other words you can have suppress you dont even see suppress read and so on so you clean those three repetitively on the goal you see or on the list or something you want this thing to read you see you cant get this item to read you know this item ought to read and youve seen it read and so forth well just ignore your righthand buttons you want to do fast job why do prepcheck you understand its different than fast check suppress suppress suppress attention to the meter see all prepchecked suppress suppress suppress suppress suppress and he finally runs out of answers you get any answers you can now find on the meter and then fail to reveal fail to reveal fail to reveal prepcheck see fail to reveal fail to reveal fail to reveal and he finally runs out of answers and you find another one on the meter clear that and then careful of careful of careful of careful of careful of careful of careful of and bang he says well thats all over here and you say all right and you check that on the meter and then you read this to be catfish psheww its quite remarkable thats very verythats quickie see thats quickie thats saint hill goals prepcheck you can make almost anything read if its ever going to be made to read by going over and over and over those buttons just well youve got this item in the session and you saw it read yesterday and now youre going to list it and youve got to get the thing firing before you list it so you say catfish and it says tsk huh you say what have you been doing you been doing anything oh nothing catfish tsk oh boy you had it rocket reading half dial well the best way to do it is just get in these lefthand buttons one two three each one prepchecked and you come back and you read this and you say catfish psheww its remarkable performance you can make an item put up and its well worth knowing well thats your lowest level of prepcheck but how many ways can you use prepcheck now ive shown you prepcheck as an assist and ive shown you prepcheck in order to get goals to read and ive shown you prepcheck which only uses the lefthand button well all rightthe left hand buttons and now lets go over and take look at further prepchecks we can chooseyou can choose any period of time and get in the eighteen button prepcheck and when you include goal it givesyou also get the counterbutton to the goal any period of time since you was little boy has anything been suppressed rather indefinite but it still gives you prepcheck and of course its done within the ramifications of session you prepcheck the thing out it means repetitive repetitive repetitive repetitive consultation with the meter till the pc runs out of answers then you consult the meter thats all there is to prepcheck matter how you use this auditing mechanism there it is all right theres unitoftime prepcheck eighteen buttons all right thats pretty remarkable but how about specific item on your motherin law see you can do an eighteenbutton prepcheck on your motherin law and produce some rather remarkable results too and youits all repetitive prepcheck and how many other ways can you use this thing well you can combine the two and you get problems intensive and you find specific item that youre looking for which is the problem the greatest change of his lifetime and then you take period month earlier than that and you prepcheck on that date but actually youre prepchecking at problem but youre prepchecking by command on time getting your eighteen buttons on the thing all the same way marvelous results now you can take on listing_____ in auditing on the goal_____ in listing on the goal______ doesnt matter how you phrase this sort of thing you get these different varieties of prepcheck now thats whole category of processes right up to there and theyre totally adequate for the education of an hca totally adequate now when we start running up into higher level class ii and class iii skills we have 212 the original version modified only as you list from ris reliable items weve got 212 and thats ayoull find out the way you were doing it at firstyou were finding items and all that sort of thing well you just go around finding items that way take the biggest great big wide rock slam that you can pick off the list someplace and oppose it and run it around into fourway package use 212a only to govern your listing and itll always be the last rock slamming item on the list use this and you wont have case that youve fixed their sciatica and you can its visibly fixed everything is going along fine you cured him or something you know and then they say well i dont know whether auditing works or not you know scientology might work and might not work so forth they get up theyve thrown their crutches away and so forth and walk out the door still nattering about how awful you are as an auditor well thats rock slam sort of proposition you see that persons rock slammer and you take specialized list and you just find the biggest widest rs on that prelisted list and take it make fourway package out of it then when you cure their sciatica they say gee my sciaticas cured see in other words the person has reached mentally instead of resisting you in other words that keeps the personits something like rudiments and havingness dont you see at much higher level you give them rudiments and havingness to get used to auditing well you give them 212 so they can appreciate it they actually will never get well unless you do something like that you wouldnt be able to find their goal or anything i doubt it very much that you could crack through such case so thats marvelous thing to have and now we take 3m youve got the créme créme youve worked it up now youve worked the case up along the line youd get that case in state where you could knock these goals off and get rocket reading goals and find the pcs goal by any method that you find the pcs goal and list it on out on 3m and find your items and dont go knuckleheaded on picking the wrong item wrong way to or something like that and it all runs off and by golly you wind up with clear now thats your ramification of processes and as far as im concerned thats it i dont need any more processesyou may think you do but i dontbecause ive been fooled too often by hgc staff auditors and things like that they come in and they want wonderful wonderful new process from see i think them up marvelous wonderful new processesi used to before i learned betterand they go off and they dont do them and now heres series of processes that i know by great subjective reality by excellent objective reality as an auditor by consistent and continual reports out through the world of one kind and another from here and there and so forth i know all these things work and whereas undoubtedly there could be great fund of processes that remain utterly undiscovered well frankly they can go on and remain undiscovered as far as im concerned because we dont need them we dont need them processes are what they are because they depend upon the cooperation and participation of the preclear and his communication with the auditor now therefore well never have processes whereby we tell the guy to drop his pants and we shoot him in the gluteus maximus with horse needle and he becomes clear that will never happen because it absolutely violates the basic principles of selfdeterminism and cause it wont ever happen all right so what do we need we need gradient whereby he can accept cause and in the processes i have given you in this lecture we have got that gradient whereby we can accept cause he can accept cause and he can come on up the line and therefore he can be cleared and we can get everything out of the road that keeps him from being at cause what more do you want well theres ramifications of it and im sure that auditing styles will change from time to time those of you who just passed model session today will be cheered to know that i have just issued brandnew release this afternoon youve got to put up with to this degree actually i codified goal finders model session into much smoother package that puts the pc insession bit better by reversing couple of things in it its actually not much different than anything else you had before but you will see theres little points like this get adjusted as we go fashions change emeters will all get painted black at some period or other you can be sure of that you can be certain that auditing rooms must be at the temperature of 796 in america and 591 in england you can sure that codifications of this kind of thing will be released auditing above the altitude of 6800 feet is not beneficial you know big discoveries can be made from here on out but ive done my job because of this twentyfive hundred years ago there was bloke by the name of gautama siddhartha buddha now whether he did or did not become bodhi and whether he was first or secondgoal clear i dont know as far as i know it has not happened on this planet im very certain that it hasnt happened on this planet for twentyfive hundred years or somebody would have found out something about it i see most of the material raised at that time has been boobytrapped all right twentyfive hundred years after the fact weve done it now weve done it much more easily and much more understandably and much more applicably than it was ever done before because i havent been worried about number one ive been worried about you and nearly all of our technology is directed toward training it or applying it to the other guy not sitting on mountain contemplating ones navel till he blows out of his silly head you see so its very practical address to the situation and the whole thing is tailormade on this kind of an address its for you to do to him you see thats the whole address to the problem every bit of its research has come up along this line and so forth so there it is theres been breakthrough in the intervening centuries weve come up to that point and we have made this breakthrough now because we are very tight organization very tight close woven network of data and that sort of thing its interesting that within days actually within days of releasing this information at saint hill clears were being made in washington dc now how fast do you think this is going to go its going to go plenty fast weve got an organization we have the technology we have the methods of training people as we go along the line all right weve arrived all at one and the same time i kind of figured we would but thats the way it is and theres the technology and ive just outlined it to you now if youre sitting around waiting for more technology to be developed and more technology to be developed and for somebody with twentytwoinch horse needle to jam into you and hit the plunger so that you can get clear then you better apply someplace else because we dont do it that way our clearing doesnt put it all on you as responsibility by long ways but it says that you must become cause before you are clear i think thats very worthwhile thing all right thats rundown of processes and where we have gotten to and thank you very much and good night
