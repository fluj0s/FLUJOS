rs21133 january 31 2002 the nuclear posture review overview and emerging issues amy f woolf specialist in national defense foreign affairs defense and trade division summary the bush administration released the results of its nuclear posture review in january 2002 that study states that the united states will longer base its nuclear planning on the need to address the russian threat instead it will develop forces with the capabilities needed to address range of threats from unspecified countries furthermore offensive nuclear weapons will combine with missile defenses and conventional strike weapons to deter and defeat potential threats the united states will reduce its nuclear forces to between 1700 and 2200 operationally deployed warheads and will place many of the warheads removed from deployed forces in reserve as part of responsive force it will also strengthen its nuclear infrastructure so that it can be more responsive in sustaining the reliability of us nuclear forces in the future this study has raised numerous issues such as how deep the reductions in nuclear forces will actually be the potential need for new nuclear weapons in the future and the role of nuclear weapons in us defense and national security policy during its first year in office the bush administration conducted wideranging review of us nuclear weapons policy this review was intended to provide guidance for future us nuclear strategy doctrine force structure and infrastructure the administration released the results of its study to congress in classified report1 and to the public in an unclassified briefing2 in early january 2002 the present report which is based on information in the unclassified briefing provides an overview of the results of the nuclear posture review and describes briefly some issues that might attract public and congressional attention in coming monthshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21133crs2 overview the new security environment during the cold war the united states developed and maintained its nuclear arsenal so that it could seek to deter and if deterrence failed defeat the soviet union other countries such as those in soviet dominated eastern europe were included in us nuclear war plans but their presence reflected their relationship with the soviet union more than any independent threat they might pose to the united states in the past decade us national security documents have recognized that the collapse of the soviet union radically altered the us security environment but russia remained concern because it retained in theory the only nuclear arsenal that could threaten us survival at the same time us security documents began to highlight emerging threats from other potential adversaries particularly those seeking to acquire ballistic missiles and weapons of mass destruction the bush administration has noted that its nuclear posture review npr is part of the administrations broader effort to transform the us military to better meet the security challenges that the united states is likely to face in the future within that context it seeks to account for the completely new relationship that the united states now has with russia it argues that instead of facing threat posed by single hostile nation that had the ability to destroy the united states the united states now faces threats from multiple potential opponents sources of conflict and unprecedented challenges the briefing also emphasizes that growing number of nations are seeking to acquire weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missiles strategy and doctrine during the cold war the united states maintained nuclear posture to deter the soviet union and its allies from initiating largescale conventional chemical or nuclear attack against the united states and its allies in europe and asia this deterrent capability rested on the us ability to threaten destruction against number of valued targets in the soviet union the us war plan contained several options both to allow for response that met the circumstances of the attack and to improve the credibility of the us deterrent threat the united states did not preclude the use of nuclear weapons in contingencies that did not include the soviet union but these were seen as lesser included threats that could be handled with portion of the weapons maintained for central deterrence in the past decade us officials have argued that nuclear weapons remain important to deter range of threats faced by the united states and they would not rule out the use of nuclear weapons to deter or respond to chemical biological or largescale conventional attack but the united states has always had the option to respond with conventional attacks and probably never relied solely on nuclear weapons for its deterrent threats the bush administration has described new model of deterrence to replace the model that according to the administration focused on offensive nuclear retaliation the administration states that the cold war strategy is not appropriate in light of the new usrussian relationship and may not be sufficient to deter new adversaries offensive nuclear weapons will continue to play role in the us deterrent strategy but they will be joined by missile defenses and conventional strike forces according to the administration missile defenses would enhance deterrence by denying an aggressors ability to attack the united states conventional strike forces would complement nuclear weapons in allowing the united states to threaten range of valued targets in the hostile nation without resort to nuclear weapons according to the administration the addedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21133crs3 options for defeating or responding to an attack would improve the overall credibility of the us deterrent furthermore according to the administrations briefing deterrence is only one of four goals that will be addressed by us nuclear forces all us military forces nuclear and conventional and the infrastructure that supports those forces also will seek to 1 assure allies and friends of the us commitment to their security 2 dissuade competitors from challenging the united states with nuclear weapons or other asymmetrical threats and 3 defeat enemies by destroying range of targets if deterrence fails the administration has also stated that the united states will longer use threat based model to structure its nuclear forces specifically the us will longer plan size or sustain its forces as though russia presented merely smaller version of the threat posed by the former soviet union instead the united states would identify the capabilities needed to address multiple contingencies and new threats that may not be evident at the present time and would not be countryspecific furthermore the united states would need to maintain more efficient command and control over its forces so that it could plan attacks on short notice in response to emerging contingencies force structure for more than 40 years the united states has maintained triad of strategic nuclear forces consisting of longrange landbased ballistic missiles icbms submarinelaunched ballistic missiles slbms and heavy bombers analysts argued that this synergistic triad of delivery vehicles would enhance deterrence and discourage soviet first strike because the varied basing modes and capabilities of the weapons would complicate soviet attack planning and ensure that the united states had forces that could survive and retaliate against range of soviet targets the united states maintained this triad as it reduced its deployed forces during the 1990s according to official documents the mixture continued to provide range of capabilities and flexibility in nuclear planning in 1990 prior to signing the first strategic arms reduction treaty start i the united states had over 10000 warheads on its strategic nuclear forces after implementing start i at the end of 2001 the united states retained around 7000 warheads on its icbms slbms and heavy bombers the bush administration has identified new triad that supports its new deterrence policy this triad consists of offensive strike forces missile defenses and responsive infrastructure to support the forces strategic nuclear forces combine with conventional strike capabilities in the offensive strike leg of the new triad the npr does not explicitly identify how many or what types of nuclear delivery vehicles icbms slbms and bombers the united states will retain within its new triad it states however that as the president announced on november 13 2001 the united states will reduce its forces to between 1700 and 2200 operationally deployed warheads over the by about 2012 in first phase the briefing notes that the united states will reduce its forces to 3800 warheads by 2007 this reductions will occur when the united states eliminates systems that have been planned for elimination under the start ii treaty since 1994 specifically the navy will convert 4 of its 18 trident submarines to nonnuclear missions the air force will eliminate all 50 of its 10warhead peacekeeper icbms and both services will reduce the number of warheads carried on deployed missiles the air force also will give up the capability to return the b1 bombers to the nuclear force the clinton administration had chosen to retain this capability as part of its hedge against uncertainty in russiahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21133crs4 the npr briefing notes that the existing us force structure is likely to remain in place through 2020 or longer because the united states has new icbms slbms or bombers in production therefore it has placed priority on funding and implementing lifeextension programs for these systems the administration has stated that many of the warheads removed from deployed nuclear delivery vehicles will be placed in storage and held in reserve when combined with the remaining force structure 14 trident submarines 500 minuteman iii icbms 76 b52 bombers and 21 b2 bombers these warheads would form responsive force that could be restored to deployment over period of months or years the administration has argued that this is different from past us policies arms control agreements have never mandated the elimination of nuclear warheads warheads were reduced when the delivery vehicles that could carry them were eliminated the united states and soviet union could not verify the elimination of actual warheads without intrusive monitoring that might reveal weapons design secrets furthermore the united states acknowledged in the past that warheads could be returned to active forces the clinton administration planned to retain some warheads in reserve under start ii as hedge against the possible reemergence of threat from russia infrastructure the us department of energy maintains and operates complex of research design test and production facilities to develop produce and sustain the warheads deployed on us nuclear forces the size and capacity of this infrastructure declined in the past decade as the united states has reduced its force structure suspended nuclear explosive testing and ceased the design of new types of nuclear warheads the npr briefing identifies responsive infrastructure as key element in the new us nuclear posture according to the administration responsive infrastructure is one that could address critical problems in the nuclear force structure in time frames that are not the 1520 year time frame we are used to thinking about this type of infrastructure would be necessary to reduce the risk as the number of operationally deployed nuclear forces declines the administration argues that with fewer warheads in the force it would become relatively more important to maintain confiden ce in the reliability of the remaining weapons the briefing indicates that the us nuclear infrastructure would require significant amount of investment and modification to meet the requirements of responsive infrastructure the briefing does not identify how the united states would modify its nuclear infrastructure to support the new nuclear posture however officials from the administration have indicated that one key element of this infrastructure is the us ability to test its nuclear weapons the bush administration continues to oppose ratification of the comprehensive test ban treaty but it has stated that it will continue to observe the moratorium on nuclear testing that has been in place for more than decade however it plans to reduce the amount of time needed to resume nuclear testing from the current 23 year period to shorter unspecified amount of time and leaves open the possibility that it may decide to resume testing in the future emerging issues depth of reductions in offensive nuclear weapons according to the administration the npr supports deep reductions in us strategic offensive nuclearhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21133crs5 weapons cuts to between 1700 and 2200 operationally deployed warheads appear to go beyond those planned for start ii which would have limited the united states and russia to 3500 warheads each and the prospective start iii treaty which would have limited each side to 2000 2500 warheads however because the administration will use different measure of account for warheads this reduction is not as deep as it might otherwise seem the start treaties use counting rules that attribute number of warheads to each type of delivery vehicle the total number of warheads would equal the number of delivery vehicles multiplied by the attributed number of warheads all delivery vehicles except those eliminated according to the complex treaty rules counted in this calculation the bush administration however will not count the warheads on delivery vehicles that are in overhaul or otherwise unavailable for nuclear missions this will include 2 trident submarines and possibly several heavy bombers at any one time if the weapons on these systems were counted the us strategic force would carry closer to 3000 warheads number between those planned for start ii and start iii in addition the united states will not eliminate many of the warheads removed from operational delivery vehicles because the bush administration could retain the same force structure planned for start ii these warheads if retained in the active reserve could raise the us deployed force to at least 3500 warheads but the number could be even higher perhaps over 4000 warheads because the start ii force also allowed for hedge of warheads that could be restored to forces in matter of months however the start treaties required the destruction of delivery vehicles so the united states could argue that it had limited capability to restore warheads to deployed forces the bush administration does not however believe that the ability to restore warheads to deployed forces should be limited it has stated that the flexibility inherent in the ability to restore warheads to deployed systems is an important part of the future us nuclear arsenal finally the reductions authorized by the npr will not occur quickly president bush has stated that the reduction to 17002200 operationally deployed warheads will occur over 10 years furthermore the united states will retain at least 3800 warheads until 2007 when it signed start ii in 1993 the united states planned to reduce its forces to 3500 warheads by the beginning of 2003 in spite of the fact that there was some uncertainty about russias future and concerns about the reemergence of russian threat the united states and russia also agreed in principle to reduce their forces to 2500 warheads by 2007 under start iii now the united states is planning to keep more warheads for longer period of time even though it will longer base its force size on the russian threat some analysts have questioned why the united states needs to retain so many warheads for so long when other potential nuclear adversaries possess at most few hundred warheads this slow pace of reductions could reflect estimates by the air force and navy of the time needed to remove and store the warheads safely but some might also question whether the npr concluded that the united states needed more warheads to address potential contingencies in its new capabilitiesbased force the need for new nuclear weapons the briefing on the npr states that the review made recommendations about developing new nuclear warheads however some administration officials and analysts have argued that the united states should seek to develop new weapons that can destroy deeplyburied and hardened targets the briefing noted that the defense department is reviewing number of alternatives to achieve this mission some might include the use of conventional weapons and some might include the use of modified nuclear weapons from the existing arsenal however thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21133crs6 interest in new capabilities when combined with the stated intention to reduce the amount of time to resume nuclear testing has led some analysts to conclude that the bush administration plans to resume efforts to design develop and test new types of nuclear weapons this approach is likely to raise concerns among many analysts outside government who argue that the united states will encourage other countries to develop new nuclear weapons if it does so itself they argue that in the interest of discouraging the proliferation of nuclear weapons the united states should reduce the perceived utility of nuclear weapons and should not acquire new capabilities for its own force role of nuclear weapons in us national security in recent years us national security documents have highlighted the fact that with the demise of the soviet union the united states has sought to reduce the role of nuclear weapons in the us military posture the collapse of the soviet union and warsaw pact along with changes in us targeting strategy in the early 1990s allowed the department of defense to reduce sharply the number of targets the united states would seek to destroy in nuclear conflict with russia in addition the elimination of the soviet conventional threat to central europe reduced the requirement for us nuclear weapons to extend deterrence to us allies the united states maintained the option of using nuclear weapons in response to chemical biological or massive conventional attack but many analysts argued that the possible need for nuclear response had diminished greatly as the united states deployed the next generation of precisionguided conventional weapons the bush administration has argued that its new nuclear posture will move the united states further along the path away from reliance on nuclear weapons although these weapons will remain part of the us deterrent posture and part of its offensive strike capability the administration has stated that the addition of ballistic missile defenses and the growing capabilities of conventional precision guided weapons will give the united states growing number of options in addition to the threat of offensive nuclear retaliation when threatened by hostile nations but as was noted above the bush administration plans to retain greater number of nuclear weapons for longer period of time than had been planned under start ii and the administration has not ruled out the development of new nuclear weapons furthermo re it has grouped nuclear weapons and conventional weapons together as offensive strike weapons it argues that the ability to use conventional weapons would reduce reliance on nuclear weapons but by grouping the two together in one interptrtation the administrations policy could begin to blur the distinction between nuclear and conventional weapons and increase the likelihood of nuclear use furthermore the new policy of capabilitiesbased planning could be interpreted by some to expand the possible use of nuclear weapons to longer list of nations including those that do not possess nuclear weapons themselves the npr briefing specifically states that us strategic forces need to provide the president with range of options to defeat any aggressor yet the united states has pledged that it will not use or threaten to use nuclear weapons against nonnuclear states unless they are aligned with nuclear state in conflict with the united states this pledge may not be consistent with nuclear posture that declares nuclear weapons to be part of the range of options available to defeat any aggressor the administration has not yet clarified publicly its intent with respect to this policy
