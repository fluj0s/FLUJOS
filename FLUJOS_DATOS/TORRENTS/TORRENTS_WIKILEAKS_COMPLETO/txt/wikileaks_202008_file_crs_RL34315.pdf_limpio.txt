report provides an overview of the major trade and economic effects of the fta over the three years ending in 2006 it also includes detailed information on key provisions of the agreement and legislative action the ussingapore fta has provided greater access for us companies has been instrumental in increasing bilateral trade and has provided reassurance to singaporeans of us interest in the count ry as citystate singapore operates as an entrepot with essentially free trade under the fta concessions dealt mainly with providing greater access for american service providers and with strengthening the business environment in areas such as the protection of intellectual property rights and access to government procurement in 2006 the united states ran 69 billi on surplus in its merchandise trade with singapore up from 14 billion in 2003 us exports of goods to singapore surged by 49 from 166 billion in 2003 to 247 billion in 2006 however even with this rapid increase in us exports the us share of singapores imports declined from 16 in 2003 to 13 in 2006 this suggests that factors other than the fta particularly the overall growth in singapores imports c ontributed greatly to the increase major us exports to singapore include machinery electrical machinery aircraft optical and medical in struments plastic and mineral fuel oil on the us import side noteworth development is that imports of pharmaceuticals from singapore have rise n dramatically from 009 billion in 2003 to 24 b illion in 2006 the fta did not lower the us tariff rate for pharmaceuticals since they already enter th united states duty free what appears to have occurred has been the developmen t of singapore as regional center for multinational pharmaceutical companie s that are stepping up exports negotiations for the ussingapore free trade agreement were launched under the clinton administration in decemb er 2000 the fta became the fifth such agreement the united states has signed and the first with an asian country according to the us trade representativ the fta broke new ground in electronic commerce competition policy and government procurement it also included what the us trade representative considers to be major advances in intellectual property protection environment labor tran sparency and customs cooperation the ussingapore fta required congressional imple mentation under expedited trade promotion authority legi slative procedures the debate over implementation of the fta fell between business and free trade interests who would benefit from more liberalized trade particularly in services and labor or anti globalization interests who opposed more ftas because of the overall impact of imports on jobs and the general effects of globalization on income distribution certain jobs and the environment specific provisions of the agreement also generated debate this report will be updated as circumstances

three years ending in 2006 it also includes detailed information on key provisions of th agreement and legislative action the ussingapore fta essentially liminated tariffs on all goods traded between the two countries it also in cluded market access measures and other provisions related to trade in services investment rules of origin intellectual property rights government procur ement licensing of professionals telecommunications worker rights the envi ronment capital controls and dispute settlement the fta has provided greater access for us companies has been instrumental in increasing bilateral trade and has pr ovided reassurance to singaporeans of us interest in the country at time when ma ny in the region perceive that the united states has been focused on the middle east and has been neglecting asia this seems to have benefitted overall bilateral relations the fta has provided certain advantages exclusively to american busine sses but many of those advantages are being extended to other nations as well the country is aggressively concluding ftas with other countries and regions as citystate singapore operates as an entrepot and shipping center and basica lly has free trade it imposes import restrictions on only handful of goods under the fta singapores concessions dealt mainly with providing greater access for american service providers particularly financial services and with strengthening the business environment in areas such as the protection of intellectual property rights and access to government procurement in 2006 the united states ran 69 billion surplus in its balance of merchandise trade with singapore up from 14 billion in 2003 us exports of goods to singapore surged by 49 from 166 billion in 2003 to 247 billion in 2006 major us exports to singapore in clude machinery ectrical machinery aircraft optical and medical instruments plastic and mineral fuel oil for details of us exports and imports by sector see table 2 and table 3 us trade with singapore has increased faster than anticipat ed before the fta however even with this rapid increase in us exports the us share of singapore s imports has declined from 16 in 2003 to 13 in 20061 the main reason for this is that singapores overall trade is boominghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34315crs2 the us balance of trade in services with singapore has declined from 40 billion in 2001 to 38 billion in 2003 and further to 26 billion in 2006 while us receipts of royalties and license fees have risen 3 billion in 2006 us payments for other private services as well as for trav and transportation so have risen us access to the singaporean market through direct investments however seems to have been enhanced considerably under the fta us income from assets in singapore rose from 67 billion in 2003 to 143 billion by 2006 this more than offset the 12 billion decline in the us surplus in rvices trade with singapore over the same period as an example of us servi ce providers in singapore under the fta citibank has been able to expand its operations there it has 50 of the credit card market offer innovative products such as biometric identification for bill paying and partner with the subway system to i ssue credit cards that double as subway fare cards and to locate branches and atm rminals in and around subway stations on the us import side noteworth development is that imports of pharmaceuticals from singapore have rise n dramatically from 009 billion in 2003 to 24 billion in 2006 singapore is now the second largest exporter of cardiovascular medicaments to the united states the fta did not lower the us tariff rate for pharmaceuticals since such products alr eady enter the united states duty free what appears to have occurred has been the development of singapore as regional center for multinational pharmaceuti cal companies this apparently was partly triggered by provisions in the fta that required singapore to strengthen its intellectual property protection the sing aporean government also has provided incentives for multinational biomedical co mpanies to locate research and production in the country most of the major pha rmaceutical companies of the world have established subsidiaries in singapore and are exporting part of their production singapore has relatively high labor standards it ratified the international labor organizations minimum age convention in 2005 this brought the number of ilo conventions the country has ratified to more than 20 including core conventions that cover child labor forced labor coll ective bargaining nd equal remuneration as city state with 34 million people nd an area roughly the size of the washington dc area inside the beltway singapores envir onmental challenges relate primarily to industrial pollution strictly regulated urbanization and preservation of natural areas the country tout s itself as garden city it recycles all waste water appears clean and uses variable tolls to alle viate

do not bode as well for the united states although singapores share of us exports to the world has remained at about 23 to 24 singapores imports from the united states have been declining relative to those from many other countries of the world as shown in table 1 and figure 3 in 2001 the united states accounted for 164 of si ngapores imports by 2006 that share had fallen to 125 despite th rapid growth in us exports there the share of singapores imports accounted for by malays ia and japan also ve fallen while the shares of china taiwan south korea nd the rest of the world have risen this

accounted for about 05 of the total and ranked 18th among all sources of beer imports the top five s ources were malaysia mexico belgium the netherlands and south korea2 among these countries only south korea has free trade agreement with singapore with respect to chewing gum the data on singaporean imports do not show appreciable imports from the united stat in 2006 out of total of 1089000 chewing gum imports hs 170410 none came from the united states there was 588000 in chewing gum that came from indonesia and 420000 that came from south korea in 2005 singapore reporte d that it had imported 1000 in chewing gum from the united states3 trade and market access in services us business interests point out that the greatest potential effect of the us singapore fta is likely to be increased access by us companies to singapores market in services services are provided in two ways in crossborder transactions and from subsidiaries in the trading partne rs economy services such as insurance shipping provision of intell ectual property and travel often are sold across borders and are counted as exports and imports other services such as accounting legal services and banking often are provided directly to th consumer through overseas subsidiaries of us companies these tr ansactions usually do not appear as exports or imports although the repa triation of profits from such activity is counted as an income flow the united states has traditionally run surplus in its balance of services trade with singapore this is shown in figure 4 under the fta this balance has declined from 40 billion in 2001 to 38 billion in 2003 and further to 26 billion in 2006httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34315crs7 among the four components of trade in rvices the united states ran surpluses in two and deficits in two in royalties and license fees the us surplus increased from 25 billion in 2001 to 29 b illion in 2006 some of this rise in fees for intellectual property likely can be attributed to strengthened intellectual property protection in singapore resulting from the fta in other private services the us surplus has fallen from 19 billion in 2001 to 07 billion in 2006 in military and government transactions the trade balance is small and varies from year to year it was 004 billion in 2001 02 billion in 2002 and 02 billion in 2006 in travel and transportation the balance trends toward an increasingly large us deficit most of this is in transportation particularly shipping as we ll as in passenger fares and travel this negative balance grew from 03 billion in 2001 to 09 billion in 2006 increased market access in services unde r an fta therefore may or may not result in an improvement in the us bilateral trade balance in services it depends on what kind of service is being traded and the relative comparative advantage of each country us service providers moreover may find it more advantageous under the increased access and strengthened intellectual property regime engendered by an fta to locate subsidiary in the fta partner country this may reduce us exports of private services but also may increase royalties and payments from use of intellectual property and earnings from ope rations in the host country in the singapore case us income from assets owned in singapore increased from 39 billion in 2001 to 67 billion in 2003 and after the fta jumped to 143

reduction in us tariffs under the fta pharm aceuticals already enter the united states duty free rather what app ears to have occurred is the development of singapore as regional center for multin ational pharmaceutical companies both for manufacturing and for research and development two major factors have contributed to this the first is the strengthening of intellectual property protection and new or revised laws in singapore the second is the development of biomedical industrial park tuas medi cal park for pharmaceutical companies to locate production and other f acilities plus research co mplex called biopolis that houses biomedical research institutes councils and rela ted organizations multinational companies have come to dominate the manufacture of pharmaceuticals in singapore these include merck sharp and dohme aventis glaxosmithkline pfizer scheringplough wyeth and eli lilly17 singapore is increasingly becoming base for both re gional and global pharmaceutical production for growing number of multinational companies the government goal is to have at least ten multinational pharmaceutical manufacturing fac ilities operational in singapore by 2010 much of the production is for export particularly to the united states and europe exports from other asia n countries also flow into singapore for reexport the country exports more pha rmaceuticals than any other asian tiger economy hong kong taiwan and south korea18 before the fta sizable proportion of singapores pharmaceutical exports were transshipments from other countries while such reexports continue to increase exports of domestic production now dominate figure 6 shows singapores global exports of pharmaceuticals and the rapid increase in domestic exports relative to reexports from 2002 to 2006 the ree xport share of all pharmaceutical exports dropped from 60 to 11httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34315crs13 balance of trade by sectors in the modern globalized economy much trade is intraindustry the old economic model of trade in which each count ry specializes in certain products and exchanges them for others in which it has comparative disadvantage only remotely resembles trade between industrialized economies po pulated by multinational enterprises in many cases the united states both imports and exports products in the same sector some of this trade ma occur within manufacturers supply chain that may straddle several countries fo r example an electronic product may be designed and marketed in the united states but final assembly may be in singapore using components from the united states as well as from other economies in the region the us balance of trade in goods with singapore is shown in figure 7 by twodigit harmonized system codes the balance of trade by sectors also indicates how trade with singapore may be affecting sectoral employment in the united states the first observation is that the us aerospace and electrical machinery producers are doing well relative to singapore most other sectors also are ex periencing either small surpluses or small deficits in bilateral trad less than 1 billion the sectors not shown in figure 7 had balances with an absolute value of less than 50 million on the deficit side the exceptional sector was pharmaceuticals deficit accounting for about 13 of the us market this industry in singapor however is dominated by multinational drug companies some headquartered in the united states the effect on us employment in the drug sector therefore is unclear and so far relatively small source data from global trade
