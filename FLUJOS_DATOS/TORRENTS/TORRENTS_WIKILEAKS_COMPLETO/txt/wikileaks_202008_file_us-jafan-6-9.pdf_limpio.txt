standards are hereby established governing the construction and protection of facilities for storing pr ocessing and discussion of special access program sap information which requires extraordinary security safeguards compliance with this joint air forcearmynavy implementation manual hereafter referred to as the manual is mandatory for all special access program facilities sapfs established after the effective date of this manual including those that make substantial renovations to existing sapfs those sapfs approved prior to the effective date of this manual will not require modification to meet these standards however documentation approved by the pso must be maintained on file within the sapf indicating that the physical security construction of the facility occurred prior to the effective date of this manual 112 the physical security safeguards set forth in this manual are the standards for the protection of sap information within the departments of the air force army and navy only the component level sap central office may impose more stringent standards if they believe extraordinary conditions and circumstances warrant this authority may only be delegated by the service component sapco additional cost resulting from more stringent standards should be borne by the requiring agency department or relevant contract 113 in situations where conditions or unforeseen factors render full compliance to these standards unreasonable secu rity officers in the grade of gs14 or o5 or above may apply commensurate levels of protection to specific requirements within this manual commensurate levels of protection will not be designed with the intent to reduce or lessen the security protection of the area of consideration any waivers to the specific requirements of this manual must be approved in writing by the service component sapco or delegated representative 114 all sapfs must be formally accredited in writing by government pso or designee prior to conducting any sap activities 115 single person is now authorized to staff sapf eliminating the requirement for the twoperson rule concept the elimination of the two person concept applies only to the staffing level of facility vice the transmission requirements of classified material outlined in the dod overprint to the nispomsup 12 concept 121 sapf design must balance threats and vulnerabilities against appropriate security measures in order to reach an acceptable level of risk each security concept or plan must be submitted to the pso for approval for the purposes of this manual the pso is defined as the accreditation authority for the compartmented facility protection against surreptitious entry regardle ss of sapf location is always required security measures must be taken to deter technical surveillance of activities taking place within the sapf tempest security measures must be considered if electronic processing of sap information is involved 122 on military and civilian compounds security controls may exist such as identification checks perimeter fences police patrols and other security measures which form basis for what is considered securityindepth security indepth is considered when supplemental protection is afforded together with the sapf location whereas internal security systems may be sufficient to be used in lieu of certain physical security or construction requirements contained in this manual 123 proper security planning for sapf is intended to deny foreign intelligence services and other unauthorized personnel the opportunity for undetected entry into those facilities and exploitation of sensitive activities faulty security planning and equipment installation not only jeopardizes security but wastes money and resources adding redundant security features causes extra expense which could be used on other needed features when security features are neglected during initial construction retrofitting of existing facilities to comply with security requirements becomes necessary and extremely costly 13 american disabilities act ada review 131 nothing in this manual shall be construed to contradict or inhibit compliance with the law or building codes psos shall work to meet appropriate security needs according to the intent of this manual at acceptable cost 5 2 general administrative 21 sap facilities

security operation procedures ids operations shall comprise four phases as described below 11 detection phase the detection phase begins when sensor reacts to the stimuli for which the sensor was designed to detect 12 reporting phase the premise control unit pcu receives signals from all associated sensors in the sapfs alarmed zone and establishes the alarm status the alarm status is immediately transmitted to the monitoring station within the monitoring station dedicated alarmmonitoring panel or central processor monitors incoming pcu signals on receiving an alarm signal monitoring stations enunciator generates an audible and visible alarm for the monitoring personnel 13 assessment phase the assessment phase is the initial phase requiring human interaction on receiving an audible or visible alarm monitoring personnel immediately assess the situation and determine the appropriate response 14 response phase the response phase begins immediately after the operator has assessed the alarm condition all alarms shall be immediately investigated during the response phase the precise nature of the alarm shall be determined and appropriate measures taken to safeguard the sapf 20 definitions 21 alarm visual and audible indication that sensor has detected the unauthorized breach into sapf alarms also signify the malfunction of sensor that normally causes

joint air force army navy jafan manual 69 annex c acoustical control and sound masking techniques 1 basic design acoustical protection measures and sound masking systems are designed to protect sap information against being inadvertently overheard by the casual passerby not to protect against deliberate interception of audio the ability of sapf structure to retain sound within the perimeter is rated using descriptive value the sound transmission class stc 11 the stc rating stc is single number rating used to determine the sound barrier performance of walls ceilings floors windows and doors 12 use of sound groups the current edition of architectural graphics standards ags describes various types of sound control isolation requirements and office planning the ags established sound groups i through 4 of which groups 3 and 4 are considered adequate for specific acoustical security requirements for sapf construction 121 sound group i stc of 30 or better loud speech can be understood fairly well normal speech cannot be easily understood 122 sound group 2 stc of 40 or better loud speech can be heard but is hardly intelligible normal speech can be heard only faintly if at all 123 sound group 3 stc of 45 or better loud speech can be faintly heard but not understood normal speech is unintelligible 124 sound group 4 stc of 50 or better very loud sounds such as loud singing brass musical instruments or radio at full volume can be heard only faintly or not at all 2 sound reduction for sapfs the amount of sound energy reduction may vary according to individual facility requirements however sound group ratings shall be used to describe the effectiveness of sapf acoustical security measures afforded by various wall materials and other building components 21 all sapf

3 3 sound maskin g and standoff distance 31 when normal construction and baffling measures have been determined to be inadequate for meeting sound group 3 or 4 as appropriate sound masking shall be employed protection against interception of sap discussions may include use of sound masking devices structural enhancements or sapf perimeter placement 311 sound masking devices may include vibration and noise generating systems located on the perimeter of the sapf 312 structural enhancements may include the use of high density building materials ie sounddeadening materials to increase the resistance of the perimeter to vibration at audio frequencies 313 sapf perimeter placement may include construction design of standoff distance between the closest point nonsapindoctrinated person could be positioned and the point where sap discussions become available for interception use of perimeter fence or protective zone between the sapf perimeter walls and the closest listening place is permitted as an alternative to other sound protection measures 32 masking of sound which emanates from sap discussion area is commonly done by sound masking system sound masking system may utilize noise generator tape disc or record player as noise source and an amplifier and speakers or transducers for distribution 42 4 placement of speakers and transducers to be effective the masking device must produce sound at higher volume on the exterior of the sapf than the voice conversations from within the sapf speakerstransducers should be placed close to or mounted on any paths which would allow audio to leave the area these paths may include doors windows common perimeter walls ventsducts and any other means by which voice can leave the area 41 for common walls the speakerstransducers should be placed so the sound optimizes acoustical protection 42 for doors and windows the speakerstransducers should be close to the aperture of the window or door and the sound projected in direction facing away from conversations 43 once the speakers or transducers are optimally placed the system volume must be set and fixed the level for each speaker should be determined by listening
