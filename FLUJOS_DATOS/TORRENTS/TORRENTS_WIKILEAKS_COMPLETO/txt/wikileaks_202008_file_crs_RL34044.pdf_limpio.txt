profit by the five major oil companies updated april 11 2008 robert pirog specialist in energy economics resources science and industry divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34044the use of profit by the five major oil companies summary the price of crude oil began to increase in the last quarter of 2003 and has led to the high prices observed from 2004 th rough 20 07 the iraq war unexpectedly high demand growth in china india nd the united states and hurricanes katrina and rita along with number of other factor s all contributed to the rising price an important result of these largely unexp ected events was that the oil industry as represented by the five major integrated oil companies doing business in the united states experienced ra pidly expanding revenues nd profits some observers characterized these profits as windfall ga ins while others pointed to the increasing scarcity and rising costs observable in th oil industry some saw price gouging in high gasoline prices while others saw the market working to avoid physical supply shortages the larger profits experienced by the il industry and the five major integrated oil companies can be used in variety of ways profits might be used to expand exploration and development of crude oil resources to expand the supply of oil refineries might be constr ucted and technology improved at existing refineries to expand the supply of petroleum products most notably gasoline profits might also be used to provide increased returns to the owners of the oil companies the shareholders this end might be accomplis hed through dividend payments and share repurchase plans profits might also be used to improve the balance sheets of the companies through debt reduction potentially improving their financial health should they face downturn in the market in the fu ture until the effects of corporate plans that reflect market characterized by higher oil prices can be observed profits might tend to build up as cash reserves as experi enced by some of the five firms since 2004 how the profits generated over the past four years are used will help to determine whether oil and pe troleum product markets remain tight with high prices or whether they loosen develop extra capacity and lead to moderating prices this report will be updatedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34044contents i l p r i c s n d p r f i t s 1 p r f i t l l

and conocophillipsthe use of profit by the five major oil companies the five major integrated oil companies operating in the us market have earned net incomes totaling 424 billion since 20041 in the previous four years from 2000 to 2003 they earned net incomes of 171 billion2 this 148 increase in profit has attracted public atte ntion and raised the issue of whether windfall profits had accrued to the firms at the same time that these oil companies were earning increased profits us gasoline consumers were facing prices that rose above 330 per gallon raising concerns that the increas ed profits might be tied to price gouging by the oil companies this report analyzes the uses of accrued profits by the five major integrated oil companies from 2004 through 20073 although the oil industry is composed of thousands of firms involved in many diffe rent aspects of the business these five firms represent the visible face of the oil industry to the american public these companies also earned 90 of the total earnings of integrated oil companies and 74 of the earnings of all the integrated oil companies the independent oil and gas producers and the independent refiners and marketers in 2007 because of their size the decisions they make with respect to utilizing profits will largely determine how the industrys use of profit is viewed by the public how the industry uses its recent profits is important because the demand and supply balance and hence petroleum produc t prices for the us consumer will be affected by the decisions made for exam ple one of the commonly cited reasons for high gasoline prices in 2007 is that refinery capacity has been offline as result of catching up on deferred maintenance and of acci dents if investments had been made in new refineries over the past 20 years the balance between refinery capacity and product demand might not be as tight thus reducing the pressure on gasoline prices oil prices and profits primary source of the increased profits of the five oil companies has been the increased price of crude oil on the world ma rket the increased price of crude oilhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34044crs2 4 see crs report rl32530 world oil demand and its effect on oil prices by robert pirog for more complete analysis of the factors influencing world crude oil prices since 2004 has been attributed to the growth in demand from china india the united states and other areas as well as to hurricanes katrina and rita and variety of other factors4 few if any of these factors could be influenced by the five companies

venezuela nationalizing its orinoco basin investments and bp experiencing pipeline problems in alaska and refinery accidents in texas the magnitude of the profits earned as well as the rapidity with which they accrued has created challenge for the oil companies how to best utilize these resources and meet the varied demands of shareholders and the public profit allocation private corporations such as the five major integrated oil companies operate for the purpose of maximizing shareholder value that is to enhance as much as possible the value of the shares held by investors and the returns earned by those shares the goal of maximizing shareholder value can be achieved in various ways the management may choose to reinvest profits in the business deploying new technology and capital equipment or hiring more workers the management might also acquire assets for the corporation through merger or acquisition another strategy might be to direc tly pay cash dividends to the shareholders or to buy back the companys shares on the open market to enhance the price of outstanding shares the management also might decide to alter the capital structure of the company by reducing the outstanding debt of the co mpany finally the management mighthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34044crs4 decide to hold the profits as cash or other shortterm assets to acquire the flexibility to implement resource allocation decisions in the future of course the company may apply the profits to seve ral or all of these uses in principle the expected rate of re turn on investments should be at least as great as the current rate of return earned by the company if the management cannot identify investment opportunities that have expected rates of return in excess of the current rate of return the profit is typically returned to the shareholders in the form of dividends or other payments capital expenditures many capital investment expenditures in the oil industry are allocated to projects that cost billions of dolla rs and will likely be online for d ecades for example an efficiently scaled refinery is likely to cost between 3 billion and 5 billion and operate for more than 30 years when planning and investing in such facilities the underlying variables that termine potential profits must not only be favorable now but must also be forecast to be favorable for decades to come because of the magnitude of the funding required for such an investment mistake might cause damage to the company for years these factors tend to create an investment philosophy in the oil industry th at is characterized by deliberate pace as well as degree of conservatism in making capital expenditures these characteristics have been observabl in the oil industry during the recent period of high profits some might have expected the increased price of oil to lead to an immediate boom in exploration and refinery construction slower pace of capital investment is consistent with view that the currently high price of oil might decline in the future leading to an investment reference price below the currently observable price or forecast that demand growth might slow or even decline even if the decision had been quickly taken to invest in either upstream or downstream activities there would likely be lag between the decision to invest and substantial expenditures being made on th project many investment projects related to the oil industry require environmen tal permits from number of federal state and local agencies all of which mig ht require studies to be undertaken and approvals to be granted several years in the permitting process might be expected capital expenditures included in table 4 might not be for only new or expanded capacity environmental regulations affect both the petroleum product slate as well as refinery sites and may require capital investment to maintain compliance httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34044crs5 table 4 capital expenditures of major integrated oil

increased by less than ½ in 2004 compared to 2003 while net income rose by 39 while capital expenditures rose by 17 from 2004 to 2005 profits rose by 34 however capital expenditures rose by 40 from 2005 to 2006 while profits rose by 8 in 2007 capital expenditures rose by almost 8 even though profits declined by 13 the lag in capital expenditures might reflect reassessment by the oil companies of future prices and profits or it may reflect other f actors that are less fundamental while it is possible that oil firms might want to invest both upstream and downstream to take advantage of favorable business conditions their actions run the risk of reducing the potential profit of the market economic theory suggests that industries adjust to tight markets throug h relatively small increases in supply because the efficient scale of the oil industry tends to be large investments tend to have large enough effect on production levels or capacity to materially affect the market for example if only two of th five major firms decided to build new refineries this might result in more than 1 million barrels day of refining capacity coming online an almost 6 increment which could be enough to change the relative market balance mergers and acquisitions depending on the relative prices of know n oil resources and exploration and existing facilities and construc tion it has on occasion in the past been cheaper for company that wishes to expand to acquire assets financially rather than through exploration andor construc tion this along with other reasons like scaling the company to an appropriate size for inte rnational competition has led to periods of merger and acquisition activity in the oil industry many of the major oil companies were involved in merger activity from 1998 to 2002 in 1999 exxon and mobil merg ed bp followed its 1998 acquisition of amoco with takeover of arco in 2000 conoco and phillips merged in 2002 and chevron and texaco combined in 2001

acquired burlington res ources in 2006 for reported 355 billion dividends and stock acquisition if management has access to capital investment projects that are projected to earn more than the current rate of return for the company carrying them out will increase the value of the company and can lead to capital appreciation for its outstanding shares if such profitabl projects cannot be identified paying out dividends may be appropriate dividend payouts have positive and negative aspects shareholders may appreciate the immediate returns but this payout is unlikely to lead to longterm capital appreciation of the shares taken in positive light the payout of dividends signals high earnings by the firm taken in negative light they signal that management does not ve wealthincreasing opport

are not directly comparable cash dividends paid reflect the product of dividends per share times the number of shares outstanding for example xxonmobils 42 increase in dividends paid out between 2003

financing offers several attractive characteristics corporate interest payments are tax deductible while dividend payments are paid from aftertax income this differential allows greater net return from identical assets one financed through debt the other financed with equity dditionally issuing debt does not dilute the ownership base of the company for exis ting shareholders nor does it dilute the capital value of an equity share offsetting these advantages are several disadvantages interest payments are fixed liability of the firm unlike dividends which are paid at the discretion of

10 although the total cash held by the companies has increased by more than 32 billion since 2003 66 of those holdings were in the hands of one company exxonmobil at the other companies the results are more mixed with both increases and decreases observable while holding cash balances might be voidable in the shortrun longterm strategy based on increasing cash holdings is likely to be questionable while cash offers flexibility it generally offers little or return the price for flexibility is the potential return lost by holding it in th longer term financial analysts generally agree that more productive uses should be id entified for cash balances or they should be returned to shareholders in the form of dividends if feasible investment opportunities can be identified conclusion it is likely that the increases in the pri ce of oil that began in late 2003 and persist today were unexpected by the major integrated companies the onset of the war in iraq and the rapid growth of oil demand in china india and even the united states were not generally forecast hurricanes ka trina and rita were associated with even greater degrees of uncertainty than the war and demand growth as result and especially in the c ontext of 2002 being relatively weak year for oil company financials it is likely that set plan existed for the use of the rapidly growing profits that began to accrue in 2004 in the several years that have passed since 2003 capital expend itures have begun to expa nd investor returns have been enhanced acquisitions have been made and balance sheets have been strengthened even though cash balance levels are still high and growing in time as corporate plans more reflect crude oil market characterized by higher prices longterm assets might be accumulated supplies of both crude oil and petroleum products might be enhanced and consumers might see slacker market where prices may moderate from current levels until that time investors in the oil industry may continue to see high rates of dividend payout stock repurchase plans and the accumulation of shortterm assets
