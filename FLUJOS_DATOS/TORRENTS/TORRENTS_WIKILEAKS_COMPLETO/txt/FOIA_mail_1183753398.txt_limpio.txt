and keith for that correction ive inserted that and also reworded the paragraph in the conclusions which talked about serious flaws along the lines suggested by tim it now reads the ipcc2001 conclusion that temperatures of the past millennium are unlikely to have been as warm at any time prior to the 20th century as the last decades of the 20th century is supported by subsequent research and by the results obtained here we have also reviewed and in some cases tested with new analysis papers which claim to refute that ipcc2001 conclusion and found that their claims are not well supported this version attached with the revised supplementary material i need to go over the changes document again and the response but i hope to send it in on monday cheers martin on wednesday 04 july 2007 1654 tim osborn wrote hi martin jan and others keith and i have put together the attached text as an alternative hopefully more accurate version to the current paragraph about differences between tree series we did this beforewhile jans email arrived so some overlap but hopefully what we say is compatible with jans comment note we havent discussed the ice core data from fisher just the treering series how does the attached sound cheers tim at 2215 03072007 jan esper wrote martin this is quite task as i do not really remember which version of dataset was used in which paper for ecs2002 i detrended all data via two rcs runs applied to the linear and nonlinear subgroups as identified in that paper all data except for boreal and upper wrigth both from lisa graumlich and mongolia from gordon jacoby were measured at wsl i wouldnt necessarily claim that the regional chronologies from the ecs approach are highly useful records ie for regional analysis i would use data that are detrended regionbyregion that used by ecs2002 is based on the same treering data as that used by msh2005 but with different standardisation method not fully sure what msh2005 did but this is very likely correct ie they likely used regional version from briffa andor grudd the fennoscandia data used by jbb1998 mbh1999 also come from the tornetraesk area but from different group of trees hm i dont believe that these studies used different trees up to the recent update by hakan grudd that is currently in review with climate dynamics there was effectively only one dataset from tornetrask keith or tim might know this better the polar urals series used by ecs2005 is also reanalysis of the data used to create the northern urals series used by jbb1998 mbh1999 i wouldnt necessarily call this reanalysis perhaps better say differently detrended anyway i doubt that there is long dataset from the northern ural as there is little wood preserved in that area this is likely the same data ie both are polar ural the taymir data used by hca2007 is smoothed version of that used in ecs2002 msh2005 this i really dont know but it would be better to use regionally detrended version of the data the greenland stack data used by mbh1999 is composite of data analysed by citetfisher_etal1996 but the precise nature of the composite is not described by citetfisher_etal1996 agreed just read the paper again and it is indeed difficult to say which data was combined ive kept the phrase about serious flaws in the conclusion despite tims suggestion supported by nanne of weaker wording because i think it is important to draw attention to the serious flaws which are there i also think that less aggressive wording would be more effective jan at 1641 uhr 0100 372007 martin juckes wrote hello another version of our paper is attached ive added the following paragraph to the discussion of table 1 and id be grateful if jan and keith could check that it is accurate evaluation of past work is further compicated by confusion between closely related proxy series in tab1 there are two series referred to as tornetraesk that used by ecs2002 is based on the same treering data as that used by msh2005 but with different standardisation method the fennoscandia data used by jbb1998 mbh1999 also come from the tornetraesk area but from different group of trees the polar urals series used by ecs2005 is also reanalysis of the data used to create the northern urals series used by jbb1998 mbh1999 the taymir data used by hca2007 is smoothed version of that used in ecs2002 msh2005 the greenland stack data used by mbh1999 is composite of data analysed by citetfisher_etal1996 but the precise nature of the composite is not described by citetfisher_etal1996 ive also moved few things around and tried to follow most of the suggestions from anders and nanne ive kept the phrase about serious flaws in the conclusion despite tims suggestion supported by nanne of weaker wording because i think it is important to draw attention to the serious flaws which are there one reviewer has implied that we should not discuss flawed work at length because in oding so we give it credibility it does not deserve i believe that since this stuff is published and influential in some quarters we should discuss it and draw attention to the fact that it is seriously flawed cheers martin attachment
