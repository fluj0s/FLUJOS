mortgage bonds and qualified vete rans mortgage bonds this report provides general overview of qualified mortgage bonds qualified mortgage bonds are sold as part of an issue the proceeds of which must be used to finance ow neroccupied residences2 in general the residences must be single family dwellings located within the governme ntissuers jurisdicti on that are reasonably expected to be the mortgagers principal residence within reasonable time after the financing is provided3 the bonds may be used to fi nance two three and fourfamily residences if one unit is occupied by the owner and the residence was first occupied at least five years prior to the mortgages execution4 prior to pl 110289 the financing was generally required to be for new mortgages and could be used to acquire or replace existing mortgages5 additionally proceeds must generally be used to finance residences within 42 months after the bonds date of issu ance or be used to redeem bonds that are part of the issue6 bonds issued to finance first time home buyers are subj ect to various other requirements these include the first time homebuyer requirement under which at least 95 of the proceeds must be used to finance the residences of home buyers who have not owned principal reside nce during the past three years7 another requirement is that the home buyers family income can not exceed 115 of the applicable median family income8 this limitation is adjusted in certain cases eg it is increased up to 140 if the residence is in an area with hi gh housing costs nother requirement under the mrb program is that the residences purchase price generally cannot exceed 90 of the average purchase price of single family residences sold in the area during the past year9 targeted area residences special rules apply to targeted area residences10 these are residences located in census tract in which at least 70 of the families have incomes that are more than 80 of the statewide median family income or in an area of chronic economic distress as designated by the state with federal approval among other things the firsttime home buyer requi rement does not apply the purchase price limit is increased from 90 to 110 and onet hird of the financing may be provided without regard to the home buyers income with the rest provided to home buyers with family incomes that are more than 140 as opposed to 115 of the applicable median family incomehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22841crs3 11 irc 148 12 irc 143g 13 irc 143m 14 the interest on mrbs is included in income for purposes of calculating the

irc 146garbitrage mortgage revenue bonds are subject to the general arbitrage rules that restrict issuers from using taxexempt bond proceeds to acquire higher yield investments11 additionally mrbs are subject to special requirement that the effective rate of interest on the mortgage cannot exceed the bond yield by more than 1125 percentage points12 recapture home buyer using the mrb program is receiving an indirect federal subsidy because his or her mortgage has low in terest rate due to it being financed by tax exempt bonds thus home buyer who sells th residence may if such sale was within nine years of the mrb financing be required to pay back some of the benefits he or she received to the federal government13 program administration mrbs are administered through mix of public and private partners bonds are typically issued by state housing finance agen cies through financial intermediaries who sell the bonds to private invest ors the bonds have lower interest rates than privately issued bonds but provide the be nefit of being exempt from federal and possibly state income taxes14 state housing agencies do not dir ectly lend the proceeds to home buyers instead the agencies provide funds to pr ivate lenders and home buyers apply to the lenders for financing just like typical mortgage the loan has belowmarket interest rates because it is financed throug h the issuance of taxexempt bonds volume cap the federal government restricts the am ount of private activity bonds of which qualified mortgage bonds are one type that each state may issue during year15 this limit is called the volume cap prior to pl 110289 the 2008 limit for each state was originally set as the greater of 85 multiplied by the states population or 262095000 these amounts are annually adjusted for inflation16 some private activity bonds are not subject to the cap qualified veterans mortgage bonds qualified 501c3 bonds and certain exempt facility

which are another type of taxexempt private activity bond may be issued to finance qualified residential rental pr ojects among other requirements at least some of the rental units must be occupied by lowincome renters irc 142dalternative minimum tax amt the alternative minimum tax amt is in tended to ensure that taxpayers cannot reduce their federal income taxes below certain level by taking adva ntage of various tax preferences eg credits deductions and exclusions18 taxpayers subject to the amt calculate their regular income tax liab ility and their amt liability and must pay whichever is higher one step in calculating taxpayers amt liability is adding back various tax preference items to his or her taxable income computed under the regular income tax the interest on taxexempt private activity bonds including originally mortgage revenue bonds is one such item that must be added back in19 pl 110289 the housing and economic recovery act of 2008 pl 110289 made three changes to the mrb program first secti on 3021 of the act allows the proceeds of qualified mortgage issue to refinance mortgages on residences that were originally financed by qualified subprime loans qua lified subprime loan is any adjustable rate singlefamily residential mo rtgage originated between december 31 2001 and january 1 2008 that the bond issuer determines would be reasonably likely to cause financial hardship to the borrower if not refinanced the proceeds must be used for the refinancing within 12 months of the issuance as opposed to 42 months the firsttime home buyer requirement does not apply and the purchas price requirement is applied using the residences market value at the time of refinancing the refinancing provision only applies to bonds issued before january 1 2011 section 3021 also increases the volume cap for 2008 th extra amount can only be used to issue exempt bonds used to provi qualified residen tial rental projects20 or qualified mortgage bonds each states ceilin g is increased by 11 billion multiplied by the percentage its population bore to the entir us population states are able to carry forward unused allocations but the amounts can not be used to issue bonds after 2010 the third change relates to the alternative minimum tax amt as explained above under the original law taxpayers were typically required to include the interest earned on mrbs when computing their am t liability section 3022 of pl 110289 permanently excludes such interest for qua lified mortgage bonds nd qualified veterans mortgage bonds issued after the provisions enactment

pa rt of the larger pool of private activity bonds private activity bonds are allocated to states and states choose how to allocate the bonds among projects for owneroccupied housing rental hous ing economic development or other programsearned on the bonds to be excluded against the alternative minimum tax amt the proposed changes ar estimated to cost less th an 36 million fo r fy2008 and 187 million through fy201321 expansion of program as mentioned previous ly prior law allowed mrb proceeds to be used for firsttime home buy ers subject to certain eligibility and for financing multifamily housing development the new law allows existing homeowners to participate in the program to refinance s ubprime loans adding to the types of eligible program participants this change expands the program the program expansion may allow some hom eowners to avoid foreclosure as financing tool the lower rate s offered by the mrb program relative to banks and other mortgage lenders could provide assistan ce to troubled homeowners who cannot afford marketrate loans borrowers with poor cred it or who owe more than their house is worth may not be helped by the mrb program because the criteria for program lending are as rigorous as those used by traditional lenders in fact few states colorado ohio and maryland for example started loan progra ms for refinancing with taxable bonds and found few qualified borrowers22 some policy makers have argued that the lending criteria of the mrb program should be rela xed to allow more borrowers to receive assistance opponents of that policy proposal could assert that the credit rating of the bond issuer must be preserved if higherri sk loans are made the credit rating of bonds may fall and the proceeds from the bond issuance for mortgages would decline if the credit rating falls then it becomes more costly for the issuer to sell debt the higher cost of debt could make the mrb financ ing option less attractive to issuers increase in bond allocation authority the increased bond allocation authority will allow states to authorize more taxexempt debt for mortgages the lower cost of funds for lenders and home buyers may be beneficial as problems with mortgage backed securities and for eclosures are limiting the am ount of capital available from traditional mortgage lenders to the extent that the lower interest rates of the mrb program lower the cost of housing then demand for homes may rise the increased demand for homes would come at time when policymakers are most c oncerned about housingmarket slowdowns due to an excess supply of homes on the market the increase in allocation authority may help to minimize competition for bond proceeds as mrb program eligibility is expanded the demand for the program increases creating more compe tition among bondfinanced projects23 increasing bond allocation while expanding the program could potentially minimize any unintendedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22841crs6 24 us congress joint committee on taxation estimates of federal tax expenditures for fiscal years 2007 to 2011 jcs307 washington gpo 2007 p 27 25 ibidconsequences caused by competition fo r bond proceeds additionally unused bond authority can be carried forward temporarily allowing agencies to manage housing finance as needed over time the increase in allocation authority will create more bond issues and more interest earnings on the bonds which will for the most part go untaxed the federal cost of the current mrb pr ogram which is estimated at 14 billion in fy2008 has been justified as necessary to encourage firsttime home ownership for disadvantaged borrowers24 given the expense of existing housing tax provisions it could be argued that owneroccupied housing is heavily subsidized for fy2008 the federal revenue loss associated with housing ta x preferences includes 852 billion for the deduction for mortgage interest 301 billion for the exclusion of capital gains on the sales of homes and 142 billion for the deduction of state nd local realestate taxes25 economic theory suggests that the use of tax preferences to change the borrowing and consumption choices of indi viduals generates inefficiencies these inefficiencies are accepted as necessa ry as noted above to advance th social goal of increasing home ownership among selected individuals expanding the mrb program will increase the revenue loss and increase these economic inefficiencies again it could be argued that the perceived social and ec onomic benefits from expanding mrbs justify the federal revenue loss allowance of mrb income exclusion against alternative minimum tax the change to allow the interest earned on mrb bonds to be excluded from income when calculating the alternative minimum tax amt could increase demand by investors for mrbs increased demand could be expected because the income exclusion against the amt could make the bonds more ttractive investment vehicles for investors if this is the case the policy change will increase the revenue loss associated with the program as taxpayers who formerly would have had to claim interest earnings on the bonds as income longer have to do so
