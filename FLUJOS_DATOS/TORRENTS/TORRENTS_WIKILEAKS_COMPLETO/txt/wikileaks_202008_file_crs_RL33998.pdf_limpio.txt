and distributing coins and currencyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33998crs7 at its most basic level of organization treasury consists of departmental offices and operating bureaus in general the offices are responsible for formulating and implementing policy initiatives and managing treasurys operations while the bureaus perform specific duties assigned to treasury mainly through statutory mandates in the past decade or so th bureaus have accounted for over 95 of the agencys funding and work force with one possible exception the bureaus can be divided into those engaged in financial management and regulation and those engaged in law enforcement in recent decades the comptroller of the currenc us mint bureau of engraving and printing financial management service fms bureau of the public debt community development fina ncial institutions fund cdfi and office of thrift supervision have undertaken tasks related to the ma nagement of the federal governments finances or the supervision nd regulation of the u s financial system by contrast law enforcement has been the central focus of the tasks handled by the bureau of alcohol tobacco and firearms us secret service federal law enforcement training center us customs service financial crimes enforcement network fincen and the treasury forfe iture fund since the advent of the department of homeland s ecurity in 2002 treasurys direct involvement in law enforcement has shrunk considerably the possible exception to this simplified dichotomy is the internal revenue service irs whos main duties encompass both the collection of tax revenue and the forcement of tax ws and regulations treasury offices and bureaus excluding the irs funding for many bureaus comes largely from nnual appropriations such is the case for the irs fms bureau of public debt fincen cohol and tobacco tax and trade bureau office of the inspector general oig treasury inspector general for tax administration tigta and the cdfi but there are some exceptions to this heavy reliance on appropriated funds the treasury franchise fund us mint bureau of engraving and printing office of the comptroller of the currency and the office of thrift supervision finance their operations largely from the fees they charge for services and products they provide in fy2007 treasury received 11624 billion in appropriated funds or 04 more than it

testimony by secretary henry paulson indicate that the treasury depa rtments proposed budget for fy2008 was intended to support five stra tegic objectives 1 promote economic growth security and opportunity 2 strengthen nationa l security 3 manage the federal governments finances 4 strengthen financial institutions and 5 manage treasurys operations effectively13 in evaluating the administrations budget proposal one consideration might be the ex tent to which the proposed budget would likely support or promote these objectives and whether other approaches might be more desirable the administration maintained that the budget proposal would promote the first objective in part by channeling more resources into treasurys contribution to international economic policy coordination and the committee on foreign investment in the united states and by eliminating funding for the bank enterprise awards program which is administered through the cdfi14 the administration claimed the propos would s upport th second objective largely by increasing funding for tfi and fincen tfi collects and analyzes financial intelligence formulates and implements measures to combat

efforts to increase and improve the delivery of services offered to taxpayers and 3 invest in information technology design ed to give irs em ployees the tools they need to administer and improve both taxpayer service and enforcement programs26 guiding the pursuit of these goals was commitment to provide quality service totaxpayers while enforcing americas tax laws in balanced manner as part of its budget proposal for th irs the administration also asked congress to pass number of legislative proposals 27 most were intended to improve taxpayer compliance through actions ch as expanded information reporting mandatory electronic filing for certain rge businesses and expanded penalties for fraudulent actions by tax preparers and for erroneous refund claims in assessing the administrations fy 2008 budget proposal for the irs it may be useful to consider the extent to wh ich it supported these objectives and whether or not the proposed budgets for enforcem ent taxpayer service and bsm were adequate in light of the many challenges facing the agency foremost among those challenges are improving compliance rate s among individuals and businesses without sacrificing recent gains in taxpayer servi ce generating more re liable estimates of the rates of noncompliance among business taxpay ers increasing the share of tax returns filed electronically upgrading the

administrations budget proposal as clearly aligned with the irs most recent strategic plan at the same time the board wanted mo re funds appropriated for enforcement and infrastructure than the

is the difference between federal taxes owed and federal taxes paid in timely manner according to the latest estimate by irs the gross tax gap amounted to 345 billion in 2001 in the committees view the irs must and can reduce the tax gap if the irs is given additional resources and is able to improve its operational capabilities most notably the business systems modernization program34 yet it could find strategy in the administrations budget request for the irs in fy2008 that would have enabled the agency to achieve the stated goal of raising the voluntary compliance rate for all taxpayers from its estimated level of 837 in 2007 to 85 by 2009 so the committee added provision to hr 2829 requiring the irs to develop such plan wit hout specifying deadline of the 2149 billion recommended

channel more enforcemen t resources into industries where misclassification is widespread36 controversial provision of the bill would have reduced funding to administer the pdc program to 1 million at such low level of funding the irs could have been forced to suspend the program on noteworthy aspect of the provision is its wording the version of hr 2829 reported by the house appropriations committee contained similar provision but it was removed during the house floor debate after facing the threat of budget point of order tied to ruling by the joint committee on taxation that cutting funding for the private tax debt collection program would result in loss of revenue to avoid similar outcome the senate version was crafted so that the provision would cut direct appropriations for

175 ibid pp b4 and c2advent of competitive sourci ng legislation and in par ticular the passage of bills containing competitive sourcing provisions172 section 739a of the consolidated appropriations act 2008 pl 110161 prohibits the use of funds for c onverting an agency activity involving 11 or more federal employees to contractor perfo rmance unless certain conditions are met publicprivate competitions that meet this size criterion will have to include staffing plan known as most efficient or ganization meo show that the cost of contractor performance would result in savings of at least 10 million or 10 of the meos personnel costs whichever amount is lesser and not provide contractor with an advantage by permitting the company to provide health and retirement benefits to the employees performing the government activity that are less than what federal employees receive173 the first two conditions appear designed to address two distinctions between standard compe titions and streamlined competitions under circular a76 agencies are required to develop an meo and apply the conversion differential that is 10 milli on or 10 of the meos pe rsonnel costs for standard competitions an agency is required to use standard competition when public private competition involves more th an 65 fulltime equivalents ftes174 in streamlined competitions an agency may develop an meo but is not required to do so and the conversion diffe rential is not calculated175 an agency may use streamlined or standard competition wh publicprivate competition involves 65 or fewer ftes the third condition may be seen as an effort to ensure that contractor does not gain cost advantage in competitions by paying less for benefits than the government does thus loweri ng the cost of his or her proposal alternatively others may see this condition as restriction on the ability of contractor to prepare competitive proposal certain organizati ons and procurement activities such as the department of defense and depot maintenance contracts are exempt from section 739a although circular a76 does not appear to prohibit conducting publicprivate competition for work that is being performed by contractor some of the language in the circular seems to emphasize holding competitions for work being performed by federal employees for example the ci rculars policy statement says in

defense and trade division for additional information see crs report rl33819 cuba issues for the 110th congress by mark p sullivancommercial activity176 section 739b notes that the circular does not prevent holding competitions for working being performed by contractors and it also requires that circular a76 include procedures and policies for these types of competitions section 739c allows protest to be filed for any competition that is streamlined as well as sta ndard conducted under circular a76 and for any decision made without benefit of an a76 compe tition to convert an agency function from employee performance to contractor performance this section also permits an individual selected by majority of the affected employees to represent the employees in protest involving an 76 competition or decision to outsource work without competition the ato retains the authority to file protest on behalf of the employees section 739c permits the ato or the individual selected by the employees to represent them to intervene in civil action brought before the us court of federal claims or us distri ct court by an interested party from the private sector additionally this section permits protests and civil actions that challenge the selection of provider that is government employees or contractor at the conclusion of competition currently an ato is not required to file protest he or she shall file protest in connection with publicprivate competition unless the agency tender official determines that there is reasonable basis for the protest177 some have been concerned that agency employees interests may not be adequately represented since an ato determines unilaterally whether there is basis for protest hence supporters of this view might argue th at another individual such as union representative would be better choice for representing the affected employees in response the private sector might argue th at allowing the ato to file protest is sufficient protection for agency employees additionally contractors might note that their employees cannot band together and lect someone to represent them in protest the final substantive provision in this section prohibits the use of funds made available by this act for certain purposes that is none of th funds appropriated by this act can be used by omb for directing or requiring an agency to take any action related to publicprivate competition or direct conversion of government activity from one sector to another s imilarly none of the funds can be used by another agency to take an action that was di

administration tig htened sanctions against cuba by further restricting how us agricultural expor ters may be paid for their sales ofac amended the cacr to clarify that the term payment of cash in advance for us agricultural sales to cuba means that the payment is to be received prior to the shipment of the goods this differs from th practice of being paid before the actual delivery of the goods practice that had been utilized by most us agricultural exporters to cuba since such sales were legalized in late 2001 us agricultural exporters and some members of congress strongly objected on the grounds that the action constituted new sanction that violated the intent of tsra and could jeopardize millions of dollars in us agricultural sales to cuba ofac director robert werner maintained that the clarification conforms to the common understanding of the term in international trade180 since 2000 either one or both houses ve approved provisi ons in the annual treasury department
