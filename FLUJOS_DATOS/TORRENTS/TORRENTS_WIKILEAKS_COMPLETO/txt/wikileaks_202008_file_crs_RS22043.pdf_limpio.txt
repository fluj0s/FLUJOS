weborder code rs22043 updated march 23 2005 privatization and welfare administration joe richardson domestic social policy division summary all states use private companies to adminis ter significant parts of the three major federalstate public assistance programs they are charged with operating temporary assistance for needy families tanf the medicaid program and the food stamp program these components include bene fit delivery worktraining efforts for recipients social services and caseload ma nagement and computer automation services however federal laws coveri ng these programs allow pri vatization of one important activity actual eligibility determinations in only one of the three tanf in the other two states must use government workers to perform eligibility determination tasks unless waiver is granted and even with tanf only one state wisconsin now uses private groups to administer all as pects of its program including eligibility judgments at issue is whether and how to extend authority to privatize eligibility determinations to food stam ps and medicaid and the degr ee to which this might make privatized eligib ility deter minations more prevalent in addition to wisconsin four states arizona california florida and texas have shown in terest in expanded privatization florida and texas are considering public assistance reforms that may require waivers of federal f ood stamp and medicaid rules an arizona pilot was ended in 2003 and california government commission has recommended pursuing across theboard privatization however there s been definitive congressional action and waivers have yet been approved proponents of extended privatization authority conte nd there are efficiencies and costsavings that could accrue and that it is difficult to privatize administration for only one of the three major programs because the applicantrecipient population overlaps significantly opponents state concerns about the potential for denial of help to those in need due to cost concerns the administrative problems and financial risks associated with privatizing eligibility determinations and the potential for net loss of jobs this report gives brief background on the debate and will be updated as events legislation and ne w proposals warranthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22043crs2 1 they also have operated other significant programs for lowincome families and individuals not covered in this report eg social services and child care not funded under tanf using wide range of private groups 2 section 11e6 of the food stamp act and ction 1902a5 of the social security actstates have long used private entities to run discrete components of their major welfare programs tanf food stamps and medicaid1 examples include worktraining programs and social services like child care provided through tanf benefit delivery through electronic benefit transfer ebt systems and managed care systems used in the medicaid program but the 1996 welfare reform law pl 104193 gave efforts to privatize the administration of benefits boost it explicitly allows states to administer and provide services under tanf through c ontracts with private organizations this effectively permits states to privatize all features of their tanf program including activities related to the determination of eligibility on the other hand states still must use public officials to undertake activities re lated to eligibility judgments in the food stamp and medicaid programs because of limiting provisions in their governing laws2 general waiver authority in both these programs might permit demonstration projects under which private entities carry out eligibility determinations however waivers have yet been approved major state initiatives privatization of eligibility activities has b een or is being pursued in five states arizona california florid texas and wisconsin wisconsin goes beyond the typical privatizati on of public assistance services it uses private groups to administer all aspects of its tanf program in many but not all of its state welfare program regions however since public employees still must determine eligibility for food stamps and medicaid there are onsite county eligibility workers to do so pursuant to welfare privatization program established by state law arizona launched pilot program in 2000 in part of one county under which the welfare department transferre d its tanf responsibilities and certa in other duties like eligibility for child care assistance to private ve ndor food stamps and medicaid activities were not included but in july 2003 the vendor discontinued its role in determining tanf eligibility primarily because of duplication resultin g from the requirement that government personnel deci food stamp eligibility texas is in the process of establishing system under which mo st activities relating to public assistance eligibilitybenefit determinations would be integrated and privatized using contracts with private sector companie s depending on the type of system texas adopts federal food stamp nd medicaid waivers or congre ssional action may be called for florida is developing system under which local community and faithbased organizations would take over many perhaps most activities relating to public assistance determinations eg screening applicants collecting information for use in judginghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22043crs3 3 wisconsin has had to warn one of its contract ors that it might lose its contract unless it corrected major problems including failure to balance caseload and financial resourceseligibility in order to facilitate service integr ation to the extent these organizations are involved in actual eligibility terminations federa l food stamp and medicaid waivers or congressional action may be requested at an earlier stage florida made preliminary requests for broad waivers of federal rules that would have permitted it to largely if not completely privatize food stamp and medicaid elig ibility activities californias performance review co mmission has recommended that the responsibility for deciding who is eligible for tanf food stamps and medicaid become statelevel not county re sponsibility that would use an internetbased application system for all three programs and woul d be run by private contractor views on privatization support for privatization of welfare eligibility determination activ ities as well as other public assistance administrative functions derives from strong belief that it will shrink government reduce costs by introduc ing privatesector fficiencies into the administration of public aid nd bring about better service to public assistance applicants and recipients proponents mainta in that private agencies ar likely to be more innovative than public ones and that competition for contracts should rais performance levels moreover they note that the current situation in which tanf eligibility activities can be privatized but not those in other progra ms is untenable as shown by experience so far eg the limited degree to which privatization has been taken up the applicantrecipient population for the three ma jor public aid programs overlaps to great extent continuing to require governme ntemployee involvement for food stamp and medicaid eligibility determinations makes it extremely difficult to effectuate coordinated public assistance systemstrategy using private contractors those who question the need for increased privatization authority have both general and specific objections they wo rry that benefits may be denied to eligible applicants because private companies administering given program could be tempted to hold down costs under the terms of their st ate contract at the expense of needy applicantsrecipients that there might be net loss of jobs in sw itchover to private administrators and that the financial benefits to the g overnment have not been shown more specifically there is concern that 1 selecting winning bidders would depend on great deal of speculation which could risk higher costs because private entities capacity to take on public assistance eligibility determin ations is relatively unknown 2 contractors would have great leverage over the state and potential comp etitors because of the likely high cost of changing administrators 3 measuring contractors performance with regard to eligibility determinations would be very hard 4 contracting eligibility determinations might subject state and federal governments to large financial losses if the private entities withdraw eg go bankrupt and the government must step in and 5 some privatization projects have been called to account for x practices eg wisconsins approach3 in addition opponents note that prior experience with privatization eg conversion to electronic delivery of benefits typically took long time including pilot projects and extensive evaluations before it became accepted practice they contend that gohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22043crs4 4 the reason foundations most pertinent annual privatization report is available at

republican leadership bill and hr 4 as passed by the house in the 108th congress would have required increased scrutiny through oversight of state audits of tanf privatization initiatives this latter
