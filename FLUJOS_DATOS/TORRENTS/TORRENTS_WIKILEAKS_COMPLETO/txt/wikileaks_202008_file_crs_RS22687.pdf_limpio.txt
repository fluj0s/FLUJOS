or labor union treasury funds from being spent for electioneering communications bcra defines electioneering communication as any broadcast cable or satellite transmission made within 30 days of primary or 60 days of general election sometimes referred to as the blackout periods that refers to candidate for federal office and is targeted to the relevant electorate2 in 2003 decision mcconnell v federal election commission fec3 the us supreme court upheld section 203 of bcra against first amendment facial challenge even though the provision regulates not only campaign speech or express advocacy speech that expressly advocates the election or defeat of clearly identified candidate but also issue advocacy speech that discusses public policy issues while also mentioning candidate specifically the court determined that the speech regulated by section 203 was the functional equivalent of express advocacy 4 on july 26 2004 wisconsin right to life wrtl corporation that accepts contributions from other corporations began broadcasting advertisements exhorting viewers to contact senators feingold and kohl to urge them to oppose senate filibuster to delay and block consideration of federal judicial nominations wrtl planned to run the ads throughout august 2004 and to finance them with its general treasury funds thereby running afoul of section 203 as such ads would have been broadcast within the 30day period prior to the september 14 2004 primary anticipating that the ads would be illegal electioneering communications but believing that they nevertheless had first amendment right to broadcast them wrtl filed suit against the fec seeking declaratory and injunctive relief and alleging that section 203s prohibition was unconstitutional as applied to the ads and any future ads that they might plan to run just prior to the bcra 30day blackout period th reejudge district court denied preliminary injunction finding that mcconnell v fec left room for such an asapplied challenge accordingly wrtl did not broadcast its ads during the blackout period and the district court subsequently dismissed the complaint in an unpublished opinion on appeal in wisconsin right to life inc v fec wrtl i 5 the supreme court vacated the lower court judgment finding that by upholding section 203 against facial challenge in mcconnell we did not purport to resolve future asapplied challenges6 on remand after permitting four members of congress to intervene as defendants the threejudge district court granted wrtl summary judgment determining that section 203 was unconstitutional as applied to wrtls ads7 it concluded that the ads were genuine issue ads not express advocacy or its functional equivalent under mcconnell and held that compelling interest justified their regulation 8 the fec appealed 1 pl 107155 this law is also known as mccainfeingold referring to the principal senate sponsors of the legislation 2 see 2 usc 441bb2 3 540 us 93 2003 4 id at

supreme court affirmed the lower court ruling finding that section 203 of bcra was unconstitutional as applied to the wrtl ads and that they should have been permissible to broadcast in plurality opinion written by chief justice roberts joined by justice alitojustice scalia wrote separate concurrence joined by justices kennedy and thomas10the court announced that because wrtls ads may reasonably be interpreted as something other than as an appeal to vote for or against specific candidate we hold they are not the functional equivalent of express advocacy and therefore fall outside the scope of mcconnell s holding11 in determining the threshold question as required by mcconnell of whether the ads were the functional equivalent of speech expressly advocating the election or defeat of candidate for federal office or genuine issue advocacy the court observed that it had long recognized that the practical distinction between campaign advocacy and issue advocacy can often dissolve because candidates particularly incumbents are intimately tied to public issues involving legislative proposals and governmental actions 12 nonetheless the court stated its jurisprudence in this area requires it to make such distinction and in drawing that line the first amendment requires erring on the side of protecting political speech rather than suppressing it 13 g3g151g138g149g162g156g146g156g561 in wrtl ii the fec appealed the lower court ruling arguing that in view of the fact that mcconnell had already held that section 203 was facially valid wrtland not the governmentshould bear the burden of demonstrating that bcra is unconstitutional as applied to its ads14 rejecting the fecs contention the court pointed out that section 203 burdens political speech and is therefore subject to strict scrutiny15 under strict scrutiny the court determined that the fecnot the regulated communityhad the burden of proving that the application of section 203 to wrtls ads furthered compelling interest and was narrowly tailored to achieve that interest16 as it had already ruled in mcconnell that section 203 survives strict scrutiny to the extent it regulates express advocacy or its functional equivalent the court found that in order to prevail the fec needed to show that the wrtl ads it sought to regulate 9 06969 us june 25 2007 10 in concurrence justice scalia found that the attempt in the court s ruling to distinguish mcconnell is unpersuasive enough and the change in the law it works is substantial enough that seven justices having widely divergent views concerning the constitutionality of the restric tions at issue agree that the opinion effectively overrules mcconnell without saying so id slip op at 17 n 7 scalia j concurring in part and

fec sought to regulate is not express advocacy or its functional equivalent the court cautioned that the fecs task is more formidable because it must demonstrate that banning such ads during the blackout periods is narrowly tailored to serve compelling governmental interest conclusion that precedent has reached18 in response to the fecs and the dissents19 argument that mcconnell established test for determining whether an ad is the functional equiva lent of express advocacy that is whether the ad is intended to influence elections or has that effect the court disagreed finding that it had not adopted any type of test as the standard for future asapplied challenges20 instead the court found that its analysis in mcconnell was grounded in the evidentiary record particularly studies showing that the bcra definition of electioneering communications accurately captures ads having the purpose or effect of supporting candidates for election to office 21 hence when the mcconnell court made its assessment that the plaintiffs in that case had not sufficiently proven that section 203 was overbroad and could not be enforced in any circumstance it did not adopt particular test for determining what constituted the functional equivalent of express advocacy indeed the court held the fact that in mcconnell it looked to such intent and effect neither compels nor warrants accepting that same standard as the constitutional test for separating in an asapplied challenge political speech protected under the first amendment from that which may be banned 22 accordingly the court turned to establishing th proper standard for an asapplied challenge to section 203 of bcra finding that such standard must be objective focusing on the substance of the communication rather than amorphous considerations of intent and effect involving minimal if any discovery so that parties can resolve disputes quickly without chilling speech through the threat of burdensome litigation and eschewing the openended roughandtumble of factors which invites complex argument in trial court and virtually inevitable appeal 23 in summation the court announced that the standard must give the benefit of any doubt to protecting rather than stifling speech24 taking such considerations into account the court held that 17 id quoting mcconnell v fec 540 us at 206 18 id 19 the dissenting opinion maintained that the principal opinion establishes new test to identify severely limited class of ads that may constitutionally be regulated as electioneering communications test that is flatly

possibility of genuine or pure issue ad that might not be open to regulation under 203 the dissent argued that the court meant that an issue ad that did not contain campaign advocacy could escape the regulation not that if an ad is susceptible to any reasonable interpretation other than as an appeal to vote for or against specific candidate then it must be pure or genuine issue ad id slip op at

advocacy only if the ad is susceptible of reasonable interpretation other than as an appeal to vote for or against specific candidate under this test wrtls three ads are plainly not the functional equivalent of express advocacy first their content is consistent with that of genuine issue ad the ads focus on legislative issue take position on the issue exhort the public to adopt that position and urge the public to contact public officials with respect to the matter second their content lacks indicia of express advocacy the ads do not mention an election candidacy political party or challenger and they do not take position on candidates character qualifications or fitness for office 25 moreover the court cautioned contextual factors should seldom play significant role in the inquiry although courts are not required to ignore basic background information that provides relevant contextual information about an advertisementsuch as whether the ad describes legislative issue that is under legislative considerationthe court found that such background information should not become an excuse for discovery26 in applying the standard it developed for asappl ied challenges to the ads that wrtl sought to broadcast the court determined that the fec had failed to demonstrate that such ads constituted the functional equivalent of express advocacy because they could reasonably be interpreted as something other than vote for or against candidate the courts established jurisprudence has recognized the governmental interest in preventing corruption and the appearance of corruption in elections which has been invoked in order to justify contribution limits and in certain circumstances spending limits on electioneering expenditures that pose the risk of quid pro quo corruption in mcconnell the court noted it had applied this interest in justifying the regulation of express advocacy and its functional equivalent but in order to justify regulating wrtls ads this interest must be stretched yet another step to ads that are not the functional equivalent of express advocacy27 in strongly worded opposition to extending the application of this governmental interest yet again the court announced enough is enough the wrtl ads are not equivalent to contributionsthey are political speechand the governmental interest in avoiding quid pro quo corruption cannot be used to justify their regulation 28 the court also announced that the discussion of issues cannot be suppressed simply because the issues may also be relevant to an election where the first amendment is implicated the tie goes to the speaker not the censor29 in an equally strongly worded dissent justice souterwith whom justices stevens ginsburg and breyer joinedargued that wrtl ii overruled that portion of mcconnell v fec upholding section 203 of bcra against facial constituti onal challenge among other points in opposition to the courts ruling the dissent observed that section 203 was less restrictive than the courts opinion would indicate in that it did not effect complete ban on corporate and labor union funds being spent on electioneering communications indeed the dissent remarked quoting mcconnell corporations and unions may finance genuine issue ads in the runup period by simply avoiding any specific reference to federal candidates or in doubtful cases by paying for the ad from segregated pac fund30 moreover the dissent added nonprofit corporation 25 id 26 id slip op at 20 27 id slip op at 26 emphasis included 28 id 29 id slip op at 21 30 id slip op at 18 souter j

electioneering communications so long as it does not finance such ads with funding from business corporations and unions31 of particular significance the dissent cautioned that it is possible based on the reasoning of the courts ruling that even advertisements containing express words of advocacyknown as magic wordscould now escape regulation under section 203 32
