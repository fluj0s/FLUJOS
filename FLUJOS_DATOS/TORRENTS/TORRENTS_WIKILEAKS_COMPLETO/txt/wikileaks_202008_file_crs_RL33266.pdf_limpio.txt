of federal student aid under title iv of the hea it entails gathering financial data wh ich are provided by the stude nt via the free application for federal student aid fafsa1 calculating the efc and packaging of the applicants financial aid award by the postsecondary instituti ons financial aid administrator faa this section provide s description of the efc and how it is calculated in addition the role of the fafsa and student financial aid packaging is examinedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33266crs2 2 the 20072008 award year began july 1 2007 and ends on june 30 2008 3 the calculation of the efc is delineated in the hea in sections 475 476 and 477 each of these sections applies to recipi ents based on their dependency status 4 section 480c defines veteran as an individual who was engaged in active duty in the us army navy air force marines or coast guard and was released under condition other than dishonorableexpected family contribution the efc is the amount that the federal n eed analysis system determines family has available to contribute toward postsec ondary education expenses in calculating the efc consideration is given to available income combination of taxable and untaxed income and benefits and for some families available assets in addition living expenses retirement needs and federal and state tax liability are considered the income contribution is calculated by determining the total income of student and his or her family where applicable and determining available income by subtracting series of allowances from total income percentage of that available income is considered as an income c ontribution toward postsecondary education costs contribution from assets is similarly calculated the combination of the available income contribution and asse t contribution divided by the number of individuals in the family enrolled in college constitutes the efc the efc process looks back year for its income data and federal income tax liability that is for award year 200720082 2006 income and federal inco tax data will be used the calculation of the efc varies pending upon the app licants dependency status there are three separa dependency classi fications for individual applicants dependent student i ndependent student with depende nts and independent student without dependents3 these distinctions are important because parental financial information is not considered if the applicant meets the statutory definition of an independent student to be classified as statutorily independent title iv section 480d an applicant must meet one of the following conditions 24 years of age or older by december 31st of the award year married enrolled in graduate or professional program have dependent other than spouse orphan or ward of the court or the applicant was until age 18 or military veteran4 or active duty service member applicants who do not meet any of the af orementioned conditions are considered to be dependent for the purposes of title iv student aid httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33266crs3 5 for more detailed description of the federal need analysis system see the 20072008 efc formula worksheets and tables available at httpwwwifapedgov efcinformationatt achments0708efcformul aguidedecfinalpdf 6 section 480f2c defines family ownership of small business as small business with not more than 100 fulltime or fulltime equivale nt employees that is owned and controlled by the familycalculating the efc the following is stepby step description of the basic calculations used to determine students efc this description applies to the 20072008 award year5 the calculation descriptions are organized as follows parents of dependent student s dependent students are included within the calculation for parents and independent students with dependents other than spouse and independent students without dependents other than spouse the calculation for parents of dependent students and independent stude nts with dependents other than spouse are discussed together because the two are identical except that the dependent students contribution is added together with the parents efc calculation for parents of dependent students and independent students with pendents other than spouse first step calculate total income is calculated by adding the following adjusted gross income agi income earned from employment untaxed income and benefits eg welfare and child support payments other sources of income such as federal education income tax credits eg hope and lifetime credits and certain student grant and scholarship aid eg americorps benefits second step calculate allowances various allowances for noneducational expenses are subtracted from these llowances are for expenses such as basic living expenses the income protection allowance federal income tax liability state and other taxes social secur ity and employment expenses third step calculate available income ai ai is calculated by subtracting the various allowances previously descri bed from ai can be negative number fourth step calculate asset contribution c ac is calculated by adding cash savings and checking and the net wort h of investments bus inesses and farms excluding the value of the family home family farm or small family business6 and then subtracting an asset protection allo wance to determine discretionary net worth the amount of the asset protection allowance increases with the age of the older parent for dependent students or the age of the student for independent students with dependents th asset protection allowance protects assets that are needed for retirement and future education costs the ac is equal to 12 of the discretionary net worth if the re sult is negative the ac is zerohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33266crs4 7 under progressive formula as the aggregate amount of income and assets rises the proportion expected to be c ontributed toward educational expenses also risesfifth step calculate adjusted available in come aai ac is added to ai to produce the aai progressive assessm ent schedule is applied to the aai to determine the proportion of income and assets to be contributed7 the assessment rate ranges from 22 to 47 both aai and the contribution from aai can be negative number sixth step the contribution from aai is divided by the number of family members in the household excluding the pa rents in the case of dependent students who are enrolled in college for parents of dependent students the resulting number is the parents contribution to the efc for independent stude nts with dependents other than spouse this number is the efc next the dependent students portion of the efc is calculated as follows seventh step similar to step 1 is calculated for the dependent student based on the amount of untaxed income and benefits other sources of income and certain student grant and scholarship aid eighth step dependent students also receive various allowances for federal income tax liability state and other taxes and social security however dependent students do not receive an allowance for em ployment expenses in addition if the parents aai is negative see fifth step above then the amount is converted to positive amount and added to the total llowances that the student receives ninth step calculate the available income ai ai is calculated by subtracting the allowances previously disc ussed from ai is then assessed at 50 this equals the depe ndent students contribution from ai if the result is negative the ai is zero tenth step the calculation for the dependent student asset contribution is the same as the calculation for parents and independent students with dependents see third step above howeve r dependent students ssets are assessed at 20 eleventh step the final step the total ef c for the dependent student is calculated by adding the pare nts contribution see sixth st ep above to the students asset and income contribution efc calculation for independent students without dependents other than spouse the efc calculation for independent students without dependents other than spouse is hybrid of the calculation for pa rents and the one fo r dependent students the calculation for this group is as follows first step calculate total income is calculated by adding the following income earned from employment untaxed income and benefits and otherhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33266crs5 8 independent students without dependents ot her than spouse receive an employment expense allowance only if they are married and both the student and the spouse are employed 9 hea section 479b 10 to be eligible for snt the student and his or her parents must not have to file an income tax return or must file or be eligible to file federal tax form 1040a or 1040ez individuals who complete federal tax form 1040 solely to claim the hope or lifetime learning tax credit are eligible as well further elig ibility for snt can be sa tisfied if any family member including the applicant has received federal meanstested benefit 11 the same income tax filing requirements and re ceipt of federal meanstested benefit that apply to snt applicants apply to autozer applicants as well autozero efc is not provided to independent students without dependentssources of income such as federal educa tion income tax credits and certain student grant and scholarship aid second step subtract allowances various allowances for noneducational expenses are subtracted from these llowances are for expenses such as basic living expenses the income protection allowances federal income tax liability state and other taxes social security and in some instances employment expenses8 third step the total allowances are subtracted from to produce the available income ai similar to the assessment imposed upon dependent students the ai of independent students without dependents is also assessed at 50 the resulting amount is the contribution from ai fourth step the asset contribution is calcu lated by adding together cash savings checking and the net worth of investments bus inesses and farms excluding the value of the family home family farm or sm all family business similar to the protection afforded to parents and independent students with dependents independe nt students without dependents also receive an allowance to protect assets that are needed for retirement and future education costs and the amount of the protection also increases with the students age the asset assessment rate for independent student s without dependents is 20 fifth step the efc is calculated by adding the contribution from ai to the contribution from ac and then dividing by the number of family members in college special efc conditions in addition to creating common application form and single methodology for determining n eed congress has also sought to further reduce the application burden for those applicants with family incomes at or below specified threshold under the simplified needs test snt9 the efc calculation does not consider assets for the student or spouse if married or parent if the student is dependent if their adjusted gross income agi is less than 50000 and certain conditions regarding federal tax returns are met10 t h automatic zero efc hereinafter autozero efc 11 sets the expected family contribution to zero for dependent students parents and the dependent student or for an independent studenthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33266crs6 12 the cost of attendance coa is measur of students educational expenses it is statutorily defined in title iv section 472 of the hea in general it is the sum of tuition and fees an allowance for books supplies transportation and miscellaneous personal expenses and room and board allowance 13 for additional information regarding the pell grant program see crs report rl31668 federal pell grant program of the higher education act background and reauthorization by charmaine mercerwho has dependents nd has an agi not greater than 20000 the autozero efc is not provided to independent students without dependents other than spouse fafsa the fafsa is used to collect most of the information that is utilized to calculate the efc applicants are required to report identifying information such as their name and social security number information about the institutions where their information should be forwarded and financial information pertaining to income and assets as ntioned above there are thr ee ways to complete the fafsa via the web electronically throug h higher education institution or by filling out paper form the paper web and onsite electronic ve rsions of the fafsa differ in the ways that submitted data are treated as result the two electronic versions of the fafsa provide advantages that the paper form does not for example the paper version lacks internal and endofentry data edits that require the applicant to resolve conflicts and complete all necessary fields prior to submission in addition the two electronic versions contain skip logic which enables applicants if they choose to skip over the sections of the fafsa that do not pertain to them as result eligible applicants who apply via the electronic formats are able to take advantage of either the snt or autozero efc because the technology allows sections to be skipped where applicable at present ther is comparable approach available for paper form filers efc and packaging fafsa data are submitted to centra l processor an entity working under contract for the us department of education that calculates the aid applicants efc based on statutorily defi ned rules from the central processor the efc and other summary data are reported to faas and to the fafsa filer the faa determines the students need for federal student aid and other sources of aid based primarily upon the efc and co st of attendance coa12 this is true for all federal student aid programs eg loans campusb ased programs except for the pell grant program13 for nearly all pell recipients the award is calculated by subtracting the efc from the maximum appropria ted pell grant for the year ie without regard to the coa the faa determines need in conjunction with each programs award rules and puts together the financial aid aw ard or package which consists of the specific sources and amounts of student aid each applicant will receive to help pay for his or her educa tionrelated expenseshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33266crs7 the financial aid package starts with the pell grant the federal foundation for student aid other aid such as campusbased student ai d program funds state and institutional aid and federal loans are added to create the students aid package the aid applicant is then notified concerning the composition of the financial aid package some of these calculations vary from faa to faa not only does the aid administrator have some discretion in th awarding of campusb ased student aid but section 479a of the hea explicitly give s faas discretion to adjust on case by case basis the coa or the values of the items used to calculate the efc to allow for treatment of an individual eligible applicant with special circumstances the statute offers examples of these special circum stances such as the recent unemployment of family member when the faa might exercise this professional judgement if he or she chooses to do so legislative proposals addressing federal need analysis as discussed simplification of need anal ysis is perennial issue several proposals have been introduced that attemp t to further simplify the process this section reviews major legislation of the 110th congress that addresses need analysis although the college cost reduc tion and access act ccraa made significant changes to the federal need analysis formula both s 1642 and hr 4137 senate and house hea reauthorization b ills include provisions to further amend select aspects of need anal ysis formula specifically both bills propose to modify the definition of room and board to include room and board allowance for students who live in housing located on military base or who receive basic allowance for housing in addition both bills would exclude the value of military housing or military housing allowance r eceived by student or his or her parent from consideration as untaxed income or be nefits in the need analysis formula
