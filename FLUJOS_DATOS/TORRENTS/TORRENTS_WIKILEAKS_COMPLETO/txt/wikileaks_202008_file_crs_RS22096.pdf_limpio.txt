researchers at harvard university released study indicating that high percentage of bankruptcy filers cited medical expenses as contributing factor for the bankruptcy filing4 amendments were introduced to address dical expenses in the bankrupt cy process and several were adopted by the senate this report summari zes the specific role of medical expenses under the reform bill the bankruptcy abuse prevention and c onsumer protection act is intended to ensure that those who are able to pay unsecu red indebtedness in ba nkruptcy do so under chapter 7 debtor liquidates all of his or her assets as of the date of filing and receives discharge for permissible debts incurred pr ior to the filing in chapter 13 debtor pledges future income to repay past debt s secured indebtedness such as home mortgages and automobile liens are treated differently under the us bankruptcy code and the law in general they cannot be fully discharged unsecured claims which are essentially contractua l obligations to repay without pledge of collateral may be historically chapter 7 has been utilized by debtors to discharge unsecured debts such as credit card debts or medical expenses medical expenses as debt the bapcpa does not confer special treatment upon health care expenses as category of unsecured debt or as driving cause for bankruptcy filing indeed proponents of the gislation explain that medical indebtedness is not intended to receive unique treatment as explained by senator sessions if they debtors make above the median income and are able to pay off some of their debts to their doctor and their hospita l why shouldnt they you mean they have obligation to pay hospital that may have spent lot of money helping them get well or physician who took care of them nd provided medical care to them if they are making 80000 year and in bankruptcy under chapter 13 the judge finds that person could pay back 25 percent why shoul d they not pay 25 percent the judge will not order it unless he believes based on the persons income level they have the ability to repay when person in america undertakes an obligation to pay someone they ought to pay them and in any country that is s we are drifting bit to suggest there is real obligation to pay the debts we incur if we get to that point then we have eroded some very important fundamental moral principles about co mmerce in america i believe this bill says plainly and clearly if one can pay back some of their debts they ought to do so there is reason why somebody making 100000 who can pay back 20 percent of the debts he owes to th person who fixed his car or the doctor who helped him get well should not pay that back why should they wipe out all of those debts5 generally debts owed for medical services hospitalizations andor medicine incurred prior to the bankruptcy are general unsecured claims the aggreg ate outstanding amounthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22096crs3 6 the internal revenue service has national living standards governing food housekeeping supplies apparel and services personal care supplies and services it has separate standards for housing utilities and transportation 7 the statutory language provides that if the debt ors current monthly income is greater than the lesser of i25 percent of the debtors nonpriority unsecured claims in the case or 6000 whichever is greater then the debtor is not eligible to file under chapter 7will be component of the means test calcula tion of the debtors ability to pay unsecured debt from future income the larger the am ount of unsecured debt the greater the income necessary to pay it off the means test doe s factor in ongoing medical expenses as living expense in various contexts they are discussed below the means test the means test is complex formula that calculates income and expenses to determine whether an individual is considered to have disposable monthly income it combines living expenses that the internal revenue service considers to be reasonable with the individual debtors actual expenses in certain categories6 for debtor whose income exceeds the applicable state median income if the sum of hypothetical expenses and real expenses m easured against monthly income results in surplus of 100 or more month the debtor would not be permitted to f ile under chapter 77 if debtor is ineligible for chapter 7 he or she may f ile under chapter 13 the duration of the chapter 13 plan will also depend upon debtors median income when the debtor is in chapter 13 determining repayment ability ie disposable income under the reorganization plan will also calculate monthly disposab income by comparable method for means test purposes debtor many exclude from monthly income actual expenses for reasonably necessary health insurance disability insurance and health savings account expenses for the btor the debtors spouse and dependents and reasonably necessary care and support of an elderly chronically ill or disabled household member of the debtors immediate family including parents grandparents siblings child ren and grandchildre n of the debtor the dependents of the debtor and the spouse of the debtor in joint case who is not dependent and who is unable to pay for such expenses if the means test indicates that debtor does have the ability to pay the debtor may still assert the existence of special circumst ances such as serious medical condition that should be considered as an allo wable deduction from monthly income conclusion health care expenses will generally be considered in one of two contexts in bankruptcy filing signifi cant expenses incurred prior to the bankruptcy filing may be calculated as unsecu red claims if the debtor ca nnot afford to pay 25 percent of unsecured claims or 100 month the debtor may be eligible to file under chapter 7 ongoing health care expenses and health insurance premiums may be deducted from the debtors monthly income factoring in these expenses may also reduce the debtors disposable income under the means test
