division c of pl 104208 together these laws require the continued detention of most criminal aliens until their removal from the us these laws also tightly restrict the opportunity for aliens wh commit crimes to obtain relief from being sent abroad even resident aliens wit h longstanding community and family ties may face mandatory dete ntion and removal with little prospect of early reentry as consequence of past criminal activity classes of removable crimin aliens the immigration and nationality act ina makes deportable any alien who is convicted of crime in any f the following overlapping categories 1 single crime involving moral turpitude committed within 5 years of entry 10 years in the case of certain former informants if the crime is punishable b imprisonment of at

not release them prior to deportation but exceptions were made for legal permanen t residents lprs who were not poor bail risks or dangers to the community except for flight risks and dangers to the community all alien s convicted of other deportable offenses generally could be released pending completion of deportation proceedings now however mandatory detention applies to almost all classes of deportable criminal aliens and the exceptions to mandatory detention are tightly restricted to certain witnesses and informant s iirira had allowed for 2year transition period during which ne w mandatory detention rules were eased this period ended in october 1998 relie f from removal the ina provides otherwise removable aliens with variou s forms of relief access to this relief from removal has been narrowed for criminal aliens primarily through expansion of aggravated felonies among the relief tha t is available under the ina are 1 cancellation of removal for longterm lprs formerly 212c relief 2 cancellation of removal for nonlpr s based on hardship formerly suspension of deportation and 3 asylum including the related but separate remedy of withholding of removal for aliens facing persecution cancellation of removal for lprs permits an lpr who has resided here at least 7 years to have an immigration judge balance equities favoring the ali ens continued presence against the seriousness of the aliens conduct in deciding whether the alien should b removed h owever an lpr convicted at any time of an aggravated felony as that class has been expande d is now ineligible for relief previously disqualification was limited to aliens who had ser ved at least 5 years for an aggravated felony also iirira stops the time counted toward the 7year minimum presence requirement when

ineligible for cancellation of removal based on hardship to citizen or lpr relatives here if the alien has committed any offense that makes the alien inadmissible or remova ble previously criminal aliens were eligible for relief albeit under heightene d hardship and presence standards the expansion of aggravated felonies also narrows eligibility f or discretionary grant of asylum additionally

otherwise qualified aliens who can show that they would be persecuted on removal only those alie ns who have been sentenced for an aggravated felony or felonies to an aggregate term of at least 5
