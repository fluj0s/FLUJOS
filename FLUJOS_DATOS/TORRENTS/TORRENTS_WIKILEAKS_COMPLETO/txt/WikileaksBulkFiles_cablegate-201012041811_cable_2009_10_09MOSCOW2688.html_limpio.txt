counselor susan elliott for reason 14 d 1 c summary efforts to sanitize stalins role in soviet history may be potentially damaging to academic freedom and linked to gor efforts to increase authoritarian rule although some recent incidents have caused concern among human rights monitors thus far gor efforts to enlist academics to help oppose falsification of history have not been strongly enforced gor rhetoric on the subject appears largely aimed at scoring political points in arguments with foreign countries end summary stalins ghost haunts the metro 2 sbu the specter of joseph stalin continues to haunt postsoviet russia as the gor and average russians alike struggle to reconcile their pride in past soviet glories with the harsh fact that the soviet system especially under stalin destroyed the lives of millions of its citizens this uneasy and ambivalent relationship with the past is further complicated by gor policy of occasionally exploiting nationalistic emotions about soviet history especially the soviet victory over the nazis to buttress support for its own modern brand of authoritarianism ref the latest dispute flared up after moscow city hall announced on october 27 that it would add lenins name to artwork in the kurskaya metro station which since august has carried restored verse from the 1944 version of the soviet anthem praising stalin moscows chief architect aleksandr kuzmin told local media that he wanted to return kurskaya to its original appearance which would include monument to stalin an article in the daily komsomolskaya pravda paper not always known for liberal opposition noted wryly that if the goal was to return things to their original appearance it might be necessary to blanket the entire city with stalins image as authorities had done during the height of stalins totalitarian reign of terror moscow mayor yuriy luzhkov told interfax october 28 that the city had intention of placing stalin statue in the metro and the moscow patriarchate criticized the idea of stalinist symbols in the metro calling it divisive academic freedom under threat 3 c gor efforts to sanitize soviet history have continued throughout the year and have the potential to reach into numerous walks of life and hence to encroach upon academic freedom in may the kremlin announced that it had formed commission to oppose historical falsification and its state duma supporters introduced legislation to defend russias honor in any discussion of world war ii and the subsequent creation of the soviet union ref b less than month later in june xxxxxxxxxxxx leaked to us an email allegedly from va tishkov the chief of the history section of ran politely requesting all faculty to present him with information in connection with the gors may announcement the information requested included list of sources of possible falsification in their field of study and information about activity among their students promoting the spread of falsification or of concepts damaging to russias interests more recently on october 14 the moscow times reported that the german government had written letter to president medvedev complaining about an investigation into an arkhangelsk historian mikhail suprun for violating privacy rights by researching deportations of soviet germans under stalin the police official who gave suprun access to the archives is also accused of abuse of office while suprun could receive up to four years in prison and has had what he called lifetimes work on computers and research data confiscated by the federal security service fsb 4 c xxxxxxxxxxxx told us that she personally knew professors at academic institutions in moscow who had received such memos during the summer including memos asking them to identify falsifiers she added that the foreign intelligence service also has presence at ran discussing this potentially disturbing trend xxxxxxxxxxxx also alluded to the unpleasant rewrites found in officially sanctioned textbooks which whitewash stalins role in the countrys history while acknowledging the existence of broad variety of history books approximately 24 schoolbooks on history are available in bookstores xxxxxxxxxxxx noted that the official version outnumbers the others by 250000 books to approximately 1015000 furthermore in russia as in the us parents do not buy their childrens history books but rather the schools order them which xxxxxxxxxxxx said makes the moscow 00002688 002 of 003 choice predetermined on october 24 the liberal daily journal reported the release of the latest in long line of history textbooks rehabilitating stalin this one ironically produced by the enlightenment publishing company denies the existence of totalitarianism in the ussr the article noted that every time someone brings up the topic of history it engendered furious online debate 6 c xxxxxxxxxxxx told us that virtual war has flared up between prokremlin and antikremlin bloggers every time someone published papers on the internet that they received from state archives 15 years ago detailing soviet human rights abuses the papers date back 15 years xxxxxxxxxxxx explained because now as in soviet times people need to complete special applications to receive permission to read such documents brief window opened after the fall of the soviet union and just as quickly closed again the past is not dead it is not even past 7 c for xxxxxxxxxxxx such debates tell as much about the present as they do about the past he believes that the gor is trying to create newly obedient society which as in orwell only knows history from standpoint beneficial to the authorities according to xxxxxxxxxxxx when the power structure talks about falsification they are simply attempting to hide part of history he added that knowledge of the real history carries significant power he was struck by the shock of people who learned historical facts because sometimes just one fact can overturn persons whole world view for example xxxxxxxxxxxx daughter who studied in the ussr and teaches history in high school upon learning that xxxxxxxxxxxx grandfather had been killed in the 1937 purges talked of little else for several years afterward according to xxxxxxxxxxx the kremlin fears people learning about past atrocities and crimes and hence tries to manipulate peoples consciousness xxxxxxxxxxx added that he understands the gors policy because if people knew the extent of soviet crimes the kremlin would not be able to control the populace xxxxxxxxxxxx expressed similar view saying that the gor prefers to present itself as infallible making only correct decisions and that discussions about stalins misdeeds might lead to unwanted questions for todays government 8 c xxxxxxxxxxx said he suspected that at least some of the prokremlin bloggers who participate in these historical debates were professionals in the pay of the gor and perhaps special services this notion may not be so farfetched on october 21 interfax reported that supposedly private citizen named mikhail baranov had launched an internet portal called runivers to fight falsification of history by creating historical and cultural electronic encyclopedia and library the article describes baranovs organization as noncommercial and does not indicate from where during these economically tight times it receives its funding however state duma deputy who is member of the runivers board vladimir medinskiy lamented to interfax that russia does not have an institution that would be dealing in historical propaganda which is why we are losing in the war aimed to falsify russian history wink is the easiest response to gor directives 9 c the fact that russia currently lacks such historical propaganda institution has thus far prevented any widespread attacks on academic freedom in the name of antifalsification xxxxxxxxxxxx told us october 27 that he had heard reports from any of his mgu colleagues of any pressure on them to present teaching materials or name names in order to ferret out falsification he attributed this at least in part to the fact that in contrast to neighboring belarus russia has ideological department which examines all teaching materials in schools and universities xxxxxxxxxxxx also cautioned against leaping to orwellian conclusions reminding us not to underestimate the cynicism involved in administrative requests like the one at ran everyone knows how to take such requests she said the request from the government is ugly but unlike in soviet times when professors all depended upon the government for their currently there is way to enforce such decrees as result according to xxxxxxxxxxxx people wink the administrators while passing along the governments request make it clear to their subordinates that they themselves do not support it xxxxxxxxxxxx pointed out that many historians may be outraged at the governments heavyhandedness and its real falsification of history but they dont see themselves as unified force moscow 00002688 003 of 003 the simplest response is to use the power of inertia and to stonewall passively goal of gor rhetoric score political points at home 10 c for the gors part it held session of its commission during the summer and its director claimed that participants were not here to censor but simply to oppose perceived attempts by other countries to gain at russias expense on the geopolitical scene although the stated focus is on international disputes the gors primary audience for its hardline stance is domestic rhetoric defending russias honor on the international stage scores easy political points for the gor at home note this occasionally results in some fancy footwork as when putin visited poland on the anniversary of the molotovribbentrop pact and wrote conciliatory article for his polish audience which according to lipman by gor design received scant coverage in russian media end note as xxxxxxxxxxxx said there is lot of vagueness about the past but world war ii is the one thing everyone in russia accepts both liberal and conservative the narrative is that germany attacked and we won that stalin continues to have following 56 years after his death is undeniable after aleksandr prokhanov editorinchief of the ultranationalist paper zavtra praised stalin on the honest monday political talk show on gazpromowned ntv television audience members were invited to phone in their opinions of those who participated 61 percent called stalin hero 32 percent an enemy and 7 percent great effective manager comment 11 c recent reports of the death of academic freedom in russia are greatly exaggerated gor leaders have shown that they are willing to adopt nationalistic postures when it buttresses their popular support but attempts to dictate academic terms thus far appear halfhearted the gor is doubt telling the truth when it claims to place greater focus on external quarrels about its past than on domestic debates it is undeniable that nationalists continue to link russias past greatness with its past political system which showed disdain for the value of individual human life and for freedom of expression and that this approach places these fundamental freedoms under threat however there remain enough russians both in and out of the government who question the nationalists logic and strive to keep the memory of stalins victims alive in the meantime the gor occasionally remembers to name street after aleksandr solzhenitsyn just to make sure that nobody confuses them with the soviets when discussing this issue russians frequently refer to the poet anna akhmatova who when khrushchev opened the doors to stalins prisons wrote that the half of russia who had imprisoned the other half would now come face to face with its victims since according to recent levada poll 27 percent of current russians have relatives who perished under stalins rule that other half is not going away any time soon beyrle
