assertive role in the world economy this report will be updated as events warrant background the eu is treatybased institutional framework that defines and manages economic and political cooperation among its twentyseven members impetus for the formation of the eu came in the aftermath of the devastation of world war ii with the signing of several treaties by six countries belgium france germany italy luxembourg and the netherlands1 by agreeing to integrate their economies in matters of coal and steel production trade and nuclear energy europes leaders hoped to achieve closer union among the peoples of europe and avoid another war on the continent as result of the 1957 treaty of rome the european economic community eec came into force in january 1958 the eec was designed to merge separate national markets into single common market that provides free movement of goods people capital and services across borders to provide for the free movement of goods the eec 1 for background on the eu see crs report rs21372 the european union questions and answers by kristin archick crs2 recognized that it required common external trade policy to prevent one member state from importing foreign goods at cheaper prices due to lower tariffs and then reexporting the items to another member state with higher tariffs2 formal trade policymaking framework article 113 eec provides the legal framework for trade policymaking embedded in this provision are two transfers of authority for the making of trade policy 1 from the member states and their parliaments to the assembly of european states acting collectively through the council of ministers and 2 from the council of ministers to the european commission3 the first transfer of authority is often referred to as community competence or supranational competence the second level of delegation involves the practical transfer of competence from the council of ministers to the european commission article 113 states as follows the common commercial policy shall be based upon uniform principles httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21185 particularly in regard to tariff rates the conclusion of tariff and other agreements the achievement of uniformity in measures of liberalization export policy and measures to protect such as those to be taken in the event of dumping or subsidies the commission shall submit proposals to the council for implementing the common commercial policy where agreements with third countries need to be negotiated the commission shall make recommendations to the council which shall authorize the commission to open negotiations the commission shall conduct these negotiations in consultation with special committee appointed by the council to assist the commission in this task and within the framework of such directives as the council may issue for it and in exercising the powers conferred upon it by this article the council shall act by qualified majority although article 113 provides the community with an exclusive external competence over commercial policy the scope of what constitutes commercial policy has been subject of major and continuing controversy this issue was raised most pointedly in april 1994 when the final act embodying the uruguay round agreements was signed 2 the european community is the legal entity that has competence to act in the field of international economic relations for the european union the press and many scholars however tend to use the two terms interchangeably 3 meunier sophie and kalypso nicolaidis who speaks for europe the delegation of trade authority in the eu journal of common market studies september 1999 vol 37 3 p 480 crs3 in marrakesh at the meeting some member states despite the strong objections of the commission insisted on signing the final act as well the commission held that the final act and its annexes fell within the exclusive competence or jurisdiction of the european community and requested ruling or opinion from the european court of justice ecj on whether the community was competent to conclude the uruguay round4 the council eight member states and the european parliament took the position that the competence to conclude the uruguay round agreements was shared between the community and the member states this disagreement was not about whether to conclude or approve the uruguay round agreements but about who had the power to approve them more specifically the dispute centered on the competence to conclude the agreements in the uruguay round related to trade in services the general agreement on trade in services and intellectual property rights protection agreement on traderelated aspects of intellectual property rights5 in november 1994 opinion 194 the ecj concluded that the community had sole competence to conclude international agreements on trade in goods but that the httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21185 commission and member states had to share competence in dealing with the new issues of services trade and intellectual property protection by ruling that these were areas of mixed competence thereby subject to the principle of unanimity the ecj arguably reduced the leverage of the commission visavis member states during internal bargaining on the eu position6 eu trade policymaking in practice the second transfer or delegation of authority from the council of ministers representing the interests of the member states to the european commission representing the interests of the community or eu as whole is complex in practice although the commission negotiates on behalf of the member states it retains much power to shape the negotiating mandate the actual negotiations and the ratification or approval of any trade agreement the negotiating mandate the european commission is the eus version of central executive body vested with power to propose legislation and common policies the commission also acts as the guardian of eu treaties to ensure that eu legislation is implemented by all members 4 the ecj is the eus version of supreme court with the responsibility to decide what is legal and what is not under the founding treaties cases may be brought to the ecj by the commission the european parliament member governments nationals of member governments for foreign entities 5 van den bossche peter l h the european community and the uruguay round agreements in implementing the uruguay round by john h jackson and alan sykes clarendon press 1997 p 29 6 woolcock stephen european trade policy in wallace helen and william wallace policy making in the european union oxford university press 2000 pp 274375 crs4 for the trade issue the commission has broad authorities and responsibilities most importantly the commission develops proposals for the initiation and content of international trade negotiations and negotiates on behalf of the eu in drawing up trade proposals the commission seeks to balance different national and sectoral interests depending on the negotiation and the mandate provided by the council the commission has considerable flexibility in deciding on negotiating tactics the commission also has much autonomy for administering the eus trade remedy procedures antidumping countervailing duty and safeguard procedures against foreign nonmembers the commission is headed by around dozen commissioners who are nominated by the member states and then selected by consensus for fiveyear term each commissioner is charged with acting in support of eu needs and goals independent of instructions from national governments most commissioners have held high office in their home countries previous to coming to brussels each commissioner has an assigned portfolio and can draw on the commissions administrative staff of 21000 civil servants often referred to as eurocrats for support in addition they are assisted by small cabinet or team of aides as body they meet once week to adopt proposals and finalize commission policy when necessary decisions of the commission are made by majority httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21185 vote the group of commission officials directly responsible for trade policy matters is located in the trade directorate dg trade these officials develop initial trade proposals in consultation with special 133 committee this committee composed of senior civil servants from the member states national ministries can be viewed as the representative of the council of ministers in watching over the commission in its work on trade issues7 though its role is purely consultative the 133 committee plays key role in helping member states influence trade policy according to one scholar the commission almost always follows the advice of the 133 committee because its members reflect the wishes of the ministers who ultimately can refuse to conclude the agreement negotiated by the commission8 once the 133 committee has agreed with or amended the commissions proposal it is transmitted to the council of ministers which has the power to establish the objectives and parameters known as the negotiating mandate for trade negotiation the negotiating mandate comprises directives and objectives that are not legally binding on the commission for some negotiations the mandate takes the form 7 the 133 committee meets at both the full committee or senior level and at the level of deputies charged with overall responsibility for trade policy the full members often referred to as titulairies meet on monthly basis full members tend to be senior civil servants drawn from national ministries of trade foreign affairs or finance usually close to the ministers they serve they tend to have good sense of what actions are politically acceptable within their member states the deputies group which meets weekly are drawn from the member states permanent representations based in brussels this group focuses more on technical than political issues 8 meunier sophie trading voices the european union in international commercial negotiations princeton university press 2005 p 35 crs5 of one or several directives but for others it may take the form of only highly generalized and vague objectives9 technically the council agrees on negotiating mandate for traditional trade issues exclusive of services and intellectual property based on qualified majority voting procedure whereby voting weights are based approximately on the size of member state populations10 yet as practical matter the council most often attempts to find general consensus without resorting to formal vote11 the negotiations once the commission has negotiating mandate from the council in principle it has considerable leeway to determine its own negotiating strategy in practice however its flexibility and autonomy could be affected in cases where some member states are intensely interested in the outcome or in cases where the negotiating mandate is quite strict representatives of member states play formal role in actual trade negotiating sessions but depending on the meeting could sit in as observers if member state makes clear its opposition to the direction negotiation is moving the commissions httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21185 trade negotiators must decide to move forward anyway and risk council rejection of any trade agreement negotiated that strays too far from the negotiating mandate or to go back on concessions made to the negotiating partner arguing that the eus hands are tied12 ratification and implementation most major trade agreements such as the uruguay round agreement must be ratified by both the council and member states eu ratification occurs when the council adopts short usually onepage decision that is followed by hundreds of pages of annexes member states ratify the agreement according to their own internal procedures such as vote in parliament in the case of the uruguay round agreements the final act was signed on april 15 1994 by representatives of the council and commission on behalf of the european community on the one hand and by representatives of the member states on behalf of their respective governments by signing the final act the community and the member states agreed to submit the agreements to their competent authorities for approval and final conclusion this included approval by the european parliament13 9 in the case of the uruguay round negotiations the council did not issue negotiating directives of formal or specific nature for most aspects of the negotiations the one exception was agriculture an area where the councils negotiating directives did play an important role 10 the council is composed of ministers from each member government the ministers represent the interests of their member states different ministers participate in the council depending on the subject matter under discussion from the mid1980s discussions on trade policy have often been on the agenda of the council of foreign ministers although trade ministers have occupied the national chairs for discussion of numerous trade matters 11 meunier trading voices p 36 12 meunier trading voices p 38 13 the 768 member european parliament ep historically has played limited and mostly indirect role in trade policy although the ep cannot enact laws like most parliaments it can veto continued crs6 after long delay the council failed to submit the request for approval by the parliament until october 1994 the european parliament gave its assent by vote of 327 65 on december 14 1994 eight days later the council formally adopted decision 94800ec accepting on behalf of the european community the agreements reached in the uruguay round in addition the council adopted implementing legislation some of the changes in community law included in the implementing legislation were in fact not explicitly required by commitments undertaken by the community in the uruguay round agreements but were additions and amendments on which some member states had insisted in return for approval of the agreements14 although much of the legislation could have been adopted by qualified majority the council adopted the implementing legislation on the basis of the unanimity principle us interests as the eu plays larger and more assertive role in the world economy its trade and investment policies increasingly have the potential to help or hinder us economic interests for this reason it is important for policymakers and private sector interests to understand how and why eu trade policies are crafted in order to represent and defend httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21185 us interests to the greatest extent possible from the perspective of institutional arrangements the making of eu trade policy can appear relatively straightforward the commission has the power to propose new initiatives and the council has the power to approve in making its decision the council relies heavily on the advice of the 133 committee while the roles and functions of the relevant decisionmaking institutions are spelled out the relative influence of the key actors the commission the council and the 133 committee on any specific issue is not easy to discern nor is it clear how each of these institutions reach agreement and why they may differ unlike in the making of us trade policy the eu lacks formal and public mechanisms for taking advice and recommendations from the private sector most of eu trade policymaking is done informally and behind closed doors number of us trade officials including former us trade representative charlene barshefsky have criticized this process in her view some of the stress in the useu trade relationship derives from an eu decisionmaking system that is slow opaque and lacks clear lines of authority between the commission and member states15 given that the eu process is unlikely to change as result of external criticism us policymakers face the challenge of trying to better understand how the process works and can be influenced 13 continued legislation in areas such as social policy agriculture and the eus internal market but the ep does not have veto power over trade legislation however by holding hearings and issuing reports the ep can influence the atmosphere for consideration of trade issues 14 some of the amenndments strengthened the eus commmencial defense instruments such as countervailing duty and antidumping procedures see van den bossche p 84 15 barshefsky charlene ustr barshefsky on transatlantic economic relationship january 17 2001 found on the worldwide web at
