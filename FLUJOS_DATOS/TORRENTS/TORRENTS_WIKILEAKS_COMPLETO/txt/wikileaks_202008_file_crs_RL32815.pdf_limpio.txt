12 regional banks the banks that form collective governmentsponsored enterprise gse as gse the banks have special ties to the federal government that accord them agency status and lead investors in capital markets to infer that the government would step in to make good any failure in the debt of the banks originally begun in 1932 as lenders to the savings and loan associations that were the primary lenders for home mortgages the banks have undergone several changes since the savings and loan crisis of the 1980s membership in the banks has changed today encompassing more commercial banks than savings associations an d including credit unions insurance companies and some associated housing providers purpos of lendingwhile still primarily housing relatednow include agricultural and small business lending the changes have also resulted in special mission setasides for low and moderateincome housing and special programs for community development the fivemember federal housing finance board fhfb regulates the system some advocate combining the fhfb with the office of federal housing enterprise oversight ofheo which is the current regulator of fann ie mae and freddie mac the other two housing related gses differences between fhfb nd ofheo including capital and ownership standards requirements for the housing mission and regulatory powers complicate regulatory consolidation in the 110 th congress two major bills would merge regulation for the housing related gses both s 1100 and hr 1427 would combine regulation of the three housing gses under single regulator who would have powers nd independence similar to those of the fhfb hr 1427 passed the house on may 22 2007 s 1100 was referred to the senate committee on banking housing and urban affairs on april 12 2007 the measures have several important differences see crs report rl33940 reforming the regulation of governmentsponsored enterprises in the 110th congress by mark jickling edward v murphy and n eric weiss for additional information the slowdown in housing markets and rise in foreclosures have led to concerns about the health of the fhlbs some large nonmember lenders have affiliates that are members of regional fhlb these affiliates could draw on fhlb resources to move some troubled loans onto system balance sheets this is concern because some believe that the government would not let the fhlb system fail and that such affiliate actions could raise the potential risk and cost to taxpayers possible mergers of fhlbs is another issue fhlb dallas has been in negotiations to merge with fhlb chicago in part because of the financial difficulties of fhlb chicago the potential merger would be the first of its kind and raises several oversight issues including fhfb approval powers and system organization this report will be updated as events warrant httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32815g8g142g141g142g155g138g149g561g10g152g150g142g561g14g152g138g151g561g4g138 g151g148g561g21

to lenders primarily for housing the banks can now lend for many other purposes as well and have special responsibilities for low and moderateincome housing for debts incurred by the federal

patterned on the federal reserve system it comprised 12 regional member owned and federally chartered banks each with its own individual board of directors the system was headed and overseen by the federal home loan bank board fhlbb whose three members were presidential appointees the purpose of the banks was to provide liquidity for the main mortgage lenders of the time the savings and loan associations home mortgage lending was often hamperednever more so than in the 1930sbecause savings associations lacked consistent access to capital markets to replace deposits whenever large numbers of depositors withdrew their money as would happen during periods of high unemployment the banks corrected this by making loans advances to the federally chartered savings associations which banking law required to be members of the banks the banks secured the advances by placing liens on home mortgages held by the lenders assuring the funds were used for housing finance the regional banks also provided regulatory oversight for their thrift members under the guidance of the fhlbb the banking act of 1935 2 added deposit insurance3 for the thrifts to the fhlbb to bolster confidence in housing finance the system remained largely unchanged during the next three decadesthe golden years of the savings and loan industryuntil the 1 47 stat 128 2 49 stat 684 3 the federal savings and loan

mortgage corporation freddie mac as wholly owned subsidiary of the banks to create and maintain secondary market for system members conventional mortgages5 the financial institutions reform recovery and enforcement act of 1989 firrea6 made major changes to the system in response to severe failures in the savings and loan industry it replaced the old fhlbb viewed as defective selfdealing regulatory structure dominated by the institutions it regulated with todays federal housing finance board fhfb the fhfb maintained supervision of the 12 banks but had neither regulatory nor deposit insurance functions over the remaining savings associations which congress delegated to new office of thrift supervision and the federal deposit insurance corporation respectively in addition firrea removed freddie mac from the bank system and reconstituted it as publicly owned stock corporation twin to fannie mae the act also opened membership in the banks to all depository institutions so long as they engaged in significant mortgage lending 7 and set up two requirements for the system setaside of at least 10 of each banks net earnings for low and moderateincome housing programs and repayment of part of the debt incurred in paying off insured depositors for the savings and loans that failed refcorp debt please see the appendix the federal home loan bank system modernization act of 1999 title vi of the grammleach bliley act8 subsequently broadened membership qualifications in the banks by dropping minimum mortgage asset requirements and making membership voluntary for all members including federally chartered savings associations who were the originally mandated members of the system the law also required new permanent capital standards for the banks and expanded the mission by allowing the banks to make advances secured by assets other than housing loansmainly agricultural and small business loan s it also altered and simplified the required obligation of the systems contribution to the old refcorp debt raising the likelihood that payments would be completed sufficient to defease the debt ahead of schedule

determinations by the affected bank banks largely fund their activity through system consolidated obligations publicly traded bonds which are the joint and several liabilities of all the banks and are issued through the office of finance consolidated obligations are neither obligations of nor guaranteed by the united states as with other gses however financial markets infer that the federal government would back these obligations if necessary to prevent default an inference widely referred to as an implied guarantee the banks fund their daytoday operations through earnings on their investments the banks also fund the regulatory operations of the fhfb which collects assessments from the earnings of the banks onbudget but selfsupporting the fhfb is not subject to the congressional appropriations process system assets were 1037 billion as of june 30 2007 10 of which 640 billion comprised advances to members about 70 of members use advances the fhlbs held 94 billion of mortgages in portfolio liabilities totaled 992 billion capital totaled 41 billion system capital is about 4 of assets relatively close to the regulatory minimum yet perhaps half the level required for commercial banking companies much of the debt is shortterm which requires that each year the total rollover of debt be several times system assets system obligations carry tripleagse credit rating

given the system series of special privileges and exemptions to help them in addressing their mission these include 4 billion line of credit with the us treasury for the system as whole11 eligibility of debt for federal reserve open market purchases unlimited investment by commercial banks and thrifts12 and collateralizing public deposits13 priority on collateral claims on member institutions over any and all other creditors the super lien14 the use of federal reserve banks as fiscal agents15 exemption of earnings from federal state and local income tax16 exemption of interest paid to investors from state income tax17 and status of debt issues as government securities for purposes of the securities laws18 the overall effect of these links to the federal government is that investors in system debt issuances might assume the federal government ultimately will treat the banks as agencies and consequently might not require as high return as they would on debt of comparable private sector company the banks do borrow money at rates near to those of comparablematurity treasury issues although bank debt does not carry the fullfaithandcredit backing of the federal government investors generally believe that the federal government which chartered them for their public policy mission would not allow any bank or its obligations to fail the us government came to the assistance of two major gses fannie mae and the farm credit banks system when their obligations threatened to default in the 1980s suggesting that similar remediation might also occur for the fhlb system 19 11 12 usc

purposes of meeting those missions each bank develops its own strategies the first mission is to provide li quidity to members they do this with advances including membercallable and convertible advances letters of credit and acquisition of member assets mortgages and mortgagebacked securities under the fhfb general management policy each bank is limited to holding mortgagebacked securities of more than 300 of capital except for those certificates acquired under the shared funding program an arrangement of the mortgage partnership funding program of the chicago bank and the systems principal acquired member asset program under this small program member of bank may sell eligible mortgage loans anywhere in the system to an institution that is member of the chicago bank the latter member then sells the loans to trust th at issues structured securities to the member for the loans with chicago acquiring the senior securities sales of all the securities are limited to banks or members within the system restriction that limits direct competition with fannie mae or freddie mac the second mission is for housing and community investment under the affordable housing program ahp each bank must give away 10 of net income through its members for low and moderateincome housing 20 under the community investment program cip the banks lend to members at cost to finance loans for moderateincome households and for commercial and economic development in lowand moderateincome neighborhoods the third temporary mission is to repay debts incurred for the deposit insurance losses due to failures of savings and loan associations in the 1980s and their cleanup in the 1990s each bank must pay 20 of net earnings after ahp payments to help repay interest on bonds issued by refcorp

statutory authority is the federal home loan bank act as amended by firrea the board has broad statutory powers over the banks it uses these powers to ensure the safety and soundness of the banks and to see that they carry out their public purpose of providing home 20 the banks donate much of the money in grants to provide equity for lowincome projects the banks often post reports on their ahp

10 2007 when fhlb chicago entered into cons ent degree with the fhfb in response to cease and desist order related to fhlb chicagos riskmanagement policies the 1992 federal housing enterprises financial safety and soundness act emphasized that the fhfbs main concern shall be financial soundness 22 and its oversight in that area has been increasingly strong under varying leadership the board has the power to approve new and existing activities it also approves the banks debt offerings it can limit indirectly other activities through approval of the individual bank budgets the board has broad powers to liquidate and reorganize individual banks within statutory framework that mandates that there be at least eight but not more than 12 banks the board may liquidate or reorganize bank whenever it finds such action will aid the efficient and economical accomplishment of the bank act23 for any liquidation or reorganization another bank may with the approval of the finance board acquire assets of any such liquidated or reorganized bank and assume part or all of the liabilities these supervisory powers for system organization may be tested by proposed merger betwee n fhlb

loans have resulted in losses in the same manner if not scale as fannie mae and freddie mac the banks have in some cases had to restate earnings cut dividends alter their capital structures and change managements as result most problems have related to accounting for derivatives generally used to hedge against interest rate movements that could erode the value of bank holdings of mortgages or liens on member mortgage portfolios and have had little cumulative effect the restatements had delayed some of the banks registrations with the securities and exchange commission sec in 2004 the fhfb required all the banks to register at least one class of equity member stock with the sec thus giving up their charter exemptions from registration as of april 11 2007 each fhlb had submitted its form 10k with the sec on time current combined financial reports for the fhlb system are now made available on the fhfb website because of their cooperative and collective structure sec registration looks somewhat different from that of publicly held companies but triggers the same disclosures as to the risks and financial details of the banks now that the banks have registered under the voluntary procedures they are not permitted to deregister and must file all appropriate disclosures and 22 pl 102550 106 stat 3941 23 bank has ever been liquidated such actions have occurred within the other

penalties for inaccurate or incomplete reporting under the securities laws including the sarbanesoxley act two other issues discussed among policy analysts concern risks attendant to joint and several liability and the super lien the former ensures that the banks will come to each others aid should that be necessary before the federal government would have to step in to take whatever actions it might deem necessary to prevent systemic losses to the banking or housing finance systems joint and several liability is large part of why the banks are usually considered single collective gse rather than collection of separate companies it also however creates some moral hazard in that any one bank may be encouraged to take risks that might have to be paid for in part by other bankseven though other banks may be unaware of any irregularity the super lien allows the banks to step into failed member institution and claim assets to make itself whole before any other creditor including the fdic the banks have not historically had to specify assets used as collateral until after failure leading to the opportunity to cherry pick the best assets remaining in failed member institution and raising the costs to the fdic of resolving failed bank or thrift continuing issue affecting all gses concerns the possibilities of systemic risk that arise from the circumstance of having all bank debt treated by the financial markets as if it were federal agency debt because depository institutions for which the federal government has clear safety responsibility can hold agency debt without regard to limits on loans to single lender the possibility exists that failure of the banks could trigger failures of commercial banks savings associations and credit unions that were overexposed to system debt 24 such failures could in turn adversely affect the fdic and even the federal budget and could have wide repercussions throughout the financial system on december 22 2006 the fhfb adopted new rule to limit the finances of federal home loan banks25 the rule limits the excess stock of member banks to 1 of the banks assets the limit on excess stock also known as voluntary stock is meant to ensure that the banks remain appropriately capitalized retain access to capital markets and preserve safety and soundness because member banks have historically redeemed excess stock on presentation the stock has some of the same characteristics of issuing new debt and raises some of the same issues of the governments implied guarantee and the possibility of systemic risk for the banks while their reach is not as great as fannie mae or freddie mac the implied guarantee presents the same problems as for the other gses because of the market perception that gses are too important for the government to allow any of them to fail the gses have an incentive to take on greater risks or to expand into areas that allow them to grow their businesses at the expense of companies not so favored this not only creates problems of competitiveness but it also creates macroeconomic problem of overallocation of capital market credit into housing markets the allocation intended for housing is problematic in that it is an indirect way to provide shelter not only can part of the implied subsidy be retained by the gses what they pass through can be wasted in the sense that lower prices for mortgages may be lost in higher 24 this concern also affects issuances of fannie mae and freddie mac ofheo determined in 2003 for example that about 2000 commercial banks held fannie mae debt equal to little over half their capital and about 1000 banks had similar amount of capital impaired by freddie mac debt issuances 25 see fr vol 71 249 dec 28 2006 pp 7804678051

difficult for regulators to control the activities of the gses as they grow in size and scope so does the potential systemic threat to financial markets the slowdown in the housing market could negativ ely affect the fhlbs in addition to any delinquent loans that may be in the fhlb system general decline in house prices would reduce the value of the collateral that backs the banks making up the system declining collateral value hurts bank balance sheets even while the loans pe rform estimating the likely effect on the fhlb system is difficult because there has not been national decline in house prices since the system was created although regional house prices have declined refinancing represents another channel through which troubles in mortgage markets could affect the fhlbs large lenders with affiliates that are members of regional fhlb could use the system to access liquidity to refinance troubled loans for example the cost of borrowing funds to finance mortgagebacked securities increased in august 2007 mortgage lending generally decreased as expected however the volume of fhlb advances to its members increased it is possible that these advances are being used to refinance troubled borrowers out of resetting loans and into the fhlb system on the one hand refina nces could help hold down foreclosure rates on the other hand refinances could move loans likely to default from private investors to the fhlb system which some believe has an implicit government guarantee g14g142g144g146g156g149g138g157g146g159g142g561g11g156g156g158g142g156g561 the major issue before congress concerning the fhlb system is gse regulatory reform the proposed replacement of the current system regulator accompanies basic move to restructure and strengthen regulation of fannie mae and freddie mac both hr 1427 and s 1100 would fold the fhfb and the office of federal housing enterprise oversight ofheothe current regulator of fannie mae and freddie macinto single overseer for all three housingrelated gses the federal housing finance reform act of 2007 hr 1427 sponsored by representative frank and others passed the house on may 22 2007 by 313104 the bill would fold the fhfb and ofheo into single regulator for all three housingrelated gses to be known as the federal housing finance agency in the senate the federal housing enterprise regulatory act of 2007 s 1100 sponsored by senator hagel and others also sets up new single regulator s 1100 was referred to the senate banking committee on april 12 2007 but further action has been taken as of the date of this writing 27 the major reason behind such legislation is the widely understood weakness in the powers and authorities granted to ofheo by congress legislation would grant greater power and independence to the new regulator than to ofheo while nearly matching the authority and independence of the current fhfb unlike the cu rrent fhfb board however the new regulator 26 congressional budget office federal
