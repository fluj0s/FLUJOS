private advocacy groups and tax analysts preeminent among the proposals is the replacement of the current income tax with some form of consumption tax much of the discussion of the merits of consumption taxes relative to income taxes is centered on the kinds of incentives and efficien cies that the two kinds of taxes exhibit in the long run increasingly however anal ysts have begun to explore the transition shortrun effects associated with shifting from an income tax to consumption tax some of these transition effects are common to all consumption tax proposals for example shift to any consumption ta x would involve some sectoral dislocation the most important of which would be shift of resources out of housing and into other sectors all consumption tax proposals impose one time tax on existing capital as well in all likelihood sh ift to consumption taxes would entail temporary rise and then decrease in interest rates potentially more serious transition pr oblems occur when taxes are imposed in their indirect form retail sales tax or valueadded tax the shift from direct tax imposed largely on individual wageearne rs to an indirect tax imposed on businesses could cause significant ec onomic contraction if wages are sticky downwards as most economists believe to be the case because many firms would not have enough resources to pay the taxes in this case onetime price increase in the neighborhood of 20 to 25 percent woul d be required to allow firms to pass the tax on to consumers and avoid serious recession the money supply would need to rise by similar or perhaps even larger amount our ability to formulate an appropriate m onetary response to deal with shock of this magnitude is questionable not only are there consider able uncertainties about the empirical magnitudes of crucial relationships needed to guide the monetary adjustment even uncertaintie s about the definition of money but there are also direct effects of the tax change on variables such as interest rates that are normally used to guide monetary policy the magnitude of these interest rate effects is uncertain transitory rise in frictional unemployment due to sectoral shifts would also be likely in addition actions taken in anticipation of the tax change could cause temporary effects on aggregate mand and the interest rate these problems would be greatly diminished in the case of the flat tax which is imposed as direct tax even in this case there would be shortrun unemployment costs associated with sectoral dislocati ons but the shock woul d be less severe than in the case of the retail sales tax or valueadded tax however the price rise that would be needed to avert contraction is also the mechanism that causes the lump sum tax on old capital to be shared by bt as well as equity without the price increase the lump sum tax would fall onl on equity capital and could impose tax burdens that are larger than net asset values in cases where assets are heavily leveraged

lawmakers private advocacy groups and tax analysts preeminent among the proposals is the replacement of the current income tax with some form of consumption tax much of the discussion of the merits of cons umption taxes relative to income taxes is centered on the kinds of incentives and efficien cies that the two kinds of taxes exhibit in the long run increasingly however anal ysts have begun to explore the transition effects associated with shifting from an income tax to consumption tax the transition effects differ from longterm effects in that they are temporary and in that some effects occur only when switch from one type of tax to another occurs consequently the decisi on to institute consumption tax novo is somewhat different from decision to replace an income with consumption tax for an emerging economy in eastern europe or asia looking to impose an entirely new tax some of these transition issues would not exist consequently the merits of consumption tax relative to an income tax could be decided to greater degree on the basis of their comparative effi ciency equity simplicity and other characteristics for count ry that already has an income tax the decision to substitute consumption tax must take into account any additional costs associated with the changeover itself and these temporary transition costs might well offset any other advantages of change hence it is possible for consumption tax simultaneously to be superior to an income tax for countries imposing the tax for the first time but economically undesirable for country that already has in place an income tax many economists who judge consumption ta x to be superior to an income tax are in fact skeptical about the advisability of making the change because of these transition effects some of these transition effects have been dealt with in considerable detail such as the burden that falls on existing capital assets and the various sectoral shifts in demand suc h as the reduction in demand for owner occupied housing that might affect asse t prices in the short run despite the extensive analysis of the economic effect s of fundamental ta x reform however little attention has been devoted to potential shor trun contractionary effects particularly of proposals that would shift the liability for tax payments from individuals to businesses the consequences of these shortrun eff ects are

some evid ence although many of these countries were replacing existing indirect taxes with vat moreover some of these countries used price controls an appro ach that the us government might be reluctant to undertake5 researchers examining the response to shift in the share of indirect taxes in the uk and the u s found some evidence that it was followed by both higher prices and reductions in output6 the first section of this paper describe s the basic types of tax proposals and how they vary in collection source which is crucial to assessing the need for price increase the second section describes the r eaction of interest ra tes and some of the sectoral effects eg out of owneroccupied housing that would be expected to occur when consumption tax is substituted for an income tax the third section describes the potential macroeconomic effect of sw itch to consumption taxes with emphasis on the effects on the overall price level the next section explains how monetary accommodation in theory at least can prevent the shift to certain types of consumption taxes from causing shortrun decline in economic activity the following section outlines the problems that would arise in actually making the such monetary adjustment the final secti on examines the distributional consequences of not experiencing an accommodated price increase ie how either having general price increase or not affect s the distribution of the tax burden types of consumption tax proposals several different types of fundamental consumption taxes have been proposed but one difference is crucial for consider ing macroeconomic effects whether taxes are collected from businesses or individuals that is whether they are largely indirect or direct type of consumption tax familiar to most people is retail sales tax rst tax commonly used by the states goods sold for final use to consumers are subject to tax in this case the liability for the tax is imposed on the business establishment that makes the final sale an alternative to the retail sales tax and tax used by many other countries is the valueadded tax vat vat is the economic equivalent of the rst assuming both are administered correctly but the tax is collected at each stage of production when all of the taxes on good are added up they are the same as the onestage tax paid under the rst under vat tax is imposed on the differencehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98901crs4 7 this method is used for subtractionmet hod vat most other countries actually use credit method where each firm pays tax on its total sales but takes credit for taxes paid by its suppliers the distinction between credit and subtraction method does not matter for the issues addressed in this paperbetween business sales and purchases busine ss adds up all of its sales and subtracts purchases of materials inventory and assets but not wages the resulting base is subject to tax7 one difference between these taxes that is not important in an economic sense but that is very confusing is how the tax rate is stated retail sales taxes are often stated as taxexclusive rates while subt raction method vats are often stated in tax inclusive rates the difference is simple if good costs 100 20 taxinclusive rate collects 20 however typical sales tax rate would be 25 merchandise that costs 80 is subjected to 25percent tax of 20 for total price of 100 it also means that if prices are to rise to cove r tax they would have to rise by 25 it is also possible to split the vat into two parts and collect them at different places resulting in tax called the flat tax the vat base is composed of two parts wages and other labor comp ensation and business cash fl ow the difference between profits and investments in capital the flat tax allows the firm to deduct wages from its base individual recipients of wage s pay tax on their wage income this converts the vat to mostly direct tax s imilar to the current income tax in its point of collection all of these taxes are equivalent in economic terms and all result in change in the relative attractiveness of different types of investment all are consumption taxes that impose tax on the return to new capital investment because in all cases investments are deducted from the tax base as in the vat and flat tax or are not subject to tax at all as in the rst consumption taxes are taxes on wages and old capital that is when consumption purchas are made with wage income or when capital assets are sold to finance consump tion tax is imposed basically the real purchasing power of capital assets is reduced in all of these taxes imposing fixed tax on old capital although as discussed subs equently the distribution of that lump sum tax among owners of capital is not necessarily the same new capital investments are effectively exempt because they are deducted or excluded from the consumption base when made eliminating the tax on investment also eliminates differentials in the tax treatment of different type s and forms of investment which can lead to important behavioral effects all three of these pproaches also have the common characteristic of not imposing taxes on flows of financia l capital thus there is taxation of dividends interest and capital gains on corporate stock at the individual level also unlike the treatment under the present income tax interest paid by firms is not deductible sales of business assets are subject to tax but this is not strictly capital gains tax since the entire sales price of the asset is included in income it is also possible however to have direct consum ption tax that includes financial flows loans would be included in income and ductions would be allowed for financial investments the usa tax originally proposed by nators nunn and domenicihttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98901crs5 8 the flat tax does disallow business deducti on of some fringe benefits most importantly health insurance which shifts some of the burde n of the tax on wages to firms so that there would probably be need for some price or wage adjustment firms will also differ in other ways the size of the cash flow tax versus the existing income tax reflects offsetting tax savings lower rates and expensing of invest ments and increases loss of deductions for interest and depreciation on existing assets firms that rely heavily on debt and are growing slowly have lower rates of new invest ment would pay higher taxes while faster growing firms that rely heavily on equity would have lower taxes 9see martin feldstein the effect of consum ption tax on the rate of interest national bureau of economic research working paper 5397 december 1995 this paper makes case that the interest rate will rise largely on grounds of comparing debt and equity returns see robert hall potential disrupti on from the move to consumption tax american economic review vol 87 may 1997 pp 147150 for case that interest rates will fall continuedwas of that general form although it had many modifications from the pure consumption base these taxes differ in variety of ways for example it is quite easy using the flat tax approach to allo w progressivity at the indi vidual level by allowing an exemption it would also be easy to gradua the wage tax rates these adjustments are more difficult and complicated with the vat and rst the ability to enforce tax is probably greater with the vat and the flat tax than in the case of the rst for variety of reasons an important difference between these types of proposals for the purposes of analyzing macroeconomic effects is the location of the tax and the changes in prices and wages that need to occur to permit th payment of the tax without output losses the rst shifts the entire legal burden of the tax to retail establishments and sales tax is often much larger than the firms existing profit margins in order to have the funds to pay the tax product prices must ri andor input prices both to business suppliers and to workers must fall if input prices to retailers fall then each intermediate supplier in the economy must so be able to reduce his own wages and supply prices hence all of the wages in the economy must fall by the tax rate if the tax is to be passed back proportionally to labor nd business net cash flow the vat shifts the legal burden to all businesses in accordance with their value added these firms must either pass the ta x forward in higher prices for output or backwards in lower supply pri ces the flat tax imposes cash flow tax that has base that is similar to the current income tax so there is not an enormous shift in tax liability most firms could probably continue to pay the tax without altering wage rates or prices very much8 sectoral effects and demandside shifts shift from income to consumption ta xes would produce sectoral and long term economywide changes these have b een addressed in number of other papers and reports9 there are several however that have relevance to the shorttermhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98901crs6 9continued largely on the grounds of increased savings response alan j auerbach tax reform capital allocation effici ency and growth in the

other proposals effects on housing congressional research service report 96379 library of congress april 29 1996 indicates that interest rates could also be affected by mismeasurement of income and deductions 10modeling the debtequity decision is not st raightforward see jane g gravelle the flat tax and other proposals effects on housing for mathematical model which includes an allocation of demand by firms nd supply by individuals macroeconomic effects that are discussed later in the report these changes would directly alter output and pri ces including interest rates interest rates as discussed subsequently direct effect s of tax changes on interest rates will complicate the task of the monetary authorities who rely on the interest rate as signal interest rates have the potential to change because of savings responses portfolio shifts and effects arising from the imperfect measurement of income under the current system they may also be influenced by expectations during the legislative consideration of the tax switch expectations are discussed subsequently this discussion refers to the direct and permanent effects of the tax substitution to illustrate these effects consider first simple world where all capital is financed by debt where all income and ductions are measured correctly and where the capital stock and the savings rate is fixed in that case moving to consumption tax would not affect the interest rate although firms are taxed on profits under an income tax they are also allowed deductibility of interest so there is tax on debtfinanced capital at the firm level thus firms have change in their demand for capital and if individuals do not increase their savings there will be change in the interest rate in fact however both debt and equity finance investment under the current income tax system equityfinanced investment is taxed more heavily than investment that is debt financed consequently shift to consumption tax which eliminates this disparity in the taxation of debt vers us equity financing should induce portfolio shift toward more equity financing holding the capital stock and therefore the average pretax return to capital fixed this switch to equity will likely be accompanied by fall in the beforetax cost of equity and rise in the cost of debt the interest rate10 at the same time the amount of interest or dividends that an individual keeps after taxes rises with shift away from income taxes if individuals increase their savings as consequence this effect alone absent portfolio shift causes interest rates to fallhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98901crs7 11at moderate inflation rates the overstat ement of income due to failure to index depreciation is approximately offset by accelerated depreciation methods rise in the inflation rate increases both the size of th interest deduction and the understatement of depreciation but the former effect is larger hence there is always subsidy and it is larger the higher the rate of inflationanother important complication however is the fact that income and expense is not measured correctly under the current tax system the most important aspect of this mismeasurement is that nominal interest which includes an inflation component is deducted from in come while only the real return to capital roughly is taxed11 as result rather than tax on bt financed earnings at the firm level there is currently subsidy when shift is made to consumption taxation this subsidy is lost which means that the cost of debt goes up therefore when this measurement effect is taken into account hol ding other effects c onstant the interest rate has to fall to keep the overall cost of capital the same it is difficult to project the effects on interest rates from the combination of portfolio and saving effect s particularly given uncer tainty about the response of saving and the substitutability of debt and equity but the effect that results from the mismeasurement of income under the current income tax system is unambiguous and likely of greater magnitude than the first two the interest rate would have to fall to allow firms to break even on new inve stment the effect would obviously vary depending on the level of expected inflation with tax rate of 35 and an inflation rate close of 3 the subsidy is approx imately one percentage point 035 times 03 thus an interest rate fall of 1 would result from the shift to consumption tax effects on the composition of output second major effect of the adoption of consumption tax would be reallocation of resources the sector most likely to be strongly affected in this regard is owneroccupied housing which is likely to be singlefa mily under the current income tax investment in ownerocc upied housing is favored over business investment because the rental value of hous ing is not included in income shift to consumption tax by ending this pref erence would be expected to reduce the demand for owneroccupied housing whic h could cause unemployment in the construction industry and in industries that supply that activity these contractions would occur more quickly than demand might be restored through the accompanying increase in business investment it is difficult to estimate the magnitude of that demand shift but the dri simulations referred to earlier showed sign ificant declines in housing construction even in the case of the flat tax wher the overall negative effects on the economy were relatively small these contractions were in the 12 to 16 range initially for the flat tax there are other activities that would be depressed or stimulated by consumption tax although none is probably so important as the shift out of housing construction activities that might be depressed poten tially include health care whose favorable treatment would be re duced by the loss of tax subsidies tohttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98901crs8 insurance state and local construction w hich would lose the advantage of tax exempt interest activities carried out by nonprofits that rely on charitable contributions and business activities of firms that tend to be heavily leveraged or growing more slowly the transmission r outes for financial funds would also be affected as pensions and insurance companies lose their tax favoritism shortrun macroeconomic effects typically one would not expect the substitution of one tax for another to have significant macroeconomic effect if the change were revenue neutral this is because the fiscal effect of imposing tax is offset by the fiscal effect of removing an identical amount of taxes there coul d be contraction in demand likely to be slight if tax substitution increases the private savings rate which could occur with shift to consumption tax however this point is set aside in the following discussion because such shift is uncertain in direction and likely to be modest shortrun demandside effects on the demand side of the economy the imposition of tax affects output employment and prices because of its effect on the governments deficit and the balance between investment and saving when taxes are increased the governments borrowing requirements are reduced tota l saving in the economy ie output that is not consumed which includes government saving is freed up to be invested ie devoted to the future initially because there is less demand for goods and services output tends to decline and the increase in availability of resources for investment tends to push inte rest rates down but in the case of substituting tax for another tax total demand is typically not affected there is effect on the governme nts deficit the tax saving freed up by collecting more in consumption taxes is offset by the reduction in income tax collections disposable income is unchang ed there is change in the demand for consumption and the savings and investme nt balance is unaffected viewed from the demand side alone change in output employment or inte rest rates would be expected but in addition to the fiscal effects of the governments budget demand is also influenced by any monetary effects induced by the tax change monetary effects concern the supply and demand for exchange media ie the currency deposits and other financial instruments that are used to engage in transactions tax change typically does not influence the underlying demand for or supply of exchange media money neither the governments provi sion of money or the publics demand for it changes due to tax shift conseque ntly one does not ordi narily expect tax reform even if it is not revenue neut ral to have moneta ry effects on demand the need for transactions media in the economy however may be somewhat more complex than is often believed in general it is assumed that all other things equal an increase in income leads to proportionate increase in the demand for money regardless of the form that income takes but some analysts have suggestedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98901crs9 12n gregory mankiw and lawrence h summe rs money demand and the effects of fiscal policies journal of money credit and banking vol 18 november 1986 pp 415429 daniel r feenberg andrew w mitrusi and james m poterba distributional effects of adopting national retail sales tax tax policy and the economy vol 11 edited by james m poterba national bureau of economic research cambridge ma mit press 1997that different components of gross domes tic product generate di fferent transactions patterns in particular it has been suggested that the government may not have the same need for money balances in its reve nue and expenditure transactions as the private sector does in consum ption and investment outlays12 switch to consumption tax from an income tax does not involve larger volume of government outlays or receipts but it may depending on the type of consumption tax affect the amount of mone needed for transactions because of change in the manner in which the tax is collected when income taxes are collected primarily by means of withholding th receipts are remitted quickly to the government without ever having to pass into the hands of consumers in the case of consumption taxes such as the vat and rst the amount of the tax is present in the price of goods rather than being absent from paychecks hence the public may need greater cash balances to pay consumption tax than an income tax of equal value it is not at all clear whether the means by which the tax is collected really influences money demand or if it does by how much if there is such an effect it would be contractionary that is the switch to consumption tax would tend to increase the demand for money which if not forthcoming from the monetary authorities would tend to dr ive up interest rates and press economic activity and raise unemployment in the short run shortrun supplyside effects at worst the demand side of the macroeconomic equation might react to the switch to consumption taxes with reduc tion in demand dependi ng on the relative requirements for money to pay taxes through withholding or by consumers at best there is adverse reaction at all the supply side of the m acroeconomic equation is another matter it is here that analysis indicates that switch from income to certain types of consumpti on taxes would have signifi cant macroeconomic effects under either vat or rst firms have tendency to increase their prices by the amount of the tax in the case of the vat this occurs at each stage of production as the tax in the amount of percentage of value added is passed on in the case of the rst the price increase represents the tax imposed at final sale of course in the case of both these taxes the elimination of the income tax creates some offset to input costs that th firms pay however there is good reason to expect that the principal input cost wages and salaries would not immediately decline in response to the tax subs tituti on in addition other input costs may be resistant to downward revision as wellhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98901crs10 briefly when the income tax is elimin ated workers should be willing to work for lower pretax wage this is because the difference between aftertax and pretax income is eliminated under vat or rst the wage worker gets after taxes is the wage the firm pays tax is taken out of it if the firm lowered its wages and salaries by the amount of the income ta x removed the worker would still get the same income but wages and salaries are set by both formal and informal agreements these agreements many of which are set in contracts are not easily changed in many if not most instances firm will unlikely be able to get its employees to accept lower wages and salaries even if potentially th ey are worse off after the reduction in addition the prices of intermediate goods reflect the wages and salaries that producers pay their employees these prices are also subject to agreements and contracts even if firm is able to redu ce its cost of labor by persuading workers to reduce their pretax wage by the amount of the tax it may still attempt to hold the line on the prices it charges for its output where these prices are set in legally binding contracts an array of contracts agreements and understandings underpins virtually all commercial activity many of the provisions of these agreements are unspoken and unspecified all are geared to the specific circumstances of normal trade and do not contain provisions for all contin gencies change in conditions as significant as the switch from income to consumption taxes is not envisioned in existing trade relationships some agreements may be renegotiated some vendors will attempt to hold fast to the prices set in their contracts in general however the incentive for workers and sellers of interm ediate goods to accept lower wages and prices is weak even without contracts or other agreements that make it difficult to renegotiate prices workers and suppliers may be reluct ant to accept cut in wages and prices if they have reason to think that other workers and suppliers will not for if firms cannot pay less to their suppliers they will attempt to charge more for their output higher aftertax wages will be needed to pay the higher prices it only makes sense to accept lower wage if everyone else does too in short the possibility that wages and prices are sticky makes the probability of stickiness greater because the consumption tax might be pa ssed through in prices it ma kes sense for suppliers and workers not to accept lower wages and prices they may need that income to pay the higher prices that may result from others refusing to accept wage and price cuts the existence of sticky wages and pr ices thus has implications for the economys supplyside response to the vat or rst if the firms cannot lower wages and input prices in the short run they must either raise their prices by the amount of the tax or reduce their output in shor t the aggregate supply of output in the economy goes down producers require high er price for any given level of output or conversely they are willing to produ ce less output for any given price level interaction with demand results in both higher prices and lower output in short the removal of the income tax does not create an offsetting effect because wages are set in pretax terms the limination of the income tax would increase the workers aftertax income so that they could take pretax wage cuthttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98901crs11 13curiously feenburg mitrusi and poterba poi nt out the potential demand effect of the differing need for cash balances but get the im plications for monetary policy reversed they argue that if greater balances are needed to pay the rst or vat it could help offset the contractionary effects of the supply reaction in fact because the demand effect would be to increase money demand and depress economic activity even more monetary stimulus would be needed to maintain the economy at full employment 14this is not an inflationunemployment tradeoff or phillips curve nothing in this analysis implies any kind of permanent tr adeoff between prices and economic activitywithout being made worse off but the ex istence of contracts implicit agreements and traditions would cause any such cut to come slowly yielding shortterm contraction in output if wages and prices were flexible in the short run then the decrease in aggregate supply in the ec onomy would not occur however the evidence of shortrun stickiness is overwhelming the role of monetary accommodation the previous analysis i ndicates that the reduction in supply caused by the imposition of vat or rst unambiguously causes output to decline and prices to rise in the short run there may also be demand effect if more cash balances are needed to remit sales or vat taxes than to remit incomes taxes this demand effect if it occurs would reinforce the output decline but tends to offset slightly the price effects13 thus whether by itself or in combination with demand effect the supply effect of substituting vat or rst for an income tax tends to depress economic activity in the short run see the appendix for mathematical treatment of these issues the story is not complete however wit hout including the effects of monetary policy if monetary policy is aimed at keeping output from falling below capacity then the monetary authorities can be exp ected to expand the money supply to keep output and employment from falling they would lower interest rates to encourage investment and increase aggregate demand to restore capacity output and full employment if they did so they would also drive up the price level essentially the monetary authorities validate the higher prices that firms try to impose making it possible for consumers to buy the firms output at higher prices if the onetime price increase were not accommodated the result would be money supply too small for full employment the price increase purchases quicker and less painful return to capacity14 note that the price effects from the monetary policy are the same regardless of which hypothesis is true about the relative need for cash balances for paying taxes under the two different system s but the monetary expansion required to maintain full employment would differ if the authorities did not accommodate the s upply shift with more expansionary monetary policy the econom would experience recession after period of adjustment the economy will return to full employment and capacity outputhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98901crs12 15indeed if money demand does change in response to the tax switch an unaccommodated substitution would result in lower price level af ter all the contractionary effects work their way through the economy 16these effects could in theory be greatly moderated by slow phasein of the tax substitution to allow time for adjustment even in this case behavioral responses in anticipation of the change could be disruptive to the economy 17the flat tax could cause contractionary effect s because fringe benefits are taxed at the firm level in addition there could be ffects from sectoral demand shiftswithout price increase15 however the magnitude of the tax shift involved indicates that the macroeconomic disruption would be severe single shift in the supply of output by the economy equivalent to 20 or 25 increase in prices in single year or less would be an economic shock outside of c ontemporary experience in short the analysis concludes that the switch to vat or rst will result in recession unless offset by monetary polic the only way this would not be the case is under the implausible assumption that wages and prices are flexible in the short run16 the conclusion is unaltered even if it is untrue that greater cash balances are needed to pay consumption tax than an income tax the result does not ensue from all consumptiontype ta xes it does not occur for example in the case of flat tax when taxes are collected directly from wage earners17 if accommodated by expansionary policy the result will be higher price level this would be only one time increase in prices however and not the continuously rising vel that constitutes inflation the challenge in adjusting the money supply typically discussions of the shortrun stabilization problems posed by an rst or vat are dealt with simply by pointing out the above the unemployment and output effects could be avoided by an ppropriate monetary po licy and the price effect would be onetime only not an inflation that continues year after year unfortunately the theoretical ability to implement such monetary program is not the same as formulating one in practice normal uncertainties bese tting monetary policy the basic principle of monetary manageme nt is to maintain supply of money consonant with the demand for money th at occurs when an economy is fully employed more money than this woul d overheat the economy and drive up prices less money would tend to push up interest rates and depre ss economic activity however the demand for money is on ly imperfectly known the central bank controls only part of the money supply th definition of money itself is in question and one knows with certainty what full em ployment really is these problems are compounded by the fact that long and vari able lags intervene between the time the monetary authorities undertake an action nd when output and prices respond to ithttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98901crs13 the federal reserve conducts its policy largely by means of series of cautious adjustments as an operating target it uses shortterm interest rates specifically it uses the federal funds rate which is the rate at which banks lend reserves to each other over period of six weeks betw een meetings of the federal open market committee fmoc the fed buys and sells treasury securities in quantities sufficient to keep the federal funds rate close to the determined target at each fomc meeting the interest rate target is reevaluated in terms of the level of economic activity the fed is trying to achieve the target itself is based on what the fed has learned through experience will m ove the economy in the direction of full employment the output level believed to be consistent with stable inflation rate the level of full employment is based on previous experience but rate of unemployment that yielded accelerating inflation in the previous business cycle may yield decelerating inflation in the current cycle heavily dependent on the underlying frictions in the economy the unemployment rate associated with stable inflation changes over time and can never be known w ith certainty similarly the interest rate that will yield given economic growth rate changes within business cycle early in an expansion when optimism is still tentative there is relatively less demand for loans and interest rates must be very low to stimulate more borrowing and investment near the top of business cycle when business managers consumers and investors are sanguine borrowing is h eavy and rates tend to rise consequently the interest rate that yields only 2 growth rate in the early stages of the expansion and therefore is too low to bring th economy to full employment may bring 5 growth when the economy is fully employed and therefore dangerously overheat the economy because of the lags in reaction to policy changes it is difficult to adjust incrementally to the goal of full employme nt if decrease in interest rates boosts output the authorities may not know until 4 to 9 months down the road if in the meantime they have grown impa tient with the lack of reac tion and have added further stimulus the result can be too much expans ion the reaction of prices to monetary stimulus may take up to two years if the authorities embark on policy of expanding the economy until price pressures emerge with the intention of cutting back at that point their cutback will come too late inflation will already be under way and to arrest the increase they will have to do more than just end the stimulus they will have to contract as result the fed must act preemptivel with respect to inflation but it must base its preemptive moves on the levels of interest rates and unemployment that yielded stable inflation in the past levels that may have changed in the meantime consequently monetary polic will be most successful in times of relative stability when full employment remains the same from cycle to cycle when interest rates induce the same type of behavior in one cy cle as they did at the same stage of the previous cycle and when the economy is not subject to significant outside shocks the authorities are more likely to be able to make the right moves and gradually adjust to level of output c onsistent with stable inflati on consequently big discrete changes in economic relationships create big problems for the monetary authoritieshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98901crs14 18m1 is the sum of currency demand deposits travelers checks and other checkable deposits m2 is m1 plus money market mutu funds savings deposits including money market deposit accounts and small time depositsadditional uncertainties po sed by consumption tax shift from income to consumption tax if the latter takes the form of vat or rst would imply very large shock to the system to be accommodated with monetary policy 20 increase in prices to be accommodated is beyond the size of any supply shock the fed has ever had to deal with it would set in motion changes that would also alter all the relationships that the fed depends on in formulating its policies including the level of full employment and the level of interest rates associated with stable inflation presumably 20 increase in prices overall would require 20 increase in the money supply with larger required increase in money supply if there are demandside effects as well however the money supply has been an increasingly difficult target to deal with in the last decade the fed longer uses it in policy making first of all the relationship between bank reserv which is what the fed actually has control over and the mone supply has been changing and is not currently stable or predictable in add ition there are different measures of money and at various times in the business cycle these different measures send contradictory signals if for example m1 were increased by given amount m2 would change by some other amount perhaps even shrink18 consequently baseline money growth can be established as benchmark to increase by 20 and unless one knows how much the money suppl should increase or decrease in the absence of the tax switch one cannot know to what levels to change it as explained earlier the fed currently uses an interest rate as its operating target in normal circumstances it may be possible to continue using it in incremental steps to keep the economy on trac k but nothing in the experience of the fed could provide the information necessary to know how much the rate would have to change to fully offset the contractiona ry effects of shift to consumption tax even incremental changes in interest rates would take on different characteristics due to the changes in interest rates engendered by the tax switch thus uncertainties regarding the magnitude of the effect of tax switch on the interest rate further complicate the problems of the monetary authorities for example even if the fed decided to accommodate the pr ice increases resulting from the tax substitution monetary expansion might fall well short of what was needed as the monetary authorities mistake fall in interest rates as sign that they have loosened when in fact the interest rate d ecline is simply the consequence of change in the tax treatment of debt finance in that case their actions could worsen contraction interestingly because of the use of interest rates as an operating target for the fed even shift to the flat tax might set in motion certain macroeconomic dislocations although the flat tax does not create the kind of supplyside and price effects characteristic of the rst and vat its effect on interest rates could send veryhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98901crs15 misleading signals to the monetary author ities who might contract the money supply in reaction to the fall in in terest rates thereby induc ing downturn in the economy the interest rate effects would not be the only problem created by the tax switch for monetary policy as explained interest rates are adjusted in order to achieve level of output associated with sustainabl inflation ie full employment the fed must base its notion of full employment and sustainable growth on past experience yet one of the effects of shift to consumption tax would be reallocation of economic activity and such realloca tion would tend to decrease potential output for period of time the reason is straightforward there ar always some resources in an economy that are unemployed because of frictions disruptions shift demand away from some industries creating unemplo yment there while new demands elsewhere create vacancies and input shortages but vacan cies and the unemployed are not always good match price signals take some time to direct inputs to where they are needed frictional unemployment therefore represents the continuing balance between the tendency of incentives to direct unemployed resources to where they are needed and the changes in tastes and technology that create those unemployed resources in the first place in periods of volatile sect oral shifts frictional unemployment can be expected to increase the sectoral shifts described earlier in the report would be significant and potentially large enough to cause temporary fall or slowdown in growth in potential output the relative fall in potential output would further complicate the feds task while it is possible to use monetary policy to ameliorate the contractionary effects of the tax switch that were described earlier monetary policy cannot reduce frictional unemployment consequently the fed w ould not only have to deal with the problems associated with shifts its operating target but also with change in its mediumterm output goal timing difficulties pose d by consumption tax ignoring the obvious difficulties associated with determining the magnitudes of the changes needed to offset the contractionary effects of tax switch the timing of monetary accommodation would be crucial the price and output effects associated with switch in tax regimes would not commence immediately and fully with the implementation of the new tax the anticipation of vat or rst would be expected to generate changes in economic behavior immediatel upon passage indeed as passage becomes likely with an impending vat or rst consumer s would make major purchases before the tax is imposed if vat is anticipated firms would begin accumulating inventory to reduce the tax on their inputs both effects would tend to significantly boost demand it is unclear whether the author ities would want to be gin anticipating the price increase with accommodation or woul d try to moderate the demand increase with contractionary policy until the tax is actually imposed and looser policy is needed the timing required for the latter is beyond the capabilities of the systemhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98901crs16 19the shortrun macroeconomic effects however are only part of the transition other advantages and disadvantages are not dealt with here for example the flat tax more easily incorporates relief for lowerincome indivi duals and the more indirect forms of the consumption tax reduce the number of taxpayers permitting economies in the collection processin addition the expectation of pri ce increase would affect capital markets since the price increase even if it is onetime surge would be expected short term interest rates would reflect the ex pectation thus before the switch to consumption tax could have its permanent effect of lowering interest rates it likely would have the temporary effect of raising them further confusing the signal that the fed gets with respect to interest rates finally it is not clear that single increase in the price level really can be accommodated cleanly without affecting future price increases in general there is reason to believe that onetime price increase due to the new tax if fully underst ood would engender expectations of additional price increases this is especially true if due allowance is made to avoid doublecompensation through escalator clauses but the formation of expectations is imperfectly understood in general they are believed to pend at least partly on experience in all likelihood whether the public expect s price increase to continue would depend on whether inflation has been recent problem if the economy has been experiencing inflation to significant degree it is more likely that the public would take any significant upsurge in prices as signal that more increases would follow in this respect the current favorable inflation environment makes it more likely that the price increase caused by the tax sw itch would not generate significant expectations of more price increases that it would truly be onetime price surge with inflation soon resuming its low path nonetheless the pros pect for an increase in inflation expectations and all the economic effects that such an increase sets in motion would create whole new set of concerns for the fed distributional consequences of price accommodation the contractionary effects of the shift to vat or rst could be huge if not dealt with they could result in adve rse employment and output effects not experienced in the post war period howeve r the practical problems associated with offsetting them with appropriate monetary policy are formidable the adjustments that would be required of the monetary authorities are outside of any recent experience it is virtually certain that the monetary response would prove either significantly inade quate or overdone in terms of shortrun macroeconomic stability transition would be easier with the flat tax version of the consumption ta x than approaches such as the vat and rst19 but the issue of prices and pri ce accommodation is intimately tied up with another important issue that of the incidence of the tax without price accommodation all of the lumpsum tax on assets would fall on equity capital httpwikileaksorgwikicrs98901crs17 20in the case of corporate investment this sset price effect would be reflected in stock market prices 20 tax woul d be expected to cause stock market values to fall by 20 if firm has debt if firm has debt equal to third of total assets the stock market would be expected to fall by 30 if the firm has debt equal to half of assets the stock market would be expected to fall by 40 see jane g gravelle the flat tax and other proposals who will bear the tax burden congressional research service report 95 1141 library of congress washi ngton dc november 29 1995as explained consumption tax is equi valent to tax on wage and old capital but depending on the price effects so forms of capital would bear greater burden than others the increase in prices that results from an accommodated rst or vat would be the route through whic h the tax would be imposed on bonds and other forms of wealth denominated in fi xed dollar amounts by means of decrease in their real value via inflation if price increase occurred bonds bank accounts and other similar financ ial instruments would bear none of the tax indeed the fall in interest rates would increase the value of bonds the tax on old wealth would tend to fall on equity and especia lly hard on leveraged equity for individuals with highly leveraged i nvestments the tax could be larger than the actual net value of the asset consider for example the consequences of the flat tax and the case of an unincorporated business for illustration suppose an individual has rental building with market value of 100000 90000 mortgage and an undepreciated basis of 95000 unde r the current income tax when the building is sold the individual pays capitalgains tax on the difference between the sales price of 100000 and the basis or on 5000 suppose this tax is 20 the individual has 1000 tax which can easily be paid out of his net sales proceeds after paying off debt under the flat tax however the entire sa price would be subject to tax so that individual would have tax liability of 20000 he s borne the to tal asset tax burden on his equity share and actually does not have enough cash from the sale to repay the mortgage while the mortgage holde r has escaped tax thus in the absence of an accommodated price increase the tax on old assets would be borne entirely by the equity owner in the case of corporate assets this effect would be transmitted to stock market values where at least in theo ry virtually all of the value of stock might be lost for some heavily leveraged firms20 suppose instead that prices had been increased to accommodate the tax as would likely be the case under vat 25 tax exclusive rate is equal to 20 tax inclusive rate in this case all pri ces in the economy including asset prices would rise by 25 so the price of th building would be 125000 and the tax would be 25000 in that case the individual w ould realize net of 35000 from the sale after repaying the 90000 loan after paying the tax he would have 10000 however the purchasing power of this 10000 in consumption goods is only 8000 given the new higher prices so the equity holder would bear the asset tax only on his share the owner of the debt claim so would lose 20 in purchasing power this mechanism is slightly different for retail sales tax where there is price rise for capital goods and tax imposed on th sale of capital asset in this case the individual has 10000 in proceeds from the sale after paying the mortgage offhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98901crs18 but the purchasing power of this amount in consumer goods is only 8000 similarly the mortgage holder has lost purchasing power the same real effects occur as in the case of the vat this problem with the flat taxs asset tax falling only on equity claims would not arise in consumption tax that included fi nancial as well as phy sical investments as in the usa tax in that case the 100000 would be included in income but the 90000 mortgage repayment would be ductible to the building owner and includable in the income of the recipient again the tax would be shared by equity and debt holders the problem with in cluding financial investments in the consumption tax base however is that it would greatly complicate the tax calculations causing each individual taxpayer to have to keep balance sheet that accounts for assets and liab ilities and their changes price accommodation has some other potentially important distributional consequences without price accommodati on none of the tax burden would fall on transfer payments while transfer payments would be unaffected by the tax with price accommodation only if they were indexed to the price level some economists have suggested that asset price effects in the shift to consumption taxes could be re lieved by allowing recovery of basis and by allowing firms to continue to depreciate assets there are limitations to this approach first such relief would be costly in revenue and require much hi gher rates in addition it would be imperfect because depreciati on would only allow the present value of depreciation to be recove red which would burden firm s with longlived assets relative to firms with shortlived assets secondly it is the lumpsum tax on old assets that is responsible for much of the savings response to consumption tax in the short run the entire asset tax could be liminated by shifting to wage tax rather than consumption tax but such shift would require mu ch higher tax rates and many models do not project such shif t as increasing savings and output in the long runhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98901crs19 mathematical appendix the following is formal treatment of the effects of shift to retail sales tax using simple islm analysis to demonstrate these points we us simplified fourequation money wage model with the conventiona l treatment of

demand where n is the labor supply and v is the tax exclusive rate of indirect tax sales or value added taxes imposed on firms equation 4 is the economys producti on function with output function of labor and capital k if we hold k constant for short run production function this system is four equations in four variables r n and p the exogenous variables are m g t and v with t being the sum of v times consumption net of tax and any other taxes we obtain the following by differentiating the equations and setting the initial value of v to zero 5 dy c dydt i dr dg 6 pdm mdp ldr kdy p2 7 hdn pfdn

happen to p if out put is held constant if dy is zero then dn is zero therefore equation 7 becomes simply 9 dp pdv thus the price change to hold income constant must be qual to the tax now consider what is required of the money supply to obtain this constant income result when dt is zero the replacement case the dr is also zero as shown in equation 5 since dy is set at zero therefore equation 6 is 10 dmm dpp dv the proportional change in the money s upply is equal to the proportional change in the tax rate and the price level consider the alternative specification fo r equation 2 where the

and dy is equal to zero then th sum of dc and di is equal to zero similarly by equation 5 dr is equal to zero if dt is equal to zero therefore noting that dpp dv 10a dmm dv 1kcpm this effect could be quite large for example in the case where liquidity demand is very insensitive to the interest rate and transactions demand is proportional to private transactions the lm curve is vertical the term in parentheses is on the right hand side is 1cci since c is large fraction of private demand the required increase in the money suppl is almost twice as large similarly by setting dm to zero we can see the effects on output and price in the case of the traditional transactions demand 11 dy i lmp dv 1 c ikl ilmphpfpfny since c is less than 1 and both i and l are negative the effect on output is negative as long as labor supply is upward slopinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98901crs21 by substitution 12 dpp 1 c ikl dv 1 c ikl ilmphpfpfny thus the price level also rises but not as much as in the case of monetary accommodation in the case where transactions demand is function of private spending including the tax the negative effect on income is greater 11a dy i lmp kc dv 1 c ikl ilmphpfpfny and
