engagement china has at best only marginally increased its deployed nuclear threat in the last 15 years and that the strategic balance with china remains overwhelmingly in our favor on apr il 21 1999 director of central intelligence dci george tenet reported the intelligence communitys damage assessment it confirmed that china obtained by espionage classified us nuclear weapons information that probably accelerated its program to develop future nuclear weapons it also revealed that china obtained information on several us nuclear reentry vehicles including the trident ii submarinelaunched missile that delivers the w88 nuclear warhead as well as variet of design concepts and weaponization features including thos of the neutron bomb on may 25 1999 the houses cox committee reported that china stole classified information on the w88 and six ot her us nuclear warheads on june 15 1999 the presidents foreign intelligence advisory board pfiab called the department of energy dysfunctional bureaucracy and urged the creation of semiautonomous or independent agency to oversee nuclear weapons in september 1999 congress passed the fy2000 national defense authoriz ation act to create national nuclear security administra tion nnsa within doe on march 1 2000 as one result of the w88 case the fbi investigated taiwanborn us scientist at the alamos lab wen ho l ee he was never charged with espionage in december 1999 the justice department indicted lee on 59 felony counts for mishandling nuclear weapons info rmation not classified at the time lee was jailed without bail until plea agreement on ptember 13 2000 when he pleaded guilty to one count of mishandling national defense information for making copies of his computer files the judge apologized to lee meanwhile in april 1999 the fbi expanded its counterintelligence investiga tion beyond the focus on alamos and in 2000 the probe shifted to missile secrets and to the defense department in april 2003 an exfbi agent james

have leaked from alamos national laborat ory to china between 1984 and 1988 us intelligence reportedly was handed s ecret prc document from 1988 containing designs similar to that of the w88 the discovery prompted an fbi investigation codenamed kindred spirit that began in september 19957 suspicions that china may have acquired w88 data also led analysts to reexamine series of nuclear explos ions detonated by china prior to its announcement of moratorium on nuclear sting in july 1996 and new willingness to sign the comprehensive test ban tr eaty ctbt in september 1996 after china became the last of the five declared nuclear wea pon states to begin moratorium there were suspicions that ch ina took the step not just because of arms control but because it had reached its goals in nuclear weapon modernization or achieved the capability to simulate nuclear explosions some speculated that china received test data from russia or france8 separate from the w88 case however the

approved report that urged among other recommendations that the appropriate executive departme nts and agencies should c onduct comprehensive damage assessment of the strategic implications of the security breaches that have taken place by china at the nuclear weapon labs25 t h intelligence community assessed the difficult question of how much prc nuclear weapon designs might have benef itted if china obtained the w88 data on this question national security advisor berg er acknowledged in march 1999 soon after the news reports that theres question they benefitted from this26 director of central intelligence d ci george tenet further announced on march 15 1999 that after an interagency team completed damage assessment by the end of march an indepe ndent panel led by retired admiral david jeremiah would review the findings the damage assessment of the intelligence community was completed by the end of march and the panel reviewed that assessment and made recommendations for changes by early april some said that an independent review was needed to give the assessment greater credibility against any charges of politicization intended to protect the policy of engagement toward china and other policies some reports suggested that in august 1997 as the white house prepared for president clintons first summit with china nsc official gary samore had requested an

intelligence communitys damage assessment on april 21 1999 president clinton said that he asked the national counterintelligence policy board to assess potential vulnerab ilities at nuclear weapon institutions other than the national labs29 according to the unclassified key findings released by the dci the intelligence communitys damage assessment with concurrence by the independent panel confirmed that china obtained by espi onage classified us nuclear weapons information that probably accelerated its program to develop future nuclear weapons that successful prc espionage ffort which dated back to at least the late 1970s benefitted prc nuclear weapon design pr ogram by allowing china to focus successfully down critical paths and avoid less promising approaches to nuclear weapon designs furthermore the assessment found that china obtained basic design information on several modern us nuclear reentry vehicles including the trident ii that delivers the w88 warhead as well as variety of us weapon design concepts and weaponization featur including those of the neutron bomb the information on us nuclear weapons ma an important c ontribution to prc efforts to maintain second strike cap ability and develop fu ture nuclear weapon designs however it was uncertain whether china obtained documentation or blueprints and china also benefitted from information obtained from wide variety of sources including open sources uncla ssified information and chinas own efforts the assessment also stated that the prc has not demonstrated any apparent modernization of the deployed stra tegic force or any new nuclear weapons deployment china has not conducted nuclear tests since july 1996 the assessment also confirmed that china has had the technical capability to develop mirv system for the currently deploy ed icbm but has not deployed mirv system nonetheless us intelligence reported that us information acquired by the chinese could help them develop mirv for future mobile missile on the continuing need for effectiv counterintelligence nd intelligence the assessment confirmed that the prc currently was using aggressive collection efforts directed at us nuclear weapon secrets in orde r to fill significant gaps in chinas programs adding further to stions about possible politicization and erosion of expertise in the intelligence community the independent review panel warned that the intelligence community had too little depth the panel also added that multiple countries have gained access to classified us information on variety of subjects for decades through espionage leaks or other venues and such losses were much more significant in the current context of diminished us research efforts intended to ensure protectiv edge over those countries using us

announcement of nuclear testing moratori um and its september 1996 signing of the comprehensive test ban treaty ctbt the committee reported that information lost from the doe labs accelerated prc nuc

independently targetable reentry vehicles mirvs for its nuclear missile force the committee reported that it had information on whether the prc currently intends to develop and deploy mirvs complicating factor was that as the committee revealed the cia obtained in 1995 someplace outside of the prc s ecret prc document containing design information on the w88 and technical information on

selfinterest in any case as the cox committees report said prc nuclear tests conducted from 1992 to 1996 had already raised suspicions in us intelligence that china had stolen us nuclear weapon

secretary richardson overstated the case when he asserts as he did several weeks ago that americans can be reassured our nations nuclear secrets are today safe and secure while intelligence officials

losses conducted by the director of central intelligen ce we also concur with the findings of the independent review of that assessment by admiral david jeremiah nd his panel on one end of the spectrum is the view that the chinese have acquired very little classified information and can do little with it on the other end is the view that the chinese have nearly duplicated the w88 warhead none of thes extreme views holds water the most accurate assessment is presented in the april 1999 intelligence community damage assessment despite widely publicized asserti ons of wholesale losses of nuclear weapons technology from specific labor atories to par ticular nations the factual record in the majority of cases regarding the doe weapons laboratories supports pl ausible inferences but not irrefutable proof about the sour ce and scope of espionage and the channels through which recipien t nations received information particularly egregious have been the failures to enforce cyber

office wrote another memo to headquarters on january 22 1999 questioning whether lee was the prime suspect in the w88 case in part because he passe d the december 1998 polygraph test82 lee wrote in his book that the local office recommended that the fbi close the investigation on him and the acting director of the t division dan butler informed lee on february 4 1999 that he could go back to the

counterintelligence until after bill richardson became secretary of energy in august 1998 in the spring of 1997 doe had selected the suspect to head program to update the computer programming used in the stockpile stewardship program that evaluates the performance of nuclear weapons without testin g and he hired prc citizen to assist him111 moreover some critics questioned why the president did not issue pdd61 until february 1998 although the suspicions that china obtained w88 data arose in 1995 and the fbi made recommendations to tighten counterintelligence measures in april 1997112 the presidents foreign intelligence advisory board pfiab led by former senator rudman reported in june 1999 that the speed and sweep of the clinton administrations ongoing response does not absolve it of

protect national security since the pr ime suspect identified by doe and the fbi in the w88 case though not charged with any crime remained employed at alamos until march 8 1999 the pfiabs re port stated in june 1999 that there does not exist today systematic process to ensure that the competing interests of law enforcement and national security are appropriate ly balanced although criminal investigations usually require leaving the suspects in place to obtain evidence and assess damage the suspect was only required to take polygraph tests in december 1998 conducted by doe and in february 1999 given by the fbi doe did not remove him from access to highly sensitive information in the x division until december 1998115 and did not dismiss him until march 8 1999116 even though the

office that day they did not search his home until later in april 1999122 some questioned the department of justices role in not supporting the fbis requests to electronically monitor him through wiretaps the fbi said that the justice departments office of intelligence policy and review oipr denied the fbis applications for electronic surveillance or wiretaps of the suspect in august 1997 and in cember 1998 b ecause there was insufficient evidence that the suspected espionage activity was current because the oipr did not approve the applications they did not reach the cour t established under the authority of the foreign intelligence surveillance act fisa on may 24 1999 reno said that the jus tice department did not authorize intrusions in the lives of american citizens when as in

the department of justice may be applying the fisa in manner that is too restrictive particul arly in light of the evolution of very sophisticated counterintellig ence threat and the ongoing revolution in information systems the board also questioned why the fbis fisa request did not include request to monitor or search the subjects workplace computer systems however there were competing concerns about protection of civil liberties as the washington post stated the lee case for example has been cited as evidence of the need to relax civil liberties protections to make surveillance easier in national security cases this is dreadful idea the post also cautioned that lee was entitled to presumption of innocence that he has not typically received in public discussions of the matter125 some expressed concerns that the lack of monitoring over the prime suspects computer use had grave conse quences for securing secret s of us nuclear weapons additional reports revealed that secretar richardson shut down the lab computers on april 2 1999 because investigators di scovered after obtai ning permission to check his computer in march 1999 that he had carried out possibly significant compromise of computer security affecting nuclear weapons cr itics were concerned that the fbi discovered that the suspect d transferred enormous volumes of files containing millions of lines of highly secret computer codes on nuclear weapon designs called legacy codes from classified computer to an unclassified computer at alamos moreover they cited as problem that someone who improperly used password may have subsequently accessed the files in the unclassified computer126 they thought it suspicious th at lee tried to delete some of the classified files127 the fbi said that

york times published an extensive review of its own reporting on wen ho lees case in respons to criticisms of its reporting of lee the new york times concluded that its review showed how in constructing narrative to fit their unnerving suspicions investigators took fragmentary often ambiguous evidence about dr lees behavi or and chinese atomic espionage and wove it into grander case that eventua lly collapsed of its own light weight181 in speech given in may 2001 senator shelby chairman of the senate intelligence committee discussed alleged espionage against the department of energy

of wen ho lee that emerged from the w88 investigation have been widely criticized we should not lose sight of the facts dr lee illegally purposefully downloaded and removed from alamos massive amounts of classified nucl ear weapons information182 sylvia lee and cooperation with the fbi number of other issues complicated the case on wen ho lee one issue was the relationship between the fbi and the

case was the governments decision not to prosecute former dci john deutch there was debate about whether deutchs case wa s analogous to lees some said that the treatment of lee was unfair and ther was doublestandard but others argued that the two people had different alleged intentions the cia investigated deutch dci in 19951996 for repeatedly mishand ling classified information and moving many classified intelligence files to hi s unsecured personal computers in his house computers used to access the internet and thus vulnerable to attacks the files reportedly included 17000 pages of documents including t op secret materials and files about presidentiallyappr oved covert action further the cia was said to have reported that deutch may have tampered with evidence allegedly showing his improper handling of classi fied files including on december 20 1996 trying to delete over 1000 classified files stored on one of f our portable memory cards additional reports disclosed that the

convinced however that the july 1997 briefing which we are persuaded was much more comprehensive was sufficient to warrant ggressive white house action also the pfiab revealed that the wh ite house

officials discussed with senior cia fbi and white house officials in several meetings that there was the possibility that china may have classified us nuclear design information former white house chief of staff leon panetta reportedly said that he was informed by then energy secretary hazel oleary in july 1995 afterwards panetta reportedly requested dci john deutch to work with the nsc on the matter deutch briefed national security advisor anthony lake in novemb er 1995 the senior officials reportedly did not brief president clinton in 1995243 sandy berger was the deputy national security advisor at that time right before the indictment of we n ho lee on december 4 1999 top law enforcement security and doe officials held meeting at the white house on whether to indict attorney general janet reno national s ecurity advisor sandy berger energy secretary bill richards on fbi director louis freeh dci george tenet and us attorn ey john kelly attended244 after wen ho lee was freed after nine months in jail under plea bargain in september 2000 president clinton criticized th pretrail detention of lee saying i always had reservations about the claims that were being made denying him bail and let say i think i spea k for everyone in the white house we took those claims on good faith by the people in the government that were making them and couple days after they made the claim that this man could not possibly be let out of jail on bail because he would be such danger of flight or such danger to americas security all of sudden they reach plea agreement which will if anything make his alleged defense look modest compared to the claims that were made against him so the whole thing was quite troubling to and i think its very difficult to reconcile the two positions that one day hes terrible risk to national security and the next day theyre making plea agreement for an offense far more modest than what had been alleged245 export controls some critics linked the controversy over lab security with the administrations export control policy to ward china they cited the export of high performance computers or supercomputers to china246 the department of commerce reported to congress in janua ry 1999 that 191 such computers were exported to china in 1998 for which onl three enduse checks were conducted247httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30143crs59 247 continued

were also concerns investigated by congress in 1998 that exports of us satellites resulted in tr ansfers of missile technology to china248 some argued that the administrations export control policies allowed dualuse exports of great strategic value to china that resulted in greater damage to us national security than the leaks of nuclear weapon data249 president clinton nonetheless said that his administration was termined to prevent diversi ons of sensitive technology to china and placed controls on exports to china that are tougher than those applied to any other major exporting country in the world250 nuclear cooperation with china some questioned whether it was appropriate for the administration to have expanded nuclear ties with china including exchanges between the two nucl ear weapon establishments while it had suspicions about security compromises at the 1997 uschina summit president clinton promised to issue certifications signed in january 1998 to implement the 1985 nuclear cooperation agreement and during congressional review the administration did not discuss problems at the labs251 at the 1998 usprc summit in beijing doe signed govern mental agreement on peaceful nuclear cooperation including exchanges at the labs252 the administration argued that lab tolab exchanges were not the cause of the alleged security problems concerns about partisanship still others urged policymakers to move beyond any partisan debates to urgently upgrade us secu rity at the labs assess the potential damage from chinas reported compromise of us secrets and take corrective action they also cautioned agains t partisan attacks in this case that might damage broader and longerter m uschina relations that are in us interests such as efforts on trade and weapon nonprolifera

goal in establishing the counterintelligence policy board was coordination of cia and fbi efforts with focus on counterintelligence at intelligence agencies concerns about doe laboratories were not publicly discussed in 1994 it was generally agreed that coordination among law enforcement and intelligence agencies improved significantly as result however of concerns dating from at least 1995 that china may have acquired sensitive information from alamos pdd61 was issued in february 1998 mandating stronger counterintelligence program within doe laboratories according to energy secretary richardson writing in march 1999 steps taken in response to pdd61 included new counterintelligen ce professionals based at the laboratories doubling of the budget for counterintelligence new screening and approval process for foreign scientists seeking access to the laboratories and more extensive security reviews including the use of polygraphs for scientists working in sensitive
