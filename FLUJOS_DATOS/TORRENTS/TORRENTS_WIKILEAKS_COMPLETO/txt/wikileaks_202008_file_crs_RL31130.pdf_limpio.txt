amendment ruling terry v ohio 4 the supreme court found that reasonable articulable spicion was sufficient grounds for police officer to briefly stop and question citizen such suspicion must not be based on the officers inchoa and unparticularized susp icion or hunch but on the specific reasonable inferences which he is entitled to draw from the facts in light of his experience terry employed totality of circumstances test to determine the reasonableness of police investigatory stops united states v brignoniponce5 addressed the issue of race as factor giving rise to reasonable suspicion of criminal activity in this case the officers relied on single factor to justify stopping responde nts car the apparent mexican ancestry of the occupants6 neither this single factor nor the police officers belief that the occupants were illegal aliens satisfied the constitutional minimum for an investigatory stop the court conceded the likelihood that any given person of mexican ancestry is an alien is high nough to make mexican appearance relevant factor 7 by itself however that factor did not support reasonable suspicion necessary for roving stop the court proposed multifactored analysis officers may consider the characteristics of the area usual patterns of traffic on the particular road and previous experience with alien traffic8 additionally erratic behavior and evasive acts by those under th observation of the police officer as well as aspects of the motor vehicle may s upport the reasonable suspicion necessary for an investigatory stop httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31130crs3

relies on apparent mexican ancestry at this checkpoint that reliance clearly is relevant to the law enforcement need to be served indeed according to the majority even if it be assumed that such referrals are made largely on the basis of apparent mexican ancestry we perceive constitutional problem10 but the court cautioned against extending the logic of border enforcement cases to situations remote from the border where the government interest in immigration policing may be less compelling thus different conclusion might pertai n if for example reliance were put on apparent mexican ancestry at checkpoint operated near the canadian border11 another fourth amendment case united states v weaver 12 likewise affirmed the conviction of black drug courier susp ect who was stopped at the kansas city airport based in part on information that number of young roughly dressed black males from street gangs in angeles frequently brought cocaine into the kansas city area13 the court ruled that federal drug enforcement agents can rely on racial characteristics if objective crime trend analysis validates use of these characteristics as risk factors in predicting criminal behavior

significant demographic changes and changes in the law restricting the use of race as criterion in government decisionmaking15 as reasons for precluding any consideration of race the likelihood that in an area in which the majority or even substantial part of the population is hispanic an given person of hispanic ancestry is in fact an alien let alone an illegal alien is not high enough to make

minor traffic infraction is pretext rather than the actual motivation for stop by law enforcement officers in other words the fact that suspects were stopped for pretextual reasons did not without more constitutionally taint the police action or evidence of drug crimes disc overed as consequence whren however did not hold that the officers motivation is entirely i rrelevant when probable cause for stop is based on traffic violation as explained by the court the constitution prohibits selective enforcement of the law based on considerations such as race but the constitutional basis for objecting to intentionally discriminatory application of laws is the equal protection clause not the f ourth amendment subjective intentions play role in ordinary probable cause fourth amendment

into such circumstantial and direct evidence of intent as may be available22 the task is complicated after whren because there may be an objective nonracially motivated basis for the stop or detention in the case of pretextual stop the court must take the inquiry into illicit in tent to the next leve l by addressing the officers reason for taking enforcement action but if raciallymotivated decision making is shown or an agency policy employs explicit racial criteria the claimant need not demonstrate statistically that members of his racial or ethnic group were disproportionately targeted for enforcement it is not necessary to plead the existence of similarly situated nonminority group when challenging law or policy that contains an expre ss racial classification23 rather because the policy itself establishes direct connection between th racial classification and the defendants enforcement action the policy is subject to strict scrutiny under the equal protection clause challenge to the specific acts of particular police officer is not unlike claim of racial discrimination in the use of pere mptory jury challenges which also involves the acts of single state actor the prosecutor in the course of single transaction the selection of jury the supreme court has instructed that all relevant circumstances be considered in the constitutional analysis of such cases including the prosecutors pattern of strikes against black jurors and the prosecutors questions and statements which may suppor t or refute and inference of discriminatory purpose24 similarly police officers pattern of traffic stops and arrests his questions and statements to the person involve d and other relevant circumstances may support an inference of discriminatory purpose in this context25

racial prof iling claimants face additional evidentiary burdens claimant alleging selective enforcement of facially neutral criminal laws must demonstrate that the challenged law enforcement practice had discriminatory effect and that it was motivated by discriminatory purpose in united states v armstrong 31 criminal defendants sought to attack their federal firearms and drugs charges for crack cocaine as selective prosecution based on race the supreme court rejected the contention b ecause there was showing that similarly situated defendants of another race were treated di fferently by criminal prosecutors to establish discriminatory effect in race cas the claimant must show that similarly situated individuals of different race were not prosecuted claimant can satisfy this requirement by naming an individual who was not investigated in similar circumstances or through the use of statistical or other evidence addressing the crucial question of whether one class is being treated differently from another class that is otherwise similarly situated32 this latter recourse calls for reliable measure of the demographics of the relevant population33 standard for determining whether the data represents similarly situated individuals34 and relevant comparisons to the actual incidence of crime among different racial and ethnic segments of the population35 this framework has been applied in number of proceedings involving allegations of discriminatory police enforcement practices36 armstrong was relied upon by the fourth circuit in affirming th dismissal of racial

virtually impossible to identify similarly situated individual who was not stopped the person ca nnot be identified at all nor is there any recorded information from which one can compare whether the motorists present similar factors to an observing officer such th at there has been disparate treatment or not because law enforcement agencies do not make or keep records on individuals they do not stop and certainl not on similarly situated individuals they do not stop imposing such requireme nt on this defendant or any defendant who challenges traffic stop as selective enforcement effectively denies them any ability to discover or prove such claim thus the defendant challenging traffic stop for selective enforcement mu st be allowed to show discriminatory effect in some other way 40supra n 27 41251 f3d 612 7th cir 2001against virginia beach police the district judge in harris v city of virginia beach 37 rejected statistical evidence of pattern practice or custom of racial profiling offered by black driver wh alleged that he was stopped for driving under the influence without probable cause without evidence that the officer was aware of plaintiffs identity and race befo re stopping his vehicle there was proof of illicit motivation moreover even if plai ntiffs could show that disproportionate number of minorities were stoppe d for traffic violations th ey could not prove their claim of discriminatory tr eatment absent showing that similarly situated non minority drivers were treated differently since record was kept concerning stops where citations were issued or search conducted the court found that plaintiffs could not meet their burden statistical evidence is generally not sufficient to show that similarly situated persons of diffe rent races were treated unequally other courts have disagreed however and refused to apply the similarly situated requirement in armstrong to racial profiling by law enforcement officers because the police never have been afforded the same presumption of regularity extended to prosecutors and because in the civil context such requirement might well be impossible to meet38 in united states v duquenava the court concurred that application of the armstrong standard to racial profiling cases would require 1983 claimant to make an impossible showing that similarly situated individual was not stopped by the law enforcement39 for this reason in the marshall decision40 the tenth circuit found that discriminatory effect could be demonstrated either by showing similarly situated individual or by relying on statistical evidence and in chavez v illinois state police41 the seventh circuit similarly held that statistical evidence of discriminatory effect should be accepted as proof of selective enforcement claim based on traffic stop while dispensing with armstrong s similarly situated requirement however chavez illustrates the difficulty of proving racial profiling claims based on statistical evidence

number of blacks and hispanics being stopped and searched the district court granted the states motion for summary judgment on the equal prot ection claims and the venth circuit affirmed the appeals court found that chavez did identify s imilarly situated white motorist who was treated differently but that the armstrong requirement was neither necessary nor sufficient to satisfy the pl aintiffs burden of proving discriminatory purpose and effect in an equal protection case the armstrong rule governing selective prosecutions did not apply in r acial profiling cases first because it would be impossible to prove plaintiffs who llege that they were stopped due to racial profiling would not barring some type of test operation be able to provide the names of other similarly situated motorists who were not stopped s econd racial profiling involves police conduct not prosecutorial di scretion and is in civil not criminal context despite its decision to permit statistical proof that minority class members were treated differently than other motori sts the court concluded that the numbers presented failed to support an inference of r acial profiling first plaintiffs relied on random sample of valkyrie field repor ts without indication of the total number of stops made during the relevant peri od sec ondly the bench marks for the presence of various racial groups on i llinois roads was the 1990 census which is widely acknowledged to undercount cer tain groups particularly blacks and hispanics thus without reliable data on whom valkyrie officers stop detain and search or of proper demographic benchm ark for the motoring public on the illinois roads in question the court could not find that the statistics prove that the valkyrie officers action had discriminatory effect on the plaintiffs nor did isolated instances of racially inse nsitive remarks made by troopers during stops provide sufficient evidence of racial motivation in racial profiling case apart from problems of proof establis hed equal protection doctrine instructs that where race or ethnicity is the sole or predominant factor behind the decision to stop or arrest strict scrutiny requires that government demonstrate compelling justification served by narrowly tailored means strict scrutiny is not however per rule of invalidity strict in theory is not fatal in fact42 but instead describes an analytical

sensitive to the circumstances in which government seeks to act and to the methods by which it seeks to achieve even its legitimate ends44 the equitable standing doctrine besides substantive proof requirements major procedural obstacles may limit the effi cacy of private actions to end racial profiling practices first there is the equitable standing doctrine that has been applied by courts to deny an individual plaintiff the legal standing to seek injunctive relief against unconstitutional police practices unless he can show substantial certainty that he w ill suffer s imilar injury in the future in city of angeles v lyons 45 the supreme court reversed the grant of injunctive relief to black motorist permanently injured by police chokehol d applied during routine traffic stop

repetition of his experience with the lapd although he had standing to assert damages claim said the c ourt the plaintiff could not obtain an injunction because it was unlikely that he again would be subject to chokehold moreover in order to show actua l threat of future injury lyons would have had not only to allege that he would have another encounter with the police but also to make the credible assertion that all police officers in angeles always choke any citizen with whom they happen to have an encounter46 the lyons principle has been extended by lower courts to racial profiling cases permitting claims for damages to go forward while denying the plaintiffs standing to seek injunctions against future police abuse it is important to keep in mind that these are two distinct inquiries and that it is possi ble to have standing to assert claim for damages to redress past injury while at the same time not having standing to enjoin the practice that gave rise to those

rights division june 2003 available at httpwwwusdojgovjustice department then undertook study of policies and practi ces of federal law enforcement agencies to determine the natu re and extent of racial profiling two years later the administration issued ban on the practice by federal law enforcement agencies including the fbi the secret service the drug enforcement agency and the department of homeland security but permitted exceptions for the use of race and ethnicity to combat potential terrorist threats62 the policy prohibits the use of generalized stereotypes based on race or ethnicity and allows officers to consider racial factors in traditional law enforcementactivities only as part of specific description or tip from an informant however the guidance does not affect current federal policy with respect to law enforcement activities and other efforts to defend and safeguard against threats to national security or the integrity of the nations borders when federal law enforcement officers are investigating or preventing threats to national security or other catastrophic events including th performance of duties related to air transportation security or enforcing laws protecting the integrity of the nations borders they may consider both race and ethnicity to the extent permitted by the constitution and laws of the united states the likely impact of the guidance may be limited by several factors first it applies only to federal agents whereas the bulk of national law enforcement remains state and local matter in addition th guidance is largely advisory since it imposes penalties and otherwise appears to lack legal force its numerous exceptions particularly for national security investigations may in the present climate invite broad circumvention where individuals of alien or middle eastern origin are concerned similarly profiling of latinos to preserve border integrity with mexico would apparently be permitted by the current policy
