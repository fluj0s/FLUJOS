accused of federal crime the right to trial in the state where the crime was committed us const art iii 2 cl3 and the right to trial by jury selected from the district where the crime was committed us const amend vi in 1998 the supreme court held that federal charges involving money laundering in florida but of the proceed s from drug trafficking in missouri could not be tried in missouri united states v cabrales 524 us1 1998 the following year the court held that use of firearm in maryland in connection with multistate kidnaping could be tried in new jersey united states v rodriguezmoreno 526 us 275 1999 subsequent congresses have seen number of propos als to expand venue for the trial of various federal criminal offenses the pattern continued in the 109th constitutional venue requirements understood in light of cabrales and rodriguezmoreno might have precluded r ealization of the full literal benefits of so of these proposalshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22360crs2 cabrales and rodriguezmoreno cabrales is not as restrictive as it might seem at first nor is rodriguezmoreno as permissive cabral laundered the missouri drug money in florida but there was evidence that she was member of the missouri drug trafficking conspiracy or that sh had transported the money from missouri to florida the court acknowledged that she mig ht have been tried in missouri had either been the case 524 us at 8 10 rodriguezmoreno and his confederates ki dnapped drug trafficking associate and transported him over the course of time from texas to new jersey and then to maryland rodriguezmoreno acquired the firearm with which he threatened the kidnap victim in maryland but was tried in new jersey for using firearm during and in relation to crime of violence kidnaping in violation of 18 usc 924c1 section 924c1 in the eyes of the court has two distinct conduct elements using and carrying of gun and the commission of kidnaping 526 us at 280 emphasis added crime with distinct conduct elements may be tried wh erever any of thos elements occurred kidnaping is continuous offense that in th is case began in texas and continued through new jersey to maryland venue over the ki dnaping conduct element of the section 924c1 was proper in texas new jersey or maryland conseque ntly venue over the violation of section 924c1 was proper in either texas new jersey or maryland 526 us at 28082 the court was quick to distinguish cabrales from rodriguezmoreno the existence of criminally generated proceeds in cabrales was circumstance element of the offense but the proscribed conduct defendants money undering activity occurred after the fact of the offense begun and completed by others in rodriguez moreno given the during and in relation to language the underlying crime of violence is critical part of the 924c1 offens 526 us at 28081 n4 the court also declined to address the socalled effects test used by the some of the lower federal courts in obstruction of justice and hobbs ac t effect cases to determine the presence of proper venue 526 us at 279 n2 obstruction of justice one of the most common venue proposals in the 109th congress related to re taliation against witnesses in fe deral proceedings 18 usc 1513 it is found in hr 970s 155 207 s 1968 8 hr 1751as passed by the house 10 as passed by the senate 204 hr 4028 312 hr 4472715as passed by the house and s 2767 1086 as passed by th senate under the proposal new subsection would have been dded to section 1513 of title 18 reading prosecution under this section may be brought in the distri ct in which the offici proceeding whether or not pending about to be in stituted or completed was inte nded to be affected or was completed or in which the conduct constituting the allege d offense occurred proposed 18 usc 1513g the language replicated that found in 18 usc 1512h concerning venue in federal witness tampering cases and added to sec tion 1512 in 1988 prior to cabrales or rodriguezmoreno the official proceeding affected would appear to have more closely resembled the circumstance element found insufficient in cabrales than the conduct element approved in rodriguezmoreno in what seems to be the only federal appe llate decision to address the question the fourth circuit concluded that its ear lier approval of venue under section 1513 in the district where the fficial proceeding had been were being or would be held cannot be r econciled with the supreme c ourts later decisions in cabraleshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22360crs3 and rodriguezmoreno rather the supreme courts recent venue decisions instruct that the nature of the crime refers only to th conduct constituting the offense and that the conduct constituting the offense is limite d to essential c onduct elements united states v bowens 224 f3d 302 312 4th cir 2000 violence during and in re lation to drug trafficking second common proposal would have built upon the scheme approved in rodriguezmoreno the statute before the court 18 usc 924c1 outlaws the use of firearm during and in relation to crime of violence or serious drug offe nse several bills eg hr 970s 155 108 hr 1279 as passed the house 106 proposed new federal crime one that would have prohibited the commission of crime of violence during and in relation to drug trafficking offense proposed 21 usc 865 they would have permitted prosecution for such an offense in 1 the judicial district in which the murder or other crime of violence occurred or 2 any judicial district in which the drug trafficking crime may be prosecuted pr oposed 21 usc 865b this analogy to rodriguezmoreno seems likely to have worked especially if the drug trafficking offense lik the kidnaping offense in rodriguezmoreno was considered continuous offense in time and space many drug trafficking offenses are likely to be considered continuing offenses for venue purposes see eg united states v zidell 323 f3d 412 422 6th cir 2003possession with intent to distribute united states v brown 400 f3d 1242 1250 10th cir 2005manufacturing thamphetamine moreover although rodriguezmoreno used firearm durin g and in relation to continuing offense kidnaping that occurred in th same district that does not appear to have been necessary for the courts analysis the courts analys is suggests different result if the kidnap victim had been kept in new jersey nd never been transported to maryland but rodriguezmoreno had traveled to maryland and used firearm there to discourage an informant from disclosing the victims wh ereabouts to authorities where crime consists of distinct parts which have different localities the whole may be tried where any part can be proved to have been done 526 us at 281 in the case of the proposal the new crime apparently would ve consisted of two conduct ements crime of violence and drug trafficking crime it would seem to have followed that the new crime might have been tried wherever either the crime of violence or continuous drug trafficking offense occurred venue in capital cases the same bills that propose venue changes for drug related crimes of violence would have repl aced an existing provision relating to venue in capital cases hr 970s 155 203 h r 1279 as passed by the house110 and hr 4472 as passed by the house810 existing law provides that where possible capital cases should be tried in the county in which the crime occurred 18 usc 3235 section 3235 is followed by section that pr ovides that murder and manslaughter cases should be tried where the deathcausing inju ry was inflicted regardless of where death actually occurs 18 usc 3236 the more sp ecific instruction of section 3236 overrides the general multidistrict ve nue provisions of 18 usc 3237a which provides that multidistrict crimes may be tr ied where they are begun tinued or completed and that offenses involving the use of the mails tran sportation in interstate or foreign commerce or importation into the united states may be tried in any district from through or into which commerce mail or imports travel httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22360crs4 at least one federal appellate court has held that the specific instruction of section 3236 overrides the general instructions of sec tion 3237a only with regard to unitary murder offenses such as murder by federal prisoner 18 usc 1118 section 3236 does not apply the court held to death resulting cases cases where murder is sentencing element rather than substantive element of the offense such as in cases of violation of 18 usc 924cuse of fi rearm during and relating to the commission of crime of violence the sentence for which is termined in part by whether death resulted from the commission of the offense united states v barnette 211 f3d 803 814 4th cir 2000 the proposal would have repealed the c ounty trial language of section 3235 and replaced it with language reminiscent of the multidistrict terms of section 3237a the trial of any offense punishable by death sha ll be held in the district where the offense was committed or in any district in which the offense began continued or was completed b if the offense or related conduct unde r subsection involve s activities which affect interstate or foreign commerce or the importa tion of an object or person into the united states such offense may be prosecuted in any district in which those activities occurred although it is far from certain the proposal apparently intended to repeal the county trial feature of section 3235 and by indirection repeal the section 3236 override of multidistrict sec tion 3237 in murder cases the manslaughter features of 3236 would presumably have continued in place since they are not capital cases and thus by definition would have been beyond the reach of the proposed capital venue provisions of the amended section 3235 constructional quandaries aside it is not clear that predicating venue upon the interstate impact of re lated conduct will always survive analysis under cabrales the proposal apparently would have permitted trial of an offense in district in which related conduct affecting inters tate or foreign commerce occurred even if the offense itself was committed entirely in another district the cabrales money generating drug trafficking in missouri would seem to qualify as conduct re lated to the laundering in florida nor would the proposal always meet rodriguezmoreno s conduct element standard there was nothing in the proposal that would have required that the rel ated conduct affecting interstate commerce be an element of the offense to be tried in fact the alternative wording if the offense or related conduct involves activities which affect interstate commerce seemed to contemplat situations in which affecting commerce was not an element conduct or otherwise of the offense false statements in passport applications hr 4437 213 as passed by the house would have outlawed making fa lse statements in passport application mailing or presenting passport application containing false statement or causing the producti on of passport by fraud or false application proposed 18 usc 1542 the bills additional venue section would have allowed prosecution in 1 any district in which the false statement or representation was made or 2 any district in which the passport application was prepared submitted mailed received processed or adjudicated or 3 in the case of an application prepared and adjudicated outside the united states in the district in which the resultant pa ssport was produced proposed 18 usc 1551 similar provisions were found in s 2611 208 as passed by the senate s 2612 208 and s 2454 208 the proposals seemed co mpatible with cons titutional requirements as explained in cabrales and rodriguezmoreno with the exception of subsection 3httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22360crs5 venue seemed to be pegged to the conduct elemen ts of the new offense as to subsection 3 the constitution authorizes congress to provide venue for crimes committed outside of the united states us const artiii 2 cl3 amend vi violence in aid of racketeering section 105 of hr 1279 as passed by the house would have amended 18 usc 1959 to outlaw crimes of violence committed 1 for hire at the behest of racketeering enterprise 2 to further the purposes of racketeering enterprise or 3 to acquire maintain or enhance the offenders position within racketeering enterprise it w ould have added new subsection 1959c under which violations of the section may be prosecuted in 1 the j udicial district in which the crime of violence occurred or 2 in any judicial district in which racketeering activity of the enterprise occurred section 1959 would have used the definition of racketeering activity found in 18 usc 1961 that lists the crimes which mark the activities of racketeer influenced and corrupt organizati on rico 18 usc 1959b it is uncertain whether venue over section 1959 offense woul d have been constitutionally proper in any district where rico predicate offense racketeering activity had been committed for instance the section 1959 for hire by rico enterprise crime of violence might easily have been compared to the after the fact money laundering in cabrales on the other hand the section 1959 in furtherance of rico enterprise crime and perhaps the in furtherance of position in rico ente rprisecrime seem to more closely resemble the conspiratorial or aiding and abetting exceptions suggested in cabrales runaway spouses hr 229 would have outlawed interstate flight to avoid court ordered payments to spouse or exs pouse and the failure to make such payments with respect to spouse or exspouse living in another state proposed 18 usc 228aa venue would have been proper in the district in which either party resided or any other district recognized by law proposed 18 usc 228ae in case prior to rodriguez moreno but after cabrales the eleventh circuit upheld an identical venue provision found in the child support provisions of 18 usc 228 united states v muench 153 f3d 1298 1300304 11th cir 1998 the results would seem to have been compatible with rodriguezmoreno since payment would have invol ved both tender and receipt failure to pay would have constitute d conduct element occurring both where the debtor and the creditor were found trial in emergency conditions in emergency conditions and with the consent of the accused pl 10963 the federal judi ciary emergency special sessions act of 2005 criminal trials may be held outside the state in which the offense occurred before jury drawn from outside the district in which the offense occurred 28 usc 141b although there is supreme court preced ent directly on point the lower federal appellate courts ve held without exception that the accused may waive the constitutions venue requirements see eg united states v grenoble 413 f3d 569 573 6th cir 2005 united states v ebersole 411 f3d 517 525 4th cir 2005 united states v strain 396 f3d 689 693 5th cir 2005 united states v rendon 354 f3d 1320 1326 n5 11th cir 2003 2 w right federal practice and procedure 306 2000 war profiteering and fraud section 502 of s 12 w ould have outlawed wartime profiteering and fraud and permitted trial anywhere the general venue chapter of title 18 chapter 211 would have authorized it as well as in any district where any act in furtherance of the offense t ook place or where any party to the contract or provider of goods or services is located the pr oscription extends to fraud concealment orhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22360crs6 falsification of material f acts and overvaluation in pr ocurement context proposed 18 usc 1038c it does require the participation of multip defendants comparable proposals appeared in h r 4682 705 s 2356 2 s 2361 101 and s 3875 1402 other than in cases brought in reliance on chapter 211 or where the misconduct occurred overseas establishing compatibility between the new venue claims and the constitutional requirements as explained in cabrales and rodriguezmoreno might have proved challenging
