provides historical c ontext by discussing selected landmark sex discrimination cases despite the fact that the courts analys is of sex discrimina tion challenges under the constitution differs from its analysis of sex discrimination under the two federal statutes discussed in this report it is apparent that the court is willing to refine its standards of review under both schemes to accommodate the novel claims presented by these cases the courts d ecisions in cases involving title vii and title ix are particularly noteworthy because they illu strate the courts recognition of sexual

1976although the f ourteenth amendment requires equal protection it does not preclude the classification of individuals the court has noted that the constitution does not require things which are different in fact or opinion to be treated in law as though they were the same5 classification will not offend the constitution unless it is characterized by invidious discrimination6 the court has adopted three levels of review to establish the presence of invidious discrimination 1 strict scrutiny this most active form of judicial review has been applied where there is either suspect cla ssification such as race nationa l origin or alienage or burdening of fundamental in terest such as privacy or marriage classification will survive strict scrutiny if the government can show that it is necessary to achieving compelling interest7 generally statutory classifications subject to strict scrutiny are invalidated 2 intermediate scrutiny this level of review is not as rigorous as strict scrutiny classification will survive intermediate scrutiny if it is substantially related to achieving an important government objective8 sex classifications are subject to intermediate scrutiny 3 rational basis review this least active form of judicial review allows classification to survive an equal protection challenge if the classification is rationally related to legitimate government interest9 this level of review is characterized by its deference to legislative judgment most economic regulations are subject to rational basis review the courts adoption of intermediate scrutiny for sex classifications did not occur until 1976 in craig v boren the court declared unconstitutional an oklahoma statute that prohibited the sale of nonint oxicating 32 beer to males under the age of 21 and to females under the age of 1810 females between the ages of 18 and 21 however were allowed to purchase beer lthough the court agreed with the states argument that the protection of public hea lth and safety is an important government interest it found that the gender classifi cation employed by the statute was not substantially related to achieving that goal the statistical evidence presented

injured in traffic accidents could not establish that the statutes gender classification was substantially related to ensuring public health and safety in establishing an intermediate level of review for sex classifications the craig court identified what has been common theme in sex discrimination cases under the fourteenth amendment stereotypes and generalizations about the sexes11 in craig the court acknowledged its previous i nvalidation of statutes that premised their classifications on misconceptions concer ning the role of females the courts rejection of the use of stereotypes may be seen in many of the cases in this area12 the courts more recent decisions similarly llude to the use of stereotypes and generalizations for example in jeb v alabama the court determined that the state could not use its peremptory challenges to exclude ma jurors in paternity and child support action13 in reaching its conclusion the court reviewed the histor ical exclusion of women from juries because of the belief that women were too fragile and virginal to withstand the pollute d courtroom atmosphere14 in jeb the court questioned the states generalizations of male jurors being more sympathetic to the arguments of father in paternity action and female jurors being more receptive to the mother the court maintained that state actors who exercise peremptory challenges in reliance on gender stereotypes ratify and reinforce prejudicial views of the relative abilities of men and women15 the court feared that this discriminatory use of peremptory challenges not only would raise questions about the fa irness of the entire proceeding but also would create the impression that the judicial system had acquiesced in the denial of participation by one gender in us v virginia the court conducted more s earching form of intermediate scrutiny to find unconstitutional the exclusion of women from the virginia military institute vmi16 although the court reiterated that

required the state to establish an exceedingly persuasive justification for its actions17 virginia advanced two arguments in support of vmis exclusion of women first the singlesex education offere d by vmi contributed to diversity of educational approaches in virginia s econd vmi employed unique adversative method of training that would be destroyed if women were admitted after reviewing the history of virgin ias educational system the court concluded that vmi was not established or maintained to promote educational diversity in fact vmis historic nd constant plan was to offer unique educational bene fit to only men18 rather than to complement other virginia institutions by providing singlesex educational option further the court recognized virginias historic reluctance to allow women to pursue higher education any interest virginia had in maintaining educational diversity seemed to be proffered in response to litigation19 in addressing virginias second argume nt the court expressed concern over the exclusion of women from vmi because of generalizations about their ability while acknowledging that most women would pr obably not choose the adversative method the court maintained that some women d the will and capacity to succeed at vmi following jeb the court cautioned state actors not to rely on overbroad generalizations to perpetuate patterns of discriminati on while the c ourt believed that the adversative method did promote important goals it concluded that the exclusion of women was not substantia lly related to achieving those goals after determining that vmis exclusion of women violated the fourteenth amendment the court reviewed the state s remedy separate program for women virginia established the virginia womens institute for leadership vwil following the adverse decision of the cour t of appeals unlike vmi vwil did not use the adversative method because it was believed to be ina ppropriate for most women20 and vwil lacked the faculty facilities and course offerings available at vmi because vwil was not comparable singlesex institution for women the court concluded that it was an inadequate remedy for the states equal protection violations vmi subsequently became coeducational the courts most recent pronouncements with respect to sex discrimination both involved immigration issues in miller v albright the court considered challenge to 309 of the i mmigration and nationality act21 the petitioner the child of an american father and filipi mother contended that 309 imposed additional requirements for establishing american citizenship when child ishttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30253crs5 22 8 usc 1409 23 miller 523 us at 441 24 id at 443fathered by an american citizen outside of the united states22 for children born of citizen mother and an alien father citizenship is established at birth however for children born of citizen father and an alien mother citizenship is not established until the father or the child takes affirmative steps to confirm their relationship by the childs eighteenth birthday in this case the petitioners father did not attempt to establish his relationship with his daughter until after her eighteenth birthday thus the petitioners application for citizenship was denied the case produced five different opinions while six justices agreed that the petitioners complaint should be dismissed they provided different reasons for this conclusion justices stevens and rehnquist contended that the petitioners complaint lacked merit maintaining that 309s di stinction between illegitimate children of us citizen mothers and illegitimate children of us citizen fathers is permissible under heightened scrutiny because it is eminently reasonable and justified by important govern ment policies23 justices oconnor nd kennedy contended however that the distinction could withst and only rational basi s review and should not satisfy the kind of heightened scrutiny justice stevens seemed to conduct setting aside the issue of 309s constitutionality justices oconnor nd kennedy believed that the petitioner lacked the standing n ecessary to even pursue her claim finally justices scalia and thom as contended that the pe titioners complaint should be dismissed because the court lacks the power to confer citizenship having acknowledged that congress has the exclusiv authority to grant citizenship justices scalia and thomas believed that there was need to address the constitutionality of 309 justices ginsburg breyer and souter dissented in opinions written by justices ginsburg and breyer in their separate opinions justices stevens oconnor ginsburg and breyer each addressed the petitioners argument that 309 invokes gender stereotypes the petitioner contended that 309 relies on the belief that an american father remains aloof from daytoday child rearing duties and will not be as close to his child24 justice stevens however maintained that the statute has non stereotypical purpose of ensuring the existence of blood rela tionship between father and child justice stevens recognized that the distinction is reasonable because mothers have the opportunity to establish parentage at birt h while fathers do not always have that opportunity further he cont ended that the distinction encourages the development of healthy relationship between the citizen father and the foreignborn child and fosters ties between the child and the united states thus 309s additional requirements are appropriate for fa thers but unnecessary for mothers in their dissenting opinions justices gi nsburg and breyer contended that 309 relies on generalizations about men and women and the tie s they maintain with their children justice ginsburg argued that 309s goals of assuring ties between the citizen father and the foreignborn child and between the child and the united states can be achieved without reference to gende r while justice breyer argued similarlyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30253crs6 25 533 us 53 2001 26 id at 62 27 id at 63 28 id 29 id at 65 30 id at 6869 31 id at 70positing distinction between caretaker and noncaretaker parents rather than mother and father in nguyen v ins the court considered second challenge to 30925 the facts in nguyen closely resembled those in miller nguyen the child of citizen father and noncitizen mother born out of wedloc k challenged 309 on the grounds that its differing requirements for acquiring citiz enship based on the sex of the citizen parent violated the fi fth amendments guarant ee of equal protection majority of the court concluded th at 309s differing requirements were justified by two important government objectives first the court found that the government has an important interest in assuring that biological parentchild relationship exists26 while mothers relationship to child may be established at birth or from hospital records father ma not be present at the birth and may not be included on such records in this way the court maintained fathers and mothers are not similarly situated with regard to establishing biological parenthood27 thus different set of rules is neither surprising nor troublesome from constitutional perspective28 second the court found that the govern ment has an important government interest in ensuring that the child and the citizen parent have some demonstrated opportunity or potential to deve lop relationship that cons ists of the real everyday ties that provide connecti on between child and citizen parent and in turn the united states29 the opportunity for meaningful relationship is presented to the mother at birth however the father is not assured of similar opportunity the court concluded that 309 ensures that an opportunity for meaningful relationship is presented to the father before citizenship is conferred upon his child as result the court found that 309s differing requirements were substantially related to the important government interests the court noted that by linking citizenship to the childs yout h congress promoted an opportunity for parentchild relationship during the formative years of the childs life30 alluding to its decision in vmi the court maintained that the fit between the 309 requirements and the important government inte rests was exceedingly persuasive31 like the petitioner in miller nguyen argued that 309 embodied gender based stereotype however the court found that 309 addre sses an undeniablehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30253crs7 32 id at 68 33 id 34 see eg id at 70 we have explained that an exc eedingly persuasive justification is established by showing at least that the cl assification serves important governmental objectives and that the discriminatory means employed are substantially related to the achievement of those objectives id at 74 because the immigration and naturalization service ins has not shown an exceedingly persuasive justification for the sex based classification embodied in 8 usc 1409a4 ie because it has failed to establish at least that the classification substantia lly relates to the achievement of important governmental objectives i would reverse th judgment of the court of appeals 35 title vii provides in relevant part that it is an unlawful employment practice for an employer to fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any individual or otherwise to discriminate against any individual with resp ect to his compensation terms conditions or privileges of employment because of such indi viduals race color religion sex or national origin or to limit segregate or classify his employees or applicants for employment in any way which would deprive or tend to deprive any individual of employment opportunities or otherwise adversely affect his status as an employee because of such individuals race color religion sex or national origin 42 usc 2000e2 difference in the circumstance of the parents at the time child is born32 this difference is not the result of stereotype or frame of mind resulting from irrational or uncritical analysis33 rather 309 recognizes simply that at the moment of birth the mothers knowledge of the child is established in way not guaranteed to the unwed father while the courts recent decisions invol ving sex and equal protection illustrate that it is concerned with the stereotyping of men and women it is unclear whether it will continue to subject sex classifications and any related stereotypes to traditional form of intermediate scrutiny the courts requirement of an exceedingly persuasive justification in vmi suggests that it may be interested in conducting more exacting form of judicial review for sex classifications in his miller dissent justice breyer emphasized the need to apply the standard established in vmi however in nguyen both the majority and the dissenting justices in discussing an exceeding persuasive justification simply reiterated the traditiona l test that is used when applying intermediate scrutiny34 thus it is not clear whether sex classifications in future cases will be subject to traditional form of intermediate scrutiny or some form of heightened scrutiny

individuals race color relig ion sex or national origin35 title vii applies to broad range of employment practices including discrimination because of sex in hiring placement promotion demotion

has developed two princi pal models for proving claims of employment discriminati on the disparate treatme nt model focuses on an employers intent to discriminate alternately the disparate impact model is concerned with the adverse effects of an employers practices on protected class under disparate impact analysis facially neutral employment practice may violate title vii even if there is evidence of an employers intent to discriminate to succeed plaintiff must demonstrate that the application of specific employment practice has had different effect on particular group of employees37 both disparate treatment and disparat impact analysis involve system of evidentiary burden shifting both models require the plaintiff to establish prima facie case of discrimination38 if such case can be established the burden shifts to the employer to articulate defense for its actions for example the employer may produce evidence showing that its actions ar justified because of the needs of its business ultimately however the plaintiff retains the burden of persuasion that is the plaintiff must establish that the employers assertion of legitimate nondiscriminatory reason for its actions was pretext to obscure unlawful discrimination39httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30253crs9 40 499 us 187 1991 41 id at 192 42 42 usc 2000ek 43 johnson controls 499 us at 202 44 see eg dothard v rawlinson 433 us

2957 2008pregnancy discrimination in recent years the court has addresse d title vii and sex discrimination most frequently in the context of sexual harassment in uaw v johnson controls however the court considered whether an employer may discriminate against fertile women because of its interest in protecting potential fetuses40 johnson controls battery manufacturer implemented policy that excluded women who are pregnant or who are capable of bearing children from jobs that exposed them to lead41 which was the primary ingredient in the manufacturing process at johnson controls althoug h fertile women were excluded from employment fertile men were still permitted to work the court found that johnson controls policy was facially discriminatory because it did not apply to the repr oductive capacity of the companys male employees in the same way it applied to that of female employees the courts conclusion was bolstered by the pregnanc discrimination act of 1978 pda which provides that discrimination on the basis of sex for purposes of violating title vii includes discrimination because of or on the basis of pregnancy childbirth or related medical conditions42 although johnson controls asserted that sex was bfoq for protecting fetal safety the court maintained that discrimination on the basis of sex for safety concerns is allowed only in narrow circumstances43 the court stressed that to qualify as bfoq an employment practice must relate to the essence or central mission of the employers business44 because reproductiv capacity does not interfere with womans ability to perform work related to battery manufacturing the court rejected johns on controls bfoq defense recently the supreme court granted review in att v hulteen 45 pregnancy discrimination case that involves ques tions about whether women who took maternity leave before the pda went in to effect are entitled to protection the plaintiffs claim that for purposes of calc ulating their current

its 20082009 term gender stereotypes the supreme court has also ruled that employment decisions made on the basis of gender stereotypes may constitute unlawful sex di scrimination in price waterhouse v hopkins 46 the plaintiff woman who wa s denied partnership in the accounting firm where she worked was apparently rejected because of concerns about her interpersonal skills some of these concerns however appeared to reflect gender stereotypes for example one ma partner referred to the plaintiff as macho and another informed her that she could improve her chances of making partner if she learned to walk more femininely talk more femininely dress more femininely wear makeup have her hair styled and wear jewelry47 reasoning that sex stereotyping is form of discrimina tion on the basis of sex the court found that employment decisions that result from sex stereotypes may violate title vii48 although the decision was in part victory for employees who have been victims of employment actions based on gender stereotypes another aspect of the hopkins ruling favored employers by requiri ng lower standard of proof when employers defend their actions in mixed motive cases in mixedmotive cases such as hopkins there are both legitimate and illegitimate reasons for an employers adverse employment action in such cases the court held th at plaintiffs must present direct rather than circumstantial evidence that discrimination was motivating factor in the adverse action and that empl oyers could rebut that evidence by proving that they would have made the same decision even if discrimination had not been factor both of these holdings made it easier for employers to defend against discrimination lawsuits by their employees mixed motives as noted above mixed motive employ ment discrimination case is case in which the employer has both legitimate and illegitimate reasons for taking the challenged employment acti on several years after the supreme court ruled in the hopkins case congress passed title vii amendm ents that partially overturned the decision in the amendments congress dded provision that defined unlawful employment actions to include situations in which discrimination is motivating factor for any employment practice even though other factors also motivated the practice49 if an employer violates this provi sion but establishes that it would have taken the same employment action absent the illegitimate motive the amendments specify that courts may grant the plaintiff declaratory and injunctive relief as well

circumstantial evidence of discr imination the decision made it easier for employees to win in mixed motive cases sexual harassment courts have recognized two forms of sexual harassment under title vii the first quid pro quo sexual harassment occu rs when submission to unwelcome sexual advances or other conduct of sexual nature is made condition of an individuals employment or is otherwise used as the basis for employment decisions the second form of harassment involves conduct that has the purpose or effect of interfering unreasonably with an individuals work performance or of creating hostile or offensive working environment this sec ond form of sexual harassment which the court first recognized as cognizable claim in meritor savings bank fsb v vinson 52 is referred to as hostile environment sexual harassment in harris v forklift systems inc the court sought to define when workplace was sufficiently hostile for purposes of maintaining claim under title vii53 the petitioner female manager at an equipment rental company alleged that the companys president created hostile environment by repeatedly insulting her because of her gender and making her th target of unwanted sexual innuendos the court determined that an employee does not need to suffer injury to assert hostile environment claim under title vii so long as the environment would reasonably be perceived and is perceived as hostile or abusive there is need for it also to be psychologically injurious54 the court identified four factors that should be considered to determine whether hostile environment exists 1 the frequency of the discriminatory conduct 2 the seve rity of such conduct 3 whether the conduct is physically threatening or humiliating and 4 whether the conduct interferes unreasonably with an employees work performance55 although the court recognized these factors as those to be considered in identifying hostile environment it emphasized that single factor is determinativehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30253crs12 56 42 usc 2000e2 57 523 us 75 77 1998 58 id at 79 59 id at 80 60 524 us 775 1998samesex sexual harassment in 1998 the court interpreted title v iis prohibition against discrimination because of sex to include harassment i nvolving plaintiff and defendant of the same sex56 the petitioner in oncale v sundowner offshore services inc alleged that he was physically assaulted in sexu manner and was threatened with rape by three male coworkers57 two of the coworkers had supervisory authority over the petitioner although the court ac knowledged that congress was assuredly not concerned with maleonmale sexual harassment when it enacted title vii it found justification in the statutory language or the courts precedents for excluding same sex harassment claims from the coverage of title vii58 at the same time the court stated that inquiries in same sex harassment cases require careful consideration of the social context in which partic ular behavior occurs and is experienced by the claimant for example the court distinguished f ootball player being patted on the butt in locker room from similar behavior occurring in an office the court contended that this kind of consideration would prevent title vii from becoming general civility code for the american workplace59 employer liability the court continued its examination of hostile environment sexual harassment in two cases involving vicarious liability in faragher v city of boca raton the court found that an employer is vicari ously liable for actionable discrimination caused by supervisor subject to an affi rmative defense that must consider the reasonableness of the employers conduct as well as the conduct of the employee60 the petitioner former lifeguard for the marine safety section of boca ratons parks and recreation partment alleged that she wa s subject to an environment characterized by lewd remarks genderb iased speech and uninv ited and offensive touching by her former supervisors recognizing that the authority conferred as result of supervisors relationship with the employer allows the supervisor greater ability to act inappropriately the court concluded that an employer could be vicariously liable when supervisor misuses that authority as the court noted when person with supervisory authority discriminates in the terms and c onditions of subordinate s employment his actions necessarily draw upon his superior position over the people who report to himhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30253crs13 61 id at 803 62 id at 805 63 524 us 742 1998 64 id at 748 whereas an employee generally cannot ch eck supervisors abusive conduct the same way that she might deal with abuse from coworker61 while the court recognized that there could be vicarious liability for the misuse of supervisory authority it established the availability of an affirmative defense for employers under this affirmative defense an employer could assert that it exercised reasonable care to prevent and correct any xually harassing beha vior or establish that the employee unreasonably failed to take advantage of any preventive or corrective opportunities provided by the em ployer the court believed that the employers ability to assert such an affirmative defense was consistent with title viis objective of encouraging employers to prevent sexual harassment from occurring62 after applying its new rules to the case at bar the court concluded that the city did not exercise reasonable care to prev ent the supervisors harassing conduct although the city maintained policy against sexual harassment it failed to disseminate that policy to beach employees further the city made attempt to monitor the conduct of the supervisors or assure employees that they could bypass harassing supervisors to register complaints the court revisited the issue of vicarious liability for employers in burlington industries v ellerth companion case to faragher 63 in ellerth the court maintained that an employer may be fo und vicariously liable for harassment by supervisor even if the employee suffers adverse tangible job consequences the petitioner in ellerth alleged that she was subjected to repeated offensive remarks and gestures by midlevel manager who supervised the petitioners immediate supervisor on three occasions the manager made re marks that could be construed as threats to deny the petitioner job benefits for example the manager encouraged the petitioner to loosen up b ecause he could make her life very hard or very easy at burlington64 although burlington maintained policy against sexual harassment the petitioner did not inform anyone in authority about the managers misconduct instead the pe titioner resigned from her position providing reasons unrelated to the harassment three w eeks after her resignation the petitioner informed burlington of her true reasons for leaving while the managers threats suggested th at the claim should be analyzed as quid pro quo claim the court categorized it as hostile environment claim because it involved only unfulfilled threats after reviewing the petitioners claim in terms similar to faragher the court determined that the manager at burlington also misused his supervisory authority the c ourt concluded that burlington should be given the opportunity to assert and prove an affirmative defense to liabilityhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30253crs14 65 527 us 526 1999 66 542 us 129 2004 67 42 usc 2000e et seq 68 524 us 742 765 1998 524 us 775 807 1998 69 pa state police v sude rs 542 us 129 13738 2004the court has also addre ssed the availability of pun itive damages for violations of title vii in kolstad v american dental association 65 the court continued to build on its holdings in faragher and ellerth by concluding that although an employer may be vicariously liable for th misconduct of its supervisory employees it will not be subject to punitive damages if it has made good faith efforts to comply with title vii the court noted th at subjecting employers that adopt antidiscrimination policies to punitive damages would undermine title viis objective of encouraging employers to prevent discrimination in the workplace in 2004 the supreme court considered the defenses if any that may be available to an employer against an employees claim that she was forced to resign because of intolerable sexual harassment at the hands of supervisor as noted above an employer may gene rally assert an affirmativ defense to supervisory harassment under the courts 1998 rulings in faragher and ellerth the defense is not available however if the harassment includes tangible employment actionsuch as discharge or demotion in pennsylvania state police v suders 66 the plaintiff claimed the tangible adverse ac tion was supervisory harassment so severe that it drove the employee to quit constr uctive discharge in effect the court in an opinion by justice ginsburg only justice thomas dissenting accepted the theory of constructive discharge as tangible employment action but it also set conditions under which the employer could assert an affirmative defense and avoid strict liability under title vii of the 1964 civil rights act67 the issue was key to determining the scope of employers vicarious liability in supervisory sexual harassment cases alleging hostile work environment in faragher and ellerth the court had sought to clarify the nature and scope of an employers legal liability for the discriminatory and rassing c onduct of its supervisors in title vii cases it held employers strictly liable for sexually hostile work environment created by supervisor when the challenged discrimination or harassment results in t angible employment action68 but in the absence of such company act the employer may raise an affirmative defense based on its having in place reasonable remedial process and on the employees failure to take advantage of it thus the ellerthfaragher defense has two components that the employer exercised reasonable care to prevent and correct promptly any sexually harassing behavior and b that the pl aintiff employee unreasonably failed to take advantage of any preventative or correc tive opportunities provided by the employer or to avoid harm otherwise69 the supreme court defined tangible employment action categorically to mean any significant change in employment status that may but not always result in economic harm specifically the term includes hiring firing failing

causing significant change in benefits70 however constructive discharge where the employee quits claiming that conditi ons are so intolerable that he or she was effectively fired presented an unresolved issue could an employer faced with claim of constructive discharge still assert the ellerthfaragher defense ultimately the court held that title vii encompasses employer liability for constructive discharge claims attributable to supervisor but ruled that an employer does not have recourse to the ellerthfaragher affirmative defense when supervisors official act precipitates th constructive discharge absent such tangible employment action however th defense is available to the employer whose supervisors are charged with harassment71 in recognizing hostile environment constructiv discharge claims suders enhanced title vii protection for employees who quit their jobs over intense sexual harassment by supervisor but the decision also makes it easier for an employer to defend against such claims by showing that it has reasonable procedures for reporting and correcting harassment of which the employee failed to avail herself only if the plaintiff quits in reasonable response to an employersanctioned dverse action officially changing her employment status or situation for ex ample humiliating demotion extreme cut in pay or transfer to position in which she would face unbearable working condition is the employer made strictly liable for monetary damages or other title vii relief72 moreover even where there has been tangible employment action coupled with constructive discharge or resign ation the employer may have defenses available first the employer may argue that the harassing conduct did not occur as alleged or was not sufficiently severe pervasive or unwelcome to meet standards for title vii violation second if the ta ngible employment action is shown to be unrelated to the alleged harassment or is taken for legitima nondiscriminatory reasons particularly if by persons othe r than the alleged harasser the employer might escape liability finally the employer might be able to demonstrate that whatever form the underlying supervisory harassment may take it did not meet the standard for constructive discharge so intolerable that reasonable person would have felt compelled to resign but suders also makes it more difficult to obtain summary judgment and avoi d jury trials in sexual harassment cases involving constructive discharge claims under the d ecision if there is an real dispute about whether the employee suffered tangible employment action the employer may not rely on the affirmative defens to obtain summary judgment retaliation in 2006 the supreme court issued its decision in burlington northern and santa fe railway

sion encompasses any employer action that would have been ma terially adverse to reasonable employee or job applicant74 this standard which is much br oader than standard that would have confined the retaliati on provision to actions that affect only the terms and conditions of employment generally makes it easier to sue employers if they retaliate against workers who complain about discrimination under the courts interpretation employees must establish only that the employers actions might dissuade worker from making charge of discrimination this means that an employee may successfully sue an employer for retaliation even if the employers action does not actually result in an adverse employment action such as being fired or losing wages recently the supreme court agreed to review crawford v metropolitan government of nashville and davidson county 75 case in which the plaintiff alleges that her participation in sexual hara ssment investigation against her supervisor resulted in her termination lthough the plaintiff cooperate d in the investigation and provided testimony regarding explicit comme nts and actions made by her boss the fact that she had not filed the sexual harassment complaint or other charges with the equal employment opportunity commission eeoc led the lower court to rule that she was not covered under title viis re taliation provision the supreme court is expected to issue decision in the case during its 20082009 term title ix of the education amendments of 1972 title ix of the education amendments of 1972 prohibits discrimination on the basis

83 gebser 24 us at 28384chicago78 the court ruled that an implied righ t of action exists under title ix for student victims of sex discrimination who need not exhaust their administrative remedies before filing suit however the availability of monetary damages under title ix remained uncertain until franklin v gwinnett county public schools79 in franklin female high school student brought an action for damages under title ix against her school district alleging that sh had been subjected to sexual harassment and abuse by teacher although the hara ssment became known and an investigation was conducted teachers and administr ators did not act and the pet itioner was subsequently discouraged from pressing ch arges the court which found that sexual harassment by teacher constituted discr imination on the basis of sex held that damages were available to the sexual harassment victim if she could prove that the school district had intenti onally violated title ix after franklin it was clear that sexual harassm ent by teacher constituted sex discriminati on but the exte nt to which school districts could be held liable for misconduct by its employees was less clear the appropriate standard for measuring school districts liability for sexual buse of student by teacher remained unsettled until the supreme court ruling in gebser v lago vista independent school district 80 in gebser the court determined that school district will not be held liable under title ix for teachers sexua l harassment of student if the school district did not have actual notice of th harassment and did not exhibit deliberate indifference to the misconduct81 the petitioner female high school student was involved in sexual relationship with one of her teachers unlike the situation in franklin the school district did not have act ual notice of any sexual relationship between the petitioner and the teacher until th ey were discovered by police officer the principal of the petitioners school did learn of inappropria comments made by the teacher prior to the discovery but he cautioned the teacher about such comments after the sexual relationship became known the school district quickly terminated the teacher despite the school districts actions the pe titioner argued that the school district should be found liable on the basi s of vicarious liab ility or constructive notice82 in requiring the school district to have actual notice of the harassment the court discussed the absence of an express cause of action under title ix unlike title vii title ix does not address damages or

because title ix does not contain any re ference to the recovery of damages in private actions the court reasoned that its recognition of theories of vicarious liability and constructive notice would allow an unlimited recovery where congress has not spoken85 stated differently the court was reluctant to expand the availability of damages for such theories when title ix fa iled to provide initially for private cause of action in this way the cour t sought to refine its holding in franklin and limit those situations in which remedy for damages would lie the court believed that title ixs remedial scheme would be undermined if it did not require that school district have actual notice of teachers sexual harassment under title ix financial assistance will not be denied until the appropriate person or persons have been advised of the discrimination and have failed to end the discrimination voluntarily86 an appropriate person is an official of the entity receiving funds who has th authority to take corrective action87 because the school district in gebser did not have actual notice of the sexual relationship it could not have taken any steps to end the alleged discrimination in addition the court stated that da mages will not be available unless it is shown that response exhibits deliberate indifference to the discrimination that is there must be an official decision by the recipient not to remedy the violation88 in gebser the school district responded to the s ituation by first cautioning the teacher and then terminating him once the rela tionship was discovered thus the court concluded that the school district di d not act with deliberate indifference davis v monroe county board of education decided in 1999 addressed the standard of liability that should be

the harassment wh ere the harasser is under the schools disciplinary authority and where the harassment is so severe that it can be said to deprive the victims of access to the educa tional opportunities or benefits provided by the school the district may be he ld liable for damages under title ix91 while the development of sex discrimination law under title ix owes much to title vii the davis courts recognition of student onstudent harassment highlights dramatic differences between the two statutes indeed in qualifying the davis standard the court suggested that student harassment may be far more difficult to prove than sexual harassment in employ ment beyond requiring actual knowledge justice oconnor cautioned that sc hools are unlike adult workplaces and disciplinary decisions of school administrat ors are not to be second guessed by lower courts unless clearly unreasonable under the circumstances additionally the majority emphasized that damages are not available for simple acts of teasing and namecalling among school children even where these comments target differences in gender92 in effect davis left to school administrators the task of drawing the line between innocent teasing and actionable sexual harassment difficult and legally perilous task at best in separate decision the same year th court found that private organization is not subject to title ix simply because it receives payments from entities that receive federal financial assistance in national collegiate athletic association v smith 93 the respondent female graduate student alleged that the national collegiate athletic association ncaa discriminated against her on the basis of sex by denying her permission to play intercollegiate volleyball at two federally assisted institutions under ncaa rules graduate student is permitted to participate in intercollegiate athletics only at the ins titution that awarded he r undergraduate degree the respondent who was enrolled at two different universitie s for her graduate degree argued that the ncaa granted more waivers from eligibility restrictions to male graduate stude nts than to female graduate students the court concluded that the ncaa was not recipient of title ix funds because the ncaa did t receive fe deral assistance either directly or through an intermediary instead it received dues payments from member ins titutions the court stated at most the associations receipt of dues demonstrates that it indirectly benefits from the federal assistance afford ed its members this showing without more is
