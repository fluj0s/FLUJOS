the federal government efforts to improve performance background traditional notions of the financial management function typically were confined to the work of government accountants auditors and budget analysts in the view of the former comptroller general charles bowsher as conveyed in an article published in 1985 such narrow concept of financial management in the federal government has not served us well because it has helped perpetuate in agencies fragmented and isolated analyses and reporting that should come together for optimum effect1 according to broad construction formally delineated in general accounting office gao report that same year financial management in the federal government encompasses all or part of the processes and functions of planning and programming budgeting budget execution and accounting and audit and evaluation further all of these component processes need to be supported by fully integrated data and information system2 in the past 25 years congress has enacted series of laws to reform and improve financial management in the federal government the federal managers financial integrity act of 1982 fmfia generally regarded as the first of these measures was intended to strengthen internal controls and accounting systems3 it established reporting requirements whereby the agency head must provide statement on whether the agency has adequate and effective management controls consistent with standards prescribed by the comptroller general and conforming to office of management and budget omb guidelines if the agency is not in

the internal control systems necessary to effectively operate its programs and safeguard its assets and that its accounting systems were antiquated and secondrate5 chief financial officers act the

all federal executive branch agencies the secretary of the treasury in coordination with the director of omb submitted the most recent set to the president and congress in march 2003 as in the five previous years gao once again issued disclaimer indicating it was unable to give an opinion on the statements because of 1 serious financial management problems at dod 2 the federal governments inability to fully account for and reconcile billions of dollars of transactions between federal entities and 3 the federal governments inability to properly prepare the consolidated financial statements13 federal financial management improvement act the federal financial management improvement act ffmia of 199614 built upon the prior legislation and incorporated into statute certain financial system requirements already established as executive branch policy the ffmia established general requirement for cfo agencies to implement and maintain financial management systems that comply substantially with federal financial management system requirements applicable federal accounting standards and the united states government standard general ledger at the transaction level the 1996 law requires auditors to report on agency compliance with these requirements and agency heads to correct deficiencies within certain time periods the law also requires the omb director and the comptroller general in gao to make annual status reports to congress15 new cfo positions in addition three new cfo positions have been created these additions however differ somewhat from the group of the 24 cfo positions previously established in 1993 the law creating the corporation for national and community service cncs provided for chief financial officer to be appointed by the president with

designated by the president with the same authority and duties as other cfos to the extent the president determines appropriate and in the interests of the united states17 therefore the cfo in the eop is also distinct from those in the 24 cfo agencies although the provisions were codified as separate section of the cfo chapter18 both the cfo in the cncs and cfo in the eop are members of the cfo council19 the homeland security act of 2002 provided for third new cfo position20 unlike the appointment procedure for cfos in other cabinetlevel departments the cfo in the department of homeland security dhs is to be appointed by the president with senate confirmation requirement with respect to specific duties and responsibilities of the cfo for dhs sec 103 performance of specific functions states subject to the provisions of this act every officer of the department the cfo included shall perform the functions specified by law for the officials office or prescribed by the secretary21 the

official of the department as the secretary may direct 22 new laws in the 107th congress in addition to the legislation calling for cfo position in the newly created homeland security department the

director regarding requirements of the new law listed 78 executive agencies and commissions now subject to coverage in addition to the prior 24 cfo agencies the director also exercised the provision in the law to waive the requirement during an initial transition period allowing agencies not having prepared audited financial statements in the past to have an exemption for fy200224 in the same memorandum the director noted that the newly covered agencies along with the 24 cfo agencies will all be subject to the provisions of omb bulletin 0109 form and content of agency financial statements beginning with fy200325 this bulletin requires agencies to consolidate their audited financial statements and other financial and performance reports into combined performance and accountability reports and accelerates the deadlines for submission previously cfo agencies had the deadline of 150 days after the end of the fiscal year ie early march to submit the reports but the due date for the combined fy2002 reports was moved up to february 1 2003 next year the reports covering fy2003 will be due by january 30 2004 then beginning with fy2004 the reports will be due by november 15 just six weeks after the close of the fiscal year two agencies the department of the treasury and the social security administration submitted their fy2002 reports within 45 days of the end of fiscal year meeting the new deadline two years ahead of schedule improper payments information act of 2002 the improper payments information act26 was also enacted toward the end of the 107th congress this law requires federal agencies to identify programs that are vulnerable to improper payments and to estimate annually the amount of underpayments and overpayments made by these programs the estimates are to be reported to congress by march 31 following the end of the fiscal year improper payments include any payments that should not have been made or were made in an incorrect amount payments to ineligible recipients for ineligible service duplicate payments or for services not received or that do not account for credit for applicable discounts for any program where improper payments are estimated to to exceed 10 million the agency head is to include report on actions being taken to reduce the improper payments presidents management agenda in addition to these recent legislative actions the presidents management agenda represents an ongoing effort in the executive branch for improving management and performance in the federal government27 one of five government 24 omb requirements of the accountability of tax dollars act of 2002 memorandum for heads of selected executive agencies from mitchell daniels jr dec 6 2002 25 omb form and content of agency financial statements bulletin 0109 sept 25 2001 26 pl 107300 116 stat 2350 nov 26 2002 27 us office of management and budget the presidents management agenda fy2002 continued crs7 wide initiatives coming under the rubric of the agenda is improved financial performance28 aspects of the financial management initiative with respect to the financial performance initiative there is concern with enhancing the quality and timeliness of financial information central element here is the accelerated timetable for submission of the audited financial statements as described above to assist in working toward production of agency financial statements just six weeks after the end of the fiscal year agencies are now required to produce interim financial statements during the fiscal year and as noted above submit their audited financial statements with their annual performance reports in combined performance and accountability report second focus involves reducing erroneous payments usually overpayments of benefits akin to improper payments as recently addressed in the improper payments information act in an initial effort to estimate erroneous payments in major benefit programs prior to enactment of the new law 15 agencies reported to omb their estimates of erroneous payments for 2001 which totaled over 30 billion the largest estimated amounts reported included 121 billion for erroneous payments in medicare 92 billion for earned income tax credit 33 billion for housing subsidy programs and 16 billion for supplemental security income according to the discussion in the budget programwide erroneous payment estimates can only help stem the loss to the federal government in waste fraud and abuse too much of which is taking place without an accounting29 the third area of major emphasis for the financial performance initiative entails strengthening asset management financial statements suggest that the federal government owns some 700 billion in assets consisting of property plant and equipment inventories and related properties and loans receivable the assets reported in the balance sheet are not comprehensive however since national defense assets and land holdings are not captured improving asset management is integral to efforts to improve financial management30 27 continued washington omb 2001 p 1 subsequently referred to as agenda for an overview see crs report

the us government p 41 30 ibid crs8 assessing progress management scorecard to measure progress on the five governmentwide agenda initiatives previewed in the presidents budget submission for fy2003 subsequently it has been updated on quarterly basis by omb the scorecard uses trafficlight motif of green for success yellow for mixed results and red for unsatisfactory for each initiative there are multiple standards for success or core criteria which an agency must meet in order to get green rating there are likewise listings for each initiative of conditions amounting to fatal flaws if an agency displays any one of these it receives red yellow grade applies when an agency is free of red conditions and has achieved some but not all of the core criteria the four core criteria for getting to green on the improving financial performance initiative are as follows financial management systems meet federal financial management system requirements and applicable federal accounting and transaction standards as reported by the agency head accurate and timely financial information integrated financial and performance management systems supporting dayto day operations and unqualified and timely audit opinions on the annual financial statements material internal control weaknesses reported by the auditors31 on the most recent scorecard reflecting status on march 31 2003 only one agency the national science foundation had met all the core criteria and received grade of green for improving financial performance six agencies received yellow while 19 were accorded red indicating failure on at least one of the requisite conditions32 in addition to the current status grades on the scorecard agencies are also given progress score for each initiative green for implementation proceeding as planned yellow for some slippage and red warning of an initiative in serious jeopardy most agencies received higher marks for progress than for current status with respect to improving financial performance 19 received green five yellow and only one red33 omb hopes that status grades for agencies will at least move to yellow by july 1 200434 possible policy concerns the general objective of improving financial performance in the federal government is noncontroversial likewise virtually 31 omb performance and management assessments washington gpo 2003 p 5 this volume was part

security was not graded on progress having just been established 34 jason peckenpaugh omb plans toplevel pressure to move agencies out of red govexeccom daily briefing may 27 2003 crs9 criticism has been directed to the major components of the initiative delineated so far striving toward more timely and accurate financial information reducing erroneous payments made by the government and bringing greater order to the management of federal assets appear beyond reproach legislative action on the two financial management measures in the 107th congress previously discussed might be viewed as congressional endorsement of sort for two of the three components of the initiative the accountability of tax dollars act by expanding the audited financial statements requirement to over 75 more agencies in the executive branch arguably conveyed support for the goal of timely and accurate financial information the improper payments information act provided statutory mandate for collecting information already underway voluntarily in some agencies via the erroneous payment component of the initiative it should be noted however that expanding the agency coverage of audited financial statements and reducing instances of incorrect payments had both received congressional attention in the 106th congress as well prior to announcement by president bush of the agenda35 in order to reap full benefits from more timely and accurate financial data some say such information needs to be taken into account by government decision makers both within the executive branch and congress the financial statements may prove of interest for various facets of congressional oversight likewise some say the clearer identification of overpayments and underpayments may lead to administrative actions to correct deficiencies in program implementation at the same time congress may use the information for oversight hearings or for consideration of possible amendments in the authorizing legislation to remedy existing statutory weaknesses which may have become evident conclusion the accountability of tax dollars act of 2002 and the improper payments information act of 2002 constitute the latest in series of financial management reform measures enacted in the last 25 years the improving financial performance initiative in the presidents management agenda has focused attention in the executive branch on meeting the core criteria for achieving green mark on the scorecard while 19 agencies received green score for progress on the financial performance initiative only one has received green for current status of financial performance by meeting all four of the core criteria as of march 31 2003 despite ombs recent concern with improving federal financial management much remains to be done before all agencies comply with the four core requirements for example the first criterion stipulates that agency heads must be able to report that their financial management systems meet federal management system requirements 35 for example hr 5521 106th congress the accountability of tax dollars act of 2000 was an earlier version of the measure enacted in 2002 also see us congress senate committee on governmental affairs report of senator fred thompson chairman on management challenges facing the new administration committee print 106th cong 2nd sess washington gpo 2000 p 3 regarding the problem of overpayments crs10 and applicable federal accounting and transaction standards since 1982 pursuant to the federal managers financial integrity act agency heads have been reporting annually on nonconformance with governmentwide financial systems requirements according to the reports covering fiscal year 2001 there were 191 instances of nonconformance in the 24 cfo agencies at the beginning and 188 at the end of the year the bulk of these 153 were reported by the defense department but after 20 years of the annual reporting more than half of the agencies reported instances of nonconformance36 continuing emphasis from omb along with attentive congressional oversight may encourage agencies to persevere in the task of improving financial performance so as to arrive at compliance with the four criteria 36 omb financial management status report and governmentwide 5year financial management plan may 1 2002 p 38 available electronically at httpwww
