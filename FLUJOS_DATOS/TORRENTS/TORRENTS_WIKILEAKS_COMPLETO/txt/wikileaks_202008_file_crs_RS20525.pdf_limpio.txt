variety of important us political military and economic interests introduction on december 31 1999 russian president boris yeltsin abruptly resigned six months before the scheduled end of his second term vladimir putin whom yeltsin had elevated from relative obscurity only five months earlier to become russias fifth premier in 18 months automatically became acting president an election was scheduled for march 26 2000 putins political popularity soared soon after he became premier based largely on his tough policy toward the secessionist republic of chechnya and his image as vigorous effective and stable leader putin was almost universally expected to win the election by wide margin the main question being whether he would get over 50 of the vote thus avoiding secondround runoff election the postyeltsin succession is an historic and momentous event russia faces grave challenges to political economic and social stability at home and questions about its role in the world putin who is 47 years old and former kgb foreign intelligence officer has very little of what could be called political track record many consider him political enigma the policies he adopts in dealing with russias political and economic ills could profoundly influence the countrys future course of development matter of serious us interest also putins future national security policies are likely to affect vital us and congressional interests on such issues as containing the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction national missile defense the future of nato geostrategic stability in eurasia and us defense requirementshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20525crs2 1 the oligarchs are immensely rich tycoons accused of using political connections and corrupt practices to win control and ownership of vast previously stateowned assets 2 ie to avoid criminal prosecution for such acts as violently suppressing parliament in 1993 launching the disastrous 19941996 war in chechnya and profiting from crony capitalism and to retain their privileges and riches putins first official act on december 31 1999 was to sign decree exempting all presidents of russia from criminal prosecution after leaving office 3 see crs report rs20437 russias december 1999 legislative election outcome and implications for us interests by james nichol january 18 2000yeltsins resignation yeltsins second term was due to end in june 2000 presidential election was scheduled for june 4 in late 1999 he was the lamest of lame ducks with public approval rating in the low single digits most russians blamed him for the countrys economic and social distress contraction of the gdp by onethird to onehalf wages and pensions chronically in arrears rising unemployment large percentage of the population reduced to poverty high mortality rate and shrinking population and rampant official corruption and criminality yeltsins political problems were compounded by recurrent health crises increasingly erratic leadersh ip burgeoning financial scandals involving his inner circle and association with group of highly visible and unpopular oligarchs1 in the early 1990s yeltsin won reputation as forceful albeit erratic leader with an ambitious reform agenda later as his political liabilities increased his popularity waned and his physical and according to many observers his mental health declined yeltsins political maneuvering appeared to be reduced to little more than personal will to power his abrupt resignation on new years eve surprised most observers he gave little explanation and quickly disappeared from public view the most likely explanation for yeltsins resignation is that he andor his inner circle concluded that there was realistic possibility of extending his rule beyond june 2000 and that their best chance for soft landing2 was to assure politically reliable successor in late 1999 putin was the obvious and virtually the only choice for that role he had been plucked by yeltsin from complete obscurity to head the federal security service the domestic branch of the former kgb in 1998 and then to widespread astonishment as premier year later putin had power base of his own and owed his meteoric rise solely to his kremlin sponsors putins popular support was demonstrated convincingly in the duma election in december 1999 parties whose only distinguishing characteristic were association with putin scored impressive victories the first time prokremlin parties had done well in duma election3 having decided that putin was the preferred successor the yeltsin team manipulated the political process one last time yeltsins resignation advanced the election date from june to march reducing the period during which putin might suffer damaging battlefield reversal in chechnya or some other political embarrassment it also threw putins rivals off balance reducing their time to organize effective campaigns and forcing them to run against an acting president seen as successfully

were viewed in mid1999 as strong contenders however decided not to run two of these former premier yevgenni primakov and moscow mayor yuri luzhkov formed political alliance in opposition to the yeltsin regime primakov became the presumed frontrunner to succeed yeltsin during the duma election campaign they were relentlessly attacked in the statecontrolled mass media and their coalition was decisively defeated both men decided that running against putin was futile primakov eventually endorsed putin aleksandr lebed the charismatic retired army general now governor of krasnoyarsk also decided not to run that left gennady zyuganov head of the communist party and lackluster campaigner as putins main rival some say that zyuganov conceded defeat in advance and was more interested in maintaining working relationship with putin and holding his party together than trying to win the election4 with putins victory seemingly inevitable he was endorsed by large number of national and regional political leaders including all former premiers even the head of the agrarian party endorsed him despite putins advocacy of agrarian land reform which is anathema to the agrarian party when the campaign period officially opened in february putin with huge lead in the polls and the advantages of incumbency and the enthusiastic support of statecontrolled media5 adopted an abovepolitics strategy he declined the free television spots reserved for candidates ads refused to debate his opponents and offered formal political platform6 putin has not had to run traditional campaign broadcast news coverage of the acting president has been so extensive and fawning that some call it all putin all the time the great majority of print and broadcast media have also cast the war in chechnya in the most favorable light for putin heralding military victories minimizing or ignoring military and civilian casualties and denouncing opponents of the war as traitors although putin is taciturn and uncharismatic he has managed to turn this to his advantage in contrast to discredited flamboyant politicians and their excessive promises also although putin is yeltsins chosen successor he benefits from contrasts with the unpopular former president putins youth and physical vigor he has black belt in judo and flies in jet fighter planes and his modest sober nononsense style boost his popularity partly because he seems so unlike yeltsin according to the election law if presidential candidate receives an outright majority of the total votes cast and over 50 of the eligible voters participate then that candidate is the winner if candidate wins simple majority in the first round the two top vote getters compete in run off election three weeks later april 16 if fewer than 50

and the outcome considered all but inevitable some critics referred to virtual election some of the oligarchs and yeltsinloyalists however reportedly tried to deprive putin of an outright majority in the first round their strategy presumably was that if putin were forced into run off he would emerge with weaker mandate and be more dependent on them7 who is vladimir putin putin was born in leningrad now st petersburg on october 7 1952 he graduated from the law department of leningrad state university in 1975 and entered the foreign intelligence branch of the kgb specializing in germanspeaking countries he is fluent in german and speaks some english he served in east germany from 19851990 after returning to leningrad he became associated with one of his former law professors anatoly sobchak who was elected head of the leningrad city council mayor in 1990 sobchak became leading liberal democratic politician and putin rose in the sobchak administration to the position of first deputy head of the st petersburg government in 1994 he was known as tough pragmatic administrator who could get things done one of his responsibilities was attracting and facilitating foreign investment in the city in 1995 putin moved to moscow sponsore d by anatoly chubais another former leningrader and one of the leading kremlin young reformers favored by the west putin initially worked in the kremlin under pavel borodin8 in two years he rose to the position of deputy head of the presidential administration in july 1998 yeltsin appointed putin head of the federal security service fsb russias domesti c security agency and in march 1999 also made him head of the presidential security council despite his rapid advancement up to this point putin maintained very low public profile that changed dramatically in august 1999 when yeltsin dismissed premier sergei stepashin and named putin in his place adding that the littleknown putin was his choice to succeed him as president initially many viewed putin as hapless puppet subject to yeltsins whims but within weeks putins forceful response to incursions into the russian republic of dagestan by radical islamic fighters from chechnya and to terrorist apartment house bombings that killed hundreds in moscow and other cities established putin as russias rising political star radically transforming the political landscape and setting the stage for his election as russias next president in word and deed putins record since yeltsins resignation is ambiguous perhaps intentionally so since he is engaged in an election campaign there is something in putins record to appeal to all parts of the political spectrum some who see him as authoritarian cite such factors as these he spent most of his career in security agencies the kgb and fsb and appointed many colleagues from those agencies to key posts since becoming acting presidenthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20525crs5 his political rise rests on the war in chechnya and the decision to accept high chechen civilian casualties in order to avoid high russian military casualties he has pledged to increase spending on weapons procurement by 50 this year he has increased government control over the mass media which ruthlessly smeared his opponents in the duma and presidential elections and constantly refers to the need to strengthen the state and impose order he opposes amending the russian constitution which concentrates enormous power in the presidents hands and if wielded by more authoritarian and disciplined man than yeltsin could provide the means to move russia away from democratization those who believe that putin seeks western oriented democratic capitalist russia cite the following he was protégé of the liberal reformers sobchak and chubais and worked effectively in st petersburg to promote foreign investment in market economy he refers constantly to the need to strengthen the protection of private property and investors rights in order to attract vitally needed foreign investment he lived abroad for five years understands capitalism and international finance and realizes that russia is so economically weak and dependent on the west that confrontational posture toward nato would be disastrous for russia he overruled his generals and ended russias yearlong confrontatio n with nato resulting from moscows strenuous objections to natos military intervention in kosovo and revived regular operation of the natorussia permanent joint council declaring that russia does not see nato as an enemy some analysts assert that these contradictory indications tend to balance each other with the result that putin should be viewed as pragmatic statist others argue that 1 putins background and history prior to 1999 provide an altogether inadequate basis to predict what sort of president he might be and 2 everything he has said and done since december 31 has to be discounted as part of short intense election campaign therefore they conclude putin should be considered essentially unknown and unpredictable until after the election when he will begin to establish record on which he can be judged putins challenges and their implications for the united states putin as president of russia faces number of major challenges requiring decisions that could shape the course of russias future evolution its role in the world and its relations with the united states in the realm of foreign and defense policy those include us pressure to modify the abm treaty to permit the united states to pursue program of national missile defense nmd this is viewed with alarm in moscow which lacks the financial and technical means to match such program at this time and is cited by duma leaders as reason for their continued delay in ratifying the start ii treaty the missilehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20525crs6 9 lee s wolosky putins plutocrat problem foreign affairs marchapril 2000defense act of 1999 pl 10638 calls for us decision on nmd in 2000 putin faces the same deadline congress and the administration have been pressing moscow to halt its transfer of nuclear reactor and ballistic missile technology to iran including through the iran nonproliferation act of 2000 pl 106178 putin must choose between further antagonizing the united states and risking the sanctions in the new law or halting the technology transfers to iran and risking loss of cooperative relationship with that key regional player as well as billions of dollars from reactor and weapons sales putin has said he will increase russian spending on weapons procurement by 50 this year the defense industrial sector is in desperate condition because of huge cuts in defense spending imposed by the yeltsin regime it is not clear whether russia has the financial means to fund this increase in defense spending nor what the response of the united states and its allies might be possibly expressed through their dominance of international financial institutions ifis such as the imf world bank and london and paris clubs of creditors on which russia is highly dependent some of putins most daunting challenges involve political economy he has described russias economic misery in grimly realistic terms saying that these tasks are his top priority and amount to nothing less than saving the russian state from collapse in order to achieve his stated economic goals putin must build political consensus for moving ahead with specific economic reforms and persuade the duma to enact legislation reforming taxation landowning and commercial law there is entrenched institutional and political opposition to all of these the outcome will be crucial for determining whether the investment climate in russia is transformed an issue of great commercial importance to the united states which is admirably suited to participate on large scale in key sectors of the russian economy such as energy telecommuni cations transportation and food processing the putin government must try to negotiate debtrelief with foreign government creditors the paris club russias foreign debt burden much of it inherited from the soviet period is presently unsustainable by moscow and uncollectable by its creditors the united states is not among the most heavily exposed creditors germany is nevertheless the us voice in ifis such as the paris club is influential and its interests economic and politicalin the outcome are substantial another challenge facing putin is to define his policy toward and relations with the oligarchs who dominate so much of the russian economy and mass media some analysts believe that this will be crucial in determining the prospects for russias transition toward democracy and functioning market economy9 moscow has declared victory in phase one of its military campaign in chechnya and largely ignored us and other criticism of the high human costs after the election will putin modify his uncompromisingly tough policy toward chechnya should the united states and the west define the putin regime in terms of its chechen policy
