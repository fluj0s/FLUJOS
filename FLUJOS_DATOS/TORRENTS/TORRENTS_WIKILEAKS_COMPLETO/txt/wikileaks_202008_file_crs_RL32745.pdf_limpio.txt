its key role as conduit for aid to the antisoviet afghan mujahidin to avoid us nuclear nonprolifera tion sanctions and receive some 600 million annually in us military and econo mic aid underscoring pakistans different agenda some of the radical islamists favored by its military intelligence service later formed the core of qaeda and the taliban crucial us policy challenge is to ga in pakistani cooperation in shutting down the extensive illicit nuclear s upplier network established in the 1990s by the self designated father of pakistans nucl ear bomb abdul qadir khan which provided nuclear enrichment technology to iran libya and north korea while at the same time supporting stability in pakistan and gaining its maximum cooperation against terrorism to date the administration appears largely to have acquiesced in pakistans refusal to allow access to khan by us intelligence officials the administration has been equally reluctant to publicly criticize the musharraf governments apparent use of international arms deal ers to obtain controlled us dualuse technology for its own nuclear wea pons program in violation of us law the 109th congress has been asked by the administration to provide some 698 million in military and economic assistance to pakistan for fy2006 part of five year 3 billion aid package some members of congress have expressed concern that as during the 1980s the urgent need for pakistans cooperation will prevent the administration from dealing forcefully with its nuclear proliferation activities and have introduced legislation that seeks to make us assistance contingent on pakistans cooperation on nuclear proliferation this report 1 briefly recounts previous failed efforts to reconcile american nuclear nonproliferation and other secur

pakistan and south asia first in an often strain ed security relationship spanning more than five decades us and pakistani national security objectives have seldom been congruent pakistan has viewed the alliance primarily in the context of its rivalry with india whereas us policymakers ve tended to view it from the perspective of regional stability and us global security interests mutual security agreements concluded with pakistan in 1954 and 1959 which remain in force were part of the us containment policy towards the soviet union2 second us nuclear nonproliferation objectives towards

the united states unwittingly facilitated the rise of radical antius islamic terrorist movement3 the ranks of qaeda and the taliban include some of the very same radical islamists nurtured by pakistans interservices in telligence isi organization and supported and armed by the cia in the successful ffort to drive the soviet army out of afghanistan some observers view this unwan ted legacy as cause for not losing sight of us nuclear nonproliferation and other interests when seeking to forge closer antiterrorism ties to country that has been major and recent source of the proliferation of nuclear tec hnology and materials and wh ich also faces some degree of risk of itself falling under the control of radical islamists this report seeks in part to explore whether there may be ways

for new five year 3 billion package of us economic and military assistance to pakistan congress also signaled its concern that pakistan was not sufficiently cooperating with us efforts to eliminate aq khans illic it nuclear supply network by revising an existing reporting requirement under the foreign assistance act 1961 amended but did not condition us assistance to pa kistan on the imposing of any specific performancerelated nonpro liferation requirements4 see legislation section at the end of this report in theory achieving the two most critical us policy objectives relating to pakistan defeating radical islamic terrori sm and deterring nucl ear proliferation should be complementary since the acquis ition of nuclear weapons by terrorists is in the words of the vicechairman of the 911 commission former representative lee hamilton the ultimate nigh tmare in practice howev er the historical record shows that the dual american objectives often have been operationally incompatible especially the goals of promoting democracy and preventing nuclear proliferation from that perspective vicechairman hamilton observed at an august 24 2004 hearing of the house international relations committee i think pakistan represents as tough problem as there is in american foreign policy today5 press reports in late december 2004 and early 2005 concerning the covert supply network established by aq khan underscored the challenge of addressing simultaneously the terrorist and nuclear proliferation threats in us policy towards pakistan the new york times reported on december 26 2004 that both the bush administration and the united nations international atomic energy agency iaea had gathered evidence in the middle east and asia indicating that khans network may be much more extensive than previ ously assumed the extent and degree of threat posed by khans network has become apparent through the discovery in libya of plans for an atomic bomb and other elem ents of nuclear starter

possibly nuclear related technology to india7 see details below8 congressional concerns and perspectives in the face of continuing evidence that pakistan remains involved in nuclear proliferation activities some members of congress and some policy analysts and observers are concerned that the united st ates may be ignoring the lessons of the 1980s in again subordinating its nuclear nonproliferation interests to other policy objectives during the 108th congress these concerns were raised by some members of congress in committee hearings and in proposed legislation that did not receive action pending legislation in the 109th congress likewise appears to reflect in part the desire of some members of congress to recalibrate the balance between us counterterrorism and nonprolif eration objectives these initiatives would condition us assistance on more cooperation from paki stan concerning aq khans network and the curtailment of other actions by pakistan to oppose or undermine us efforts to curb nuclear proliferation see details in section entitled legislation at the end of this report httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32745crs5 9 this section was prep ared by richard

and technology this report will not be further updated recommendations of the 911 commission hard choices or the same choices the 911 commission report emphasizes the need for hard choicesand difficult longterm commitments to pakistan9 the report explicitly notes that the need for pragmatic approach inevitably involves compromises with other important us interests such as democracy and nuc lear nonproliferati on the report does not address the issue of where the balance should be struck between supporting the musharraf government as necessa ry means of fighting terrorism perhaps because of its relatively na rrow mandate the 911 commission focused more on the urgency of maintaining stable and cooperative government in islamabad that would remain partner in the war against terrorism and less on pakistans role as source of nuclear proliferation in the view of the 911 commission maintaining close cooperation w ith pakistan in the fight against qaeda and keeping pakistans nuclear capabilities out of the hands of terrorists depends critically on supporting president pervez musharra fs vision of moderate modernizing islamic state the 911 commission addressed only in an oblique manner the issue of pakistans past nuclear proliferation activ ities and the risk of further proliferation emanating from pakistan the reports s ection on pakistan acknowledges but does not dwell on pakistans continuing poten tial to be source of technology and know how for other states or terrorist groups in tent on acquiring nuclear weapons it noted president musharrafs repeated assurances that pakistan does not barter with its nuclear technology but also observed that proliferation concerns have been long standing section of the 911 commission report dealing more generally with the threat of nuclear proliferation takes note of khans role in establishing illegal covert networks for global transfer of nucl ear technology and materials but its recommendations are not pakistanspecific

ce to both countries an act which hurt pakistan far more than india pakistani resentment of us policy in the 19711972 war was particularly deep because of pakistans role in facilitating secret trip to beijing by national security advisor henry kissinger in july 1971 just few months before the war with india which led to the us opening to china the nixon ad ministration disapproved of the military government of pakistans brutal efforts to suppress rebellion in east pakistan and believed that india which it viewed as prosoviet was exploiting the situation but declined pakistans request for military support when its forces became surrounded by the indian army dennis kux the united states and pakistan disenchanted continuedjurisdiction to enable the capture interdic tion and prosecution of smugglers by any state that finds them operating covertly in its territory the report specifically calls for expanding the 2003 proliferation s ecurity initiative psi and the 1991 nunn lugar cooperative threat reduction ctr program the psi emphasizes international cooperation to interdict wmd and ba llistic missile shipments while the ctr concentrates on securing nuclear weapons and other da ngerous materials scattered throughout the territories of the former soviet union which could fall into the hands of terrorists10 instead of hard choices some observers judge that the bush administration and congress have little choice but to provide substantial assistance to pakistan to bolster musharraf and to gain the closest possi ble antiterrorist coope ration from islamabad without regard to issues such as democr acy and nuclear proliferation from this perspective the issue may be less one of choices than following the logic of unpleasant realities the hardest choices ma in fact be those faced by president musharraf given the broad public antipathy in pakistan towards us policy in the middle east including the war in iraq nd support of israel and the widely held misperception that the us war on terrorism is in fact war against islam past as prologue pakistan and the recurrent dilemma of conflicting us policy goals11 the effort to reconcile us nuclear proliferation objectives towards pakistan with more immediate american regional and global security concerns has long and less than encouraging history refere nces by the 911 report to pakistans perception of the united states as an unre liable ally relate di rectly to fundamental differences in us and pakistani expectations of the alliance and the consequent unwillingness of several us administrations to support pa kistan in its wars with india in 1965 and 197112httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32745crs7 12 continued allies washington woodrow wilson center press and baltimore johns hopkins

overthrow by general zia alhuq in 1977 bhutto partly justified his role in seeking nuclear weapons capability for pakistan by observing that there was christian bomb jewish bomb and hindu bomb and vowing that pakistan would build an islamic bomb in this particular context bhuttos use of th phrase appears related to his resentment of the perceived discrimination against pakistan on the part of

pakistan concentrated on obtaining nuclear mate rials and technology from abroad and by whatever means successful us diploma tic efforts in the late 1970s to prevent france from delivering uranium

three decades later the december 1979 soviet invasion of afghanis tan created quick reversal of us nuclear proliferation and other security polic priorities president carters national security advisor

more circumscri bed in 1990 president bush informed congress that he could l onger make such certifica tion and that most economic and all military assistance to pakistan would be suspended22 the 911 commissions references to pakist ans belief that past us support has been selfserving relate in large part to this devel opment even though islamabad had ample warning that its nuclear activities were putting its assistance in jeopardy although the us government denied th charge pakistani commentators asserted that the imposition of sanctions was directly related to 1989 withdrawal of the soviet

economic and military sanctions required by us foreign assistance law on both countries pakistan subsequently became ineligible for most forms of us aid for other r easons see below the reaction of the president and congress appeared to reflect several factors including decline in the belief of the efficacy of sanctions once the tests were fait accompli efforts by us agricultural interests to prevent loss of markets and the rising influence of the india caucus in congress legislation passed in july 1998 made pakistan eligib for agricultural export credits to buy us winter wheat while

the activities of aq khan and his network others question the whether pakistan is fully committed to fighting the war against terrorism let alone exercising nuclear restraint among the most serious sources of concern is the welldocumented past involvement of some memb ers of the armys interservices intelligence isi organization with qaeda and the taliban and the possibility that some officers retain sympathies with both groups in the words of one analyst pakistans official alliance with the united states in the war on terror has only increased the danger posed by alqaeda sympathizers within its nuclear establishment25 these considerations are seen as significant factor in musharrafs refusal to provide adequate information about aq khans network some observers argue that without additional nonprolifer ation policy initiatives beyond those already adopted by the bush administration embracing nd supporting musharraf is an inadequate response to danger posed by pakistans nuc lear establishment and its past role as possibly the most important single source of nuclear proliferati on to radical states even if president musharrafs assuran ces are taken at face value pakistan remains significant source of prolif eration risk still outside the nuclear nonproliferation treaty pakistan is not bound by that treatys prohibitions on nuclear weapon states transferring nucl

overseen by lead scientist at the pakistan atomic energy commission paec which did not enjoy krls high public profile that scientist samar mubarikm and may have known of khan s activities and may even have used khan and krl as decoy to divert attention from paec where the most critical work on nuclear wea pons was being carried out73 whether president musharrafs delicate treatment of khan following the revelations of his activities reflects some level of official culpability is arguable it has been pointed out that despite evid ence that he had committed serious breaches of pakistani law khan was allowed by musharraf himself to keep the many millions of illgotten dollars while two former elected prime ministers had been exiled and barred from political office for corruption charges involving far less money74 likewise it appears that the pakistani government was at very minimum incredibly lax in responding to rumors of his activities even be fore pakistans may 1998 nuclear test

there was evidence that the top officials of the pakistani government were complicit in or approved of khans proliferation activities the bush admin istration has found insufficient evidence to

commissions best hope label for musharraf himself as myopic and repetitive of past us reliance on pakistani military regimes especially in light of their view that pakistans uncertain political stability is rooted in musharrafs policies and in the pe rsonal support he receives from the united states124 president musharraf remains generally popular figure in pakistan but he has been an object of hatred for islamic radicals including those affiliated with domestic and international terrorist organizations march 2004 survey found that 86 of pakistanis view musharraf fa vorably with 60 viewing him very favorably but 65 also said that they support osama bin laden musharrafs government depends on an alliance of six islamist parties which use the acronyms mma united action front in english to maintain majority in the national parliament the same alliance controls the assemblies in two provinces bordering afghanistan baluchistan and the northwest frontier province nwfp125 the support of the islamist parties has been broug ht into question by musharrafs decision to break his commitment to step down as army commander at the end of the year promise he made in 2003 to secure the support of six islamic partie s in parliament the bargain struck with the islamic parties served both to maintain governing majority in the national assembly and to secure passage of an amendment the 17th to the pakistani constitution which among other things legitimatized musharrafs 1999 military coup126 the response to musharrafs indication that he would remain army chief until the end of

musharraf129 doubts about musharrafs popul arity have been echoed by leading pakistani analyst who contends that all of the paki stani presidents major policy shifts after september 2001 have come through compulsion by external pressure or events and that while the direction of pakistans policy change has been appropriate the momentum of change is too slow and awkward and unsure to constitute critical and irreversible mass130 many leading pakistani commentators insist that only by allowing the countrys secular political par ties fully into the system can the country realize stable and enduring democracy131 american policy makers however gene rally agree with the 911 commission that us interests are for the time being best served by the presence of strong and secure islamabad leadership thus while early optimism about musharrafs potential as reformer has waned considerably there are those who still conclude that the existence of an unstable and possibly islamicized or

is the issue of political succession in pakistan especially as it relates to potential domestic upheaval and control of that countrys nuclear arsenal133 the constitutionally designated successor to the president is the chairman of the senate currently member of the militaryfriendly pakistan muslim leaguequaideazam pmlq party and musharraf loyalist muhammadmian soomro an international banker from wellknown sindhi family it is the presidents prerogative to appoi nt army chiefs the consensus view among analysts has the pakistani military maintaining its substantive administration of the country in the event of president musharrafs premature removal the nature of such potential removal likely would influence the scope and intensity of military governance for example if musharraf were removed through violent means it is quite possible that the army would declare martial law and rule directly for period in any case it is widely assumed that the hierarchical solidarity and historic professionalism of pakistans military would result in its continued effectiveness as stabilizing force at least in the short and perhaps middleterm despite the apparent sturdiness of the militarys command structure there remains widespread pessimism about the ability of political institu tions built by musharraf to survive his sudden removal and doubts remain about the viability of political succession mechanisms134 after his september 2001 policy shift musharraf moved to purge protaliban islamists from the higher ranks of the military in october 2001 musharraf promoted trusted associate lieutenant general m uhammad yusuf chief of the general staff of the pakistan army to the rank of gene ral and appointed him as vice chief of the army staff vcos the seniormost position after musha

that pakistan continues to be involved in the illegal acquisition of nucl ear materials and technology to modernize its existing nuclear forces and at minimum allows the activities of nuclear supply networks on its territory such networks ma still be involved in supplying nuclear materials technology and knowhow to wouldbe nuclear states or even terrorist networks in addition pa kistans nuclear arsena l and fissile material may be vulnerable to seizure in the even t of coup by dissident military officers or the seizure of power by radical islamis ts with sympathy for terrorist groups moreover if not carefully handled us policies aimed at strengthening pakistan militarily could unintentionally upset current positive trends in pakistans relations with india that involve considerable politi cal risk for both governments resolving or deferring final settlement of the thus far intractable kashmir dispute would greatly benefit both us s ecurity counterterrorism nd nonproliferation

expressed strong objections to the sale of the p3c surveillance aircraft and the tow antitank missiles144 within the constraints imposed by pendence on antiterrori st cooperation from pakistan us policymakers still may have several options for pursuing stronger antiproliferation policy while maintaining pakistans status as front line state in the war against terrorism possible approaches include option 1 facto accepta nce of pakistans nuclear activities and noncooperation on the aq khan issue on condition of maximum counterterrorism support although the united states may appear to have little choice but to support musharraf the degree of us support matte rs greatly one option which appears to approximate current policy is to provide largescal economic and military support to pakistan conditioned only on satisfactory pakistani c ooperation against terrorism the 911 commission report argues that pres ident musharraf is the best hope for stability in pakistan and afghanistan nd an advocate of enlightened moderation the commission recommends that as the united states makes fresh commitments now it should make promises that it is prepared to keep for years provided pakistans leaders are prepared to make difficult choices of their own145 the advantages of this course are that it reduces pakistani suspicion that in the words of the 911 commission report the ited states views pakistan as an ally of convenience the underlying rationale fo r this option is that the more confidence that president musharraf has in the us commitment to pakistan the more ready he will be to confront terrorism for several reasons the nonproliferati on benefits of this option appear few while the risks may be high this option does not fully address the limits of musharrafs authority in regard to antiterrorist cooperation with the united states and it limits pakistans hard choices to the fight against extremists not its nuclear behavior despite its st rong support for the musharraf government the bush administration has not yet obtained full pa kistani cooperation against qaeda and the taliban if musharraf should adopt zerotolerance policy of shutting down all terrorist networks he risks possibly fatal backlash from extreme nationalist and islamist elements of the military and militants carrying out an insurgency in indian occupied kashmir as well as the loss of support from his current political allies among the islamist partieshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32745crs39 146 isi on musharraf benazir sharif powersharing deal hindustan times dec 5 2004 147

oderate military succe ssor continues to maintain political dominance for the next few years there is absolute guarantee that pakistan will continue its front line status against the taliban and qaeda much could depend on pakist ans volatile political situation already islamist political forces are impatient with musharrafs vision of moderate modernizing islamic state and measures however incomplete to suppress domestic jihadists in baluchistan and the northwest frontier pr ovince and terrorist groups operating in kashmir even now some in the pakistani hier archy are not prepared to support us policy to the point of compromising in th eir view pakistans long term fundamental interests some analysts judge it unlikely that the isi would ever completely alienate the taliban evidence that more than one assassination attempt against musharraf involved collusion between radical islamis ts possibly qaeda operatives and lower level pakistani air fo rce personnel underscores th at the military continues to be susceptible to ideological fissures radical political change may be unlikely under present circumstances but violent islamis t campaign against the government or an internal coup cannot be completely ruled out questions about musharrafs ability to c ontrol events appear to be underscored by rumors in late 2004 and early 2005 that he has been engaged in secret negotiations on power sharing agreement with the leaders of the two previous governing parties the pakistan peoples party ppp led by benazir bhutto and the pakistan muslim league pml led by nawaz sharif under one rumored deal musharraf would remain president at least until 2007 but he would give up his position as chief of the army staff move also demanded by his current mma allies and hold fresh parlia mentary elections in 2005 bo th bhutto and sharif had alternated as civilian prime ministers during the 1990s but both had been overthrown by military c oups and both are now in exile146 while such development would likely be viewed as positive step toward s democratization decision by musharraf to end his alliance with the mma could provoke new political crisis moreover the very fact that the arrangement has been rumored raises questions about pakistans stability at the same time questions remain about pakistans nuc lear policies the us government cannot verify the musharraf g overnments assurances that aq khans nuclear sales were not stat policy and would not be re peated moreover although pakistan firmly ruled out any limits on its vertical proliferation activities ie building more nuclear weapons and depl oying more capable ballistic missiles humayun khans acquisition of us tec hnology in collaboration with the south african arms dealer asher karni appears to belie this claim

the stability and moderation offered by musharraf in terms of unilateral options that do not directly undercut uspakistani cooperation against terrorism one us offici has said that ultimately the first and best line of defense as regards ussource technology is the vigilance and cooperation of us companie s that sell sensitive technology reportedly french company refused to sell triggered spark gaps to karni because he did not have us export license148 it appears that the discovery of karnis activities occurred only by luck and the vigilance of one company whereas earlier purchases of sensitive technology had been delivered for instance the united states could further increase its assistance to and intelligence and law enforcement cooperation with south africa currently country with weak enforcement of its stringent ws against the export of dualuse technology to nonnsg countries should south africa continue to demonstrate weak enforcement of its laws against the unli censed exports of nucl earrelated technology the us government could unilaterally suspend south africas privileges as member of the nuclear suppliers group to import sensitive us technology without an export license it is likely however that such move would be opposed by some nsg countries if for other reason than that their own enforcement of export controls may have weaknesses option 2 emphasize multilateral nonproliferation strategies this approach recommended in the 911 report involves concentrating on the recipient or enduser side of the equation as the most effective way to deny nuclear weapons and materials to terrorists that is it emphasized measures to seek to close off global supply networks rather than pena lizing pakistan or even demanding full account of aq khans activities

not provide pakistan with high value military hardware without dr amatically improved coopera tion on the aq khan case and other activities linki ng pakistan to nuclear proliferation the united states might insist on the following actions by pakistan as price for obtaining valued military equipment especially weapons system s that are not directly related to counterterrorism cooperation such as f 16 aircraft antitank weapons and other weapons systems that pakistan is seeking to upgrade its military forces and offset or qualitatively exceed the capabilities of indi an weapons this option could also include longerterm waiver authority on us nuclear and missile proliferation sanctions beyond the current yeartoyear extensions in appropriations bills this option could require pakistans agreement to full cooperation on aq khans network full cooperation also regarding the asher karnihumayun khannetwork strict observance of us export c ontrol laws by the government of pakistan the pakistani military and any third party intermediaries absolute commitment on future transfers of nuclear or missiletechnology and new nuclear tests and restraint on nuclear and missile competitionwith india key rationale key rationale for this option is that providing pakistan with such high value weapons systems is only wa rranted if the benefits exceed the cost in this case the cost to the united states is not just the dollar value of the weapons systems but also the inevitable complications for relations with india country with which the united states also has developed facto strategic relationship even if new delhi is also allowed access to coveted us defens technology as now seems likely the record of the past half century shows that india will seek to match every increase in pakistans military capability and viceversa one of the most problematical aspects of selling f16s to pakistan is that in the words of one study the f16 could be pakistans primary nuclearcapable

relationship for what it is getting from pakistan158 potentially risky test of wills potentially significant problem with this option is that so long as islamabad per ceives that the bush administration needs it more than pakistan needs the united states musharraf or successor is in position to turn the tables on us policymakers that is instead of treating the f16s or other weapons systems as carrot to be earne d by additional coopera tion pakistan could reduce or limit its cooperation on terrorism as lever to get the united states to agree to allow the purchase of the aircraft and ot her desired hardware in fact some of president musharrafs remarks at press conference during visit to washington in early december 2004 several months be fore the administration announced its willingness to approve the sale of the f16s could be interpreted as effort to put counterpressure on the united states musha rraf told reporters th at he had discussed the f16 issue with president bush and senior us officials but that the administration had not yet agreed to the requested purchase at the same time musharraf also implied declining enthusiasm for using pakistani forces to hunt for qaeda in tribal zone between pakistan and afghanistan wher many believe bin laden and other senior terrorist leaders may be hiding he reportedly criticized the us invasion of iraq and said that the tr ail of osama bin laden had gone cold in large part because of decline in operations by us forces in afghanistan and delays in the training of afghan forces159 although using the offer to sell f16s to pakistan as leverage to gain more cooperation regarding aq khans networ k or other objectives could backfire musharrafs domestic politi cal vulnerabilities noted bove might give the united states the upper hand in any test of wills moreover conditioning the sale of f16s on better responsiveness by pakistan to u s nuclear nonprolifer ation concerns may be the least risky of the options that i nvolve putting pressure on pakistan but the viability of this option depends on many factors that are outside us control and even that of musharraf because of his somewhat precarious domestic

to india in the context of new framework of cooperation which might also include the sale of ballistic missile defense technology and even cooperation on nuclear energy in response to questions from the press the briefer denied that the sale of f16s to pakistan would be destabilizing arguing that while the numbers of aircraft provided to pakistan would be relatively small perhaps in the neighborhood of 25 th indian government was contemplating very large scale purchase160 whether the administrations decision to approve the request might be the result of successful strategy to gain mo re cooperation on aq khans network and qaeda cannot be determined from open sources should there be link to pakistans new cooperation with the iaea some critics of the administrations handling of pakistans nuclear activities may question the value of the tradeoff when questioner at the march 25 2005 press briefing commented that the announcement came shortly after pakistan announced that it would allow iaea inspectors to look at some nuclear parts161 to aid its investigation of irans nuclear program the state department briefer responded that we dont want to get into the details of our

margin ie twothirds or more to overcome presidential veto the fact that the administration has announced its intent to resume sales of f16s to pa kistan does not affect congre ss powers as of midmay
