editi news breaking news may 2012 the second tranche of deep dive processing capability at rpc has gone live in addition 2 extra logs are being processed at opc this brings the current deep dive1 capability to cpc with 16 x 1 qgr opc with 7 x 1 og rpc1 with 23 x log this gives over 300 gchq and 250 nsa analysts access to huge amounts of data to support the target discovery mission the mti programme would like to say big thanks to everyone who has made this possible which includes m llhtga tea ssmc ssos gte acd opplec it services r1 at nsa ahs and true collaborative effort tempo ra was delivered by the mti enhanced discovery swimlane led by iart of the mti sicint apps theme led by pm and editi tempora tempqra is an internet buffer capability being delivered by mti ipp and gte for joint mission benefit it builds upon the key success of the tint experiment and will provide vital unique 1 of 3 capability to misdmce communities tempo is the codeword for gchqs internet buffer business capability as whole which is the ability to loosely promote of traffic across gchqs sse access into repository which will keep the content and its associated metadata for periods of time approximately 3 days for content and up to 30 days for metadata to allow retrospective analysis and forwarding to follow on systems tempora as capability is agnostic of the technologies used to promote that traffic and to store that traffic and so should not be used as codeword for the individual components eg xks mvr etc at the moment the components include amongst others gchq ssh access pokerface sanitisation xks in various configurations and it will include mvr in the very near future tempora also covers the management of the rules used to promote traffic into the internet buffer capability tempora is not processing centre specific at the moment there are instances of tempora at all xpc namely cpc opc and rpc1 these should be referred to when required as opccpcrpc1 tempora edit bit more detail tempora are gchqs largescale deep dive deployments on special source access sse deep dive xkeyscores work by promoting loose categories of traffic eg all web email social chat ea vpn voip from the bearers feeding the system and block all the highvolume low value traffic eg p2p downloads this usually equates to 30 of the traffic on the bearer we keep the full sessions for 3 working days and the metadata for 30 days for you to query using all the functionality that keyscore offers to slice and dice the data the aim is to put the best 75 of our access into temporas comprising mix of deep dive keyscores and promotion of data based on ip subnet or technology type from across the entire mvr at the moment users are able to access 46x1 ogs of data via existing internet buffers this is lot of data not only that but the longrunning tint program and our initial 3month operational trial of the cpc internet buffer the first operational internet buffer to be deployed show that every area of ops can get real benefit from this capability especially for target discovery and target development internet buffers are different from tint in that the latter is purely an experimental research environment whereas internet buffers can be used operationally for epr effects enabling cne etc for more detailed depiction of how tempora and tint differs please see here edit contacts n eime role gte xks senior user mti sigint apps theme lead enhanced discovery project manager enhanced discovery xks sme 2 of 3
