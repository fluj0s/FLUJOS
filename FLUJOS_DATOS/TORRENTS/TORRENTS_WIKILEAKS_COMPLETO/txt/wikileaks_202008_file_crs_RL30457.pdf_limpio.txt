the administration routinely submits requests for supplemental appropriations for the current fiscal year by late april 2000 through several submissions to congress president clinton had requested 5

million for diplomatic support and economic aid related to kosovo and the balkans 210 million for poor country debt relief 600 million for home energy assistance to low income american families affected by high home heating oil prices and weather emergencies and 426 million for domestic disaster relief that mostly involves ongoing post1999 hurricane cleanup efforts the administration designated nearly all as emergency requirements for fy2000 thereby eliminating the need to reduce existing appropriations to offset the costs of additional spending the white house proposed limited number of offsets rescissions transfers and delays in funding obligations totaling about 750 million the fy2000 supplemental request continues pattern of the past few years in which the president has asked and congress has approved large supplementals generally focusing on defense foreign policy and domestic natural disasters and farm relief initiatives in most cases congress has increased the presidents proposed supplementals adding funds especially for domestic programs and defense continuing controversy however has been the extent to which new appropriati ons should be offset by cuts in existing funds since fy1997 congress has agreed to declare most supplementals as emergencies adding small amount of offsets the house and senate tool different legislative approaches during consideration of the supplemental requests on march 30 2000 the house passed 128 billion fy2000 supplemental appropriation measure hr 3908 about 75 billion higher than the presidents 5 billion request

for hurricane floyd cerro grande fire and other natura l disaster relief and 600 million for the low income heating and energy assistance program hr 4425 however rejects funding for poor country debt relief and most balkan assistance the legislation further includes change in the payment dates for social security and veterans benefits that will result in 42 billion higher spending in fy2000 rather than fy2001 some senators oppose this switch in payment schedules and reportedly obtained senate leadership agreement to attempt to rescind these provisions legislation considered in july earlier the house and senate took different legislative paths in considering the presidents 57 billion supplemental request the house took up single fy2000 supplemental bill hr 3908 passing 128 billion measure on march 30 the senat however decided to attach supplemental money to regular fy2001 appropriation bills s 2521 military construction passed by the senate on may 18 s 2522 foreign operations passed by the senate on june 22 and s 2536 agriculture reported by the committee on may 10 combined the three senate measures recommended 86 billion in fy2000 supplemental spending ultimately congressional leaders decided to use hr 4425 the housepassed military construction appropriation as the vehicle for all supplemental issues background early in each new session of congress the adminis tration routinely submits requests for supplemental appropriations for the current fiscal year such proposals may include items rejected or deferred during congressional consideration of regular appropriations requests the previous session new requirements arising since enactment of appropriations for the current fiscal year or more routine matters that are anticipated and generally noncontroversial the president may also ask that congress rescind or cancel funds previously appropriated often these rescissionshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30457crs2 are proposed to offset some of the costs of the new supplemental proposals part or all of supplemental request may be deemed as an emergency thereby avoiding the requirement under budget laws to find equivalent savings to offset the added costs of new initiatives the president may submit the supplementals and rescissions in multiple packages over the course of several months during the final months of the first session of the 106th congress congressional leaders and administration officials had informally discussed additional funding requirements for two major foreign policy and defense issues major counternarcotics initiative to assist colombia in fighting its growing drug production problem and kosovo peacekeeping operations and economic aid although neither became part of endofthesession budget negotiations that culminated in passage of the consolidated appropriations act fy2000 pl 106113 in midnovember it was widely anticipated that additional funding proposals for these two activities would form the core elements of an fy2000 supplemental appropriation in february march and april 2000 president clinton sent congress several supplemental proposals totaling 57 billion in addition to the large requests for colombia 955 million and kosovo 26 billion the white house also seeks 210 million for us contribution to the heavily indebted poor country initiative hipc 620 million to help americans cope with the impact of rapidly increasing home heating oil prices roughly 426 million for domestic disaster relief programs mostly related to post1999 hurricane cleanup efforts and after house debate 200 million for flood relief in mozambique and southern africa the fy2000 supplemental request continues pattern of the past few years in which the president has asked and congress has approved large supplementals generally focusing on defense foreign policy and domestic natural disasters and farm relief initiatives last year congress enacted 152 billion supplemental pl 106 31 hr 1141 providing funds for kosovo military and humanitarian aid operations and military readiness 12 billion farm assistance 609 million and central american aid for victims of hurricane mitch 1 billion in 1998 congress passed two supplemental measures the first 54 billion package enacted in early may pl 105174 hr 3579 included funding largely for defense operations in bosnia and iraq and various domestic natural disasters the second debated in the final days of the 105th congress and incorporated into the omnibus consolidated and emergency supplemental appropriations act pl 105277 hr 4328 totaled 208 billion in new spending for among other things farmers affected by low commodity prices 58 billion us embassy security overseas in the wake of terrorist attacks in kenya and tanzania 24 billion american forces in bosnia and other defense readiness requirements 66 billion and y2k computer conversion efforts 34 billion one of the most controversial issues during each of these debates was over the question of how to pay for the additional spending to declare most of the items as emergency requirements or offset new funds with cuts in existing appropriations frequently targeting domestic programs normally when seeking suppleme ntal funds for the current fiscal year the administration recommends prompt congressional action within few months to meet what are either unanticipated requirements or needs that cannot wait until the regular appropriations cycle congress generally begins action on earlyyear supplemental requests in march and completes debate by may it is not unusual forhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30457crs3 1 three weeks after house debate on hr 3908 the white house submitted another supplemental request 200 million for relief of flood victims in mozambique and southern africacongress to expand significantly the presidents supplemental proposal as occurred for each of the three supplementals cited above adding funds for host of additional programs that were not anticipated at the outset of the debate major funding elements of the supplemental and congressional action the presidents supplemental request included five major spending initiatives for counternarcotics programs in colombia peacekeeping and reconstruction aid for kosovo and the surrounding region debt relief for poor developing countries home energy assistance for low income families affected by rising home fuel oil costs and weather emergencies and cleanup and repair operations remaining from hurricanes that struck the united states in 1999 house and senate bills added sixth

detailed information of new spending and offsets congressional debate overview house consideration during its march 9 markup the house appropriations committee agreed to 91 billion fy2000 supplemental appropriation measure hr 3908 adding about 38 billion to the presidents then55 billion request the house panel increased funding for the counternarcotics initiative in colombia and the andean region added 24 billion for dod petroleum cost increases and health programs and raised the presidents request for domestic natural disaster relief by about 11 billion the committee supported the full 2 billion for dod peacekeeping operations in kosovo but pared back by over 350 million economic aid to kosovo and the balkans hr 3908 as reported recommended the requested 600 million for lowincome home energy assistance but rejected 210 million for poor country debt relief during two days of debate the house approved an amendment by representative lewis adding 4 billion for various defense department activities focusing on quality of life and readinessrelated programs such as recruiting advertising and retention health care programs and weapons maintenance the house further adopted an amendment by representative weldon that provides 100 million for local community fire company assistance the house also approved proposal by representative toomey to appropriate from the onbudget surplus 4 billion to reduce the public debt the house rejected 108315 however representative sanford amendment that would have cut 16 billion from the bill by deleting all nonemergency appropriations and removing each emergency designation for other accounts this would have had the affect of triggering sequestration by whatever amount the bill exceeded the budget caps or requiring the insertion ofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30457crs4 2 see statement by the president march 30 2000 and statement of administration policy on hr 3908 march 29 2000 each is available at the white house web site httpwwwwhitehousegovoffsets to avoid sequestration the sanford amendment exempted defense and disaster relief funds from sequester if one occurred in many respects the administration supported the housepas sed measure especially funding included for military operations in kosovo counternarcotics activities in colombia victims of hurricane floyd and energy aid for americans affected by rising oil costs the white house however was also concerned about areas that are not funded in hr 3908 embassy security for us diplomatic personnel in kosovo peacekeeping operations in east timor and kosovo and debt relief for poor developing nations officials further expressed alarm that the growing price tag of the supplemental would generate opposition and delay final enactment something they said would begin to erode us military readiness if the kosovo money was not approved in particular the administration opposed the lewis amendment adding 4 billion for defense qualityoflife activities that officials contended were not needed until next year2 table 1 fy2000 supplemental summary s millions request house senate conf counternarcotics for colombia 9550 14185 11679 13191 kosovo

billion in new budget authority in fy2000 that is not reflected in the totals in this or other tables included in this report senate consideration partially because of the rising levels of funds added to hr 3908 the senate did not schedule consideration of the supplemental bill senate leaders decided instead to include elements of the fy2000 supplem ental request during debate on three of the first regular fy2001 appropriation bills considered byhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30457crs5 3 although senate leaders hoped this would speed up final enactment of supplemental spending differences in house and senate schedules for taking up the 13 appropriation bills complicated swift consideration of the foreign operations measure the senate committee reported its foreign operations bill s 2522 on may 9 but the house appropriations panel did not consider its bill until june 27 because of disputes unrelated to the appropriations issue minority leader daschle objected to the senate proceeding with consideration of foreign operations citing senate regular order that calls for debate on appropriation bills only after house passage consequently the senate could not pass and schedule conference meetings on the three fy2001 funding bills that included supplemental appropriations 4 s 2521 further provides 809 million for coast guard drug interdiction and other requirements under the counternarcotics and plan colombia title the coast guard funds however are not directly part of plan colombia 5 the house has adopted related amendment to the defense department authorization bill hr

operations s 2522 and agriculture s 2536 containing fy2000 supplement spending following amendments adopted during senate debate and passage of military construction on may 18 the combined amount recommended by the senate bills for fy2000 totaled about 86 billion the level was about 355 billion more than the presidents request but 38 billion less than the consolidated 128 billion house bill senate measures s 2521 and s 2522 recommended about 12 billion for plan colombia level somewhat less than the house and the administrations combined request for fy2000fy2001 of 136 billion4 s 2521 cut funding to 1825 billion for dod operations in kosovo raising objections from administration officials who said it would result in transfers from regular army programs to kosovo costs and reduce army readiness s 2522 deferred all additional reconstruction aid to the region until fy2001 the most controver sial issue concerning kosovo peacekeeping was senate appropriations committee amendment that cut off spending for us forces in kosovo after july 1 2001 unless an extension was authorized by congress the white house threatened to veto s 2521 because of the committee amendment during floor debate of s 2521 on may 18 however the senate adopted levin amendment 5347 deleting the funding cut off provision from the bill5 for other defense department spending items s 2521 added about 22 billion mainly for health programs and oil price increases but did not include the roughly 4 billion additional funds included in hr 3908 for dod quality of life activities in s 2536 and s 2521 the

leftist guerrillas deal with human rights violations in the colombian army control the corrupting influence of drug trafficking and recover from an economic decline members of congress are facing the issue of whether and under what circumstances us assistance can ameliorate the countrys problems6 in this context the presidents request for 955 million in fy2000 emergency supplemental assistance for counternarcotics and related initiatives in colombia and other andean countries has proved highly controversial much of the controversy has revolved around the conditions that should be attached to colombian aid some 500 million of which would be spent on 1 helicopters intended to transport colombian army counternarcotics battalions to conduct counternarcotics cn operations in souther n colombia where coca cultivation is expanding rapidly 2 training and equipping two new cn battalions which would join the cn battalion trained by the united states in 1999 in conducting such operations and 3 logistics and intelligence support for colombia because of reports documenting ties between colombian army units and illegally armed rightist paramilitary groups which us officials state engage in drug trafficking and killing those that they suspect of collaborating with leftist guerrillas some members argue that the assistance should be conditioned on the prosecution and trial of members of the military who assist paramilitary groups preferably by civilian courts some argue that the army should not receive any us assistance either on the grounds that us aid should continue to target special counternarcotics police forces which would receive some 68 million in support from thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30457crs7 supplemental or that assistance to the army will inevitably draw the united states into colombias decadeslong counterinsurgency effort against two leftist guerrilla groups others wonder whether the united states should be providing any assistance at all fearing that the united states will inadvertently be drawn into vietnamlike quagmire still others favor still greater assistance designed to combat guerrillas other issues are whether the proposals 74 million in fy2000 support for alternative employment and economic development programs outlined for colombia is sufficient and whether the proposal includes enough funding for other andean nations under the proposal brazil bolivia ecuador peru and venezuela would receive about 76 million in funding for their own counternarcotics and alternative development programs some 38 million would be allotted for the improvement of forward operating location fol in manta ecuador from which us planes fly counternarcotics surveillance missions over the andean region congressional action the house appropriations committee recommended 14 billion for plan colombia combining the administrations separate 127 billion fy2000fy2001 requests into the supplemental hr 3908 strengthened regional elements of plan colombia by increasing economic assistance to peru bolivia and ecuador by 61 million above the administrations fy2000fy2001 proposal the committee s bill further shifted 26 million for the purchase of two blackhawk helicopters from funding for colombian army counternarcotics battalions to the colombian national police during house floor debate lawmakers rejected several amendments to cut plan colombia funding representative obey amendment would have cut 552 million from the counternarcotics section sum representing the entire budget for the push into southern colombia initiative the obey amendment also would have provided for subsequent vote in july under expedited procedures to restore these funds 186 239 representative pelosi amendment would have deleted 51 million from department of defense funding the cost of the dod element of the push into southern colombia initiative proposal by representative ramstad would have deleted the entire 14 billion plan colombia funding plus the 300 million for dea domestic drugrelated activities 158262 and representative paul amendment would have cut counternarcotics and other kosovo and east timor funding 45367 the house however adopted two amendments pertaining to colombia one offered by representatives gilman goss delahunt and farr approved 38039 attaches four conditions to plan colombia funding for military aid to be distributed the president must certify that colombia 1 has implemented strategy to eliminate coca and opium production by 2005 2 allowed the head of its military to dismiss personnel found violating human rights 3 assured cooperation between the military and civilian authorities in the investigation and prosecution of human rights violators and 4 developed judge advocate general corps for the colombian military the amendment also earmarks funding for monitoring the armed forces guerrillas and paramili tary groups and provides that any supporters of the latter two should be denied visas to the united states the president can waive the four conditions if required by extraordinary circumstances he can waive the visa prohibition if it is in the national interest in addition the house approved by voice vote an amendment offered by representative sawyer earmarking 50 million for assistancehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30457crs8 to displaced persons the house appropriations committee version of the bill had allocated 245 million to assist currently displaced persons representative taylor amendment to limit the number of us troops in colombia to 300 at any one time except those present on an emergency rescue mission or stationed as an attache or part of the marine guard at the us embassy was ruled out of order in the senate plan colombia supplemental funding was split between fy2001 military construction s 2521 and foreign operations s 2522 appropriation measures together the two bills provided 117 billion about 190 million less than the administrations combined twoyear request of 136 billion the senate legislation reflected continuing congressional concern over the prospect of incremental american entanglement in colombian counterinsur gency activities shifts funding priorities in several key ways and restricts the involvement of us personnel in the region s 2522 provided 118 million for 60 huey ii helicopters in lieu of the administrations proposed 388 million for 30 blackhawk helicopters s 2522 provided 138 million for human rights governance and judicial programs about three times the level requested by the president the senate measure placed special emphasis on the creation of colombian national policefiscalia human rights units 10 million witness and judicial security 10 million and oversight capacity by the human rights office 1 million and us government monitors 15 million s 2522 increased from 76 million to 205 million funds for interdiction and alternative development in bolivia ecuador peru and other regional nations s 2522 imposed cap of 250 us military personnel and 100 civilian contractors that can be in colombia in support of the counternarcotics initiative s 2521 added 809 million not requested and not part of the plan colombia total for coast guard activities out of concern that the shortage of personnel spare parts and aging equipment has severely eroded coast guard drug interdictio n and other operational capabilities the administration in particular opposed the helicopter provision and the cap placed on us personnel working in colombia believing that committee steps to strengthen oversight of plan colombia slow us involvement with the military broaden regional assistance and limit the presence of american advisors were not enough senator gorton proposed an amendment during committee mark up on may 9 to reduce funding in s 2522 from 934 million to 100 million although thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30457crs9 amendment failed 1115 supporters said they might offer similar proposals during senate floor debate in june 21 floor action on s 2522 the senate either tabled or rejected three amendments to reduce or condition funding for colombia these were senator wellstone amendment to cut the 225 million provided

to prohibit the use of funds from the act and from department of defense funds for four purposes related to us support for and participation in counterinsurgency law enforcement and counternarcotics operations in colombia senatehouse conferees on hr 4425 agreed to 132 billion for plan colombia roughly the same amount but with different mix of program priorities than the presidents request major

stabilization programs throughout the balkans region defense and peacekeeping costs of the 229 billion defense department dod supplemental just over 2 billion would cover costs of us contributions to the peacekeeping operation in kosovo kfor this amount is intended to support 6200 us personnel in kosovo and about 1000 more supporting the operation in surrounding countries and enforcing international sanctions against the government of yugoslavia actual kfor costs were somewhat uncertain because of recent tensions in kosovo nato was considering whether to increase troop levels congressional action the house passed measure fully supported the 2025 billion request for us military operations as part of kfor during debate the house rejected an amendment by representative kasich 200219 that would have withheld half of the kfor funds until the president certified that eu and nato member states had obligated or contracted significant amount of the financial and personnel assistance they had pledged for kosovo the senate appropriations committee in s 2521 trimmed defense funding for kfor to 1825 billion raising objections from administration officials who say it would result in transfers from regular army programs to kosovo costs and reduce army readiness but most debate centered on congressional oversight of us forces in kosovo the panel approved an amendment by senator byrd 233 that would terminate funding for the deployment of us troops after july 1 2001 unless congress authorizes an extension the byrd amendment further required the president to develop plan under which european militaries would assume the lead role for ground forces in kosovo and withholds 25 of supplemental money until the administration certifies that european nations are fulfilling their funding commitments the administration strongly opposed the byrdwarner amendment threatening presidential veto because the provision would damage us credibility overseas undermine our position as the leader of nato and inflame the situation in kosovo7 during floor debate of s 2521 on may 18 the senate adopted levin amendment 5347 deleting the byrdwarner provision from the bill8

international peacekeeping contributions regional diplomatic and consular programs and fulbright and other exchanges of the 239 million requested for secure embassy facilities hr 3908 provided 104 million for new facility and marine guard quarters in sarajevo in reporting the bill the house appropriations committee noted that unallocated funds from this account remain from fy1999 and fy2000 appropriations that could be reprogrammed for other needs the house bill fully met the administrations request for fmf and imet assistance for the balkan region and provided 13 million of the 22 million requested for additional usaid operating costshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30457crs12 of the administrations 195 million seed account request hr 3908 provided 958 million 124 million of which is for kosovo and limited to support of american officers in the international police force in rejecting most of the 928 million requested for direct use for kosovo reconstruction the house appropriations committee pointed to provision in the fy2000 foreign operations appropriations that places 15 limit on the proportion of total donor pledges for kosovo that the united states may provide this limitation which applies only to the fy2000 funds provided in that act reflects the view of many who believe that because the united states bore the heaviest burden in pursuing the kosovo war european allies should lead the reconstruction effort to date the united states has pledged 150 million of fy2000 seed funds accounting for 15 of the total pledged by donors at the novemb er 1999 donor conference increased donor pledges since november however would allow the administration to provide an additional 31 million and stay within the 15 range the committee however suggested that it was reluctant to provide additional funds for kosovo because of europes failure to meet commitments in timely fashion including funds pledged for the administration of the province and the international police force during house floor debate representative kasich offered an amendment that would have withheld 50 of funds for us military operations in kosovo until the president certified that eu and nato member countries followed through on financial commitments the kasich amendment failed however 200219 s 2522 provided supplemental appropriations for kosovo assistance or other balkan economic military or diplomatic funding the senate bill howeve r increased fy2001 spending above the presidents request so that montenegro would receive 89 million the same as proposed for fy2000fy2001 croatia would receive 60 million slightly below the 657 million sought over two years but the administratio ns request for kosovo 928 million in fy2000 supplemental and 175 million for fy2001 would likely fall short under s 2522 because of the continuation of congressional limitation that us funds for kosovo reconstruction cannot exceed 15 of total contributions from all donors as enacted hr 4425 includes 50 million in economic assistance only for croatia montenegro and up to 124 million for kosovo the kosovo funds can only be used for police activities hipc trust fund contribution last year in response to an international campaign led by nongovernmental development and religious organizations the united states great britain and other major foreign aid donors agreed to expand significantly the heavily indebted poor country debt hipc initiative hipc which was first implemented in 1996 is an effort to lower the debt burden of the worlds most severely indebted countries many of which are in africa to sustainable levels and stimulate economic policy reforms and poverty reduction efforts in debtor nations previously hipc had been criticized for providing too little debt relief over lengthy qualification period for limited set of countries hipc expansion first endorsed by the g7 in june 1999 and later approved by the world bank and the imf in september

also crs report rl30449 debt and development in poor countries rethinking policy responsessubstantial cost increases for creditor nations and international financial institutions ifis to which the debt is owed10 the hipc initiative has two major components cancellation of bilateral debt owed to the united states and other creditor governments and reduction of debt owed to the world bank the imf and other regional ifis creditor governments cover their own expenses individually for the forgiveness of bilateral debt at the paris club an informal arena for negotiating debt reschedulings and reduction of publically held loans to finance the cancellation of multilateral debts the world bank and imf created the hipc trust fund into which ifis and aid donor governments would deposit contributions the bank and the fund will cover their own costs but other ifis especially the african development bank do not have enough resources to cover the losses of cancelled loan repayments donor governments have agreed to to make up the gap for those ifis with insufficient funds following agreements to expand hipc president clinton amended in september 1999 his pending fy2000 foreign aid request increasing debt relief from 120 million to nearly 1 billion over four years congress agreed to 123 million for bilateral debt cancellation at the paris club in 2000 but rejected the 600 million proposed for hipc trust fund contributions fy2000fy2003 the administration is now asking congress in the fy2000 supplemental to approve 210 million for the trust fund officials say that the absence of us contributi on has convinced other creditor governments to hold back their own pledges until the us acts they argue that while most of the existing pledges are earmarked for african nations that will be among the earliest qualifiers resources for latin american debt relief for bolivia nicaragua and honduras are not available without us contribution they contend debt workouts for these countries will be delayed critics of multilateral debt relief including some in congress believe that before the us contributes to the trust fund ifis should agree to suspend for period of time new lending to hipc countries once they receive debt relief so that they do not return to severely indebted state congres sional action the house and senate bills rejected all supplemental funding for the hipc trust fund although s 2522 provided 75 million for debt relief in fy2001 money that could be used as an hipc trust fund contribution the amount falls significantly below the presidents 472

appropriations for the department of defense by stephen daggett august 18 1998because conferees had included the pay date modifications reportedly however they obtained senate leadership agreement that when the senate returns in july legislation to rescind these provisions will be considered paying for the fy2000 supplemental continuing controversy during the recent consideration of supplemental appropriations is whether to cover the costs of the additional spending through offsets or to declare the requirement as an emergency practice that has received widespread criticism12 the emergency designation allows congress to approve the supplemental funds without offsetting the amounts with rescissions in previously enacted discretionary appropriations or finding cuts in mandatory spending programs but if congress agrees with the president to define all or part of the supplemental as an emergency and not offset the amounts discretionary spending rises and the size of the budget surplus for fy2000 declines between 1994 and 1997 congress usually enacted budget authority offsets for supplementals reversing that practice during the past two years congress has mostly declared supplemental appropriations as an emergency some lawmakers have strongly objected to this action arguing that fiscal discipline requires congress to fully offset new spending so as not to reduce the surplus especially if it utilizes surpluses generated by social security in january 2000 the congressional budget office projected that there will be 23 billion non social security surplus in fy2000 the administration designated nearly all 48 billion as emergency requirements for fy2000 while proposing limited number of offsets rescissions transfers and delays in funding obligations totaling 706 million that covered the costs of nonemergency spending the largest offset requested by the administration was 438 million of information technology funds provided for y2k requirements that are longer needed by several federal agencies table 3 below provides complete listing of offsets rescissions transfers and delays in obligations congressional action the house passed bill like the administration termed nearly all of supplemental funding as an emergency hr 3908 included 441 million in rescissions and offsets also like the administration the house panels largest rescission was the 235 million in unneeded y2k funds after reporting hr 3908 on march 9 the house approp riations committee encountered opposition among some members who wanted more or all of the new spending offset by cuts in existing appropriations house leaders delayed debate on hr 3908 until after the house passed the fy2001 budget resolution representative sanford proposed an amendment during house floor debate that would have cut back significantly on the size of the supplemental appropriation and removed emergency designations the sanford amendment failed however on 108315 votehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30457crs18 senate bills designated 86 billion of the 93 billion recommended in supplemental appropriations as emergencies s 2522 and s 2536 further rescinded 664 million
