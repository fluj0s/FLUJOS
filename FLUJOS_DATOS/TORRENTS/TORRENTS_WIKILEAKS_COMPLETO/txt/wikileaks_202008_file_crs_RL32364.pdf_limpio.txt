international economy summary the international monetary fund imf conceived at the bretton woods conference in july 1944 has become the fo cal point of the international monetary system created in 1946 with 46 members it has grown to include 184 countries the imf has six purposes that are outlined in article i of the imf articles of agreement they are the promotion of international monetary cooperation the expansion and balanced growth of international trade exchange rate stability the elimination of restrictions on the international flow of capital insuring confidence by making the general resources of the f und temporarily availabl to members and the orderly adjustment of bala nce of payment bop imbalances at the bretton woods conference the imf was tasked with coordinating the system of fixed exchange rates to help the international ec onomy recover from two world wars and the instability in the interwar period caused by competitive devaluations and protectionist trade policies from 1946 until 1 973 the imf managed the par value adjustable peg system the us dollar was fixed to gold at 35 per ounce and all other member countri currencies were fixed to the dollar at different rates this system of fi xed rates ended in 1973 when the united states removed itself from the gold standard floating exchange rates and more open capital markets in the 1990s created new agenda for the imf the resolution of frequent and volatile international financial crises the asian financial crisis of 19978 and subsequent crises in russia and latin america revealed many wea knesses of the world monetary system to better help it achieve its overall goal of promoting stable international monetary system the imfs format has changed dramatically since it was created in 1945 designed initially to provide short term balance of payments bop lending and monitor member countries macroec onomic policies the imf has steadily incorporated microeconomic factors such as institutional and structural reforms into its activities these had been seen previously as the exclusive province of the world bank and other development agencies the imf found that in order to pursue its core responsibilities in the changed world ec onomy it needed to pay greater attention to second generation reforms as economis ts call these sorts of issues imf member countries agreed on quot increase in 1997 the us congress subsequently appropr iated additional funding for th imf in october 1998 in the midst of the asian financial crises d ecision that engendered considerable debate in

second generation economic reforms 2 1httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32364the international monetary fund organization functions and role in the international economy background and introduction history of the imf the international monetary fund was created in 1946 result of the 1944 international financia l conference at bretton woods ne w hampshire it was created in order to prevent return of the international financial chaos that preceded and in some ways precipitated world war ii during the 1930s many countries pursued beggarthyneighbor economic policies restricting purchases from abroad in order to save scarce foreign exchange cutting the value of their currencies in order to underprice foreign competitors and hampering inte rnational financial flows in ways that deepened the world depression and accelerated the decline in economic activity the imf was designed to limit or prevent this kind of economic behavior technically the imf is specialized agency of the united nations but it functions virtually independe ntly of control the imf must obey directives of the security council but it need not comply with directives from the general assembly or other agencies rather than being organized on onecount ry onevote basis as is the united nations the imf has weighted voting the imf has 184 member countries whose voting share depends on the size of th eir quota or financial commitment to the organization countrys quota is determined by its size and its vel of participation in the world economy the amount country can borrow from the imf is determined by the size of its quota the united states is the largest single shareholder with 172 voting share together the nine executive directors eds representing the g7 countries and ot her advanced countries in europe have nearly 56 of the vote most decisions are reached by simple majority though decision is generally expressed by consensus some special matters changes in the articles of agreement or pproval of new quota increases for example require an 85 affirmative vote country can bloc k or veto loans or other operational policy decisions by the imf however because the us vote exceeds 15 quota increases amendments or othe r major actions can go into effect without its consent the same can be said for other majo r blocks of imf member countrieshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32364crs2 the imfs mandate as set forth in its articles of agreem ent the purposes of the imf are 1 to promote international coope ration on international monetary problems 2 to facilitate the expansion and balanced growth of international trade promoting high levels of employment and real income and the devel opment of productive resources in all member countries 3 to promot exchange rate stability and to avoid competitive exchange rate depreciation 4 to help establish multilateral system of payments among countries for curre nt transactions and to help liminate foreign exchange restrictions which hamper world trade 5 to make loans to member countries on temporary basis with adequate safeguards for repayment thus providing them with opportunity to corr ect maladjustments in their balance of payments without resorting to measures destructive of nationa l or international prosperity and 6 to shor ten with such loans the duration and to lessen the degree of disequilibrium in the international balances of payments of members the international monetary fund is an international financ ial institution ifi which deals mainly with balance of payments bop exchange rate and international monetary concerns originally the imf focused primarily on macroeconomic issues it monitored the macroeconomic and exchange rate policies of mber countries and it helped countries overcome bop crises w ith shortterm loans conditioned on their making improvements in their macroeconomic performance institutional and microeconomic issues were generally considered the province of the world bank and the other multilateral development banks mdbs in r ecent years however the fund has found that these issues have much larger impact on countries abilities to pursue effective macroeconomic and exchange rate policies increasingly it has included them among the subjects which need to be addressed in the context of its loan programs it has also given increased attention to institutional and microeconomic issues in its consultations with member country governments its surveillance activities and the technical ssistance it offers to member countries the imf is monetary institution not velopment agency its sister agency the world bank was created at the same time as the imf in order to provide long term loans and to stimulate growth and economic development in wardamaged and developing countries even so econo mic development and growth are core objectives of the imf as specified in purposes 2 and 4 above the founders believed that international monetary stability would facilitate the growth of world trade and that this in turn would generate higher levels of employment increased income and expanded growth and development in the count ries participating in the postworld war ii international economy the founders also expected purposes 5 and 6 that the imf would be means through which countries could remedy their domestic economic problems without resorting to the kinds of beggarthyneig hbor practices which sought to shift the burden of adjustment onto other countries countries with chronic balance of payments deficits could get shortterm imf loans to help them weather balance of payments crisis it was generally pr esumed that bop deficits inflation unemployment and low levels of economic activity were the result of inappropriate domestic economic policies better policies and adjustments in the exchange rate for the countrys currency were deemed to be the appropriate respons to this situationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32364crs3 it was expected that imf assistance woul d help countries shorten the depth and duration of their economic problems and he lp contain or prevent the spread of monetary instability to other countries as the largest single contributor 504 billion cumulatively to the imf the united states has leading role in shaping the imfs lending surveillance and advisory operations both house and senate committees frequently hold hearings on imf activities in developing countries and on imf reform other countries are also concerned that steps should be take n to make the imf more effective the role of congress in making imf policy the president has the ultimate authority unde r us law to direct us policy and instruct the us representatives at the imf and the multilateral development banks mdbs the president in turn has generally delegated authority to the secretary of the treasury the treasurys under secretary for international affairs and his staff manage daytoday us par ticipation with the advice and consent of the senate the president names individuals to represent the united states on the executive boards of the mdbs the executive board deals w ith operations and must approve any loan or policy decision the secretary of the treasury serves as the us representative on the world bank board of governors where each country has its own representative the board of governors is the highest level decisi on making body of the world bank in both the world bank executive board and board of governors count ries have voting shares comparable to their financial c ontributions at the world bank the united states has 16 vote in the principal loan window congress must give its consent by law before the united states may agree to participate in any new funding agreemen ts the senate has advise and consent authority over all persons nominated to represent the united states at the imf and the multilateral developmen t banks on many occasions congress has enacted legislation specifying what us policy shall be in the international financial institutions ifis and how the us executive directors at these institutions shall vote and the objectives they shall pursue for example the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of 1996 pl 104132 instructs the treasury department to oppose any loan or other use of ifi funds to or for any country for which the secretary of state has determined is st atesponsor of terrorism congress has also frequently made specific suggestions to the administration through sense of congress resolutions or language in committee reports accompanying legislation suggesting specific goals and priorities the united states ought to emphasize in the ifis since the world bank and the other multilateral institutions are not agencies of the us government but rather international institutions their activities and policies are not subject to us law httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32364crs4 figure 1 imf organization chartthe imfs organizational structure figure 1 shows the organizational struct ure of the imf as of march 2004 the board of governors bog is the highest au thority in the imf all countries are represented on the bog usually at the fina nce minister level or equivalent the bog usually meets annually in the fall committee of the bog the international monetary and financial co mmittee imfc meets twice nnually to consider major policy issues affecting the international monetary system and make recommendations to the bog the development committee joint committee of the boards of governors of the imf and world bank also meets at the same time to consider development policy issues and other matters affecting deve loping countries the two committees generally issue communiques at the close of their meetings summarizing their findings and recommendations these often serve as policy guidance to the imf and bank pending final action by the b og and as means for airing views and for coordinating or harmonizing country po licies on issues of in ternational concern source imfhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32364crs5 1for further discussion of this issue see crs report rs21810 international monetary fund selecting new managing director

and supervise the activities of the imf the five largest shareholders are the united states japan germany britain and france all appoint their own representatives on the board the remaining members are elected for two year terms by groups of countries generally on the basis of geographical or historical affinity few countries saudi arabia china and russia have enough votes to elect thei r own executive directors eds most countries are represented on the bed howev er by eds who also represent five to twenty other countries the eds each have voting authority equal in size to the combined vote of the member countries that appointed or elected them they must cast their votes as unit the execu tive board has several committees which examine policy and budget issues and other important matters the imf executive board selects the managing director of the imf who serves as its chairman and as chief executive officer of the imf1 the managing director manages the ongoing operations of the fund under the policy direction of the executive board supervises some 2800 sta ff members and oversees the preparation of policy papers loan proposals and othe r documents which go before the executive board for its approval most of the mate rial which comes to the executive board is prepared by imf management or sta ff however some documents and recommendations are prepared by executive directors themselves or by the governments they represent the managing director is elected for fiveyear renewable term of office the executive board also approves the selection of the managing directors principal assistants the first deputy managing director and two other deputy managing directors by tradition the european countries have the right to nominate persons who might be elected as imf managing director the us has similar prerogative at the world ba nk the first deputy managing director of the imf is typically us citizen recent controve rsies have prompted the board to consider possible ways the ma naging director might be selected on the basis of merit rather than by geography or political connections the imfs main functions and activities the imf has three principal functions and activities 1 surveillance of financial and monetary conditions in its member countries and of the world economy 2 financial assistance to help countries ove rcome major balance of payments problems and 3 technical assistance and adviso ry services to member countries surveillance oversight imf members agree as condition of membership article iv that they will collaborate with the f und and other members to assure orderly exchange arrangements and to promote stable system of exchange rates inhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32364crs6 particular they agree to pursue economic and financial polic ies that will produce orderly economic growth with reasonable price stability to avoid erratic disruptions in the international monetary system not to manipulate their exchange rates in order to attain unfair competitive advantage or shift economic burdens to other countries and to follow exchange rate policies compatible with these commitments the imf articles of agreement require article iv that it oversee the international monetary system in order to ensure its effective operation and to oversee the compliance of each member with its obligations to the fund in particular the fund shall ex ercise firm surveillance over the exchange rate policies of member countries and sh all adopt specific principles for the guidance of all members with respect to those policies countries are required to provide the imf with information and to consult with the imf upon its request the imf staff generally meets each year with each member country for article iv consultations regarding its current fiscal and monetary policies the state of its economy its exchange rate situation and other relevant concerns th imfs reports on its annual article iv consultations w ith each country are presented to the imf executive board along with the staffs observations and recommendations about possible improvements in the countrys ec onomic policies and practices access to information the information in these reports about their economic conditions performance and polic ies is the property of the countries concerned and may not be disc losed without their consent in recent years however the imf has successfully persuaded most countries to allow publication of their article iv consultation repor ts loan documents and other information about their economic policies and conditions the imf makes these available to the public on its country information page available at httpwwwimforg most countries now also publish on their imf country page cons iderable information often the verbatim text of their letters of understanding with the imf concerning the stabilization programs they plan to pursue in connecti on with an imf loan these are generally the product of close discussions between im f staff and country officials the imf executive board will not normally approve loan unless the condition embodied in these plans is acceptable to it the imf executive board must approve the disbursements at each stage of these loan programs it s published remarks often give the reader considerable insight into the borrowers performance and its degree of compliance with loan conditionality in exercising its oversight and surv eillance function the imf also publishes numerous reports each year on economic conditions and trends in the world economy these include for example its world economic outlook which provides each year an overview of conditions in the world economy and international financial statistics monthly compilation of detailed economic data on all countries the fund is required article v iii section 7 to publish an annual report on its operations transactions and resources and it is authorized to publish such other reports as it deems desi rable for carrying out its purposes these are available through its publications page also available at the imf website this authority does not extend however to the publication of information about the internal conditions in member countri countries are required article v iii section 5 to provide the imf with info rmation about their economic and

the case for independent imf surveillance remarks by edward balls at the institute for international economics washington dc march 6 2003 4 the imfs recent experience with contingent credit lines is case in point the ccl program was created in early 1999 to help bolster countries that might be hit for reason of their own by contagion effects in the international financial crisis this is where investors decide to pull their money out of whole category of countries because problems emerge in one or two of them th ccl allowed qualified countries to sign up for immediate access to substantial sums to he lp insure them against such situations continuedconditions and international economic and financ ial relationships however this information is generally deemed to be th property of the country which provided it and their consent is required for its re lease the fund may not publish reports involving changes in the fundamental st ructure of the econo mic organization of members article xii sec tion 8 without their consent it may communicate its views informally to any member country about any relevant issue 70 vote of the executive board is required however be fore any report can be published on economic monetary or balan ce of payments conditions in country if the country in question does not want it released it does not appear that the imf executive board has ever exercised this authority crisis prevention some analysts are concerned that imf surveillance is not sufficient in preventing financial crises in recent report the us general accounting office gao asserted that the imfs surveillance mechanisms including the funds biannual world ec onomic reports weos and its early warning systems ews have not performed well in predicting crises2 in reply to the report first deputy managing direct or anne kreuger noted that it is difficult for the imf to publicly predict crises if the fund publicly reported countrys economic weaknesses this alone might precipitate the very economic crises everybody wishes to avoid some argue th at the imf should formally separate its surveillance activities from its lending operations in an attempt to get around this problem3 it is difficult to see how this w ould solve the problem however since its surveillance functions are generally the means by which the imf gets inside information about economic conditions in mber countries the imf would violate its rules if it released information of th is sort without countrys consent and it would likely make the acquisition of accura information about economic conditions in member countries more difficult in th future moreover if fire wall were erected between the two functions the imf staff responsible for its loan program would not have ready access to the in formation derived from surveillance as conditions became more serious in prospective borrower country the imfs lending function only comes in to play when country applies for assistance to deal with pending or cu rrent economic crisis countries often postpone this step until the crisis is almo st upon them since it is often seen as an admission of failure by the government the imf has sought for years to encourage countries to come to it for aid befo re their economic problems reach crisis proportions however it has capacity for requiring them to do so4 similarly thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32364crs8 4continued nobody borrowed from it and it was closed in november 2003 in retrospect it seems that countries feared that their app lication for ccl would be perceived by the market as sign of weakness rather than strength and this would put them at greater risk than before similar factors seem to discourage countries from applyi ng dearly for imf assistance as soon as they begin experiencing economic problems ironically arrangements of this sort seem to have been helpful if countries open line of credit but promise that they will not borrow from the imf unless their economic circumstances teriorate between 1987 and march 2004 59 precautionary arrangements of this type were approved by the imf evidently the market sees precautionary arrangements as type of in surance rather than signal that there might be undisclosed sources of risk which might be of concern see for example the imfs contingent credit lines ccl factsheet march 2004 available from the imf web page at httpwwwimforgexternalnpexrfactcclhtm imf cannot require countries to address economic problem s even those which are of broad international concer n such as japans chronic balance of payments surplus or the united states chronic bop defic it if those countries have sufficient resources and they choose not to apply to it for assistance some critics say that the imf should solv this by neither doing surveillance nor lending instead private lending would termine whether or not to provide capital based on confidence economic policies and appropriate risk premium this is in effect another version of the argument that the imf makes things worse in the world economy and that commercial financial markets would be more efficient and effective in their approach the argume nt assumes that countries will share with private lenders the same types of information they currently share with the imf and that private lenders would be willing to lend to countries in deep financial crisis on terms that they can afford it presumes that countries will r their economies better and will be more willing to adopt economic reforms if th ey have recourse to an organization like the imf it also assu mes that the world economy will not suffer if some countries are cut off from credit durin g financial crises because they cannot or will not meet whatever terms th eir private creditors demand those who oppose this view and support th imf argue that the history of the world economy during the nineteenth and th twentieth century up to 1945 give much evidence which contradicts the assumptions stated above financial assistance when its member countries experience balance of payments bop difficulties either through capital account or current account crises the imf can make loans designed to help them stabilize their in ternational payments situation and adopt policy changes sufficient to reverse their situation and overcome their problems in some cases the imf makes shortterm ans to help prevent countries economies from spiraling into financial crisis and to facilitate renewed inflows of private sector capital many financial crises in developing countries in recent years were the result of lack of confidence by the interna tional financial market s and the sudden stop or reversal of capital inflows to developing countries whic h often occurs at the outset of crisis in other cases the imf make s loans to help countries deal with bop crises but the loan repayment period is longer and the conditionality includeshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32364crs9 5see crs report rs21357 new imf conditionality guidelines november 19 2002 6 imf how does the imf lend factsheet april 2003 available through the imf web cite at http www imforg type title in inquiry box problems which are more deeply rooted and require more time than is usually possible in the imfs usual timeline the imf is required by its articles to sure that countries use of its resources will be temporary and that ans will be repaid to insu re this end as well as to guarantee oftneeded economic reforms the fund splits the disbursement of its loans into tranches and requires that specified economic conditions must be met for the continued disbursement of imf funds the imf has redesigned its conditionality guidelines to better tailor its lending arrangements to the specific financial needs of each recipient country5 the imfs area departments which interact with borrower countries and prepare loan agreements ma well have different perspective on this question than do the imfs functional depar tments which must approve prospective loan agreement before it goes to the ex ecutive board on one hand the imf wants to tailor its loan programs to the particular situation in the borrower country on the other hand the imf also needs to have c onsistent approach nd policies which are equally applicable in all parts of the world officially the amount country is able to borrow from the imf is related to the countrys quota its ownership and contributi on share in the imf in most instances countries may borrow several multiples of their quota in response to particular circumstances the conditionality and performance standards attached to loan become more rigorous and demanding as its size relative to the borrowers quota increases in many cases deemed except ional by the imf executive board at the time countries have received loans from th imf which are much larger than the normal guidelines would allow in decem ber 1997 for example the imf made 21 billion imf loan to south korea which was 1939 of its imf quota the imf has several loan programs6 see appendix 1 for details most are funded with money drawn from the quot as subscribed by member country governments and charge marketbased repaymen t terms quotas are in effect lines of credit which imf member countries ex tend to the imf in case it needs money to finance its operations the imf generally draws only upon the quota resources subscribed by the countries with strong currencies the imf charges its borrowing countries interest rate of charge at rate slightly hi gher than the market rate for shortterm loans in major currency markets the imf pays interest rate of remuneration to the countries when it us their quota resources at this blended market rate in some instances particularly for loans with long repayment periods or for loans which are particularly large compared to the size of the borrowers economy the borrower may be required to pay higher interest rate surcharge and the imf may borrow money on market rms to supplement its quota resources the imf makes loans to its poorest memb er countries on highly concessional repayment terms through its poverty reduction and growth facility prgf these also aim to help countries overcome bop problems but their conditionality puts less emphasis than is usual for imf loans on au sterity and more on economic growth thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32364crs10 7fy2000 annual report on technical assist ance supplementary paper recent developments pg 4 imf does not use its regular quota resources to fund these loans rather prgf loans are funded with money borrowed in worl d capital markets and contributions from donors countries offset the interest cost of these loans hence the imf can charge its prgf borrowers an interest rate onehalf of one percent similar to the rate the world bank charges its poorest borrowers to cover the cost of making and administering prgf loans technical assistance the imfs technical assistance and advisory programs have become increasingly important in recent years indeed some analysts now believe that this is imfs most important function while the specific types of reform vary from case to case imf technical assistance operations focus primarily on its core areas of expertise principally financial and macroeconomic policy management any member country may request that the im f provide it with technical assistance though it is separate program the imf wants to make techni cal assistance more integral part of its article iv consultations and lending programs the imfs technical assistance department plays key role in the implementation of the imfs developmentoriented strate gy many subdepartments are reporting increased demand for assistance in areas such as government transparency compliance with international standards and codes strengthening domestic financial systems and poverty reduction demand has been especially great in the areas of fiscal policy and administration of technical assistance in addition to helping countries design appr opriate fiscal policies the latter areas help them build the institutions needed to support and implement them7 the imfs role in the international economy from fixed to floating rates the world financial system created at the 1944 bretton woods conference was fixedparity fixed but adjustable exchange rate system in effect the united states defined the value of its dollar in term s of gold and other countries defined their currencies in terms of the us dollar central banks were supposed to stabilize the value of their national curre ncies through their domestic monetary policies and use of foreign exchange reserves with the prior consent of the imf countries could devalue their currencies if their existing par value proved unsustainable the main issue facing the imf during this period was convertib ility whether c ountries currencies could be used freely in worl d markets or whether countries would maintain currency controls re stricting the outflow of foreign exchange and specifying that their currencies could only be exch anged for other currencies within their territory currency controls of this sort placed serious limitations on world trade major success of the imf and its members during its first two decades was thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32364crs11 8imf international financial statistics 1987 yearbook pp 901 9445 1145 1601 gradual spread of convertib ility to include most of th worlds major economies and most largest trading nations in 1971 the united states severed th link between the dollar and gold henceforth the dollar was worth dollar rather than any fixed quantity of gold or other materials the gol d window at the us treasury was closed and despite prior official assurances foreign govern ments could longer exchange dollars for their equivalent value in gold this action by the united states produced great uncertainty in world currency markets it was not clear how the currency of one country should relate in value to the currenc of another some countries defined the value of their currency in terms of gold others linked their currency to some other major currency and others simply decided to let the value of their currency rise or fall float in world currency markets without fixed anchor of value the world money supply and consumer prices grew fourfold in the decade following 1971 whereas the worlds gdp in constant prices grew by only onethird8 many economists believe that financial strains which predated the us decision to sever the golddollar link and the disruptions and financial shocks which followed are still being felt in varying forms today however given the differences in national interests and preferences and the changes which have since occurred most economists doubt th at return to the earlier fixedparity exchange rate system is now desirable or perhaps even desirable an 85 majority vote of the imf membership would be requi red to establish fixed or any other uniform system of exchange rate proce dures article iv section 4 in many respects the current flexibility and liquidity of world financial markets can be attributed to the reduction of barriers and other shifts wh ich have occurred since the early 1970s ironically it was the prior success in ach ieving the ready c onvertibility of the major currencies which laid the groundwork for the new system of floating exchange rates the value of countrys currency was longer determined at the exchange window of its central bank rather the rate for convertible currencies would be determined secondtosecond every day by supply and demand conditions in the world market at the time many agreed that the imf needed to create new world financial system to clarify and stabilize the situ ation but disagreements among the major countries made this virtually impossible in 1978 the members of the imf adopted an amendment to the imf articles of agr eement which let member countries decide for themselves what exchange rate system they would use the amendment severed officially the link between currency nd gold imf member countries were prohibited from defining the value of their currency in terms of gold and the imf was prohibited from lending gold or defining its ssets in terms of gold countries could use any system they wanted other than us ing precious metals as base for defining the value of their currencies prior imf approval of exchange rate changes would longer be required httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32364crs12 most major countries let the value of their currency float in world exchange markets after 1978 though they might seek to influence that value through changes in their domestic monetary policy or throug h purchases or sales in currency markets other countries defined the value of thei r currency in terms of fixed quantity of another countrys currency pa rticularly for small countries this helped protect their economies against the pernicious effects of rapid changes in currency values due to specific eventsa likely possibility in sma ll economies with floatin g rates however it risked catastrophic financial crashes if s has been the case many times in the past three decades the market value and offici exchange rates for their currencies diverged and the central bank did not ve enough foreign exchange reserves to offset market pressures for devaluation financial liberalization financial liberaliza tion in the developing countries coincided with major liquidity boom in the western countries the size and scope of capital flows increased dramatically during the 1990s instead of relatively small number of banks lending to foreign governments as was the case in the 1980s developing countries turned to the new global capital markets and were ra ising money through the issuance of sovereign debt and private cap ital flows the crises of the late 1990s were influenced as much by this rapid increase in private financial flows and market sentiment as by the underlying macroecono mic fundamentals of th crisis countries in recent years major crises have occurred when governments allowed banks in their country to borrow substantial am ounts of shortterm money from abroad in order to fund longterm undertakings classic debtasset match problems occurred when in an uncertain situation the creditors found that countrys central bank lacked sufficient resources to cover all the shortterm obligations which were scheduled to come due in that case rather than simply rolling over their loans as had been their standard practice in the past creditors all sought to get their money out in order to avoid default this often precipitated collapse which entangled creditors in the very situation they wished to avoid financial liberalization and imf policy the increased importance of private capital markets and the debate over its effects on developing country policy ma king has had major effect on imf operations instead of being the central figu re as in the old fixedparity system the imf became merely another participant t hough arguably the most important one in the world monetary system since 1979 w ith the possible exception of south korea in 1998 only developing countries have come to the imf for assistance in dealing with their international mone tary problems the major count ries have dealt with their problems on their own through changes in th eir monetary and exchange rate policies and through the g7 they have not come to the imf for loans or generally technical assistance and policy advice this has had major impact on the work of the imf it has had to deal increasingl with the particular needs of developing countries where even though it is not development agency the imfs policies and operations can have major imp act on development prospects it has forced the imf to grapple with new issues that were not part of its original mandate these includehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32364crs13 9these included fiscal discipline redirection of public expenditure priorities towards fields offering high economic returns and the potentia l to improve income distribution tax reform to lower marginal rates and broaden coverage interest rate lib eralization competitive

httpwwwcsisorg 11 this is some overlap between williamsons original list and naims list of second continuedcapacity building in countries with weak institutions development policy concerns the dissemination of information about ec onomic conditions and policies in member countries and the creation of standards and guidelines for international financial and monetary practices in addition the imf s had to rethink its crisis prediction and management operations the imf operates on the general principle that the liberalization of trade barriers and reductions in currency re strictions will strengthen the world economy and raise living standards in individua l countries until recently it also generally supposed that most bop crises in countries ste mmed mainly from inappr opriate fiscal and monetary policies leading to poor macro economic performance the imfs typical remedy included measures to reduce the bo rrower countrys budget deficit to raise interest rates and to adjust downward the international value of the countrys currency in order to lay the foundation for future growth later experience showed however as discussed below that some cr ises could be driven by mistakes in public sector policy but that others were caused more by the interaction between structural and institutional problems and private sector activity washington consensus reforms the term washington consensus was first used in 1990 to summarize the ge neral policy reforms that many experts agreed were appropriate for developing countries in latin america and other developing countries9 the consensus encapsulated three main ideas macroeconomic discipline market economy and openne ss to global trade and foreign direct investment10 the imf the world bank and other international lending agencies put strong emphasis on these concepts in thei r loan programs during much of the 1990s appendix 2 illustrates as first generation reforms some of the major elements of the washington consensus approach to policy reform after the financial crises of the late 1990s the term washington consensus took on more negative connotation some argued that marketfriendly economic policies were forced on deve loping countries by the imf and by major commercial banks in order to create investment opportun ities in developing countries that would benefit investors in the advanced economies second generati on reforms in 1994 the list of washington consensus reforms was expanded to in clude the socalled second generation reforms11 the idea of second generation refo rms is that without

subject for example see eichengreen capital flows and crises cited above institutions legal financial and bureaucratic it is difficult perhaps impossible to implement washington consensus macr oeconomic reforms the macroeconomic principles which lie at the heart of much of the imfs activities may not work as expected if the underlying institutions in borrower countries are weak or dysfunctional strong domes tic institutions are increasin gly necessary for countries to manage large capital flows and are bein g proved increasingly important for long term economic growth12 appendix 2 shows the two types of reforms first and second generation or micro and macroec onomic that are often codependent many economists decided in the late 1990s that these reforms needed to be better incorporated into imf assistance programs simply put many felt that the imf could not successfully pursue its core f unctions and purposes unless the fit between its basic econom ic concepts and the institutional reality in recipient countries was improved analysts find that without strong institutions country is more likely to suffer persistent domestic challenges including economic inequality and intermittent dictatorship13 good national institutions are inte gral to providing framework for citizens to conduct their business and for government to create effective policy collect taxes and effectiv ely regulate the economy proper diagnosis of the origins of financial crisis are important the difficulties of the borrower country may be compounded if the imf lacks the proper tools or if its tools and policies which might be appropriate for crises that stem from poor macroeconomic mana gement are inadequate for crises whose origins are attributable more to weak instituti ons and poor management of country accounts the imf said in its assessment of the asian financial crisis of 19978 for example that the sudden collapse of south korea thailand and indonesias currencies was due more to poor bt management policies unsound banking institutions and weak bank oversight procedures than to any specific problems with macroeconomic policy14 this was the imf reported new breed of economic crisis the fund responded to the crisis in itially with the kinds of tools and policies appropriate for crises caused by unsound macroeconomic policy though it shiftedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32364crs15 gears quickly and added institutional and structural reforms to the agenda as nature of the problem became apparent the f und presumed in itially that its macroeconomic programs would be suffici ent together with large financing packages to restore confidence growth was expected to slow but to remain positive neither the imf nor other obser vers expected the deep recessions that occurred the effects of structural and institutional reform are felt much more slowly in an economy than are those of macroeconomic policy change in all three countries moneta ry policy had to be tightened vigorously to halt the collapse of their exchange rates according to the imf the tightening went well beyond what might have been warranted by fundamentals in order to prevent the currency collapse from turning into rampant inflation structural and institutional factors were major contributor s to the depth of the crisis meanwhile fiscal policy in the three countries was also tightened on the mistaken assumption that government overspending wa s part of the problem in retrospect the imf acknowledged this was not tr ue particularly for indonesi and south korea imf staff reported that if fiscal policy had been eased more quickly the subsequent recessions in the countries w ould have been less severe the imf and other observers drew seve ral conclusions from the asian crisis they concluded for example that when institutional and structural issues are the problem crisis prevention is the preferable strategy the course of the crisis clearly showed the imf reported the difficulty of stopping such developments once they have started more emphasi s should be put on surveillance particularly identifying and remedying weaknesses in countries exch ange rate and fina ncial systems before crisis occurs greater transparency of economic and financial data was also essential they found to strengthen mark et discipline and avoid adverse surprises further effort to restructur countries financial and co rporate sectors were needed and the legal commercial fra mework for their economies needed to be updated care also need be taken regarding th pace and sequencing of capital account liberalization par ticularly when the soundness of domestic financial institutions is doubtful so that shortterm capital fl ows do not make countrys economy more vulnerable to instability imf activity in the poorest countries between 1976 and 1980 the imf sold 50 million ounces of gold from its stockpile partly at official prices and partly at market prices to raise money to help lowincome countries until that time the imf had lowcost facility to help poor countries who had difficulty with its standa rd marketrate terms the proceeds were accumulated into the gold trust f und which lent sdr 3 billion 38 billion to poor countries between 1977 and 1981 on hi ghly concessional repayment terms some of the repayments from these loans were placed in the new structural adjustment facility saf which lent another sdr 18 billion 24 billion on the same basis between 1986 and 1995 later reconstituted as the enhanced

1987 and 199915 many critics complained however that the esaf was lending to poor countries with the same type of cond itionality it applied for its regu lar loans these countries could not afford to use budget cuts nd austerity as devices for turning around chronic balance of payments deficits in stead they argued the imf needed to put more emphasis in its concessional loan program on growth pove rty alleviation and structural change in the economies of its lowincome borrower countries in 1999 the imf and the world bank approved new joint approach for their poverty reduction efforts in the least developed and deve loping countries16 the basic format of the esaf was altered reconstituted as the poverty reduction and growth facility prgf the program was supposed to integrate the objectives of poverty reduction and growth mo re fully into its macroeconomic concerns the imf says in its prgf factsheet that its c oncessional loan progra m and the concessional aid program of the world bank are now built around povert reduction strategy paper prsp the prsp is prepared by the borrower government with input from members of civil society and the international financial institutions as of march 2004 77 countries were eligible for prgf funding the prgf has significantly expanded th scope and range of imf assistance in its poorest c ountries distinguishing features of the prgf are as follows greater country ownership of the reform pro cess through increased government input broader country par ticipation among civil society and the poor and imf lending is embedded in broader pove rtyreduction framework the prsps prgf loans allow countries to create budgets that reor ient government spending towards the social sectors and basic in frastructure include tax re

circumstances study of the prgf done by imf staff in 2002 and 2003 found that the programs supported by prgf lending are mo re propoor and progrowth than those previously funded by esaf19 however some critics maintain that the balance needs to be shifted further they claim for example that the terms of prgf loans are not much different from those prev iously required for esaf loans they say these are too hard for poor countries still puttin g too much emphasis on improvements in macroeconomic policy and requirements for structural reform and diverting resources and attention from povertyalle viation activities supporters argue by contrast that poverty can best be alleviated by economic growth and that eff ective economic policy and better institutions are crucial to that goal they note that the guidelines of the prgf were changed from those of the esaf to give more explicit emphasis to growth and poverty alleviati on than was the case before and they argue that the balance has been well shifte d in that direction in fy2003 approximately 176 billion was disbursed under the prgf an increase from 136 billion in fy2002 and 81 billion in fy2001 prgf loans are administered by the imf through the prgf and prgfhipc trusts the trusts borrow resources from central banks national governments and official institutions generally at marketrelated interest rates and lend them on

along with contributions from bilate ral donors this has been able to fund the bulk of the imfs share of the hipc program funds were also transferred by the imf from some special reserve accounts to help defray prgfhipc expenses another aspect of the prgf program is the imfs involvement with the heavily indebted poor countries h ipc debt reduction initiative the imf and world bank have initiated this joint initiative to reduce to the stock of debt for the poorest countries through debt forgiveness the go of the hipc program is to reduce the debt stock of its beneficiary countries to sustainabl level generally defined as 150 of export income because most of this debt was borrowed on concessional repayment terms the annual co st of servicing the debt is only small fraction of the

supervision and lending activities requirement of eligibility is the completion of prsp indeed the bank and fund seem to be using the pr sp process as an adjunct element of the hipc debt cancellation process to help encourage further policy and institutional reform in hipc candidate countries mo reover hipc countries must be under an imf program and must establish track record of reform and sound policies21 finally an imf program must be in place fo r hipc country to receive debt relief from the paris club group of official creditors22 imf activity in institution building analysts have found that countries with good financial systems and the requisite microeconomic institutions are more likely to use capital effectively and encourage development through econo mic growth and trade23 by contrast there is little evidence that poorly functioning financia l systems have many desirable effects though they can be useful to privileged or wellconnected groups nevertheless the process of reforming financia l institutions in country can be painful additional inputs of capital or steps to contain risk may be required costs including excess employment and overcapacity may need to be reduced and the special beneficiaries of the existing system may need to be persuaded or forced to accept change in many instances the costs of reform may be more evident than are the future benefits so resistance may be strong this may be particularly true if prevailing interest rates need to be raised to market levels the interest groups w ho believe themselves injured will likely resist the reforms more vigorously than will the less well organized and perhaps unknowing persons who will be the main beneficiaries of reform the financial sector assessment progra m fsap is an example of how the imf is increasing its activity in domestic financial surveillance and financial sector institution building created by the imf and world bank in 1999 to study and assess the financial sectors of

on poverty reduction strategy pape r which is supposed to be prepared by the borrower country in cooperation with civil soci ety and its development partne rs in particular the world bank in practice the world bank has major role in preparing these papers imf nonconcessional loans carry an intere st rate rate of charge which is based on the imfs sdr interest rate the sdr rate is calculated weekly based on weighted average for shortterm debt in money markets in the united states united kingdom japan and the euro zone ther is markup depending on the status of the country and in some cases there is also an interest rate premium surcharge in march 2004 the rate was 161 about do uble the reference rate for rate for dollarbased loans but only about onethi rd the rate for loans in pound sterling standby arrangements sba are the imfs standard loan program and its most commonly used facility designed to address shortterm bop problems these are lines of credit which may be used as needed during specific period of time generally 12 to 18 months repayment is expected within 2¼ to 4 years after each disbursement is made rcharges are applied to loans which represent high multiples of the
