the construction of most of the large irrigation and wate r resources infrastructure in the west reclamation manages water resource facilities in 17 western states with an original development cost of over 200 billion recl amation is over 100 years old and many of its facilities now have an average age of over 50 years this aging infrastructure requires increased maintenance and replacement efforts and expenditures reclamation appears to have well doc umented plan to assess the management needs of its portfolio of aging infrastructure however water resources infrastructure management objectives require prioritization due in part to finite budget this inevitably leads to conflicts over project funding prior ities as reclamations portfolio of infrastructure continues to age these conflicts are likely to arise more often further in the case of struct ures whose operations and maintenance responsibilities have been transf erred to the local project beneficiaries the increased maintenance and replacement efforts and expenditures associated with aging infrastructure such as more expensive recapitalization projects could motivate the beneficiaries to seek federal funds and congressional support to address project funding issues this report describes reclam ations approach to mana ging aging infrastructure as well as that of two other agencies the army corps of engineers and the natural resources conservation servi ce involved with significant portfolios of dams and related infrastructure additionally there is discussion of four specific approaches to managing reclamations

protect water and related resources in an environmentally and economi cally sound manner in the interest of the american public1 in most cases this means developing water supplies primarily for irrigation to reclaim arid lands in the west reclamation manages water resource facilities in 17 western states with an original development cost of over 200 billion2 citing engineering indices the agency has estimated that the replacement value of all reclamation infrastructur would be over 100 billion3 reclamations inventory of assets includes 471 dams and dikes that create 348 reservoirs with total storage capacity of 245 million acrefeet of water4 reclamation is the largest wholesaler of water in the united states through its assets reclamation serves more than 31 million people and provides irrigation water for 10 million acres of farmland that produce 60 of the nations vegetables and 25 of its fruits and nuts reclamation is the nations secondlargest producer of hydroelectric

and reserved works maintenance needs are identified either by the operating entities or through periodic facility revi ews conducted by reclamation major maintenance or reha bilitation for reserved works is typically funded from annual appropriations14 however maintenance funding for transferred works is the responsibility of the operating tity which may have difficulty f unding major recapitalization efforts securing needed additional funding th rough private lenders for rehabilitation work on transferred fac ilities can be difficult because the federal government retains title so

stipulated that reclamation was to recover more than 69 million 35 of reimbursable expenses typically charged to water users for project om costs at arrowrock dam congress further stipulated that

the completion of feasibility studies was premature and that pending tribal water rights claims should be resolved prior to rehabilitation work at the project further reclamation opposed the proposed project repayment terms citing concern that repayment terms which depart from standard reclamation practice are precedent setting and may pose problems for the agency in the future30 typically reclamation has constructed projects us ing federal funds and then established repayment schedule for project benefici aries based on the amount of total construction costs allocated to various

the administrations fy2009 budget request for this program is 59 million all authorized funding is subject to appropr iations via the agriculture appropriations bill40 summary and analysis there is an established process within reclamation for identifying and prioritizing the om or rehabilitation funding need s of the water resources infrastructure that reclamation has constructed si nce its creation in 1902 however it is clear that these needs are addressed in number of ways both internal and external to reclamation ie throug h the dam safety pr ogram and through congressionally directed spending as the dams and water conveyance struct ures continue to age and need more costly repairs and upgrades the question of who shoul d pay will likely be raised repeatedly for jackson gulch the manc project even if the contractual responsibility to conduct rehab ilitation work is clearly fined as om and remains the responsibility of water users are the na tions best interests served by allowing infrastructure to deteriorate further when those water users are unable or unwilling to undertake repairs or shoul d water users be held account able for their contractual obligations if the latter should funding for and transfer of future projects be contingent on stricter analyses of end users ability to repay their obligations in contrast to the jackson gulch project described above at arrowrock dam the approach to the rehabilitation of aging in frastructure stipulated by congress in 206 of the energy and water developmen t appropriations ac t of 2002 appears to classify the replacement of wornout equipment as om the repayment of these costs is typically the responsibility of water us ers to be repaid in the fiscal year that costs are incurred however the legisla tion caps the total responsibility of water users at 69 million and extends th repayment period to 15 yearshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34466crs10 41 pl 95578 42 pl 110114 5103c2a and bfor the st mary dam issue congress c hose the approach of designating and authorizing funding for another federal agency to do the work instead of reclamation however the solution may dd complexity to an already complicated issue the wrda legislation stipulates 75 federal cost share of the total cost of the rehabilitation project but does not specify repayment of the remaining 25 it might be assumed that the remaining cost is to be borne by water users under reclamations repayment rules but this is not specified also this cost share allocation may conf lict with 4a of the reclama tion safety of dams act of 197841 which indicates that costs associated with modification of structures resulting from age and deterioration or nonperformance of normal maintenan ce by the operating entity are to be considered reimbursable project costs further regarding st mary dam th wrda stipulation for an exclusion on construction associated with standard om as well as that for emergency repairs42 appears to indicate that the broader st mary rehabilitation project is considered neither routine om nor an emergency repair if that is the case it may bolster the position of those who would seek to classify the work as modification of structures resulting from age and deterioration or nonperformance of normal maintenance cited from the safety of dams ac t above and thus subject to reimbursement under the terms of the act finally as its name suggests the dam safety program is focused solely on dams review analysis and repair of other water resources infrastructure such as canals and pump stations are not within th scope of this program the dam safety program is clear in its design with welldelineated evaluation and implementation components however its limited scope albeit focused on vital element of water infrastructure excludes other important water resource facilities based on review of documents such as the bureau of reclamation asset management plan fiscal year 2007 commentors would likely conclude that the agency has welldocumented plan to asse ss the management needs of its portfolio of aging infrastructure however as ma be indicated by some of the projects discussed above such as the st mary dam the necessity of prioritization given finite budget for asset management objec tives inevitably leads to conflicts over project funding priorities as reclamation s infrastructure continues to age these conflicts may arise more frequently additionally more expensive recapitalization projects may exceed the financial means of local operators in the case of transferred works and could drive those entities to seek congressional support for project funding
