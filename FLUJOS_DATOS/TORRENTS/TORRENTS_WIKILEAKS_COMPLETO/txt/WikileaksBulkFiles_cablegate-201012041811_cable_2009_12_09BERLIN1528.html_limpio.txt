tftpswift agreement passes on german abstention ref berlin 1393 b berlin 1377 c berlin 1167 classified by dcm greg t delawie for reasons 14 b and d 1 c summary german federal interior minister thomas maiziere overruled justice minister sabine leutheusserschnarrenberger and abstained from voting at the november 30 coreper vote in brussels on an interim useu agreement to continue the terrorist finance tracking program maizieres decision allowed the agreement to pass and followed weeks of engagement in berlin brussels and washington as well as highlevel interventions from secretary clinton treasury secretary geithner attorney general holder national security advisor gen jones and ambassador murphy maizieres decision was difficult for him to make given that the coalition agreement called for specific revisions to the swift agreement none of which germany achieved except shortening of the interim period from 12 to 9 months the episode has tested germanys new coalition government just weeks after its formation with leutheusserschnarrenberger heavily criticizing the abstention this experience suggests that we will need to pay close attention to germany during our negotiations on longterm tftp agreement end summary germany relents following intense pressure 2 c ambassador murphy met with interior minister maiziere on november 27 and urged him to support useu negotiations on an interim tftp agreement to which maiziere indicated that he would abstain from voting on the agenda item at the november 30 coreper meeting maizieres decision which followed german request to shorten the duration of the interim agreement to nine months rather than twelve facilitated the passing of the agreement as germany was the strongest holdout maizieres decision followed two weeks of intense lobbying in berlin brussels and washington by embassy berlin useu the departments of treasury state and justice and the nsc the campaign included calls by secretaries clinton geithner the attorney general and the national security advisor to their german counterparts state department counterterrorism coordinator benjamin urged support for the agreement during twoday visit to berlin see septel ambassador murphy twice wrote to all five relevant ministers interior justice finance chancellery and mfa and made repeated calls to senior decision makers stressing the importance of the interim agreement and the need for germany to not block it the dcm econ mc and staff from multiple embassy sections heavily engaged on the issue as well 3 c maiziere cdu stressed that his decision was not an easy one given that the christian democratsocial union cducsu and free democratic party fdp coalition had differing views on the tftp program the outcome particularly irritated justice minister leutheusserschnarrenberger because she had expressed concerns about the tftp dating back to the initial july decision to give the negotiating mandate to the swedish eu presidency furthermore in october leutheusserschnarrenberger had inserted language into the cducsufdp coalition agreement specifically addressing the tftp negotiations and directing germany to call upon the eu to work towards higher level of data protection see ref b following maizieres decision the justice minister complained that her views were ignored and that the decision has upset millions of citizens of europe maiziere told the ambassador that he would be expressing some criticisms of the agreement publicly in order to reflect moi concerns and to deflect public criticism he was subsequently quoted as saying that not completely satisfactory agreement is better than none at all berlin 00001528 002 of 002 german vote comes with costs for the coalition 4 c maiziere intimated and working level contacts have confirmed that germany would like to avoid repeat of our allout lobbying effort during the negotiations for longterm tftp agreement maizieres strong preference is to seek consensus with his ministry colleagues he particularly wants to avoid another clash with the justice minister on this issue as it has caused small amount of discord between the new coalition partners who are having rocky start on number of fronts the incident is particularly difficult for maiziere as he entered the interior ministry stressing that he represented break from his predecessor wolfgang schaeuble whom he felt overly focused on security issues see ref maiziere surely finds this whole experience regrettable as it put him in exactly the position he did not want to be in seemingly siding with the us over german interests causing disruption within the coalition and compromising the data privacy rights of german citizens engaging the fdp on data privacy 5 c it is not altogether surprising that this disagreement arose given the fdps reputation as staunch defender of citizens privacy rights see ref c nevertheless the intensity of this dispute should be wake up call we must avoid repeating this as we look to completing the longterm useu tftp agreement the coalition agreement calls for strict limitations on the use of tftp data automatic access to the system data deletion requirements clear rules on sharing information with third parties and legal redress these positions will guide germanys views in the followon negotiations and we need to consider how to take them into account in way that does not complicate tftp implementation 6 c embassy berlin is examining how we can reach out to fdp ministers and parliamentarians to educate them on us data protection structures as this experience has demonstrated that they are often misinformed on the nature of our policies we will likewise reach out to cducsu decision makers in part to enlist their help in reaching the german public we also intend to make the point that countering terrorism in globalized world where terrorists and their supporters use open borders and information technology to quickly move people and financing requires robust international data sharing murphy
