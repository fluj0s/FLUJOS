universe processes congress enewsletter willingness to be and communicate youre not really upset by becoming things unless you are unwillingly forced into becoming something and then you became something without your own determinism and so you are being something you do not like to be you do not want to be and so you wont communicate with it although youre being it youre not in communication with it when you become willing to be it you simply communicate with it the moment you communicate with it it goes pshoo it has the same solidity as vacuum and that is how engrams are blown how locks are blown how blocks you might say helddown fives in computing machines and so forth go by the boards thats how occlusion goes by the boards excerpted from the universe processes congress thetamest theory being problem aspect an article by l ron hubbard from the universe processes congress just recently i was working with it and suddenly realized that the principle of problems was inherent and was contained in the thetamest theory here we have something which is itself solver of problems poser solver of problems impinged upon something which is never more than problem the difference between theta and mest is of course theta can get ideas and mest sometimes receives them so we get theta as nomotion thing impinged upon this allmotion thing which is to say we get solver poser and solver of problems here imposed on the raw material of problems and that raw material is itself chaos and out of this chaos theta brings order in organization now thats actually an old theory that life is bringing order out of chaos that god for instance they say one cult religion or another says that god brought order out of chaos and so forth thats what thetan is trying to do hes trying to bring order out of chaos after hes failed several times he gets to be an organizer but he gets fixated on it but that is something that theta does and this chaos is matter energy space which in itself combined at uniform rate gives us time or mest all right you say whats this theory got to do with its got lot to do with you it sure has has lot to do with processing and at the moment this was struck as an advance point in research and investigation there wasnt any more problem because one had taken in the anatomy of problems into the woof and warp of scientology itself what is the anatomy of problem lets say in terms of force that great many force vectors going in random directions will itself produce confusion thats the basic problem confusion number of force vectors traveling in number of different directions life comes along stops one of them gets two more of them to line up and unite gets bunch more of them to go different direction makes pattern out of it makes it repetitive and has an automobile dam has some face powder see the raw material of the problem bunch of confused vectors of force bunch of force confusions being lined up in some fashion or another or disaligned for some purpose or other life has to put purpose into that chaos and then make the chaos align itself and so we have all kinds of things we have automobiles and we have thinking machines and electronic brains and nuclear physicists we have all kinds of bricabrac in the society endless bricabrac which is all planned and organized the thetamest theory demonstrates that whatever is solving problems is life and whatever has problems to be solved is mest aint that horrible whatever is solving problems is life that could be said to be definition of life that which is posing and solving problems and that which has problems to be solved is mest now you see that see that that means that means that the auditorpreclear relationship is not really dependent upon transference valence switches or any complexity of this character it puts the preclear into position he was not before willing to be and as long as he was unwilling to be in that position he would himself force himself into the position that is to say hes putting the preclear into the role of being the physical universe and the preclear simply starts being audited he starts answering up the answers to the problem you see he is taking that part of him which is the physical universe which is relatively inanimate which is not thinking and he is willingly occupying that role and simply by being willing to be it and willingly occupying it he blows it and again becomes theta l ron hubbard excerpted from the lecture thetamest theory being problem aspect this lecture is available in the universe processes congress willingness to be and communicate thetamest theory being problem aspect universe processes congress universe processes congress what are these lectures about delivered in phoenix arizona in june of 1954 the universe processes congress was the culmination of eighteen months of intensive research by ron into techniques for exteriorization and the achievement of ot and the breakthrough he announced at the beginning of this congress was momentous because here was the discovery of the relationship of duplication to bridge progress if an auditor could not duplicate how could he deliver the tech and if preclear could not duplicate how could he do the process how could he exteriorize and go free here was the very key to entrapment on the whole track discovery so encompassing it provided the resolution for all cases and this opened the way to still more answers from how being creates space to how the material universe itself was created from why persons willingness to duplicate establishes his ability to communicate to why an exteriorized individual who can duplicate sees far better than anyone with mest eyes and finally to why any difficulty stems from persons unwillingness to duplicate here too were duplication processes delivered for the first time ever on group basis and introduced by ron with these words i have some phenomenal things never tried before to try out on you thus the congress experienced firsthand hours of processing personally from ron culminating in the universe processes the universe processes congress includes 14 lectures complete with transcripts an extensive glossary and guide with key lrh references which relate to the series the master glossary in the guide covers both the lectures and the issues if you are not already member of the ias find out how you can
