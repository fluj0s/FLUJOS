details dawson would not say how investigators linked lockhart to the crime he did say police have lot of evidence but declined to elaborate we have the right individual in jail dawson said im 100 percent sure of that burks slaying drew national interest compounded by similar storyline that was developing at another quaint southern college town the murder of young coed and student leader at

speeding but lockhart took off in his silver chrysler sebring when two other investigators were called to the scene backup was brought in because lockharts vehicle matched the description of one that

short with an officer close behind him lockhart stopped hit the ground and put his hands behind his back lewis said lockhart later confessed to robbing an elderly woman last week outside walmart in

lockhart shortly after the murder and had it enhanced with the help of nasa they just didnt know who he was the photo might have come from local gas stations surveillance footage the day after burks
