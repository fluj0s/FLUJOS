government and finance division valueadded tax new us revenue source summary president george w bush has stated that tax reform is one of his administrations top priorities some form of valueadded tax vat broad based consumption tax has been frequently discussed as full or partial replacement for the us income tax system as of january 3 2008 in the 110th congress four proposals for fundamental tax reform include some form of vat hr 1040 hr 4159 s 1040 and s 1081 in addition in the 110th congress representative john dingell introduced hr 15 which would levy vat to finance national health insurance vat is imposed at all levels of production on the differences between firms sales and their purchases from all other firms for calendar year 2005 broadbased vat in the united states would have raised net revenue of approximately 50 billion for each 1 levied most other developed nations rely more on broadbased consumption taxes for revenue than does the united states vat is shifted onto consumers consequently it is regressive because lowerincome households spend greater proportion of their incomes on consumption than higherincome households this regression however could be reduced or even eliminated by any of three methods refundable credit against income tax liability for vat paid allocation of some of vat revenue for increased welfare spending or selective exclusion of some goods from taxation from an economic perspective major revenue source is better the greater its neutrality that is the less the tax alters economic decisions conceptually vat on all consumption expenditures with single rate that is constant over time would be relatively neutral compared to other major revenue sources vat would not alter choices among goods and it would not affect the relative prices of present and future consumption but vat cannot be levied on leisure consequently vat would affect households decisions concerning work versus leisure the imposition of vat would cause onetime increase in this countrys price level but vat would not necessarily affect this countrys future rate of inflation if the federal reserve offset the contractionary effects of vat with more expansionary monetary policy if the united states continued its policy of flexible exchange rates then the imposition of vat would not significantly affect the us balanceoftrade there is conclusive evidence that vat would change the rate of national saving more than another type of major tax increase the high revenue yield from vat would cause administrative costs to be low measured as percentage of revenue yield in comparison to other broadbased consumption taxes vats have produced relatively good compliance rates whether or not federal vat would encroach on the primary source of state revenue the sales tax is subject to debate federalstate vat could be collected jointly but state would lose some of its fiscal discretion this report will be updated as issues develop new

w bush has stated that tax reform is one of his top priorities his presidents advisory panel on federal tax reform analyzed different reform options including partial replacement vat or valueadded tax although the panel did not recommend the vat option it viewed this option as worthy of further discussion1 in the 110th congress some members of congress are expressing interest in examining the feasibility of levying some form of valueadded tax as way to reform the tax code or finance national health care2 representative burgess introduced hr 1040 which would allow taxpayers to select flat tax modified vat based on the concepts of robert hall and alvin rabushka as an alternative to the current income tax system3 representative phil englishs proposal hr 4159 would replace our corporate income tax with subtractionmethod vat and our individual income tax with consumedincome tax senator richard c shelbys proposal s 1040 and senator arlen specters proposal s 1081 would replace individual and corporate income taxes and estate and gift taxes with flat tax based on the hallrabushka concept in addition in the 110th congress representative john dingell introduced hr 15 which would levy vat to finance national health insurance furthermore some advocates of vat argue that this tax is needed to meet the longterm revenue requirements of the federal government4 1 the

development new tax framework blueprint for averting fiscal crisis washington 2005 45 p crs2 arguably the primary reason for congressional interest in the vat is its high potential revenue yield5 for calendar year 2005 vat imposed on most goods and services would have raised net revenue of approximately 50 billion for each 1 rate levied6 other aspects of vat that often raise interest or concern include international comparison of composition of taxes equity neutrality inflation balanceoftrade national saving administrative cost compliance and intergovernmental relations this report considers the experiences of the 29 nations with vats in the 30 member organization for economic cooperation and development oecd relevant to the feasibility and operation of possible us vat currently the oecd consists of 22 european nations turkey the united states canada australia new zealand japan mexico and south korea in order to examine different aspects of vat it is important to understand the concept of valueadded tax including the types of vats the different methods of calculating vats and exemption versus zerorating concept of valueadded tax valueadded tax is tax levied at each stage of production on firms value added the value added of firm is the difference between firms sales and firms purchases of inputs from other firms in other words firms value added is simply the amount of value firm contributes to good or service by applying its factors of production land labor capital and entrepreneurial ability7 another method of calculating firms value added is to total the firms payments to its factors of production types of vat there are three types of vats that differ in their tax treatment of purchases of capital inputs plant and equipment under the consumption vat capital purchases are treated the same way as the purchase of any other input the purchase price is deducted at the time of purchase this tax treatment of capital purchases is equivalent to expensing under the income vat the vat paid on the purchases of capital inputs is amortized credited against the firms vat liability over the expected lives of the capital inputs under the gross product vat deduction for the vat on purchases of capital inputs is allowed against the firms vat liability 5 the revenue for vat would vary depending on the tax base for discussion of this issue see crs report rs22720 taxable base of the valueadded tax by maxim shvedov 6 crs figure derived from vat revenue estimates in the following source william g gale and c eugene steuerle tax policy solution in alice m rivlin and isabel sawhill eds restoring fiscal sanity 2005 washington brookings institution press 2005 p 113 7 these factors of production have specific meanings to an economist labor consists of all employees hired by the firm land consists of all natural resources including raw land water and mineral wealth capital is anything used in the production process that has been made by man the entrepreneur is the decision maker who operates the firm crs3 all 29 oecd nations with vats use the consumption type the consumption vat is the type usually advocated for this country indeed most vat advocates intend to shift tax burdens from capital income to consumption furthermore consumption vat is simpler to compute because firms do not have to separate expenditures for capital from other expenditures methods of calculating vat there are three alternative methods of calculating vat the credit method the subtraction method and the addition method8 under the creditinvoice method firm would be required to show vat separately on all sales invoices9 each sale would be marked up by the amount of the vat sales invoice for seller is purchase invoice for buyer firm would calculate the vat to be remitted to the government by threestep process first the firm would aggregate vat shown on its sales invoices second the firm would aggregate vat shown on its purchase invoices finally aggregate vat on purchase invoices would be subtracted from aggregate vat shown on sales invoices and the difference remitted to the government the creditinvoice method is calculated on transactions basis under the subtraction method the firm calculates its value added by subtracting its cost of taxed inputs from its sales next the firm determines its vat liability by multiplying its value added by the vat rate10 most flat tax proposals are modified subtraction method vats under the addition method the firm calculates its value added by adding all payments for untaxed inputs eg wages and profits next the firm multiplies its value added by the vat rate to calculate vat to be remitted to the government the creditinvoice method is used by 28 of 29 oecd nations with vats tax economists differ in their classifications of the japanese vat both the credit invoice and the subtraction methods have been discussed for the united states the prevailing view of economists is that the creditinvoice method is superior this method requires registered firms to maintain detailed records that are cross indexed with supporting documentation vat shown on the sales invoice of one firm is the same as the vat shown on the purchase order of another firm hence the credit invoice method allows tax auditors to cross check the records of firms also each firm has vested interest in insuring that the vat shown on its purchase orders is not understated so the firm can receive full credit against vat liability for vat previously paid thus the creditinvoice method would seem to be easier to enforce also the creditinvoice method is probably the only feasible method if there are to be multiple tax rates 8 numerical examples with explanations of these three methods of calculating vat are shown in appendix 9 an exception is the final retail stage where policymakers have the option of including or excluding the vat from the retail sales slip 10 for comprehensive explanation and analysis of methods to calculate vat see value added tax methods of calculation by james m bickley crs general distribution memorandum available from the author crs4 supporters of the subtraction method maintain that it would have low compliance costs because all necessary data could be obtained from records kept by firm for other purposes still firm would have to make calculations based on these data for example deductible expenses would have to be separated from nondeductible expenses and some data expressed on an accrual basis would have to be converted to cash flow basis the creditinvoice method would have substantial compliance costs because the amount of vat would have to be shown on every sales invoice and conversely on every purchase invoice on the plus side however the creditinvoice method would yield an additional data base to firms some firms might find these additional data useful in decision making for example records of purchase invoices and sales invoices may improve some firms control over their inventories compliance costs of the creditinvoice method might be partially offset by the value of the vat data base to firms but this value has never been quantified the creditinvoice method would have greater administrative costs than the subtraction method because of its requirements for additional data computations and recordkeeping although there are data on the administrative costs of vat calculated by the creditinvoice method empirical data are not available on the subtraction method consequently quantitative comparison of costs currently is not feasible the subtraction method would not work administratively if many goods are exempt or if multiple tax rates are levied unless specified otherwise this report will assume that the creditinvoice method is used and that the vat is the consumption type exemption versus zerorating none of the vat proposals would require all firms to collect the vat the two fundamental methods of giving special tax treatment to businesses in an industry under vat are exemption and zerorating an exempt business would not collect vat on its sales and would not receive credit for vat paid on its purchases of inputs an exempt business would not register with tax authorities and consequently would not be part of the vat system hence an exempt business would not have the usual vat compliance costs and would not impose administrative costs on the government except verification of its exemption of course an exempt businesss costs however include any tax paid on inputs because it receives credit for previously paid taxes zerorated business would not collect vat on its sales but would receive credit for vat paid on its inputs this is equivalent to the business being charged zero tax rate zerorated business would be registered taxpayer and consequently would involve the usual compliance and administrative costs zero rated business however would receive refund of any vat paid on its inputs so its costs would not include vat paid at earlier stages the effects on final prices and total vat collected by the government caused by exempting or zerorating firms would vary with the stage of production an exempt retailer would not charge any vat on its sales but it would not receive any credit for vat previously paid on its inputs so its price to the final crs5 consumer would include all vat paid except that on its own valueadded the government would have collected tax on all the value added in the product except the retailers zerorated retailer would not charge any vat on its sales but it would receive credit for all vat previously paid on its inputs zerorated retailer would not remit vat to the government but it would receive refund for vat previously paid by suppliers hence the price of the commodity would not include any vat and the government would receive revenue exempting or zerorating retailer would not affect the linkage or chain of vat collections and credits between different stages of production because retailers are the final stage of production and distribution but exempting or zerorating an intermediate stage such as manufacturing of wholesaling would break the chain between firms at different stages of production exempting however causes far more serious break than zerorating for example an exempt manufacturer would not collect vat on sales to wholesaler and would not receive credit for vat paid on inputs nonexempt wholesaler would not receive credit for the vat paid on the manufacturers inputs included in the price it paid the manufacturer but the wholesaler would remit vat collected on all of its sales so some of the value added in the product would be taxed twice consequently exempting manufacturer or any other intermediate producer would increase total vat collected by the government and the final retail price of the commodity zerorated manufacturer would not collect vat on sales but would receive credit for vat paid on inputs the price paid by the wholesaler therefore would contain vat the nonexempt wholesaler would collect vat on sales and would not be eligible for any vat credits but the total vat at that point would exactly equal what it would have been had there been untaxed stage subsequent stages of production would charge vat on sales and would receive credit for vat paid on inputs as though there had been break in the chain hence zerorating manufacturer or other intermediate stage would change neither total vat remitted nor the retail price on the commodity11 if both zerorated firms and exempt firms operate at the same level of production in the same industry the zerorated firms would have competitive advantage because their costs are less by the amount of the vat policy makers may be faced with decision to either zerorate or exempt particular product zerorating is desirable when the objective is to exclude the consumption of the product completely from tax where an exemption is warranted when it is not 11 table b1 in appendix b summarizes the selective economic effects of exemption and zerorating which were discussed in this section crs6 regarded as feasible or desirable to tax the activity but some tax on final consumption is considered desirable there are two major objections to exemption first cascading results as the exempt firms and their business customers cannot receive input tax credit secondly firms producing both exempt and taxable including zerorated items must allocate inputs between exempt and nonexempt categories and this is difficult to accomplish in any nonarbitrary way and to control12 revenue yield in estimating vats revenue yield economists and public officials use the operating assumption that vat would be fully shifted to final consumers in the form of higher prices of goods vat or any other major tax increase would have contractionary effect on the economy unless offset by other economic policies consequently revenue estimate is generally made under the assumption that the federal reserve would use an expansionary monetary policy to neutralize the contractionary effects of vat also revenue estimate does not take into account the possible shifts in consumption patterns that might be expected if some items are taxed and others are excluded from taxation the potential revenue per 1 rate from vat would vary with the comprehensiveness of the tax base broadbased vat would have limited exclusions while narrowbased vat would have numerous exclusions obviously the broader the tax base the lower the tax rate necessary to raise given amount of revenue furthermore the broader the vat base the more efficient it is the exclusion of goods from taxation changes their prices relative to taxed goods changes in relative prices cause economic distortions consumers tend to substitute lower priced goods for higherpriced goods there are three primary justifications for excluding specific items from taxation under vat13 first the vat would be difficult to collect because sellers of some types of goods and services could easily avoid reporting their sales for example vat would be difficult to collect on expenditures for domestic services and expenditures abroad by us residents second some goods are excluded on equity grounds since these goods claim disproportionately large percentages of the incomes of lowerincome families data on spending patterns do not however suggest that exclusions can have very powerful effect on the distribution of vat14 third 12 john f due some unresolved issues in design and implementation of valueadded taxes national tax journal vol 43 4 dec 1990 p 385 13 this classification of justifications for exclusion from vat taxation was derived from the following source alan tait valueadded tax international practice and problems washington international monetary fund 1988 p 56 14 us congressional budget office effects of adopting valueadded tax washington continued crs7 some goods may be excluded because they are merit goods that is goods the provision of which society as distinct from the preferences of the individual consumer wishes to encourage15 some items may be justified for exclusion for more than one reason william g gale of the brookings institution and c eugene steuerle of the urban institute estimate that each percentage point of vat with only few exclusions could generate net revenue equivalent to 04 of gross domestic product gdp16 for calendar year 2005 us gross domestic product was 125 trillion17 for calendar year 2005 each 10 rate for vat could have raised net revenue of approximately 50 billion with broad base thus for 2005 according to the galesteuerle estimate us vat of 5 would have generated 250 billion in revenue in comparison for fy2005 the individual income tax yielded 927 billion18 the vats high revenue yield at low tax rate not only makes it possible source revenue for tax reform but also has generated concerns among some that vat revenues may finance larger public sector the issue of vat and the size of government is examined in later section of this report international comparison of composition of taxes one argument frequently made for us vat is the relatively heavy reliance on consumption taxes by other developed countries for 2005 for taxes on general consumption eg vats and sales taxes the united states federal state and local governments had lower reliance 80 of total tax revenues than any other oecd nation19 also for 2005 the united states federal state and local governments general consumption taxes as percentage of gross domestic product 22 were lower than any other nation in the oecd20 this lower reliance on consumption taxes may result from all other developed nations having vat at the national level vat is requirement for membership 14 continued us govt print off feb 1992 pp 2226 15 richard musgrave and peggy b musgrave public finance in theory and practice 4th ed new york

country see table c1 in appendix c 20 ibid for data by country see table c1 in appendix c crs8 in the european union eu21 sweden norway iceland and switzerland had retail sales taxes at the national level but eventually switched to vat22 according to the oecd the spread of value added tax also called goods and services tax gst has been the most important development in taxation over the last halfcentury limited to less than 10 countries in the late 1960s it has now been implemented by about 136 countries and in these countries including oecd member countries it typically accounts for onefifth of total tax revenue the recognized capacity of vat to raise revenue in neutral and transparent manner drew all oecd member countries except the united states to adopt this broad based consumption tax23 policy insights can be obtained by examining the experiences of other nations however just because other nations exhibit specific tax policy does not necessarily mean that it is appropriate for the united states to adopt this policy economic analysis of optimal taxation suggests that those choices depend on issues of efficiency equity and administrative and compliance costs and should be made in the context of the overall tax and spending structure these considerations may vary from one country to another equity major topic concerning any proposed tax or tax change is the distribution or equity of the tax among households there are two types of equity vertical and horizontal vertical equity concerns the tax treatment of households with different abilitiestopay horizontal equity concerns the degree to which households with the same abilitytopay are taxed equally both vertical and horizontal equity may be affected by the measure of abilitytopay and the tax period abilitytopay the most common measure of abilitytopay is income24 proponents of income as measure of abilitytopay argue that saving yields utility by providing households with greater economic security federal data are more readily available on different measures of income than different levels of consumption for example the federal government reports levels of disposable income which equals consumption plus 21 sijbren cnossen vat and rst comparison canadian tax journal vol 35 3 mayjune 1987 p 583 22 cnossen vat and rst comparison p 585 and oecd consumption tax trends oecd march 2005 p 11 23 oecd international vatgst guidelines oecd feb 2006 p 1 available at httpwwwoecdorg 24 for an overview of the incidence of the vat using income as measure of abilitytopay see us congressional budget office effects of adopting valueadded tax washington feb 1992 pp 3147 crs9 saving thus tax economists can more easily calculate tax incidence if income instead of consumption is the measure of abilitytopay some arguments for the consumption tax base suggest that personal consumption is the best measure of abilitytopay because consumption is the actual taking of scarce resources from the economic system some economists argue that consumption may be better proxy for permanent income than is current income see discussion below time period tax incidence usually is measured by using oneyear period data on consumption and income are readily available in oneyear increments and the concept of oneyear period is easily understood but many economists believe tax incidence is more accurately determined by measuring consumption and income over households lifetime lifetime income and consumption are affected by the life cycle concept and transitional components of income according to this life cycle concept household makes current consumption decisions based on its expected future flow of income averaging its consumption over its lifetime for example common life cycle is low income in the households early years high income in the households middle years and low income in the households retirement years young household may save small percentage of its income in order to acquire consumer durables in its middle years this household may save high percentage of its income while its income is highest finally during its retirement years this household may save small percentage of its income in order to maintain its consumption level thus annual consumption tends to be more stable than annual income over the households life cycle although many economists prefer the concept of lifetime income federal data are not collected on lifetime basis consequently economists have developed life cycle models in an attempt to measure equity but the distributional results from these models are subject to widespread debate vertical equity25 if disposable income over oneyear period is the measure of abilitytopay then vat would be viewed as extremely regressive that is the percentage of disposable income paid in vat would decrease rapidly as disposable income increases in most discussions of tax policy both oneyear period and annual disposable income or some other annual income measure are used consequently the vat is viewed as being extremely regressive for example cbo calculated the annual incidence of 35 broadbased vat for 1992 cbo found that all families would have paid 22 of their income in vat the burden on family income was 25 for comprehensive analysis of the vertical equity of vat see erik caspersen and gilbert metcalf is valueadded tax progressive annual versus lifetime incidence measures national tax journal vol 47 4 dec 1994 pp 731746 and us congressional budget office effects of adopting valueadded tax pp 3147 crs10 48 on the lowest quintile 32 on the second quintile 28 on the middle quintile 23 on the fourth quintile and 15 on the highest quintile26 if disposable income over lifetime is the measure of abilitytopay vat would be mildly regressive for lower and middleincome households it appears that nearly all savings are eventually consumed27 thus it may be that for the vast majority of households lifetime consumption and lifetime income are approximately equal highincome households tend to have net savings over their lifetimes consequently they would pay lower proportion of their disposable incomes in vat than would lowerincome groups but these highly stylized lifecycle models are controversial28 if consumption is used as measure of abilitytopay singlerate vat with broad base would be approximately proportional regardless of the time period in other words the percentage of consumption paid in vat by households would be approximately constant as the level of household consumption rises another equity issue concerns the burden of vat on different age groups if older individuals on the average consume more out of savings than younger individuals then vat would fall more heavily on the old than the young conversely an increase in the personal income tax would fall more heavily on the young than the old policy options to alleviate regressivity some supporters of progressive taxation oppose the vat primarily because they believe that it is regressive mechanism is likely to introduce progressivity at higher income levels but critics are especially concerned about the absolute burden of vat on lowincome households the degree of regressivity on lowerincome households however can be reduced by government policy three oftenmentioned policies are exclusions and multiple rates income tax credits and earmarking of some revenues for increased social spending including indexed transfer payments exclusions and multiple rates the incidence of the vat depends on its tax base therefore the regressivity of the vat can be reduced or eliminated by excluding zerorating or exempting those goods that account for disproportionately high percentage of the incomes of lowerincome households the 26 us congressional budget office effects of adopting valueadded tax p 35 27 franco modigliani nobel laureate in economics estimated that at least 80 of all savings by

the united states the american economic review vol 91 3 june 2001 pp 574595 crs11 exclusion of many necessities on equity grounds from retail sales taxes has been politically popular at the state level all members of the european union eu exclude some goods from vat on equity grounds also most eu nations have multiple tax rates on equity grounds reduced rates are applied to necessities and premium rates are levied on luxuries despite the existing policies in the eu most tax economists oppose exclusions and multiple rates to reduce regressivity for three reasons first the administrative costs compliance costs and neutrality costs are substantial29 if vat is to raise given amount of revenue then revenue lost from excluding goods must be offset by higher vat rates these higher rates increase the distortion in relative prices and consequently reduce the neutrality of the tax system second the possible reduction in regressivity from exclusion and multiple rates is declining because consumption patterns for different income levels are becoming more similar30 third for one year time period the reduction in regressivity is limited particularly for lowincome households money saved for exclusions is largely offset by higher tax rates needed for revenue neutrality on taxed goods31 tax credits the federal government could allow either flat tax credit or credit that diminishes as income rises in order to overcome the regressivity of vat this credit method could be operated in two ways first an individual could apply the credit against his federal income tax liability thus lowering his liability on dollarfordollar basis if the tax credit exceeded the individuals tax liability he could apply for refund of the excess credit taxpayer already due tax refund could increase the size of his refund by the amount of the tax credit household not subject to income taxation could apply for tax refund equal to the credit an income tax credit that declines as income increases could reduce regressivity more sharply than flat income tax credit second standalone credit system could be established which would not require an eligible household to file an income tax return in order to obtain refund for vat paid an eligible household would have to submit simple form in order to receive refund standalone credit system may be more effective than the income tax credit in encouraging lowincome households to file for refund but administrative and compliance costs would be higher as stated previously the presidents advisory panel on federal tax reform examined proposal for partial replacement vat the panel believed that 29 for an examination of increased administrative and compliance costs resulting from exclusions and multiple rates see liam ebrill michael keen

current law it would be possible to develop an approximately distributionally neutral tax credit and rate structure32 but federal credit system would incur some administrative costs which would increase the total administrative costs of vat furthermore households incur implicit taxes if their credits are phased out or income tested transfers reduced at the federal level studies have concluded that the refundable earnedincome tax credit eitc has had significant positive impact on participation in the labor force33 but compliance with eitc provisions has been an ongoing issue34 earmarking of vat revenues third option to reduce or eliminate regressivity is to earmark some of the revenue from vat to finance an increase in income tested transfers aaron estimated that an increase in benefits of approximately 5 billion for vat yielding 100 billion could fully protect low income families from paying the vat35 for example 10 percent increase in food stamp entitlements would approximately offset the effect on households eligible for the full food stamp allotment of vat that raised 100 billion in revenue this estimate is based on the fact that 100 billion will be approximately three percent of consumption in 1989 and that food is estimated to absorb about 30 percent of the budget in estimates of poverty thresholds36 many households with low taxable incomes do not currently receive transfers and would not be protected by aarons proposal horizontal equity if disposable income is the measure of abilitytopay the horizontal equity of vat would depend on the time period for oneyear period vat would be very inequitable because households with the same level of disposable income would have widely differing levels of consumption and consequently payments of vat for lifetime period the vat would have high degree of horizontal equity for low and middleincome households almost all income is consumed over these households lifetimes consequently households with the same lifetime incomes 32 the presidents advisory panel on federal tax reform simple fair progrowth p 194 33 crs report rl31768 the earned income tax credit eitc an overview by christine scott pp 1415 34 ibid pp 1617 35 henry j aaron the political economy of valueadded tax in the united states tax notes vol 38 10 march 7 1988 p 1113 36 ibid crs13 would have the same levels of consumption and the same vat payments37 over their lifetimes highincome households with equal incomes differ in their levels of consumption and consequently vat payments for example assume that two households have 10 million in lifetime income but the first household spends 45 million on consumption and the second household spends 9 million on consumption the second household would pay twice as much in vat as the first household thus for lifetime period the vat is not horizontally equitable for highincome households neutrality in public finance the more neutral is tax the less the tax affects private economic decisions and consequently the more efficient is the operation of the economy conceptually vat on all consumption expenditures with single rate that is constant over time would be relatively neutral compared to other major revenue sources for households two out of three major decisions would not be altered by this hypothetical vat first this vat would not alter choices among goods because all would be taxed at the same rate thus relative prices would not change in contrast other taxes such as excise taxes which change relative prices would distort household consumer choices by encouraging the substitution of untaxed goods for taxed goods but hypothetical income tax on all income would be neutral in this respect second vat does not affect the relative prices of present and future consumption in contrast the individual income tax affects the relative prices of present and future consumption because the income tax is levied on income which is saved and then the returns on saving are taxed households workleisure decision however would be affected by vat or any other tax on either consumption or income38 since leisure would not be taxed any tax increase would fall on the returns to work vat would have conflicting effects on the number of hours worked by each household household would have an incentive to substitute leisure for work because of the relative rise in the value of leisure to work substitution effect conversely household would have an incentive to increase its hours worked in an attempt to maintain its current living standards income effect thus vat could decrease increase or not change households hours worked for firm the vat would not affect decisions concerning method of financing debt or equity choice among inputs unless some suppliers are exempt or zero 37 henry j aaron the valueadded tax sorting through the practical and political problems the brookings review summer 1988 p 13 38 in economics leisure is any time spent not working crs14 rated type of business organization corporation partnership or sole proprietorship or goods to produce other types of taxes may affect one or more of these types of decisions but vat cannot be levied on all consumer goods consequently prices of taxed goods will rise relative to untaxed goods furthermore most nations with vats have more than one rate39 multiple vat rates alter relative prices of taxed goods finally vat rates in most nations have tended to rise over time despite these deviations from pure form of vat broadbased vat is relatively neutral compared to most other taxes this neutrality is greater if the tax rate is relatively low but the relative neutrality of vat compared to an increase in the personal income tax is uncertain40 inflation if the federal reserve implemented an expansionary monetary policy to offset the contractionary effects of vat then there would be onetime increase in the price level for example an expansionary monetary policy to accommodate 5 vat on 60 of consumer outlays might directly cause an estimated onetime increase in consumer prices of approximately 3 there would also be some secondary price effects some goods would rise in price because their factors of production especially labor are linked to price indexes yet if the federal reserve disregarded these secondary price increases in formulating monetary policy these secondary price increases would tend to be offset by price reductions in other sectors of the economy an examination of vats in the oecd has found only an initial effect of vat on the price level but it is difficult to empirically isolate the effect of vat from other possible causes of change in the price level it has been suggested that the federal government exclude the vat from price indexes hence existing indexing would not have an inflationary effect41 but such an approach might prove unpopular and it might be contested in court in summary the proper monetary accommodation for vat would probably cause onetime increase in the price level but not affect the subsequent rate of inflation ie cause continual increases in the general price level 39 for list of standard and reduced

model separating efficiency from redistribution american economic review vol 81 4 sept 1991 pp 985995 41 aaron the political economy of valueadded tax in the united states p 1113 crs15 balanceoftrade currently all nations with vats zerorate exports and impose their vats on imports this procedure for taxing trade flows is referred to as the destination principle because commodity is taxed at the location of consumption rather than production an alternative would be to apply the origin principle by having all nations levy their vats on exports but not imports all experts on the vat recommend that nations adopting vat use the destination principle in order to be consistent with existing practices of other countries the destination principle creates level playing field because imported commodities rise in price by the percentage of the vat but exported commodities do not increase in price for particular nation the vat rate on domestically produced and imported products would be the same the vat rate on particular good would still vary among nations simple example demonstrates this concept of level playing field assume nation has 10 vat and nation b has 20 vat exports from nation to nation b would not be taxed by nation but nation b would levy 20 vat on imports from nation thus consumers in nation b would pay 20 vat regardless of whether their purchased goods were domestically produced or imported furthermore exports from nation b to nation would not be taxed by nation b nation would levy 10 vat on imports hence consumers in nation would pay 10 vat on both domestically produced and imported commodities in 1962 the rules applicable to taxation were included in the general agreement on tariffs and trade gatt under these gatt rules indirect taxes were rebatable on exports but direct taxes were not rebatable taxes which are not shifted but borne by the economic entity on which they are levied are classified as direct taxes from 1962 through 1972 fixed exchange rate system prevailed and the united states ran deficits in its balanceofpayments us officials complained that the gatt rules favored nations with vats because their exports were zerorated in contrast corporate income taxes were not rebated on exports in early 1973 the united states and its major trading partners formally shifted to flexible exchange rate system under this system the supply and demand for different currencies determine their relative value if country has deficit in its balanceoftrade this deficit must be financed by net importation of foreign capital but net capital inflows cannot continue indefinitely thus over time this countrys currency will tend to decline in value relative to the currencies of other nations consequently this countrys balanceoftrade deficit will eventually decline as its exports rise and imports fall hence economic theory indicated that vat offers advantage over other major taxes in reducing deficit in the balanceoftrade thus us officials ended their complaints about the effects of gatt tax rules on international trade since early 1973 there have been periods when exchange rates have been managed by mutual agreement among governments central banks have crs16 coordinated purchases and sales of different currencies in order to stabilize their relative values to promote international economic stability even if there were fixed exchange rate us vat would have slight impact on the balanceoftrade because the proposed vat rate of 5 or less is low tax rate during the last 25 years the value of the dollar has fallen relative to an index of major currencies yet serious us balanceoftrade deficit persists in summary us vat offers major advantage over other major tax increases in reducing the us balanceoftrade deficit any large us tax increase which reduces the federal deficit could reduce the us balanceoftrade deficit the us treasury would reduce its borrowing on financial markets interest rates would decline and foreign capital would flow out of the united states this capital outflow would reduce the demand for dollars relative to other currencies this decline in the value of the dollar would raise exports reduce imports and consequently reduce the us balanceoftrade deficit national saving national saving consists of government saving business saving and personal saving42 vat or any other tax that reduces the budget deficit would be expected to reduce government dissaving and consequently raise national saving second issue concerns the effect on the personal savings rate of levying vat compared to increasing income taxes vat would tax savings when they are spent on consumption allowing savings to compound at pretax rate but an income tax is levied on all income at the time it is earned regardless of whether the income is consumed or saved the income tax is also levied on the earnings from income saved consequently some proponents of the vat have argued that choosing vat rather than an income tax to raise revenue would increase the return from saving and consequently raise the savings rate the rate of return on savings however has never been shown to have significant effect on the savings rate because of two conflicting effects first each dollar saved today results in the possibility of higher amount of consumption in the future this relative increase in the return from saving causes household to want to substitute saving for consumption out of current income substitution effect but higher rate of return on savings raises households income consequently the household has to save less to accumulate some target amount of savings in the future income effect thus this income effect encourages households to have higher current consumption and lower current saving 42 for an explanation of the components of national saving see crs report rl30873 saving in the united states how has it changed and why is it important by brian w cashell and gail makinen crs17 crs study compared the longrun effects on the capital stock and consumption of 60 billion vat and 60 billion increase in individual income taxes this studys results suggest that selecting vat instead of an increase in individual income taxes would raise the capital stock by less than 2 and consumption by only quarter to third of percent after 50 years43 an empirical study by the congressional budget office analyzed the economic effects of replacing quarter of the current income tax with 6 vat on all consumption cbo estimated that this tax substitution would in the longrun increase the saving rate by 05 raise the capital stock by 79 increase output by 15 and raise consumption by 1244 these cbo findings of only slight economic effects in the longrun are consistent with the estimates of the crs study45 administrative costs the valueadded tax would require the expansion of the internal revenue service but the high revenue yield from vat could cause administrative costs to be low measured as percentage of revenue yield the administrative expense per dollar of vat collected would vary with the degree of complexity of the vat the amount of revenue raised the national attitude towards tax compliance and the level of the small business exemption for tax year 1995 the government accountability office gao estimated the cost of administering us vat at 1221 billion if the vat had single rate broad base and an exemption for businesses with gross receipts of less than 10000046 for tax year 1995 professor sijbren cnossen estimated that the overall administrative cost of hypothetical single rate us vat at 1billion47 he assumed that the administration of the vat would be fully integrated with the administration of the federal income taxes48 the oecd found that evidence suggests lower cost per dollar on revenue collected for vat than for income tax49 43 crs report 88697 s economic effects of valueadded tax on capital formation by jane g gravelle p 2 archived report available

research on vat compliance has been limited50 for tax year 1995 professor sijbren cnossen estimates the compliance costs of single rate us vat would equal approximately 5 billion51 he emphasizes that compliance costs can be reduced by broadening the base of the vat imposing single rate and increasing the threshold for registration52 agha and haughton summarized estimates of vat evasion for five european countries53 these five countries and their percentage of revenue lost through evasion were belgium 8 france 3 italy 40 netherlands 6 and united kingdom 2454 in comparison to other broadbased consumption taxes such as the retail sales tax vat has produced relatively good compliance for four reasons first vat collected using the creditinvoice method offers the opportunity to crosscheck returns and invoices for example vat shown on sales invoice of wholesaler will appear on the purchase invoice of retailer tax auditor can examine both invoices to crosscheck the accuracy of the tax returns of both the wholesaler and the retailer second each firm has an incentive not to allow suppliers to understate vat on their sales invoices firm is able to credit vat paid on inputs against vat collected on sales consequently firms net vat liability will increase if vat shown on its purchase invoices was understated by suppliers third tax auditors can compare information about vat with information about business income taxation which will increase compliance with both types of taxes for example the sales revenue figure reported on business income tax forms may be checked for consistency with gross vat collected as shown on vat forms also check of cash receipts during vat audit may identify the under reporting of sales firms may attempt not only to evade the vat but also to evade the business income tax55 50 for current examination of vat compliance from the approach of behavior economics see paul webley caroline adams and henk elffers value added tax compliance in

organization of economic cooperation and development taxing consumption pp 199 200 crs19 fourth some firms legally required to remit vat may not register but these firms receive credit for vat paid on inputs hence these firms are only partially able to evade the vat because of the compliance with the vat by suppliers although compliance with vat is higher than other broadbased consumption taxes the level of noncompliance is significant as previously discussed some firms legally required to remit vat may not register furthermore firms may evade vat by altering or omitting information as indicated in the following 10 major types of evasion first registered firm may not record resales of goods purchased from unregistered suppliers second seller of both exempt and taxable goods may divert purchased inputs on which vat is claimed against taxed sales to help produce and sell exempt goods third firm may claim credit for purchases that are not creditable for example firms owner may claim credit for vat paid on an automobile but then use it for nonbusiness purposes fourth firm may illegally import goods charge vat on their sale but not report this vat fifth firm may simply underreport sales which is the most common type of evasion retailers are the most frequent users of this type of evasion sixth firm may collect vat on sales and then disappear this type of evasion is particularly common to small firms in the construction industry seventh in those nations with multiple rates firm may illegally reclassify goods into categories with lower tax rates eighth the owners of some small firms particularly retailers may consume part of their firms production but not record their consumption ninth firm may submit completely false export claims in order to obtain illegal vat refunds and tenth two firms may barter goods in order to evade the vat56 intergovernmental relations for the united states federal vat raises two primary intergovernmental issues the federal encroachment of the state sales tax and the joint collection of vat57 encroachment on state tax source it has been claimed that broadbased consumption taxation has traditionally been state source of revenue while income taxation has been federal revenue source consequently federal vat would encroach on primary source of tax revenue for the states58 56 for detailed discussion of these 10 types of evasion see alan tait valueadded tax international practice and problems washington international monetary fund 1988 pp 308314 57 for an overview of state tax officials concerns related to the enactment of broadbased federal consumption tax see us general accounting office state tax officials have concerns about federal consumption tax washington march 1990 77 p 58 for an examination of this issue see robert p strauss administrative and revenue continued crs20 most states however adopted their individual income taxes before they adopted their general sales taxes thirtynine states levy both individual income taxes and general sales taxes twentythree of these states adopted their individual income taxes in an earlier year then they adopted their general sales taxes three states adopted both taxes in the same year thirteen states adopted their general sales taxes in an earlier year than they adopted their individual income taxes59 constitutional restriction prevents the federal government from levying vat precedents exist for the federal government to levy new tax that many states already levy for example the federal government levied the personal income tax after many states had already imposed this tax also both the federal government and the states impose many of the same excise taxes the federal government relies primarily on income taxes but taxation of income by states has risen steadily over the years60 for fy2003 333 of state tax collections consisted of individual income taxes and 52 consisted of corporation income taxes61 thus total state taxes on income accounted for 385 of all state taxes collected in comparison for fy2003 general sales taxes accounted for 338 of state taxes collected62 hence it can be argued that the states have encroached on the primary source of revenue of the federal government states could continue to levy their retail sales taxes while the federal government levies vat in canada the federal government levies vat and the provinces continue to collect their retail sales taxes joint collection states could piggyback on federal vat to do this states would have to replace their retail sales taxes with vat and adopt the federal tax base because federal vat would probably have broader base than any state sales tax more revenue would be yielded for each 1 levied also the vat would eliminate duplication of administrative effort permit the taxation of interstate mail order sales permit the taxation on internet sales and lower total compliance costs of firms 58 continued implications of federal consumption taxes for the state and

may decline the opportunity for joint collection because of their desire to maintain greater fiscal independence from the federal government in 1972 federal legislation permitted states to adopt the federal individual income tax base and have the federal government collect its state income tax without cost to the states63 state delegated collection of its income tax to the federal government the law was repealed in 199064 in canada differences in tax bases for retail sales taxes in the provinces and the federal vat have resulted in unexpectedly high administrative and compliance costs different tax bases have caused products to fall in four different tax categories taxed by both political jurisdictions taxed at the provincial level but not at the federal level taxed at the federal level but not at the provincial level and not taxed by either political jurisdiction the federal government has tried to persuade the provinces to adopt the same tax base but they have refused65 63

valueadded tax for the united states lessons from canadian experience national tax association proceedings of the eightysixth annual conference 1993 p 98 crs22 appendix creditinvoice subtraction and addition methods this appendix provides numerical examples of the three methods of calculating vat creditinvoice subtraction and addition methods the tax rate for vat may be price inclusive included in the sales price or price exclusive added to the sales price most developed nations levy their vat rates on price exclusive basis the creditinvoice method of calculating vat is demonstrated in table a1 the rate for the valueadded tax is assumed to be 10 on priceexclusive basis the product manufactured and sold is widget the production of widgets involves firms at four different stages of production raw material producer manufacturer wholesaler and retailer the operating assumption is that the vat is fully shifted forward to the next stage of production consequently the consumer pays the entire vat66 the seller indicates the amount of vat on each sales invoice at the first stage of production the simplifying assumption is made that the raw material producer provides all of his own inputs the raw material producer has sales of 200 plus vat on sales of 20 10 of 200 sales plus vat equal 220 200 20 because the raw material producer purchased inputs he receives credit for prior vat paid hence the raw material producer remits 20 to the government at the second stage of production the manufacturer has sales of 500 plus vat on sales of 50 10 of 500 which is shown separately on the sales invoice sales plus vat equal 550 500 50 the manufacturer purchased 200 in raw material plus 20 was paid in vat as listed on the purchase invoice the manufacturer credits the 20 paid in vat on inputs against the 50 in vat collected on sales and remits the difference of 30 to the government at the third stage of production the wholesaler has sales of 750 and adds vat of 75 10 of 750 sales plus vat equal 825 750 75 the wholesaler purchased inputs for 500 and paid an additional 50 in vat consequently the wholesaler credits 50 in vat paid on inputs against 75 in vat collected on sales and remits 25 in vat to the government finally the retailer has sales of 1000 and adds vat of 100 10 of 1000 sales plus vat equal 1100 1000 100 the retailer purchased 750 in inputs and paid an additional 75 in vat the retailer credits the 75 in vat paid on inputs against the 100 in vat collected on sales and remits 25 to the government the vat remitted by the four firms was 100 the consumer paid 100 in vat on top of 1000 in retail sales the last line of figures in table indicates the value added at each stage of production the sum of all firms value added is 1000 which equals the sales price exclusive of the vat 66 this simplifying assumption is based on the fact that the vat is broadbased consumption tax levied on most goods and services crs23 table a1 creditinvoice method data in

purchases including vat of 220 his vat base is 330 550 less 220 his vat to be remitted is 30 9091 of 330 crs24 the wholesaler has sales including vat of 825 and purchases including vat of 550 his vat base is 275 825 less 550 his vat to be remitted is 25 9091 of 275 lastly the retailer has sales including vat of 1100 purchases including vat of 825 and his vat base is 275 1100 less 825 he remits vat of 25 9091 of 275 the total vat remitted to the government by all four firms is 100 20 30 25 25 this 100 in vat equals 9091 of 1100 the addition method is shown in table a3 the raw material producer calculates its value added by adding all payments for factors of production which the firm owned and applied to the production process thus the raw material producer had value added of 200 wages of 100 rent of 50 interest of 30 and profit of 20 next the raw material producer calculates its vat by multiplying its value added by the tax rate thus the raw material producer must remit 20 200 x 01 to the government this procedure applies to all other stages of production and total vat remitted is 100 table a3 addition method data in us dollars vat rate assumed at 10 return on factors of raw vat
