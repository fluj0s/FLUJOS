each to be included in the particular organizations administrative record the purpose of this letter is to respond to the questions raised with respect to the other applicants sirt fst csfsso and ign and part of the questions raised with respect to dfi and dci our respon ses are as follows sirt and fst your staff has stated that the schedules d of the applications sirt and fst have filed need to state that csi appoints sirt and fst trustees and to state facts showing the 2way relationship in treas reg 1509a4i2id sic your staff would like this information to establish that sirt and fst are supporting organizations of csi as general matter we assume t hat your staff are referring to section 1509a4i2iid of the regulations which relates to the second prong of the responsiveness test for zuckert scoutt rasenberger mr john burke qualified written material september 26 1993 page 2 determining whether supporting organization is operated in connection with the supported rganization the actual requirements of this regulation raise two issues with respect to the question your staff has raised first the regulation does not require that the supporting organization must appoint the trustees or other members of the governing body of the supported organization rather this is merely one of three ways to meet the first prong of the twoprong responsiveness test of regulatio ns section l509a4i2ii here csi does not appoint the trustees of either sirt or fst and therefore neither can ma ke the requested representation csi does however control who is eligible to serve as trustee since condition for tr ustee eligibility for bo th trusts is that the individual be an ordained minister of scientology in good standing with csi nonetheless both sirt and fst m eet the first prong of the responsiveness test under regulations ction 1509a4 i 2 ii c which is that the trust ees of the supporting organization maintain close and continuous working relati onship with the officers directors or trustees of the publicly supported organizations the narrative responses to part ii questions l and 5 of the two organizations1 applications as well as the extensive record in csis determination proceeding particularly the information concerning the operation of csis central reserves committee uneq uivocally establish this relationship these same facts also unequivoca lly establish the second prong of the responsiveness test contained in regulations section 1509a4i2d which requi res that the supported organization have signific ant voice in the in vestment policies of the supporting organization the timing of grants the manner of making them and the selection of recipients of such suppo rting organization and in otherwise directing the use of t he income or assets of such support organization once again facts th at unequivocally stablish this prong are clearly set forth in the narrative of each organizations exemption application as well as the extensive record csi has submitted for example on page 2a of its application sirt states zuckert scoutt rasenberger mr john burke qualified written material september 26 1993 page 3 sirt accomplishes its re ligious purpose by making donations grants and interestf ree loans to the beneficiaries csi selects and for such purposes and on such terms as csi in structs so long as consistent with sirts governin g instrument and on page 2d of its application fst states as scientology reserve s entity fsts financial affairs are directly supervised by csis central reserves committee in this capacity csi authorizes all expenditures of fsts funds to ensure they forward specific goals of the scientology religion in accordance with csis di rections fsts disbursements since 1988 other than operating expenses have consisted solely of grants and loan s to csi religious education college and to scientology international reserves trust as detailed on the attachments to part iv section lien 15 and p art iv section b line 4 as shown above sirt and fst meet both prongs of the responsiveness under the regulations b csfsso your staff has stat ed that csfssos dissolutio n clause should be amended to
