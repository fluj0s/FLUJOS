expire at the end of the next session of the senate as re sult recess appointment may last for less than year or nearly two years depending on wh the appointment is made presidents have occasionally used the r ecess appointment power in ways that have had the effect of circumven ting the confirmation process8 in response congress has placed restrictions on the presidents author ity to make recess ppointments under 5 usc 5503a if the position to which the president makes r ecess appointment falls vacant while the senate is in session the recess appoi ntee may not be paid from the treasury until he or she is confirmed by the senate the salary prohibition does not apply 1 if the vacancy arose within 30 days befo re the end of the session 2 if nomination for the office other than the nomination of someone given rece ss appointment during the preceding recess was pending when the nate recessed or 3 if nomination was rejected within 30 days before the end of the session and another i ndividual was given the recess appointment recess appointment falling under any one of these three exceptions must be followed by nomination to the position not later than 40 days after the beginning of the next session of the senate9 for this reason when recess appointment is made the president generally submits new nomination for the nominee even when an old nomination is pending in additi on although recess appointees whose nominations to full term are subsequently rejected by the senate may continue to serve until the end of their recess appointments recurring pr ovision of the appropriations act
