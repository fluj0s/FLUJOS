responsible for many of the combat deaths in iraq and afghanistan vehicleborne ieds and car bombs are now used to strike police stations markets and mosques killing local citizens as well as us troops us forces counter the devices through utilizing intelligence sources and by disrupting portions of the radio spectrum that insurgents use to trigger ieds insurgents quickly adapt to countermeasures and new more sophisticated ieds are increasingly being used in both iraq and afghanistan recent trends show decrease in the number of ied attacks in iraq since june 2007 but an increase in the number of effective ied attacks in afghanistan department of defense dod officials have also charged that iran may be supplying new ied technology to insurgents in iraq there is growing concern that ieds might eventually be used by other insurgents in pakistan and in other areas worldwide order code rs22330 updated february 8 2008 improvised explosive devices ieds in iraq and afghanistan effects and

use to trigger ieds insurgents quickly adapt to countermeasures and new more sophisticated ieds are increasingly being used in both iraq and afghanistan recent trends show decrease in the number of ied attacks in iraq since june 2007 but an increase in the number of effective ied attacks in afghanistan department of defense dod officials have also charged that iran may be supplying new ied technology to insurgents in iraq there is growing concern that ieds might eventually be used by other insurgents in pakistan and in other areas worldwide2 this report will be updated as events warrant background improvised explosive devices also known as ieds roadside bombs and suicide car bombs have caused over 70 of all american combat casualties in iraq and 50 of combat casualties in afghanistan

casualty continued crs2 that much of the munitions for constructing ieds in iraq may have come from large iraqi military ordnance deposits looted by insurgents or from stockpiles scattered in secret locations throughout that country before the war4 in afghanistan the ied munitions supply is supported by funds from an expanding opium trade5 afghanistans opium crop reportedly grew 59 in 2006 yielding 6100 tons or 90 of the worlds supply6 in 2007 the opium crop grew by another 34 and is now the source of 93 of the worlds supply of heroin and morphine7 news sources report that the average number of daily attacks in iraq has decreased by 42 since june 2007 coincident with the recent surge in the number of us military forces there in addition coalition forces in iraq have discovered significantly more enemy weapons caches largely due to an increase in the number of tips from iraqi nationals however dod officials have also stated that in afghanistan taliban fighters have increased both the number and lethality of their ied attacks8 observers have indicated that the taliban forces in afghanistan appear to have learned some ied techniques from the iraqi insurgents and some areas of afghanistan are now reportedly becoming too dangerous for reconstruction efforts there to continue9 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22330 the taliban reportedly is allied with local pashtun fighters and some foreign fighters and is using suicide bombings improvised explosive devices and small arms to increase attack levels in neighboring pakistan at least 865 security forces and officials have reportedly been killed by suicide bombs and improvised explosive devices in 200710 dod has found that insurgents build and deploy ieds by using social networks that for centuries in afghanistan and iraq have formed the sinews of commerce and survival for tribes and factions11 typical ied terrorist cell consists of six to eight people 3 continued summary by reason october 7 2001 through august 18

triggerman spotter and often cameraman videos of exploding us vehicles and dead americans are distributed via the internet to win new supporters in july 2007 dod officials reportedly accused four captured iranians of smuggling explosives and personnel from iran into iraq12 iran is suspected of supplying iraq insurgents with training and new ied technology such as passive infrared electronic sensors that are used for triggering roadside bombs the new sensors are more resistant to electromagnetic countermeasures now employed by us forces dod officials also suspect that iran is supplying iraq insurgents with more lethal ied bomb design called an explosively formed projectile efp an efp is made from pipe filled with explosives and capped by specially shaped metal disk when the explosives detonate they transform the disk into jet of molten metal capable of penetrating armor efps reportedly strike with enough power to cause pieces of targeted vehicles heavy armor to turn into shrapnel making them much more deadly than traditional ied weapons dod officials report there were 69 attacks utilizing efps in april 200713 the same type of efp device has been used by shiite organizations in lebanon where hezbollah receives military support from iran however iranian government officials deny httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22330 involvement with any transfer of these weapons to iraq14 in addition us intelligence officials have reportedly said that most ied attacks against us forces in iraq come from sunni insurgents rather than from the shia elements most directly backed by iran15 over time the insurgents in iraq have adapted to many us countermeasures and several dod officials have stated that protective equipment sometimes seems to be less effective after being deployed for only few months16 countermeasures dod has established the joint ied defeat organization jieddo to investigate countermeasures along with various national laboratories the department of

crs4 contractors and academia the marine counter improvised explosive device technology directorate and the army electronic warfare division also work with the jieddo to reduce the ied threat17 dod has also sent electronic warfare officers from the navy and air force into iraq and afghanistan to work on counteried measures18 the technologies being evaluated include electronic jammers and predetonators radars xray equipment robotic explosive ordnance disposal equipment physical security equipment and armor for vehicles and personnel19 in 2007 jieddo has funded almost 14000 jammers for marine and army units including robots for explosive ordnance disposal teams cougar vehicles for route clearance teams and guardian manportable jammer for dismounted operations the jieddo also uses intelligence sources to assemble and distribute products to military units daily to support their efforts to destroy the networks that create ieds electronic jamming devices include the ied countermeasures equipment ice and the warlock both of which use lowpower radio frequency energy to block the signals of radio controlled explosives detonators such as cell phones satellite phones and long range cordless telephones20 other countermeasures include the joint ied neutralizer httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22330 jin and the neutralizing improvised explosive devices with radio frequency nirf which produce highfrequency field to neutralize ied electronics at distance21 system now deployed in iraq codenamed ping fits inside humvee and sends out electromagnetic waves to penetrate the walls of buildings to detect ieds22 other sensors such as the laserinduced breakdown spectroscopy system libs detect traces of explosives used for ieds from as far away as 30 meters23 by 2010 the army plans

spectrum in the iraq combat theater is largely not managed and counteried radio jammers can sometimes lock onto other us electronic combat systems because of lack of coordination of spectrum usage also unmanned aerial vehicles uavs can sometimes lose their radio control links due to groundbased radio interference caused by counteried jammers once they are far away from their control base therefore dod is now developing an electronic warfare coordination cell to help sort out problems that can impede friendly operations or endanger explosive ordnance teams as they disable ieds on the ground25 other counteried research involves fusing large amounts of intelligence and surveillance data to monitor when and where bombs are planted using such data gathered by unmanned aerial vehicles uavs enemy bomb makers can be targeted before attacks can be launched sometimes the data can be played backward to see from where the bombers and vehicles came26 threat data about ieds is tightly controlled by dod to avoid giving feedback to the enemy about the effectiveness or ineffectiveness of different ied designs also proprietary rights must be protected for those companies who produce ied httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22330 countermeasures however these controls may sometimes limit access by other companies to important information about the effectiveness of antiied systems as they are tested or used in battle27 as result some industry officials say they are not getting access to all the information they need to help them create the most effective new solutions to counter ieds and suggest that relaxing some of the controls might lead to more solutions28 however the jieddo has recognized this issue and is taking steps including modifying content on its website to improve access to information at the appropriate clearance levels29 acquisition and funding of countermeasures some us army units in iraq and afghanistan reportedly lack the latest humvee armor kits and the new deployment of five additional army brigades has added to that shortage30 humvees can be uparmored through rebuilding process that adds classified technology called frag 5 or frag 6 which are armor kits that are said to offer 25 david fulghum jamming jamup aviation week space technology november 7 2005 vol 163 18 p 32 26 david fulghum attacking bombs aviation week july 31 2005 27 michael moss

washington post february 12 2007 p a1 crs6 increased protection against sidepenetrating efps31 however the weight of extra armor may sometimes hinder the payload and performance of humvees the army expects to begin taking delivery in 2007 of the first wave of blastproof trucks called mine resistant ambush protected mrap vehicles32 all humvees in iraq are to be replaced by mraps which are better designed to withstand traditional ieds however some dod officials have reportedly stated that the mrap may not be able to stop efps unless additional armor is added and that this known vulnerability will cause insurgents to increase their use of efps33 the army and marine corps are also planning to gradually replace the humvee fleet with the new joint light tactical vehicle jltv starting in fy201234 on august 5 2007 the house passed hr 3222 the department of defense appropriations act of 2008 where 500000000 was made available to the joint ied defeat fund until september 30 2010 the joint ied defeat fund allows dod to allocate funds where needed however under this legislation funds allocated for operating and administrative expenses are limited to not more than 110000000 and the office of the secretary of defense osd is required to submit plan to the defense committees explaining the intended management and use of the amounts provided httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22330 in september 2007 the senate committee on appropriations recommended 120000000 in funding for the jieddo which is 380000000 below the budget request of 500000000 the committee in its report expressed strong concern over the lack of formalized strategic plan to clarify the roles of jieddo within the department of defense and the intelligence community the dod was required under pl11028 to finalize the jieddo strategic plan by august 17 200735 however dod reportedly provided the plan to congress on september 28 2007 the jieddo also reportedly received 4269 billion in bridge fund as part of the
