because health care and peoples responsiveness to its costs may have changed in the decades since the hies implementation the method that best replicates the hie results may not in fact best represent current responsiveness to health care costsharing whether peoples responsiveness has changed is diﬃcult to know without another experimental study like the hie however on the speciﬁc question of which method is best for replicating the hie results this report points to the cubic formulahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33296congressional research service the library of congresscrs report for congress received through the crs weborder code rl33296 alternatives for modeling results from the rand health insurance experiment march 6 2006 chris l peterson specialist in social legislation domestic social policy divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33296alternatives for modeling results from the rand health insurance experiment summary the rand health insurance experiment hie was ongoing from the mid 1970s to the early 1980s two thousand none lderly families from si x urban and rural areas were randomly assigned health insura nce plans with different levels of cost sharing that is with various levels of deductibles coinsurance and outofpocket maximums the results from this unprecedented health insurance experiment showed that people facing hi gher costsharing that is they had to pay higher proportion of total health care costs out of their own pockets had lower health care spending than those in plans with lower costsharing similar experiment has been performed since the hie so it rema ins the epochal analysis for understanding the link between health insurance costshari ng and total health care spending this report examines the methods used to apply the hie results in health policy analyses the key variable used to try to explain health care spending in the hie was the plans coinsurance that is the percentage of total health care costs that the individual must pay understanding these results from the hie was complicated by the fact that for each coinsu rance rate there were multiple plans each with different outofpocket maximum although the maximum never exceeded 1000 for example person may have been enrolled in the 25 coinsurance plan but after that person had spent 1000 or less out of pocket the plan effectively became 0 coinsurance plan thus the nominal coinsura nce could not be used as the sole cost sharing variable for explaining the imp act of costsharing in the hie plans the hie results have been particularly useful for policy analysts estimating what effect changes in costsharing might have on health care spending in public health insurance programs for example micr osimulation modeling is one tool used by health policy analysts to estimate the impact of costsharing changes micro refers to the fact that the modeling takes place on an individual level rather than an aggregate level based on database of individuals representative of certain population the us population or smaller subset such as individuals enrolled in medicaid if one wanted to estimate the impact of an increase in coinsurance for example microsimulation model would apply that increase to every person in the data along with concomitant drop in total health care spending in most health insurance modeling the hie results remain the basis for adjusting total health care spending in re sponse to costsharing changes however applying those results in model is not always straightforward one of two methods is typically used elasticities generally preferred by health ec onomists and induction preferred by actuaries each has benefits and shortfalls but little comparative analysis has been done this report begins by gene rally describing and comparing elasticities and induction factor s the report then summarizes key findings from the hie and discusses how elasticities and induction factors can be used to replicate those results because of the limitations of these methods in modeling this report offers third alternative that appears to better replicate the hie results this method called the cubic form ula is simply formula that produces hiereported spending

coinsurance affect the quantity of health services used according to results from the seminal rand health insurance expe riment hie of the 1970s and 1980s generally speaking if persons costsharing increases less health care will be used if costsharing decreases more health car will be used economists account for such changes with measure called demand elasticity actuaries have related measure called induction factors these two methods are used in health insurance models usually with the purpose of replicating the hie results neith er of these methods is perfect or even perhaps inherently preferable moreover converting the hie results into appropriate elasticities or induction factors is not alwa ys straightforward the use of each has benefits and shor tfalls but little comparative analysis has been done the congressional research service crs has partnered for more than decade with actuaries from the group to formulate microsimulation models that provide estimates of the actuari value of health insura nce plans to account for changes in costsharing these models use induction factors crs and are in the process of significant overhaul of these models as part of that process the application of the models induction factors was assessed and compared to elastic ities and another alternative presented in this report the cubic formula this report is the documentation of that assessment this report begins with basic explanation of elasticities and their health insurance applications induction factors ar similarly described th contrasted with elasticities from theoretical standpoint such an elementary explanation is intended to ensure that the key distinctions and limitations of elasticities and induction factors are not missed particularly for their appli cations in modeling the next section of the report reviews some of the key fi ndings from the rand health insurance experiment finally the re port discusses how best to replicate hie results using elasticities induction factor s and the cubic formula in short this report asse sses the ability of the three methods to consistently replicate certain rand health insurance ex periment results because health care and peoples responsiveness to its costs ma have changed in the decades since the hies implementation the method that best replicates the hie results may not in fact best represent current responsiveness to h ealth care costsharing whether peoples responsiveness has changed is difficult to know without another experimental study like the hie however on the specific question of which method is best for replicating the hie results this report points to the cubic formulahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33296crs2 theoretical explanation of costsharing methods elasticity of demand the elasticity of demand is number that approximates the effect that change in price has on the quantity purchased of good or service in other words elasticities are used to answer this question if the original quantity q0 of good or service is purchased at the original price p0 how many units would be purchased q1 at different price p1 for two given prices p0 and p1 and the two associated quantities q0 and q1 the elasticity is defined as the percentage change in quantity resulting from one percent change in price starting from particular point p0 q0 this is represented algebraically as follows 1 qq q p p ppoint10 0 10 0 for example car dealership knows that if its price on particular model is 30000 it will sell 500 of those cars in the ear however if it drops its price to 27000 it will sell 600 the point elasticity w ould then be calculated as follows 2 600 500 500 27000 30000 30000 20 10 2point because the absolute value of the elasticity is greater than one it denotes that people are very responsive to price changes for this model specifically 10 drop in price would yield 20 increase in quantity demanded those dealing with elasticities aspire to apply particular va lue say 2 to all different prices and quantities for that g ood however point elasticities do not yield consistent results as costs haring factor they lack certa in desirable properties one such property is reversibility which means that the calculation of costsharing factor based on two points yields the same result regardless of which point is considered the starting point p0 q0 point elasticities are not reversible as demonstrated below by using the same two points used in eq 2 but switching the starting point the elasticity below 15 does not match the previous one 2 3 e500 600 600 30000 27000 27000 15point to obtain the same elasticity from given pair of points arc elasticities are used instead of point elasticities in other words arc elasticities are reversible archttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33296crs3 elasticities are calculated as change in quantity divided by average quantity change in price divided by average price or 4 q q q q 2 p p p p 2arc10 10 10 10 using the prior example the arc elasticity is the following and does not vary regardless of which is chosen as p0 q0 5 e600 500 600 5002 27000 30000 27000 300002 173arc as in this example the arc elasticity 173 is often close to the average of the point elasticities 175 in addition to reversibility another advantage of the arc elasticity is that it is defined even if any of the pa rameters equals zero in the pointelasticity formula if either p0 or q0 is zero the elasticity cannot be calculated for these reasons arc elasticities are generally favored by h ealth economists over point elasticities although the arc elasticity may be nearly as easy to calculate the point elasticity is often easier to apply when predicting quantity q1 eq 6 shows the formula that results from solving the pointelasticity formula in eq 1 for q1 6 q1 point q0 1 ep1p0p0 eq 7 shows the formula that results from solving the arcelasticity formula in eq 4 for q1 7 q1 arc q0ep0 ep1 p1 p0 ep1 ep0 p1 p0 the temptation is to take an arc elasticity and predict q1 based on the point elasticity formula in eq 6 however this does not yield proper results to illustrate apply the previously calcula ted arc elasticity 173 to predict q1 when p1 is 27000 and the starting point is 30000 5 00 although the actual q1 is 600 the pointelasticity version of q1 yields 586 for the pointelasticity version of q1 to yield 600 the original point elasticity of 2 would have to be used although it is more unwieldy the arcelasticity version of q1 in eq 7 yields the proper result in this case 600 when applying the arc elasticityhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33296crs4 1 it is possible to use an arc elasticity in the pointelasticity formula for q1 and obtain the appropriate q1 by using multiplicative factor however calculating that factor is more cumbersome than simply using th appropriate formula in eq 7in other words when predicting quantity using elasticities it is critical to use the q1 formula that corresponds with the asticity used whether arc or point1 the additional complication of applying the point elasticity is that because it is not reversible one must determine which point elasticity to use when predicting q1 from particular p0 q0 it is best to choose the pointe lasticity value based on the starting point closest to the one it is being applied to health insurance applications calculating elasticities when individuals are covered by health insurance is complicated by the fact that the price paid by consumers for health care that is their co stsharing is usually not the full price of that care for example the average price of hospital stay may be 5000 but the insureds effective price would be only the costsharing 750 deductible for example this effective price the persons outofpocket liability is what influences their behavior rather than the total price thus when looking at elasticities for health insurance purposes the prices p0 and p1 are generally the prices paid by the individual out of pocket rather than the actual total price for the good or service in addition it is often difficult to measur the quantity of health care purchased when deriving an elasticity for health care what should be used for quantity fortunately there is way around this dilemma using the fact that the total amount spent on health care ie the persons out ofpocket payments plus payments by insurance is the actual price of the good or servi ce not just the outofpocket amount multiplied by the quantity used th erefore the percentage change in total spending would be as follows with p0 and p1 representing the actual price of the good or service not just the outofpocket amount 8 in total spending pq pq pq11 0 0 00 however in calculating elasticities based on costsharing changes we assume that the actual price of the health good service does not change that is that p0 and p1 are equal as such price falls out of the equation so that the percentage change in total spending is equivalent to the percentage change in quantity demanded 9 in total spending in quantity demandedpq pq pq q q q10 010 0 thus the easiest way empirically to calculate an elasticity for health care is to use the percentage change in total spending as the percentage change in quantity demanded this applies to all of the uses of quantity for the remainder of this report for example an insurance company contracts with physicians so that typical office visit is 100 or p on average its enrollees make three visits per year forhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33296crs5 2 with an explicit measure of quantity number of visits because the underlying total price 100 remained the same the arc elasticity w ould yield the same result whether using that quantity or total spending affirming what was shown in eq 9 from the two data points in this example the point elasticities would be 00625 and 04167 depending on which point was chosen as the start this is quite large range for describing the impact of cost sharing changes 3 plans average coinsurance is often estimated in an effort to make elasticities applicable which is discussed later in this report 4 daniel zabinski et

principal actuary at the group for the crs contract on the va luation models documentation on those models regarding induction factors is very similar to the writeup in the msa monograph continuedtotal spending of 300 per enrollee for the office visits the rollees must pay copayment per visit of 5 coinsurance of 5 the following year the plan keeps its contract arrangements the same with physicians but increases its copayments to 25 for office visits coinsu rance of 25 the result is that the average number of visits drops to 225 for total average sp ending of 225 from these figures the arc elasticity is calculated as follows 10 225 300 225 3002 25 5 25 52 021429arc because the absolute value of this elasticity 021429 is less than one and closer to zero one would say the demand for this type of care is relatively inelastic that is substantial change in the effective price of care led to relatively small change in the amount of care demanded2 nevertheless the example is muchs implified version of the costsharing structure for the range of services in most health insurance plans which have deductibles and outof pocket maximums in addition to copayments and coinsurance that may vary by type of service as result precisely determining p1 for actual health insurance plans is not straightforward p1 becomes function not only of the new costsharing structure but of q1 the variable we seek to derive from p1 because of this simultaneous some might say circular relationship elasticities appear to be limited outside of applications to plans with only coinsurance costsharing3 induction factors induction factors are not discussed as co mmonly as elasticities in health policy circles thorough literature review on the topic came up with only handful of references all veral years old4 like elasticities induction factors are used tohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33296crs6 4 continued methodological description of health care reform premium and discount

ticities is that its f actors are relatively easy to apply on all plan types even those with complicated costsharing structures moving bey ond the simp lified case of pure coinsurance the actuarial method of induction offers tractable albeit imperf ect approximation to the actual change in medical care5 it avoids elasticities circular conundrum by applying the new cost sharing structure to the original spending it does this by calculating the dollar amount of outofpocket payments oop under the old and the new costsharing structures holding total spending q0 constant where i is the induction factor and oop1 denotes the dollar amount paid out of pocket based on the new costsharing structure but the old quantity demanded q1 is predicted as follows 11 q1 q0 i oop0 oop1 solving this equation for the induction factor yields the following 12 i q1 q0 oop0 oop1 eqs 11 and 12 illustrate that an induction factor is very different measure from an elasticity even though both may tr to replicate similar impacts of cost sharing changes on total health care spending the value of an elasticity represents the percentage change in quantity resulting from one percent change in price the value of an induction factor is the percenta ge of the difference in two plans outof pocket payments that directly aff ects total health care spending for example person has total hea lth care spending of 5000 of which 4000 is paid by health insurance plan and 1000 out of pocket another plan in which the person had total spending of 5000 may require 1500 out of pocket 500 increase an induction factor of 70 or 07 means that total health care spending would be reduced by 70 of the outofpoc ket difference between the plans 70 of 500 or 350 thus under the new plan with higher costsharing total health care spending for the person would be pred icted to drop to 4650 that is 5000 350 although induction factors nd elasticities are very diffe rent measures there are cases in which they can be shown to be cl osely related for example in plans where the costsharing can be represented as pure coinsurance th induction formulas oop1 can be written as q0p1 and oop0 as q0p0 in that case eq 11 can be written as shown in eq 13 which can be solved for the induction factor as shown in eq 14httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33296crs7 6 zabinski et medical savings accounts shows another version of the induction factor as function of the arc elasticity 7 eqs 12 15 and 16 also yields an induction factor of 12513 q1 q0 q0ip0 p1 14 i q q q p p10 0 01 the following emerges by dividing both the numerator and denominator of the righthand side of eq 14 by p0 15 epoint p0 i q q q p p px1 p10 0 10 00 through similar algebraic manipulations the induction factor can also be written as follows 16 i earc q1 q0 q0p1 p0 these last two equations may not have widespread practical applications however they both illustrate that induction factors can be expressed as function of elasticities both point and arc in their pure coinsurance forms6 they also highlight an issue that is indicated by the q0 in the denominator of eq 16 and in the upper denominator of eq 14 that inducti on factors are not reversible that is induction factors calculated from two points will yield different values depending on which of the two points was chosen as the starting point this is the same shortcoming that point elasticities have and eq 15 does not fix this arc elasticities do not have this shortcoming thus the inductionfactor equation as function of the arc elasticity in eq 16 necessarily places q0 in the denominator to introduce it because two values for the induction factor result from any two price quantity data points care mu st be taken to choose the correct one depending on the q0 used to create the factor and the q0 used to predict costsharing changes in new plan health insurance applications using the officevisit example presented earlier eq 14 yields the following induction factor7 17 i 225 300 300 5 25

traditional graphs and slopes are used with apologies to economists who would prefer st raightforward demand curves 9 the derivative of q2 with respect to p2 yields the original slopeinduction factors lack of reversibility is demonstrated once more by reversing the parameters of the officevisit exam ple and calculating that induction factor 18 i 300 225 225 25 5 167 in sum although induction factors appear to enable better analysis of greater variety of health insurance plans compared to arc elasticities they are not unambiguously superior one reason be ing that they are not reversible specifically the use of induction factors could lead to flawed results if single value is being used across domain of coinsurance levels additional comparisons in elementary algebra the slope of line is defined as rise over run specifically the change in the dependent va riable divided by the change in the independent variable x thus the equa tion for the linear slope between two price quantity data points is q1 q0p1 p08 substituting this in the costsharing formulas previously discussed yields the following 19 epoint slope p0 q0 20 earc slope average p average q 21 i slope q0 interestingly if the predicted quantity say q2 based on some price p2 is calculated from starting point p0 q0 based on one of the original points used to calculate the factors above the equation is reduced to the following for both point elasticities and induction factors 22 q2 q0 slope p2 p0 this results in straight line with the original slope and passing through the original data points9 from the officevisit exampl moving from 5 to 25 coinsurance yields an induction factor of 125 and point elasticity of 00625 applying these factors in the domain of 5 to 25 coinsurance to predict quantity yields the straight line in figure 1 as eq 22 would predicthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33296crs9 10 the same line results when switching the st arting point of the two original data points and when using the appropriate other poi nt elasticity or induction factor 11 in lieu of using the substitution of the slope calculus can be used to find some simplified form for the predicted quantity based on the arc elasticity formula let eq 7 predict q2 based on some p2 given constant elasticity calculated from two original data points the derivative of q2 with respect to p2 yields complicated equation the gist of the resulting equation is that p2 appears only in the denominator as quadratic formula this is consistent with the arc that resu lts from applying eq 7 as in figure 1 source congressional research service crs example and calculations this characteristic has important imp lications for applying the rand hie results discussed later10 however similarly substituting eq 20 in the predicted quantity formula for arc elasticities eq 7 does not yield simplified equation of any sort11 using the arcelasticity formulas predicted quantity yields nonlinear curve an arc that arc will pass through

casehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33296crs10 12 tom selden an economist at the agency for healthcare research and quality ahrq came up with this name for the conceptarc in figure 1 illustrates this for the coinsurance domain of 5 to 25 using 5 300 as the starting point and 021429 as the arc elasticity the concavity of the arc also indicates th at responses to costsharing will not be constant as is the case using point elastic ities and induction factor s specifically the concavity results in greater responsiveness at lower prices than at higher prices within the applicable domain whether this is preferable to constant responsiveness probably depends on the good or service bein g analyzed with respect to the demand for health care this concavity is consistent with the hie results discussed later that people are more responsiv to costsharing changes when their costsharing is relatively small compared to the respons when their costsharing is higher another desirable property of costsha ring factors in addition to those mentioned earlier is path neutrality that is when using factors particular value based on two data points the predicted quantity for given price should be identical regardless of which point is chosen as the start p0 q012 for example the straight line in figure 1 from induction factors and point elasticities results whether using 5 300 or 25 225 as the star ting point however in spite of the reversibility of the underlying factor arc asticities are not path neutral the arc in figure 1 would be slightly different had 25 225 been used as the starting point beginning at the higher price the resulting arc would not bulge as much from the straight line at 15 coinsurance for example the quantity at the straight line is 2625 on the arc in figure 1 it is 2419 if the starting point had been 25 225 the quantity on the arc would have been at 2505 at 15 coinsurance the difference in the estimated quantity between the arc elasticity results is approximately 35 in the previous examples the starting point p0 q0 used to predict quantity has always been one of the two original points used in calculating the costsharing factor however when applying given costshari ng factor the data may require beginning from known point that is not one of the or iginal points if those original points were even known in the officebased exampl given the induction factor of 125 the point elasticity of 00625 and the arc asticity of 021429 assume plan has 15 coinsurance p0 and that an analyst wants to predict range of quantities based on changes to that coinsurance if costs haring factor is path neutral then the predicted quantities in this example s hould be the same as illustrated in figure 1 assuming this would be the case the q0 associated with the 15 coinsurance was taken from the points on the lines in figure 1 2625 for the pointelasticity and induction formulas and 2419 for the arcelasticity formula figure 2 shows the predicted quantities generated from beginning coinsurance of 15 and applying the various costsha ring methods the dark lines are the original ones from figure 1 with which the results would coincide if they were path neutral however none of the three costsharing methods point elasticities induction factors or arc elastic ities is path neutral the dashed lines show the predicted quantities based on the elasticities with the straight line based on the point elasticity and the arc based on the arc elasticity the light solid line shows thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33296crs11 13 as demonstrated previously arc elasticities are not path neutral even when using one of the factors original points as the starting poi nt for predicting quantity the other predicted quantity associated with 15 coinsurance q02505 would have yielded yet another distinct arc in figure 2 this one passing through the or iginal point of 25 225 but not 0 300predicted quantities ba sed on the induction factor ll of the methods reproduce the q0 on which the predicted quantities in the figure were based at 15 coinsurance only the arc elasticity matches the original data point 5 300 note that none of the methods obtains the original point of 25 22513 this lack of path neutrality is serious limitation of all these costshari ng methods the implications of which are discussed in detail in the section on the methods ability to replicate hie results source congressional research service crs example and calculations note the two dark lines are the original results shown in figure 1 ideally the factors would be path neutral

free for all lessons from the rand health insurance experiment cambridge massachusetts harvard university press 1993 hereafter cited as newhouse free for all authors of the hie often refer to the outof pocket maximum as the maximum dollar expenditure mde there were couple other plans with slightly different costsharing design s but they received less attention in the hie results 15 all of the results in this section are based on the average annual perperson medical spending based on the fourequation model scribed in chapter 3 of newhouse et alrand health insurance experiment the rand health insurance experiment hie was ongoing from the mid 1970s to the early 1980s two thousand none lderly families from si x urban and rural areas were randomly assigned health insura nce plans with different levels of cost sharing the results from this unprecedented health insurance experiment showed that people facing higher co stsharing that is they d to pay higher proportion of total health care costs out of their own poc kets had lower health care spending that those in plans with lower costsharing similar experiment has been performed since the hie so it remains the epochal analysis for understanding the link between health insurance costsharing and total health care spending the key variable used to explain health care spending in the hie was the plans coinsurance that is the

average coinsurance is 16 the 50 plans is 24 and the 95 plans is 31 this is shown by the points connected by the heavy solid line segments in figure 5 along with the previous points from the pure price effects that is for purecoinsurance plans from figure 4 over its applicable domain the average coinsurance for plans with an outofpocket maximum yields spending in line with the pure price effects from purecoinsurance plans17 the concordance of these results is wh at one might have expected it also makes applying these results convenien t first microdata on health care expenditures rarely provide costshari ng information like plans nominal coinsurance the results in figure 5 suggest that such information may not be necessary that the average coinsurance pa id by person even in plan with complicated costsharing stru cture should be as reliabl in deriving and applying costsharing factors as that of purecoinsurance plan in addition the average coinsurance of the typical hie plans did not exceed 31 however in dealing with individual s expenditure data some people may have faced high costsharing for example many people may have had health care expenses that never reached their plan s deductible thus facing an average coinsurance of 100 costsharing factor s calculated from the hie at an average coinsurance of 31 may not be appropria when applied at 100 coinsurance because the pure price effects are estima ted for coinsurance up to 95 and are consistent with the typical hie plans through their average coinsurance domain of 31 one can justify using costsharing factors from the pure price effects for application to all average coinsurance levels regardless of the complexity of plans underlying costsharing structure because of the potentially broader appli

first one of the four coinsurance levels used in the hie is 0 value which makes the pointelasticity formula undefined when the point elasticity pe rforms best its results coincide with those using induction factors otherwise as illustrated in figure 2 the application of the point elasticity is far from optimal calculating and applying costsharing methods based on hie results in this section of the report costsha ring factors arc asticities and induction factors are calculated from the hie results in table 1 18 in this section once the arc elasticities and the induction factors are calcula ted variations in their application and the results are discussed one goal of this analysis is to demonstrate how the factors might be applied in microsimulation model using the structure of the crshay models as an example the crshay models use expenditure da ta from individuals who are enrolled in health insurance plans with innumerable and unknown costsharing structures using the expenditure data by source of payment that is outofpocket versus insurancepaid expenses the first step is to standardize the data applying cost sharing factors to produce expenditure levels as if everyone were in free plan the estimated free plan data then becomes the baseline against which costsharing arrangements are applied table 2 arc elasticities between average coinsurance amounts by

total medical elasticities reflect the comb ination of outpatient and inpatient spending and therefore have the result of tempering the differences in those elasticitiesthe key column in table 2 is the shaded one showing elasticities for total medical these values vary depending on the average coinsurance range used19 even if an analyst were to carefully sel ect an elasticity according to these results choosing value is not always straightfo rward consider person in plan with 15 pure coinsurance on 5000 total spe nding 750 out of pocket which elasticity should be used if estimating the impact of moving to 40 coinsurance plan an elasticity of 022 would pred ict total spending at 4097 using eq 7 if an elasticity of 017 were used total spending in th new plan would be estimated at 4284 nearly 5 higher thus even the most fastidious analysts can reasonably use different elasticities and come up with different results on that basis alone predicting quantity with pointelasticity and arcelasticity formulas earlier in this report it was noted that when predicting quantity using elasticities it is cr itical to use the q1 formula that corresponds with the elasticity used whether arc or point this point merits repeating in the context of the hie results because arcelasticity factors are so often applied in the pointelasticity formula for predicting quantity that is arcelasticity factors like those in table 2 are often applied in eq 6 instead of the more appropriate eq 7 based on the total medical elasticities in table 2 table 3 shows the results if one were to use those elasticities to estimate freeplan spending from the other three coinsurance rates specifically for each row in table 3 the appropriate elasticity is taken from the first three rows of table 2 since the purpose of the calculation is to estimate freeplan spending the result shoul d be 100 b ecause the arcelasticity formula is rarely written in terms of q1 arc elasticities are often applied using the pointelasticity formula in eq 6 t hose results are shown in column of table 3 and do not yield the target amount of 100 shown in column c column b shows the results of using the arc elasticities with the formula for q1 from eq 7 which yields the targeted results eq 23 illustrates how these results were calculated applying the 095 elasticity to the pointelasticity formula eq 24 does the same but applies the elasticity in the arcelasticity formula the results in table 3 again illustrate why arc elasticities should not predict quantity using the pointelasticity formula although the

predicting quantity is not path neutral that is when using factors particul ar value based on two data points the predicted quantity for given price will vary depending on which point is chosen as the start p0 q0 using the hie data points as p0 q0 and the appropriate elasticities between consecutive points yields the two curves in figure 6 the dashed line in the figure is predicted quantity based on the higher of two consecutive hie data points for example if predicting quantity at coinsurance price of 70 this is between the hie data points of 50 63 and 95 55 where the arc elasticity for total medical care is 02220 using eq 7 and 50 63 as p0 q0 predicts quantity of 586 using the same equation but the beginning point of 95 55 predicts quantity of 588 this is relatively small difference in fact over the domai n of 25 to 95 the difference in the predicted quantities varying which pair of consecutive points is chosen as p0 q0 averages about twotenths of one percent21 this is shown graphically in figure 6 by the nearly imperceptible difference between the lines over the 25 to 95 domain figure 6 also illustrates serious limitation of predicting quantity using an arc elasticity when the price is zero that is free as was the case in the rand health insurance experiment applyi ng the freeplan data from table 2 to predict quantity between price of 0 and 25 coinsurance causes eq

original data points this is another pot ential area of concern for applying the arc elasticities however this appears to be less of practical concern when using arc elasticities derived from the hie

dashed line source congressional research service crs analysis note dashed line from figure 6 based on moving from higher original hie data points to consecutively lower ones solid line predicted

difference between the curves is twotenths of one percentage point thus even when the beginning data point is not one of the original points used to calculate the elasticity applying the arc elasticity to predict hie results yields relatively consistent results except when predicting based on small coinsurance rates in other words even though arc elasticities are genera lly not path neutral thei r application for hie results produces curves that appear relatively path neutral except at smaller coinsurance levels except when dealing with freeplan levels arc elasticities appear useful in reasonably replicating hie results induction factors table 4 displays the induction factors calculated according to eq 14 and based on the coinsurance p0 and p1 and spending levels q0 and q1 in table 1 as previously mentioned the value of an i nduction factor is the percentage of the difference in two plans outofpocket payments that directly affects total health care spending table 4

03 induction factor the lines that result in figure 9 have relatively constant slopes not counting the graphs vertical lines that link the line segments solving eq 21 for the slope and holding the induction factor i constant illustrates why the slope is relatively flat and constant based on the four original hie data points for q0 and constant induction fact or of 03 the slope of the resulting two lines is between 018 and 030 this is consistent with the slope of the line segments between the hie data points where the coinsurance is not zero however between the hie data points of 0 100 and 25 71 the slope is 116 as result the two lines based on the 03 induction factor vary substantially from the line based on the hie data points although each of the two lines based on the 03 induction factor passes through one original hie point the one that served as p0 q0 in the formula for predicting quantity source congressional research service crs analysishttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33296crs26 there are two lines predicted from the original hie points and the 03 induction factor because the use of constant induc tion factor effectively assumes the factor is reversible of course it is not reversible as illustrated by the two lines that emerge between two data points when holdi ng the induction factor constant the dissimilarity between the slopes of the lines based on the hie factors versus the 03 factor causes particular concer n for the crshay models which produce results based on costsharing additions to free plan along with the same dashed line in the previous two graphs based on the hie data figure 10 shows predicted inpatient care from constant 03 induction factor and from the freeplan spending data point of 0 100 where average coinsurance is 25 the difference between the two lines is greatest the predicted quantity of inpatient care is 30 higher than the hie results these results suggest that if induction factors are to be used they should not be constant agai nst the entire domain of costsharing cubic formula both arc elasticities and i nduction factors have limitations when trying to apply them to replicate hie results these limitations are severe when doing analyses based on freeplan levels as illustrated in figure 6 or when using constant factor for all levels of costsharing as in figure 10 this has huge implications for the crshay models because they are built on base dataset that represents freeplan spending and uses constant factors regard less of costsharing these findings suggest the need for another method to estimate th impact of costsharing on demand for health care some other method that yields better mode l results may lack otherwise desirable characteristics not critical in modeling for example an arc elasticity has applications for analyzing all kinds of goods and services it produces standardized value for comparing peoples price sensitivity for all kinds of goods and services standardization is obtained by taking the slope of the line or of the demand curve and applying the original or average price and quantity combinations so that the units are longer part of the factor as dem onstrated in eq 19 and eq 20 for modeling purposes however such standardiz ation is not only unnecessary but is also problematic in that it leads to the problems observed in figure 6 better method for replicating the hie results may not ultimately produce factors that are standardized for comparing other goods and services it is more important however that the method produce values that are reve rsible path neutral and consistent with the hie results the hie results of interest for our modeling purposes are the four pricequantity data points in terms of average coinsurance and percentage of freeplan spending 0 100 25 71 50 63

moving from higher to lower costsharing as shown in table 4 while these are the ideal scenarios for the arcelasticity and inductionfactor curves the cubic formula always yields the same results without needing p0 q0 and regardless of whether one is moving from higher or lower costsharing the cubic formula has several improve ments over the other methods for example because p0 q0 is not part

provided only four data points it is not known which of the three curves best reflects the impact of costsharing between those points considering this as well as the relatively small overall differences between the curves th shape of the curves should not be an overriding criterion in deter mining which method to use estimating freeplan spending as presented here each of the methods ta ke particular average coinsurance to predict the percentage of freeplan spending associated with that coinsurance this section discusses how these results would be applied to create freeplan spending levels such as those used in the crsh ay models and how their results vary the example case is person who was enrolled in highdeductible health plan the deductible was 1000 after which 25 co insurance applied during the year the person had total medical expenses of 150028 of this total the person paid 1125 or 75 if this person had been in free plan her spending would likely have been more than 1500httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33296crs29 29 calculated as 0237550 9550029023 also figure 7 showed little difference in the results when the starting poi nt for predicting quantity was not one of the original hie points however those resu lts were calculated between consecutive hie points with the corresponding elasticity in this example there is greater variation due to the larger coinsurance domain usedto calculate freeplan spending using th arcelasticity formulas the appropriate elasticity for total medical spending is needed from table 2 because the intent is to predict freeplan spending that is p10 one of the values in the calculation should be based on coinsurance of ze ro as in the first three rows of table 2 the other value relevant for choos ing the appropriate elasticity is the other coinsurance of 75 in the table the nearest coinsurance rates to 75 are 50 with an elasticity of 023 and 95 with an elasticity of 029 based on its distance between 50 and 95 coinsurance the 75 coinsurance is estimated through simple imputation to have an elasticity of 02633329 the p0 q0 to be applied in eq 7 is the 75 1500 given in the example predictin g freeplan spending as follows 28 q1 q0ep0 ep1 p1 p0 ep1 ep0 p1 p0 where p10 q0ep0 p0 ep0 p0 where 0263331e 1e 1500 1026333 1026333 2572 as shown in eq 28 predicting freepl an spending that is predicting q1 where p10 causes p0 to cancel out of the formula thus the elasticity is the only variable remaining that reflects the original plans 75 coinsurance as result when dealing with freeplan information constant results ca n be avoided only by calculating precise elasticity values the results are quite sensitive to the value of the elasticity an arc elasticity of 023 w ould have yielded freeplan spending of 2396 an arc elasticity of 029 would ve yielded freeplan spending of 2725 when dealing with free plan the use of continuous arc elasticities is required to predict spending that is not constant over given domain in other words the arc elasticity must be used to create unique elasticities at each given point like point elasticity obviously this is not the role of the arc elasticity the approach applied in eq 28 to work around the factors limitation when dealing with free plan is arguably misuse of its factors thus when applying arc elasticities to freeplan information an analyst must choose be tween possibly misusing the factors or predicting constant spending regardless of costsharing neither is desirable in applying the inductionfactor formul as not only should the factor be chosen from the first three rows of table 4 but should also be taken from the penultimate column for higher coinsurance as startin g point this matters because induction factors are not reversible as with the elasticities there are two induction factors to choose between 117 based on coinsurance from 0 to 50 or 086 based on coinsurance from 0 to 95 these cons tant factors would predict unique amounts of spending for every coinsurance in the domain unlike elasticities as resulthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33296crs30 calculating an induction factor for given co insurance is not as crucial but doing so produces continuous factors that seem more accurate than the factors at 50 and 95 based on its distance between 50 nd 95 coinsurance the 75 coinsurance is estimated to have an i nduction factor of 09978 the fr eeplan spending level is then calculated using both eq 11 and eq 13 respectively below 29 q1 q0 i oop0 oop1 1500 09978 1125 0 2623 30 q1 q0 1 ip0 p1 1500 1 09978 750 2623 this is 2 higher than the comparable arcelasticity amount these results are also sensitive to the value of the factor an induction factor of 086 would have yielded freeplan spending of 2468 an induction factor of 117 would have yielded freeplan spending of 2816 applying the cubic formula to the same example is more straightforward in that there are factors to decide among thus the freeplan spending level is calculated by applying the price of 75 coinsurance as follows 31 q 15546p3 28459p2 17743p 1 15546753 28459752 1774375 1 614 in other words the cubic formula estimates that an average coinsurance of 75 yields quantity that is 614 of freepl an spending thus the 1500 in total spending is 614 of freeplan spending and this freeplan spending results 32 1500 614 2442 although there is range of possible results from the other two methods the cubic formula produces single result that result is 5 lower than the arcelasticity result in eq 28 and 7 lower than the inductionfactor result in eq 30 predicting spending from estimated freeplan spending pure coinsurance plan based on the freeplan spending estimates above one can predict spending in plan with nominal coinsurance of 75 and deductible or outofpocket maximum in this case of course the nominal coinsurance also serves as th average coinsurance priori one might expect total spending to be predicted at 1500 becau the average coinsurance of 75 as before once more the arc elasticity of 026333 is used in eq 7 with p00 q02572 and p175httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33296crs31 30 there is an interesting byproduct of the price levels falling out of the arcelasticity formula when dealing with free plan th arc elasticities become path neutral as demonstrated in this example by the pred icted spending of 1500 emerging by identity33 q1 q0ep0 ep1 p1 p0 ep1 ep0 p1 p0 where p00 q0 ep1 p1 ep1 p1 where p1 cancels out q0 1e 1e 2572 1 026333 1 026333 1500 as illustrated in figure 6 using constant arc elasticities to predict spending from freeplan values that is p00 also yields constant value the arcelasticity formula causes spending to be predicted ba sed solely on the value of the elasticity with its impact on the freeplan spe nding of 2572 calculating continuous elasticities is not only problematic as was mentioned before but it is also complicated requiring one to dd methodology to methodology30 predicting spending from the estimated freeplan level using the induction factors requires choosing di fferent induction factor than was used in estimating the freeplan value even though the analysis is of the same coinsurance amounts new factor must be chosen because induction f actors are not reversible and in this case the analysis is of moving from costsha ring to substantial costsharing of 75 rather than vice versa the applicable induction factors from table 4 are 047 and 074 for this example the induction factor is calculated as 059 and is applied in eq 13 as follows with p00 q02623 and p175 34 q1 q0 1 ip0 p1 2623 1 059075 1462 this result is approximately 25 less than the 1500 total sp ending that should have been produced in spite of the precise calculation of the induction factor the difference is due to induction f actors lack of path neutra lity and the issues surrounding the calculation of the induction factor itself an induction factor of 0571 would have predic ted quantity of 1500 the cubic formula produces the percentage of freeplan spending from the coinsurance eq 31 already predicted that 75 coinsurance yields quantity that is 614 of freeplan spending since th is led to freeplan value of 2442 shown in eq 32 the predicted spending in 75 coinsurance plan would be calculated as 2442 614 1500 this is not surprising considering that the 2442 was calculated as 1500 614 so 1500 emerges by necessity when multiplying it by 614 this demonstrates the c ubic formulas path neutrality typical plan structure pure coinsurance plans are virtually nonexistent todays health insurance plans have not only coinsurance but copayments deductibles and outofpocket maximums this example illustrates how thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33296crs32 estimated freeplan spending can be used to predict spending for the same person in plan with deductible of 500 followed by coinsurance of 625 with an outof pocket maximum of 2000 although not pur coinsurance plan this plan would also have 75 average coinsurance at 1500 total spending thus assuming average coinsurance is an accurate predictor of total spending one might expect the methods to predict 1500 of to tal spending from the freepl an level for this person in this instance1500 may be the desire d total spending under the new plan however the only information that would be known in the crshay models is the freeplan spending for this person becau applying the elasticities to predict spending requires an average coinsurance the only information for calculating this is the freeplan spending level of 2572 in other words calculating the average coinsurance of plan that does not have pure coinsurance requires using the given spending level as the basis in this exampl the first step would be to calculate out ofpocket spending under the new plan give n total spending of 2572 this is the same calculation that would be done for th inductionfactor fo rmula as follows 35 oop1 500 625 2572500 1795 the average coinsurance based on freeplan spending q0 would then be as follows requiring the introduc tion of new variable p1 36 p1 oop1 q0 1795 2572 698 the actual average coinsurance will likely be different once quantity is adjusted downward because of the costsharing nevertheless in lieu of any other known number one must then decide which elasticity to use based on table 2 again because calculating the elasticity is critical when dealing with free plan precise elasticity is used 025639 based on the aver age coinsurance this produces total spending of 1523 approximate ly 15 higher than 1500 37 q1 q0ep0 ep1 p1 p0 ep1 ep0 p1 p0 where p00 q0 1e 1e 2572 1 025639 1 025639 1523 using induction factors to predict spendi ng is relatively straightforward using eq 11 since it uses oop1 although its value differs from the one calculated in eq 35 because the freeplan spending estimated from the induction factors in eq 29 is different than the freeplan spending based on the elasticities as shown in eq 28 the induction factors freeplan spending of 2623 for this person produces the following 38 q1 q0 i oop0 oop1 2623 i 0 1827httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33296crs33 the challenge is deciding the value of th induction factor i again the average coinsurance will likely be different once quantity is adjusted downward because of the costsharing but in lieu of an other known number one must use p1 to choose an induction factor based on table 4 the crshay models and most other models using induction factors for modeling pur poses use constant induction factors regardless of costsharing level already shown to be problematic the average coinsurance p1 based on the freeplan spending in the new plan would be approximately 696 based on wher 696 falls between 50 and 95 coinsurance the induction factor is estimate d at 06221 plugging this value into eq 38 then yields 1486 which is 1 sm aller than the 1500 expected priori alternatively predicting quantity by directly applying the 696 average coinsurance in the inductionfactor form ula based on eq 13 based on freeplan spending also yields 1486 39 q1 q0 1 ip0 p1 where p1 oop1 q0 2623 1062210696 1486 this should not be surprising since setting the first line in eq 38 equal to the first line in eq 39 yields an identity 40 q 0 i oop0 oop1 q0 1 ip0 p1 where p0 oop0 q0 and p1 oop1 q0 q0 i oop0 oop1 q0 1 i oop0 q0 oop1 q0 q0 i oop0 oop1 q0 i oop0 oop1 thus when using induction factors the average coinsurance derived from applying plan structure to given pricequantity combination yields the same results as using the nominal outofpocket dollar amounts one of the most common arguments for using induction factors is th at it enables one to handle complex plan designs by virtue of the nominal outofpocket amounts in actuality its methodology is different than using the average coinsurance as result the limitations of the arc elasticity from calculating the average coinsurance in typical plan structure are the same limitations faced by the inductionfactor formulas this point is typically obscured however because the induction factors rely on the nominal dollar amounts as with arc elasticities and induction fact ors the cubic formula also relies on the average coinsurance of the new plan calculated from the spending levels of the old plan q0 applying the cubic formulas average coinsurance of approximately 702 based on its freeplan spending level produces the following 41 q 15546p3 28459p2 17743p 1 where p702 619 applying this percentageoffreeplan sp ending to the freeplan spending of 2442 from eq 32 yields 1512 not quite 1 higher than 1500httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33296crs34 using the same approaches to predict sp ending in the original plan which had 1000 deductible and 25 coinsurance ba sed on the freeplan spending levels shown in eqs 2832 yields the values shown in table 5 the target amount is 1500 once again the cubic fo rmula produces results clos est to the target amount to reemphasize the point the inductionfo rmula results were calculated using the first line of both eq 38 and eq 39 as expected the results were identical although induction factors are not reve rsible this added complication was previously justified by the factors capacity to predict spending based on new plans costsharing structure as applied to the original plans spending the arcelasticity and cubic formulas work best when the new plan is only pure coinsurance any other plan structure forces one to resort to cal culating an average coinsurance based on the original plans spending level which intr oduces some error however it was shown above that the induction factors methodolog is different than using the average coinsurance calculated from the original pl ans spending level introducing the same kind of error this seems to nullify the case for tolerating the induction factors lack of reversibility and the c oncomitant complexity mo reover the inductionfactor methodology is the only one of the three th at does not replicate plans original spending level when modeling purecoinsu rance plan as shown in eq 34 this is because the inductionfact or results are based on p1 even when p1 is

used to predict total medical care spending one might expect however that the effect of costsharing will vary depending on the type of service whether inpatient or outpatient for example one of the most interesting hie results is that spending in the 25 plan averaged 71 of freeplan spending for both outpatient and inpatient care as shown in table 1 and illustrated in figure 12 because of this concordance the corresponding arc elastic ities table 2 and induction factors table 4 do not vary by type of care between 0 and 25 coinsurance between 25 and 95 coinsurance spending does differ by type of care as do the factors source table 417 joseph p newhouse et free for all lessons from the rand health insurance experiment cambridge massachusetts harvard university press 1993 note total

factors do vary by type of service 03 for inpatient hospitalization 10 for pr escription drugs and 07 for all other care31 as was illustrated in figure 10 these values predict spending levels that do not always line up well with the hie it is arguable that medical care has changed so that the constant factors are more in line with current utilization patterns than the hie results however that is not the argu ment made these c onstant factors were based largely on the rand study32 it is difficult to determine how these constant factors were obtained from the range of hiebased induction factors in table 4 decade ago team of actuaries reexamin ed these constant factors since the management delivery and mix of health care services have changed dramatically since the study was performed some of the workgroup members thought the factors should be higher while others thoug ht they should be lower ultimately they decided to leave the constants unchanged but noted that one set of factors is not appropriate for all uses the factors used should be carefully considered in the context of the specific situation33 the induction factors currently used in the crshay models still have these values inpatient and ou tpatient care for practical modeling purposes one must consider whether the differences in th hie results by type of care would substantially affect model results if not it is probably not worth varying the factors by type of care again between 0 nd 25 coinsurance there is difference between inpatient and outpatient care whatso ever in terms of percent of freeplan spending the largest difference is at 95 coinsurance differences at the 95 coinsurance are compared in this section from the example person above 95 purecoinsurance plan predicted from freeplan levels would produce total medical spending shown in the gray column of numbers in table 6 the table also shows what sp ending would be predicted if all spending had been either outpatient or inpatient care and

of service the differences in the total medical column merit some di scussion even if it is somewhat repetitive first these amounts are based on the predic ted freeplan values which were based on the total spending of 1500 in the original plan with an average coinsurance of 75 the three approaches produced diffe rent freeplan values applying the factors to the estimated freeplan spending to 95 coinsurance should yield total medical spending that is 550 of the freeplan spending this was so for the elasticity and cubic formulas for the induc tion formula it was 554 thus the bulk of the difference among the factors was due to the difference in creating the freeplan values as mentioned in that section the results from the arc elasticities and the induction factors vary widely depending on the values chosen for the factors moreover as illustrated in figure 11 the methods functions yield dissimilar results between the hie coinsurance levels nd which one is superior is not known the cubic formula does not require the calculation of factors when predicting quantity because it does not have factors of its own pr edicting spending by various types of care requires estimating new formulas for each type of care different cubic formula must be estimated to be consistent with the hie results this is one practical limitation compared to elastic ities and induction which use the same formulas but different factors for different types of care for inpatient care the formula is estimated as q 22764p3 37873p2 19645p 1 for outpatient care it is q 08662p3 19296p2 15883p 1 for dental care it is q 0782p3 13865p2 11377p 1 for inpatient care in pa rticular the resulting curve is not ideal between 414 and 696 the slope of the curve is actually positive34 while the hie results are not known between th four original data points it is counterintuitive that higher levels of costsharing would lead to higher inpatient spending in spite of its other advantag the cubic formula is problematic for producing spending levels by ty pe of service at least fo r inpatient care the results in table 6 are not affected however because the coinsurance is 95 one of the original hie data points which is replicated by the cubic formulas if the example persons spending were all inpatient each of the three approaches would predict total spending that is 22 23 higher than if it were all outpatient though large this difference does not by itself merit accommodating typeofservice factors first this diffe rence occurs at the 95 coin surance level an unusual amount of costsharing for plan when calculating average coinsurance on individual records many may be at this coinsurance vel or even 100 if they are still in the plans deductible range of course in the deductible range dollar amounts are relatively small this leads to the second point that in the aggr egate the differences resulting from using separate factors by type of care may largely offset for example the total medical spending amounts are ba sed on the hie data in which outpatient care made up 46 of the tota l and inpatient care made up 54 applying those percentages to the numbers fo r outpatient and inpatient in table 6 yields 1416 in total medical for the elasticities 1439 fo r the induction factors and 1342 for the cubic formulas only the calculated results using the induction factors vary from the predicted total medical amount in table 6 by more than dollar thus as long ashttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33296crs38 35 for this analysis total medical consis ts of inpatient care inpatient hospital stays including zeronight stays and separately billing doctor expenses and outpatient care officebased outpatienthospital and emergencyroom visits 36 it is not clear whether or not the hie outpatient results in cluded prescription drugs the separate effect of costsharing on prescripti on drugs is discussed separately which would suggest they were not included in outpatient care the next section of this report discusses those results separately as well so prescripti on drugs are left out of outpatient care hereone is predicting total spending rather than by type of care it is arguable that the total medical factors pr oduce adequate results example using actual data the preceding hypothesis was tested informally by using personlevel expenditure data from the 2002 medical expenditure panel survey meps for those under age 65 with any health care spending these results are shown in table 7 table 7 average predicted spending by plan and factor based on 2002 meps plan

care using the respective cubic formulas yields total plan spe nding of 1161 difference of 35 from the totalmedical cubic formula result this result emerges by outpa tient spending being 49 of the freeplan level nd inpatient spending being 60 of the freeplan level replicating the result in table 1 the totalmedical result of 1202 differs from 1161 to the extent that the ratio of outpatienttoinpatient spending in meps differed from that in the hie these results will also vary depending on which services are included in each respective category for example if pres cription drugs were not modeled separately but were lumped into outpatient care wh ich is reasonable d ecision the difference in predicted total spendi ng would be 57 depending on whether typeofservice formulas were used instead of the total medical formula36httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33296crs39 37 1e1e 10171017141as was previously mentioned when applying elasticities with free plan one must decide whether to misuse the factors calculating quasipoint elasticities or whether to use the constant elasticity va lues and thus predic t constant spending across broad domain of costsharing fo r this example and for simplicitys sake the constant elasticities in table 2 will be used to predict freeplan values based on the meps data to create the freeplan values the three elasticities from the gray column of the first three rows in table 2 were used all records in the meps data with an average coinsurance between 0 and 25 had thei r total expenditures increased by 41 to create the freeplan spending level37 this was the case whether the persons average coinsurance was 0 25 or anything in between which is flaw in the arc elasticity when dealing with freeplan information for coinsurance above 25 to 50 the increase to the estimated freeplan spendi ng was 60 for coinsurance above 50 the freeplan adjustment was 82 this led to average freeplan spending estimated at 2764 26 higher than the freeplan level predicted by the cubic formula beginning with the freeplan spending estimated using the elasticity formula flawed as it is predicting total spending in the 95 coinsurance plan is less problematic even though constant adjus tment emerges this is acceptable since the elasticity on which that adjustment is based relies on the same coinsurance levels 0 and 95 used to create the elasticities from the hie as with the cubic formula the elasticity in this case will predict 55 of the freeplan value using the totalmedical elasticity the outpatient and inpatient elasticities will yield 49 and 60 of free plan spending for those services respectively based on the freeplan estimates the totalmedical elasticity for 95 coinsurance plan predicts average spending of 1520 at the same coinsurance level applying the outpatient and inpatient elasticities to those types of care separa tely produces an av erage valu of 1473 the arc elasticities estimate of the 95 coinsurance vary by 3 depending on whether the typeofservice elasticities are used versus the totalmedical elasticity of course these results still differ dramatically from the cubic formulas largely because of the flawed nature of the ar c elasticitys formula for creating freeplan values predicting total spending from freeplan spending is also problematic except when the coinsurance is at one of th hie levels which is the case here as with elasticities continuous induction factors can be calculated over range of coinsurance levels in an attempt to improve precision though its impact on accuracy may be questionable in applyi ng induction factors to the meps data the factors given in table 4 are used turning to the next induction factor once the upper coinsurance level of the pairs is exceeded for example to create freeplan levels using the totalmedical induction factors 163 is used for coinsurance between 0 and 25 for coinsurance above 25 to 50 117 is used for coinsurance above 50 086 is used this led to average freeplan spending estimated at 2161 about 1 lower than the freeplan level predic ted by the cubic formula and substantially lower than that predicted by the arc elasticityhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33296crs40 38 figure 5 of crs report rl31374 health expenditures in 2003 by paulette c morgan httpwwwcongressgoverprlpdfrl31374pdf the hie plans covered prescription drugs which at the time had traditionally been poorly covered by health insurance plans about 8 percent of total spending in th hie was for drugs from newhouse et p 365 this may have been higher than the average for that time because of the hie coveragealthough the arcelasticity and cubic formula replicate 550 of freeplan spending at 95 coinsurance the induction factor results are slightly different for total medical at 554 thus spending in the 95 coinsurance plan using the 047 induction factor averages 1196 calcula ting spending using the inpatient and outpatient factors 042 and 054 respectively instead yields an average of 1145 difference of more than 4 had an inpatient i nduction factor of 03 and an outpatient induction factor of 07 been us ed spending would have averaged 1031 in the 95 coinsurance plan illustrating on ce again that the induction factors of 07 for outpatient care and 03 for inpatient care do not replicate hie results consistently based on the meps data average spending in 95 coinsurance plan varies by 3 to 4 depending on whether the totalmedical or typeofservice formulas and factors are used however these di fferences are also affected by what is classified as outpatient versus inpatient care it is important to note that this is the coinsurance level where the difference by ty pe of service would be greatest since most plans would likely be at lower levels of coinsurance where there is little or difference by inpatient versus outpatient care according to the hie results individual analysts must decide whether such typeofservice analysis is merited prescription drugs prescription drugs are component of health care spending that has received increasing attention from those who follow health insurance issues this is not surprising considering the growing proportion of health care spending that it comprises in 1980 around the time of the hie prescription drugs made up 6 of health care spendi ng by 2003 that percentage had doubled to 1238 not much attention was given to prescription drugs in the original hie results but reexamination of the available information is merited in light of prescription drugs growing prominence as feature of health care coverage one caveat of this analysis is that because of the changes over the past 25 years that is the increasing number variety price and utilization of prescription drugs the hie results regarding prescription drugs may be partic ularly out of date and inapplicable considering the popular notion that demand for prescription drugs is most elastic among health care goods and services the section examines whether the hie results affirm that notion and to the extent the difference is measurab whether it should be accounted for in microsimulation modeling newhouse et presented their finding on the effect of plans costsharing on prescription drugs in this way other than through its effect on physician visits plan did little to alter drug use

inappropriate overprescribing the proporti on of inappropriate prescrib ing did not vary much by plan design costsharing redu ced the use of both prescription andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33296crs41 nonprescription drugs there was evid ence of substitution of overthecounter drugs for prescription drugs as costsharing increased p 365 these statements would suggest that the effect of costsharing on prescription drug spending would be similar to that of total medical care or outpatient care more specifically other hie results indicate that prescription drugs are quite different depending on ones interp retation to understand this it is helpful to r ecall the discussion of the effect of costsharing on total medical care in the section presenting selected hie results figure 4 showed the association between costsharing and spending in the original hie plans wh ich had outofpocket maximums however because of the outofpocket maximums the nominal coinsurance failed to capture all of costsharing in the plan separate estimate was derived by the hie authors to determine the pure price effects associated with the hie coinsurance levels shown as without outofpocket maximum in figure 4 the adequacy of these numbers was affirmed by how they lined up with the averagecoinsurance results shown in figure 5 although the analysis was limited in that the average coinsurance levels did not exceed 31 all three sets of estimates based on nominal coinsurance average coinsurance and pure coinsurance or pure price effects are not available for prescription drugs for purposes of this re port the last would seem most important which is the piece not contained in the hie results the other tw sets of estimates for prescription drugs are shown in dashed lines in figure 13 along with the original totalmedical lines from figure 5 the lighter dashed line in shows the relation between nominal plan coinsurance and prescrip tiondrug spending the darker dashed line uses the same prescriptiondrug spending levels but is based on the average plan coinsurance the points labeled in the figure are only for the prescriptiondrug lines amounts were given for pure coinsurance or pure price effects for prescription drugs lacking this the other two sets of estimates must be used to judge whether the totalmedical values are adequate estimators for prescription drugs as shown in figure 13 the nominal coinsurance for prescription drugs corresponds with the average and pure coinsurance levels for total medical spending prescriptiondrug spending ba sed on the average coinsurance appears much different than for total medical spendi ng this would seem to lead one to different conclusion than that of the hie authors the comparisons in the figure may be suspect however for example the aver age coinsurance for the dark dashed line in the figure is for all medical spending not specifically for prescription drugs this is problematic because the average coinsu rance specifically for prescription drugs may be different particularly if di sproportionate share of prescriptiondrug spending took place below the outofpocket ma ximum which is believable if most prescription drug spending took place belo w the outofpocket maximum then the nominal coinsurance would be closer to the actual average costsharing for prescription drugs than would the plans tota l average coinsurance in that case the lighter dashed line may be preferred this w ould be consistent with the hie authors conclusions it would also make calculating the effects of costsharing simpler since the totalmedical values could be used fo r all types of care including prescription drugshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33296crs42 it is difficult to determine from the hie what the pure price effects are on prescription drug spending even if it were possible to determine it would be questionable as to its applicability today in lieu of any more recent experimental information it is arguable that using total medical factors is worse than any of the other options especially considering th potential challenges of appropriately applying additional factors in microsimulation modeling source figure

elasticities and induction factors are used in health policy circles to replicate results from the rand health insurance expe riment hie this report showed how both methods have serious limita tions particularly for thei r practical applications in microsimulation modeling results based on arc elasticities are problematic when dealing with plan or even record in dataset in which there is costsharing results from point elasticities are not even calculable from plan with costsharing which is one reason why point elasticities were quickly dispensed with in this report if such free plan is used in applying particular arc elasticity total spending will be adjusted by constant percentage re gardless of the costsharing in the nonfree plan workaround was presented adding another level of complex ity to the application of arc elasticities but its appropriateness is questionable inducti on factors can handle such freeplan information unfortunately their values are not reversible between two pricequantity points two induction factors emerge rather than one this complicates the appropriate app lication of induction factors one purported advantage of induction fact ors is that they can better handle complicated plan structures this is because they are calculated and applied based on the dollar amounts of costsharing that indivi duals face in plan in addition induction factors predict spendi ng by applying the new costsharing structure to the old total spending which also makes its application easier the analysis in this report showed however that the induction factors essentially rely on the average coinsurance calculated from applying the original total spending to the new cost sharing structure arc elasticities do so as well with concomitant limitations acknowledged that induction factors effectively do the sa thing with the same concomitant limitations is ty pically obscured because th induction factors rely on the nominal dollar amounts thus in act uality induction factor s have inherent substantive advantage for handling complicat ed plan structures indeed because of their use of dollar costsharing based on the original total spending the induction factor is arguably inferior when dealin g with purecoinsurance plans upon which the hie results in this report were based this removes the primary rationale for tolerating the induction factor s lack of reversibility the crshay models create and use base line of freeplan values for thousands of recordsindividuals although arc elas ticities and induction factors can be used for this purpose their sensitivity to the specific factors values in such circumstances is additional cause for concern special care must be taken to use the appropriate values because the crshay models curre ntly use induction factors which are not reversible using the appropriate values is even more important and involved presently however the models use cons tant values for the induction factors regardless of coinsurance levels39 either new factors should be used that vary byhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33296crs44 39 continued but this should have little or impact on replicating the hie results or if there were an impact it would not be for this purpose wh ich vary by coinsurance regardless of the nominal dollar amounts of costsharingcoinsurance or new method should be app lied arc elasticities are not superior for this purpose given the methods limitations nd the models use of freeplan values in an effort to apply some method th at would be particularly useful for microsimulation modeling the cubic formula was derived its legitimacy is based on the notion that persons experience in plan as captured by their average coinsurance is appropriate for replicatin g hie results the cubic formula has many of the desirable qualities that arc elastic ities and induction fact ors sometimes lack the cubic formula is path ne utral because it does not have separate factors that must be calculated the cubic formula has issues regarding reversibility the cubic formula faces diminution of predic tive power when dealing with freeplan information in addition from practi cal standpoint it is much simpler to appropriately implement in microsimulation modeling the key flaw of the cubic formula is that if one wants to parately model the impact of costsharing changes by type of service for exampl inpatient versus outpatient new cubic formulas must be derived as was done in this report at least one of these cubic formulas produced quite undesirable results the cubic formula for inpatient care estimated that as coin surance rises between 414 and 696 there would be higher inpatient spending while there are hie results between its four original data points this result is counterintuitive the hie results also showed that for most costsharing levels there is little or difference in total spending resulting from separate application of costsharing factors for certain types of medical care even for prescription drugs the type of health care popularly believed to be most ffected by costsharing changes the hie does not provide evidence that people res pond dramatically different to changes in costsharing compared to other types of care this being the case it is arguable that the cubic formula for total medical is adequa for predicting all kinds of costsharing changes moreover because predicted va lues can vary more from the costsharing method used rather than the typeofser vice variation the c hoice of costsharing method is arguably more important than dealing with typeofservice variations none of these methods arc elasticities induction factors the cubic formula is perfect each has its advantages each has its flaws analysts face the decision given the advantages and flaws of each of which is best for their purposes for the crshay models which are presently built on baseline of freeplan values and use constant induction factors regard less of costsharing the cubic formula appears better able to replicate hie results than the current approach
