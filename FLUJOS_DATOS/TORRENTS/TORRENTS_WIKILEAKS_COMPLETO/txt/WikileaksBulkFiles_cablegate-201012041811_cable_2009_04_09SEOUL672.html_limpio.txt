pgov kn ks subject mnd dprk military rhetoric and national defense commission changes are about succession classified by pol mc joseph yun reasons 14bd 1 c summary the dprks recent restaffing and expansion of the national defense commission ndc and its hostile military rhetoric over the last several months are related to the dprk leaderships top priority need to stabilize the dprk internally in preparation for succession according to xxxxxxxxxxxx second priority was to achieve improved relations with the united states which the dprk regards as its only potential security guarantor ironically end summary military statements and the ndc 2 c in an april 23 meeting xxxxxxxxxxxx told poloff that the korean peoples armys kpa spate of highlevel announcements over the past several months such as the march 8 kpa supreme command report the first in 15 years and the four kpa general staff statements since january not seen since 1999 should not be misinterpreted as the dprk military asserting control over the country because the military could act only in concert with the workers party and the cabinet instead the generals appearing on tv was phenomenon directed at dprk citizens with two goals to show that the dprks hostile external situation meant citizens had to pull together and as power display to send lawandorder message to counter the increasing economic disorder resulting from decades of economic depression there was dissatisfaction among some elite groups in the dprk who knew of economic reform in china and vietnam and wondered why the dprk had instead deteriorated to tamp down this internal dissent external tension was needed the rokg was not particularly worried about the specific threats to the south contained in the statements because they saw the statements as targeted at the domestic audience and in any case knew the dprk would try to achieve surprise if it were to resort to military action rather than giving warning 3 c the key factor in the background was 67yearold kim jongils kji waning health after kjis august 2008 stroke the dprk was different environment that needed stronger leadership xxxxxxxxxxxx said that before the stroke kji was confident that he could rule for years but afterward he suffered physical and psychological trauma kji had become obsessed with creating political stability to allow an orderly succession though xxxxxxxxxxxx did not claim to know who was next in line immediately after the april 5 missile launch the supreme peoples assembly had declared the beginning of kjis third ruling period but rather than celebrating the renewal of his mandate kji was concentrating on changes that would pave the way for succession 4 c the most important of these was the enlargement from 8 to 13 members and strengthening of the kjichaired national defense commission ndc the ndc was first established in 1998 with largely symbolic role but had since taken on policy and coordination functions now it had the lead on succession xxxxxxxxxxxx believed kji brotherinlaw chang songtaeks addition to the ndc was important for succession preparation not only because he was married to kjis only sibling and close confidante 63yearold kim kyonghui but also because chang was seen as having effectively protected and acted for kji during kjis fall 2008 recovery period 5 c another key change was the replacement of national defense commission deputy chairman kim yongchun with oh kukryul 78year old kimfamily loyalist in relative terms since all senior officials are loyalists who xxxxxxxxxxxx thought was consolidating various roksurveillance and special operations institutions under his control at ndc one of these was the workers partys operations department which oh has headed since 1989 xxxxxxxxxxxx also referred to an april 21 joongang ilbo newspaper article claiming that office 35 charged with intel collection and the external liaison office charged with training agents had both been moved from the operations department to ndckpa control saying that rok intel sources did not think there was evidence of such move the operations department which formulates actions against the south was passive during the 19992007 sunshine policy period but was now becoming more active again in other words ohs job was to keep the south off balance and make sure that it did not disrupt the succession period xxxxxxxxxxxx said he believed that changes to the dprk constitution announced but not yet explained would also focus on successionrelated issues he alluded to frequent dprk propaganda aiming for the establishment of strong and prosperous nation by 2012 saying that dprk authorities believed they had already succeeded ideologically and militarily so they were concentrating on the economic side which is where the kaesong industrial complex fit in 6 c the dprks determination to maintain internal order meant that it could go so far as to engage in limited armed conflict with the rok at the same time the dprk was well aware that rok forces were ready for any provocation and would respond with superior force in addition the dprk knew that combined rokus surveillance capabilities would prevent it from achieving surprise so xxxxxxxxxxxx was reassured that direct military provocation was imminent relations with the us 7 c asked what the rokgs policy options were given the above situation xxxxxxxxxxxx answered indirectly saying that the main question was usdprk relations second only to maintaining internal stability to allow for succession was the dprks determination to improve relations with the us because only the us could solve both the dprks security and economic problems xxxxxxxxxxxx said this push for improved relations was ironic given dprk rhetoric attacking the us as menace but was nevertheless high on dprk authorities agenda xxxxxxxxxxxx said the dprk saw the 19992000 rapprochement with the clinton administration as the first failed chance for peace with the us that the bush 43 administration had turned to negotiations too late for substantial progress and that the obama administration amounted to second chance the dprk craved dialogue with the us aiming for big deal but first needed to raise tensions to create the need for dialogue 8 c the scope for interkorean relations depended on what happened with usdprk relations xxxxxxxxxxxx was convinced that the dprk would keep tension high towards the south while seeking an opening with the us therefore his recommendation to rok policymakers was to stay on an even keel to keep the southnorth situation from deteriorating further the dprks april 21 proposal for dialogue about landuse and wages at the kaesong industrial complex was potentially helpful in that regard but had to be approached carefully because the dprk would try to seize the initiative and lockin economic benefits without offering reciprocal steps like other rokg officials xxxxxxxxxxxx emphasized the need for continued close usrok coordination on all issues related to north korea 9 c xxxxxxxxxxxx cautioned that china would seek to prevent usdprk relations from improving too much adding with smile that had it not been for its attitude toward the us china would have moved to prevent the october 2006 dprk nuclear weapon test mt kumgang 10 c as an aside xxxxxxxxxxxx commented on the july 2008 shooting death of south korean tourist at mt kumgang he said that kpa soldiers and sentries in the area after frequent contact with south korean tourists had tendency to be too relaxed so kpa officers periodically conducted exercises to tighten discipline the shooting had occurred during one of those exercise periods stephens
