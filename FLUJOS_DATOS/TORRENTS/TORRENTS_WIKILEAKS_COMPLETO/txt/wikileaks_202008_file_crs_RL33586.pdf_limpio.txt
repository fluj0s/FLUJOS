federal networking and information technology research and development program funding issues and activities summary in the early 1990s congress recognized that several federal agencies had ongoing highperformance computing pr ograms but central coordinating body existed to ensure longterm coordination nd planning to provide such framework congress passed the highperformance co mputing and

released grand challenges highperformance computing and communications that document outlined research and development rd strategy for highpe rformance computing and framework for multiagency program the highperformance computing and communications hpcc program the hpcc program has evolved over time and is now called the networking and information technolog research and development nitrd program to better refl ect its expanded mission proponents assert that fede ral support of information technology it rd has produced positive outcomes for the country nd played crucial role in supporting longterm research into fundamental asp ects of computing such fundamentals provide broad practical benefits but generally take years to realize additionally the unanticipated results of research are often as important as the anticipated results another aspect of governmentfunded it re search is that it often leads to open standards something that many perceive as beneficial encour aging deployment and further investment industry on the othe r hand is more inclined to invest in proprietary products and w ill diverge from common standard when there is potential competitive or fi nancial advantage to do so finally proponents of government support believe that the outco mes achieved through the various funding programs create synergistic envir onment in which both fundamental and applicationdriven research are c onducted benefitting g overnment industry academia and the public supporters also believe that such outcomes justify governments role in funding it rd as well as the growing budget for the nitrd program critics asse rt that the government through its funding mechanisms may be picking winners and losers in technol ogical development role more properly residing with the private sector for example the size of the nitrd program may encourage industry to follow the governments lead on research di rections rather than selecting those directions itself the fy2009 budget calls for 3548 billion for the nitrd program an increase from the fy2008 projected budget of 3341 billion because the nitrd program budget consists of the budgets allocated to the 13

electronic mail nd instant messaging were byproducts of governmentfunded research in the 1960s that was aimed at making it possible to share expensive computing resources among multiple simultaneous interactive users additionally the report noted that federa lly funded programs have played crucial role in supporting long term research into fundame ntal aspects of computing such fundamentals provide broad practical benefits but generally take years to realize furthermore supporters state th at the nature and underlying importance of fundamental research makes it less likely that industry w ould invest in and conduct more fundamental research on its own as noted by the cstb companies have little incentive to invest significantly in activities whose benefits will spread quickly to their rivals21 further in the boards opinion government sponsorship of research especially in universities helps develop the it talent used by industry universities and other parts of the economy when companies create products using the ideas and workforce that result from federallysponsored research they repay the nation in jobs tax revenues productivity increases and world leadership22 another aspect of governmentfunded it rd is that it often leads to open standards something that many perceive as beneficial encour aging deployment and further investment industry on the other nd is more

salient and may merit further investigation if the united states is to maintain comprehensive it rd policy included among the possible issues congress may wish to pursue are the united states status as the global leader in highperformance computing research the apparent bifurcati on of the federal it rd research agenda between grid computing and supercompu ting capabilities the possible overreliance on commercially available hardware to satisfy us research needs and the potential impact of deficit cutting on it rd funding many members of congress as well as those in the research community have expressed concern over whether the united states is maintaining its position as the global leader in highperformance computing rd that concern was highlighted in 2003 when japan briefly surpassed the ited states in possessing the fastest and most efficient supercomputer in the world30 while this was reason for some concern it was also viewed by some as an indicator of how the united states research agenda had become bifurcated with some in the rd community focusing on traditional supercomputing capabilities and others focusing more on cluster computing or grid computing each type of computing has its advantages based on its application standalone supercomputers are often fa ster and are generally used to work on specific problem for example cryptanalysis and climate modeling applications require significant computing power and are best accomplished using specialized standalone computers clus ter computing however allows the use of commercially available hardware which helps contain costs the cluster configuration is useful fo r applications in which problem can be broken into smaller independe nt components31 therefore one possible course for congress could be to monitor closely the work th at was begun by the highend computing revitalization task force and is now being performed by the nitrd programs highend computing interagency working group and provide ongoing feedback and guidance without clear plan as to how to proceed pursuing two disparate research agendas with goals that could be viewed as being at odds with each other could split the research community further damaging its ability to provide leadership in either area the nitrd program already is working on roadmap for future directions in supercomputing therefore one possible course for congress at this time would be to monitor closely the work of the highend computing revitalization task force and provide input or more visible foru m for discussion ie additional hearings involving task force participants c ongress may wish to conduct its own inquiry into the debate over grid ve rsus standalone computing for example at july 2003 hearing one of the overarching questions the panelists were as ked to address was whether federal agencies were pursuin g conflicting rd goals and if so whathttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33586crs16 should and could be done to ensure they moved toward more coordinated unified goal another issue is whether the united states is relying too heavily on commercially available hardware to satisfy its rd needs while use of computers designed for massmarket commercial applications can certainly be part of successful highend computing rd plan congress may wish to monitor how this reliance may be driving the ne w emphasis on grid computing as noted earlier critics of it rd f unding often state that industry should conduct more fundamental r d on their own without government backing and that fiscal restraint dictates that less funding should be made ava ilable conversely supporters of government fundi ng would point out that it rd has very long cycle from inception to application and that any reductions in funding now could have significant negative impact for many year s to come in terms of innovation and training of researchers therefore congress may monitor nd assess the potential impact of deficitcutting plans on progress
