saudi arabia terrorist financing issues this report will be updated periodically overview since terrorists of saudi origin were invol ved in the qaeda attacks of september 11 2001 and since domestic terrorist violence s been increasing in saudi arabia there has been concern over the stability of saudi arabias political and social system and the need for the long term reform of its institutions despite increased saudi security measures aimed at thwarting islamic militants many analysts including the authors of the 911 commission report1 believe that the root causes of terrorism in saudi arabia are complex and cannot be eradicated by security policies alone however there is currently consensus in saudi arabia or in the west on the path toward reform and how it will help alleviate saudi arabias terrorist problem some expert s suggest that liberalminded reform policies would alienate moderate saudi religious leaders needed in the fight to undermine an underground culture of islamic militancy in saudi arabia httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21913crs2 2 see crs report rs21695 the islamic traditions of wahhabism and salafiyya aug 9 2004 3 country reports on hum an rights practices

arabia is monarchy with royal power vested in the descendants of king abd alaziz saud known more commonly as ibn saud the founder of the modern saudi state for over two centuries saudi arab ias ruling family s relied upon religious leaders to help bolster its legitimacy among saudis and leading conservative muslim clerics have gained extensive influence over saudi social policy as result of this tacit alliance between the ruling family and the religious hierarchy clerics practicing puritanical version of islam known as wahhabism have been able to institute number of social restrictions such as the segregati on of the sexes the prohibition of the sale and consumption of alcohol nd ban on women driving2 some analysts believe that such social restrictions have fostered climate of extremism in saudi arabia saudi officials have issued statements insisting there is association between islam and terrorism for many years saudi officials and some outside observers did not place islamic militancy at the top of their policy agendas believing that the kingdoms islamic roots immunized it from extremist elements human rights freedom of information as the us state department observes in its latest country report on human rights saudi arabia has elected representative institutions and its human rights record remains poor3 government security forces and the religious police continue to mistreat both citizens and foreigners through intimidation abuse and arbitrary detention regardin g the judiciary most trials are closed and defendants usually lack gal counsel according to the report the government restricts freedom of speech the saudi information ministry heavily censors the saudi press and forbids criticism of the royal family and religious establishment this policy is strictly enforced at the domestic level and extends to censoring local editions of the traditionally more open saudiowned pan arab newspapers published in london although most local newspapers are priv ately owned the government approves and appoints editors and can arbitrarily dismi ss journalists who cross the governments threshold for criticism the government owns all broadcast media but there are many regional satellite stations that are more open and have forced the saudi authorities to allow the written press little more freedom since 1999 the saudi governments internet service unit isu has blocked over 2000 webs ites many of whic h contain sexually explicit material4 reform in saudi arabia in saudi arabia reforms that have been undertaken have been instituted from the top down and many arab and western critics believe that the process has been mostly symbolic in order to placate democracy dvocates abroad others believe that saudi arabias conservative society which is heavily influenced by arab tribal customs and puritanical interpretation of islam necessitates that its rulers move more slowly in liberalizing the saudi political and educational systemhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21913crs3 5 can saudi arabia reform itself middle east report 28 international crisis group july 14 2004 6 reform with an islamic slant washington post march 9 2003 7 in 1993 saudi officials improved relations with the saudi shiite community and allowed some of its exiled leaders to return to the kingdom 8 saudi leaders considered steps to reform the po litical system at earlier periods in saudi history though the royal family took concrete steps toward instituting reforms until 1992 9 many observers note that saudi security servic routinely ignore the provisions in the basic lawmany individual saudi voices are callin g for reform according to recent international crisis group re port on saudi reform reform has been common mantra echoed by royalty government officials shura consultative council members businessmen academics liberals and islamists alike there are clear elements of convergence virtually all want to preserve the countrys is lamic orientati on while ridding it of some of its more intolerant and restrictive mores and most claim to favor continued rule by the alsaud as guarantee of unity and stability while urging gradual movement towards more representative government institutions5 more extreme reform advocates particularly saudi exiles abroad who do not ppear to have large followings believe that saudi arabia should evolve from an absolu monarchy into constitutional monarchy with an elected parliament many fear that this would risk an islamist takeover of the saudi political system according to one saudi intellectual i dont think the us will like the outcome of democracy here6 saudi shiites who compose approximately 510 of the total saudi population and reside in the oilrich eastern province also are found in the ranks of saudi reformers as nonsunnis shiites suffer from official disc rimination and are s econdclass citizens in saudi arabia7 petition presented by shiite representatives was followed by an audience with crown prince abdullah on april 30 2 003 indicating th at both the government and the shiite pe titioners want to continue the more cooperative approach pursued over the last decade previous saudi governme nt attempts at reform despite the attention given to saudi arabias political environm ent in the wake of the september 11 2001 attacks the prospect for political reform in saudi arabia was first raised in earnest after the defeat of iraq in the 1991 persian gulf war8 at the time there was both internal and external pressure on saudi leaders to expa nd political participati on as some western officials had been criticized for allegedly going to war against iraq in order to protect wealthy autocratic regimes in the persian gu lf saudi prowestern liberals pressured the royal family from within and demanded that the government open up the political system saudi leaders cautiously responded and in 19921993 promulgated and established basic law to serve as precursor to future saudi constitution they also created local and national c onsultative councils majlis alshura to serve as advisory boards to the government the basic law banne d arbitrary arrest and harassment9 it did not alter the islamic character of the saudi governing system which bases its legal system on sharia or islamic law the consultative c ouncil which was initia lly comprised of 60 appointed saudi elites from the academic busin ess and religious co mmunities was given limited powers to question cabinet members propose laws and provide recommendationshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21913crs4 10 on august 20 1993 king fahd appointed 60member consultative council its membership increased to 90 in 1997 and to 120 in 2001 women are only permitted to serve as observers at consultative council meetings 11 meeting with members of the saudi consulta tive council crs staff visit to saudi arabia september 2004 12 new saudi election law does not explicitly pr event women from voting or running for office however an election implementation committee has ruled against womens participation in the upcoming municipal elections to the saudi government10 currently the majlis alshura has budgetary authority and its legislative proposals can be vetoed by the saudi government the consultative council does have the power to delay legislation it opposes such as recent proposal by the saudi government to establish highway tolls according to dr abdullah bin saleh alobaid professor and memb er of the consultative council one of the challenges the majlis alshura faces is the lack of understanding in saudi society over the respective roles of the executive and legislative branches of government11 recent reforms and setbacks saudi arabia has recently taken steps to expand political participation and loosen some restrictions on freedom of speech while simultaneously cracking down on the most vocal reformists in order to deter future activities in july 2004 the government nnounced that elections for local municipal councils will be held in ear ly 2005 though saudi women will not have the right to vote or run for office12 crown prince abdullah started n ational dialogue forum allowing reformers to hold open discussions on previous ly taboo subjects such as womens rights official corruption and abuses by religious po lice the government so permitted the first visit of an international human rights orga nization human rights watch and authorized the countrys first indigenous human rights organization crown prince abdullah has established higher committee for education reform which has been tasked with reviewing the saudi curriculum and making recommendations to modernize the saudi school system at the same time saudi ar abia has imprisoned several reformers on charges of incitement some were released after promising not to engage in future activities while others were put on trial until recently politi cal prisoners in saudi arabia have not been given access to an attorney nor have they been put on trial before judge some analysts note that recent trial of saudi reformers actually worked to their benefit in that some reformers want the saudi judici system to be more open and transparent the saudi government has since susp ended public trials of reformers prioritizing the fight against terrorism many regional analysts believe that domestic counterterrorism opera tions and the need to placate religious moderates may supersede reform efforts in saudi arabia in an environment of increasing homegrown islamic militancy modeled on the activities of qaeda particularly in saudi arabia many governments in arab nd muslimmajority countries are under pressure to detain suspects without due process at the sa time they are routinely criticized by international human rights groups for th eir aggressive interrogation techniques detentions and mistrea tment of prisoners in dealing with the latest manifestation of islamic militancy saudi government officials have focused less on reformori ented policies and mo re on coopting saudi religious officials in order to undermine the culture of jihad which some analysts believehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21913crs5 13 in rare public dialogue saudi women talk rights christian science monitor june 14 2004 14 although the saudi government has record budget surplus in 2004 due to the high price of oil rapid population growth has caused drop in per capita gdp over the last decade has long simmered in parts of saudi arabia over the past year saudi officials have asked clerics to preach against terrorism in their weekly sermons more religious figures have spoken out against isla mist militancy on saudi state tele vision the government also has offered amnesty to some members of militant groups so fear that by pursuing reformminded policies saudi officials w ould alienate religious leaders whose cooperation is needed in the fight against terrorism womens rights in saudi arabia the combination of arab tribal tradition and the integration of wahhabi or unitarian tenets in the saudi political system has limited womens rights outside of the home many western observers believe that saudi arabias strict social regulations oppress women women are prohibited from driving and must be veiled when in public although women ar permitted to work in certain professions such as health care and teaching there continues to be high female unemployment despite large pool of welleducated female college gr aduates physical abuse also is prevalent one saudi female tele vision announcer was recently beaten by her husband and allowed television station to broadcast her injuries to the saudi public in order to raise awareness of the issue saudi women also face strict dress codes enforced by the religious police mutaween which require women to be covered in public crown prince abdullah has permitted some small steps toward greater awareness for womens issues in june 2004 the govern ment sponsored conference on womens issues and the council of ministers recently stat ed that more jobs should be set aside for saudi women13 in september 2003 300 prominent sa udi citizens including 51 women submitted petition to crown prince bdullah calling for further reforms findings of the 911 commission in its findings on the connection between the septembe r 11 2001 terrorist attacks and the phenomenon of growing islamic extremism in saudi arabia the 911 commission report states that the united states and saudi arabia must determine if they can build relationship that political leaders on both sides are prepared to publicly defend relationship about mo re than oil it should include shared commitment to political and economic reform as saudis ma ke common cause with the outside world this recommendation is based largely on the notion that after the 911 attacks in which 15 of the 19 airline hijackers were saudi citizens saudi arabias domestic political environment is of great concern to us na tional security traditionally the united states has tread lightly on the issue the ussaudi relationship has long been based on tacit understanding that the united states would refrain from interfering in saudi domestic affairs in return for saudi c ooperation on energy and security issues in the persian gulf the commissions report recognizes that saudi arabia itself faces unrest and terrorist activity by islamic radicals nd that saudi arabia must ddress the extensive influence of its religious establishment and stagna nt socioeconomic conditions which some believe are fostering religious extremism14 the 911 commission report insists that the ussaudi relationship must evolve from its current state and that leaders on both sideshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21913crs6 must agree on common framework for addr essing reform in saudi arabia without unintentionally causing an extremist b acklash against either government us policy to support reform in saudi arabia since the september 11 2001 rrorist attacks the bush administration has pushed for us programs and policies to support democracy and reform in the middle east however many observers feel that both us and saudi officials remain reluctant to push the sensitive issue of saudi reform to the forefront of the ussaudi bilateral relationship instead us and saudi author ities have cooperated on hard security issues such as tracking qaeda terrorists and local saudi extremists and bolstering saudi arabias anti money laundering capabilities from the us standpoint officials ve given top priority to securityrelated cooperati on which itself has been difficult to secure from saudi officials in addition there are few independent reform gr oups inside saudi arabia that are both tolerated by the saudi government and willing to work with us groups from the saudi perspective there is deepseated fear that extremists will use ussaudi cooperation on reform as rallying cry to recr uit more saudi nationa ls to jihadist groups bent on overthrowing the saudi royal family us diplomatic efforts to promote refo rm in saudi arabia have largely been conducted by the us embassy in saudi arab ia and the state depa rtments middle east partnership initiative mepi office in washington during 2003 the us embassy encouraged visits to saudi arabia by human rights representatives and helped arrange visit by the assistant secretary of state for democracy human rights and labor in july also during 2003 the embassy arranged orientation trips to the united states and workshops for saudi journalists scholars offi cials and members of the private sector in some cases under the auspices of the inte rnational visitors program and the mepi program some officials have noted that security concerns insi saudi arabia have hampered us embassy personnel from c onducting more extensive reformrelated activities legislative response to the 911 commission

with saudi arabia hr 10 passed by the house the 911 recommendations implementation act cont ains reporting provision under which the president is required to submit to two specified congressional
