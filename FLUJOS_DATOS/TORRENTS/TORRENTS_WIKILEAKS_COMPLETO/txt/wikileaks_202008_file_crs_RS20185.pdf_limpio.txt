ability to gather and retain data financial services businesses have increasingly found ways to take advantage of their large reservoirs of customer information not only can they serve their customers better by tailoring services and communications to customer preferences but they can profit from sharing that information with others willing to pay for customer lists or targeted marketing compilations although some consumers are pleased with the wider access to information about available services that information sharing among financial services providers offers others have raised privacy concerns particularly with respect to secondary usage the united states has general law of financial privacy the us constitution itself has been held to provide protection against governmental access to financial information turned over to third parties united states v miller 425 us 435 1976 this means that although the fourth amendment to the united states constitution requires search warrant for law enforcement agent to obtain persons own copies of financial records it does not protect the same records when they are held by financial institutions state constitutions and laws may provide greater protection various federal statutes provide measure of privacy protection for financial records the right to financial privacy act 12 usc 34013422 sets procedures for federal government ccess to customer financial records held by financial institutions the fair credit reporting act fcra 15 usc 1681 to 1681t establishe s standards for collection and permissible purposes for dissemination of data by consumer reporting agencies it also gives consumers access to their files and the right to correct information therein the electronic funds transfer act 15 usc 1693a to 1693r describes the rights and liabilities of consumers using electronic funds transfer systems among them is the right to have the financial institution provide consumers with information as to the circumstances under which information concerning their accounts will be disclosed to third parties with the passage of the fair credit reporting act amendments of 1996 pl 104208 div tit ii subtitle d

ion requirements other customer information such as credit report or application information may be shared with other companies in the corporate family if the customers are given clear and conspicuous notice about the sharing and an opportunity to direct that the information not be shared that is an opt out under section 214 of pl 108159 117 stat 1952 the fair and accurate credit transactions act of 2003 fact act subject to certain exceptions affiliated companies may not share customer information for marketing solicitations unless the consumer is provided clear and conspicuous notification that the information may be exchanged for such purposes and an opportunity and simple method to opt out among the exceptions are solicitations based on preexisting business relationships based on

of consumer financial and health information intended to guide state legislative efforts in the area10 these privacy provisions preempt state law except to the extent that the state law provides greater protection to consumers the ftc in conjunction with the other federal financial institution regulators is to make the determination as to whether or not state law is preempted

personal information conveyed to financial service providers was the negative reaction to what became an aborted attempt by the federal banking regulators to promulgate know your customer rules 11 these rules would have imposed precisely detailed requirements on banks and other financial institutions to establish profiles of expected financial activity and monitor their customers transactions against these profiles even before the know your customer rules and enactment of glba depository institutions and their regulators have increasingly promoted industry selfregulation to instill consumer confidence and forestall comprehensive privacy regulation by state and federal governments one of the federal banking regulators the office of comptroller of the currency for example issued an advisory letter regarding information sharing 12 to some participants in the financial services industry preemptive federal legislation is preferable to having to meet differing privacy standards in every state with respect to information sharing among affiliated companies fcra as amended by the fact act preempts state law13 glba on the other hand leaves room for more protective state laws in congress the debate continues as to whether there should be further limitations on disclosures for example whether consumer consent or customer optin should be required before certain sensitive types of information may be disclosed to third parties has been an issue in each congress since glba was enacted

imposed upon companies doing business in europe under the european commission on data protection eu data directive an official act of the european parliament and council dated october 24 1995 9546ec this imposes strict privacy guidelines respecting the sharing of customer information and barring transfers even within the same corporate family outside of europe unless the transfer is to country
