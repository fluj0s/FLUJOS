already has passed several laws to address identity theft and continues to debate whether additional action is needed this report will not be updated for information on pending bills and current legislative action see crs report rl31408 introduction the growth in the number of cases of identity theft where one individual assumes the identity of another to commit fraud is alarming to many consumers including many members of congress despite widespread public perception that the internet is major contributor to the rise in identity theft surveys indicate that comparatively few individuals who know how thief acquired their personally identifiable information pii cite the internet some attribute the rise in identity theft instead to carelessness by businesses in handling pii and by credit issuers that grant credit without proper checks identity theft can be separated into lowtech crimes by thieves who acquire pii through traditional means such as lost or stolen wallets or dumpster diving and hightech crimes by thieves who compromise computer databases or use the internet survey released in january 2005 discussed below found that computer crime accounted for 116 of identity theft cases in 2004 compared with 68 from paper sources computer crimes do not necessarily involve the internet they may be caused by data security or computer security lapses such as insider theft still the internet can be used to acquire an individuals pii particularly through practice known as phishing the internet also could enable hackers to access computer databases if the databases are connected to the internet also pii may be inadvertently placed on the internet through congressional research service the library of congress crs2 human error1 the networked nature of the internet age coupled with steadily increasing computer power not only allows the linking of enormous databases to facilitate information access but also makes that information more vulnerable to misuse the ease speed and relative anonymity of online transactions may further exacerbate harm to the consumer when identity theft occurs identity theft definition prevalence and how it occurs the federal trade commission ftc defines identity theft as fraud committed or attempted using the identifying information of another person without authority2 the ftc commissioned synovate to conduct an identity theft survey in 2003 httpwwwftcgovos200309synovatereportpdf an ftc press release summarizing the survey httpwwwftcgovopa200309idthefthtm reported that 273 million americans had been victims of identity theft in the previous five years3 losses to businesses and financial institutions totaled nearly 48 billion and to consumer victims 5 billion in outofpocket expenses the survey found pp 3031 that 51 of the identity theft victims in their survey knew how their pii was stolen including 14 who said it was obtained from lost or stolen wallets checkbooks or credit cards 13 who httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22082 said it was obtained during transaction 4 who cited stolen mail and 14 who said the thief used other means for example the information was misused by someone who had access to it such as family member or workplace associate more recent detailed statistics have not been published by the ftc but february 7 2005 ftc press release states that identity theft affects approximately 10 million americans each year httpwwwftcgovopa200502ncpw05htm meanwhile the council of better business bureaus and javelin strategy research released survey in january 20054 the report

nonprofit identity theft resource center httpwwwidtheftcenterorg also offers advice and information choicepoint and other high profile incidents in 2005 three high profile incidents that became public in 2005 where the security of consumer pii was compromised reinforced existing fears about identity theft congressional hearings are underway on whether new legislation is needed to regulate companies that collect and sell pii called data brokers data warehousers or information brokers and other businesses that store pii in computer databases breaches of consumer data privacy have become disturbingly commonplace these three incidents were chosen as examples because they are of current congressional interest officials from these companies testified to congress on march 15 2005 about the incidents to the senate committee on banking housing and urban affairs choicepoint and bank of america and the house energy and commerce subcommittee on commerce trade and consumer protection choicepoint and lexisnexis their testimony is available on the committees websites httpbankingsenategov and httpenergycommercehousegov httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22082 in february 2005 data broker choicepoint revealed it had sold data on at least 145000 americans to criminals posing as officials in legitimate businesses5 contrary to initial press reports choicepoints computers were not hacked instead the criminals opened about 50 accounts with the company and accessed the data as customers the disclosure came as choicepoint complied with california law that requires companies with corporate computer networks that do business with state residents to notify individuals if their unencrypted personal information is acquired by an unauthorized person according to testimony to the house energy and commerce subcommittee by choicepoints chairman and ceo derek smith choicepoint employee became suspicious in september 2004 during the credentialing process for prospective small business customer in angeles according to mr smith the angeles police department was brought in and at least one individual was arrested and convicted thereafter choicepoint discovered that those involved previously had opened accounts by presenting fraudulently obtained california business licenses and fraudulent documents after the public disclosure of this data security breach it became known that similar incident occurred at choicepoint five years earlier6 also in february 2005 bank of america publicly announced that it lost five backup computer data tapes in december 20047 the tapes contain personal information on 12 million federal employees who use federal government charge card program smartpay including some members of the senate and their staffs the tapes were being transported 5 evan perez identity theft puts pressure on data sellers wall street journal february 18 2005 b1 via factiva according to that article although choicepoint cites 145000 individuals

committee hearing bank of america official stated that there is evidence to date of unauthorized use of the data in march 2005 information broker lexisnexis division of reed elsevier disclosed that it had identified number of incidents of potential fraudulent access to information about 32000 us individuals at the house energy and commerce subcommittee hearing lexisnexis official reported that criminals compromised the ids and passwords of legitimate customers and used them to access certain databases at seisint company that recently had been acquired by lexisnexis at this time it appears that the internet played role in the bank of america case choicepoint used the internet as communications medium to provide data to the criminals but it apparently otherwise was not factor the extent to which the internet may have been involved in the lexisnexis incident is unclear phishing as noted earlier the internet can play role in identity theft today attention is httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22082 focused on relatively new scam called phishing phishing refers to practice where someone misrepresents their identity or authority in order to induce another person to provide pii over the internet some common phishing scams involve emails that purport to be from financial institution internet service provider or other trusted company claiming that persons record has been lost the email directs the person to website that mimics the legitimate business website and asks the person to enter credit card number and other pii so the record can be restored in fact the email or website is controlled by third party who is attempting to extract information that will be used in identity theft or other crimes the ftc issued consumer alert on phishing in june 20048 an antiphishing working group industry association has been established to work collectively on solutions to phishing the group encourages consumers to report phishing incidents via its website httpwwwantiphishingorg and provides phishing statistics in january 2005 it reported there were 2560 active phishing websites and the average monthly growth rate between july 2004 and january 2005 was 28 httpantiphishingorgapwg_phishing_activity_reportjanuary2005pdf existing laws the ftc enforces three federal laws that restrict disclosure of consumer information and require companies to ensure the security and integrity of the data in certain contexts section 5 of the federal trade commission act the fair credit reporting act fcra and title v of the grammleachbliley act ftc chairwoman deborah platt majoras summarized these laws as they pertain to identity theft at march 10 2005 senate banking committee hearing httpbankingsenategov_filesmajoraspdf she identified two other laws that are not enforced by the ftc but which also restrict the disclosure of certain types of information the drivers privacy protection act and the health insurance portability and accountability act congress also has passed laws specifically regarding identity theft the 1998 identity theft and assumption deterrence 8 ftc how not to get hooked by phishing scam june 2004 httpwwwftcgov bcpconlinepubsalertsphishingalrtpdf crs6 act the 2003 fair and accurate credit transactions fact act and the 2004 identity theft penalty enhancement act those laws are summarized in crs report rl31919 the fact act which amended fcra contains perhaps the most comprehensive provisions in federal law directed at identity theft in addition to allowing consumers to obtain free copies of their credit reports discussed earlier the act further regulates consumer reporting agencies cras enhances penalties for identity theft and provides assistance for victims9 among other things the fact act requires cras to follow certain procedures concerning when to place and what to do in response to fraud alerts on consumers credit files requires credit card issuers to follow certain procedures if additional cards are requested within 30 days of change of address notification requires the truncation of credit card numbers on electronically printed receipts and extends the statute of limitations for when identity theft cases can be brought as noted some states such as california have their own identity theft laws see crs report rl31919 and others are considering such legislation continuing congressional issues httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22082 at march 10 2005 senate banking committee hearing ftc chairwoman majoras emphasized that complicated maze of laws governs consumer data based on the type of company or institution involved the type of data collected or sold and the purpose for which it will be used she conceded that it is not clear if data brokers like choicepoint come under the ftcs jurisdiction and concluded that additional legislation may be necessary particularly regarding notice and security witness from the secret service also testified about his agencys jurisdiction over identity theft crimes10 many bills have been introduced in the 109th congress see crs report rl31408 legislative approaches include strengthening penalties for identity theft or for the misuse of ssns11 increasing regulation of information brokers such as by requiring them to notify individuals whose pii has been breached or to obtain consumers consent before selling pii limiting the use of ssns or allowing individuals to choose an identifier other than their ssn for medicare purposes for example or making phishing crime the only legislative action to date in the 109th congress is markup of bill hr 29 that contains an antiphishing provision the bill was ordered reported from the house energy and commerce committee on march 9 2005 as discussed already the senate banking committee held hearings on identity theft on march 10 and march 15 2005 house energy and commerce subcommittee held hearing on march 15 2005 additional hearings are expected 9 implementation of the act is discussed
