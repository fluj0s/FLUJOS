national ocean service which issues the grants stated its goal was to build national integrated ocean and coastal observing system th president had not requested funding for the grants for fy2004 the house appropriations committee di rected noaa to evaluate operations of its 12 environmental research labs erls to determine the impact on agency services if these were consolidated to six six of the erls are situated in close proximity in boulder co the committee stated that its assumption was that ultimately the six erls would be administered under the noaa line offices for which they provide

circulated for expert review the final report had not been submitted by may 2004 in addition the committee directed noaa to transfer 43 million of tsunami mitigation research funding to the nati onal

contribution for salaries and expenses of the commissioners and us obligations for international fisheries agreements the committee so proposed new account for fy2004 the fisheries litigation and settlement fund and 50 million to establish it the committee adopted novel approach to reporting noaas fy2004 budget called truth in budgeting in srept 108144 the committee stated that it attempted to tease out salaries and expenses from socalled base funding requested for each of the agencys fi ve line offices noaa base funding had become catchall term for programs administrative expenses and agency functions that have specific line item funding the committee noted that because budget reporting across the agency was not uniform that task was difficult as such the committees funding tables generally pr ovided more details on line items and subactivities in the noaa budget than t hose found the presidents fy2004 request the committee stated that it was concerned th at disparate elements of the budget had been lumped together under base funding2 further the committee admonished noaa financial directors about future budget submissions and directed the agency to follow the organization nd level of detail found in the committees funding tables without exceptions the co mmittee expected the agency to report to congress about any deviations from thos appropriations tables the committee criticized the noaa fisheries budget submission c iting instances where fixed and variable costs were not differentiated3 the committee raised questions about funding for the endangered species act other regulatory programs administrative cost s mandatory obligations and personnel expenses that were virtually indistin guishable from genera l programmatic funding in noaa fisheries base funding in par ticular the committee noted the line office failed to identify its information technol ogy it funding obligations such as computer acquisitions accordingly the committee recommended that noaa create separate budget line under systems acquisitions for it in the noaa fisheries pac account in addition the committee report s imilar to the house appropriations committee report addressed

to support6 the committee noted it had found cases where oar was conducting independent research that was not relevant to noaa line office operations7 it also identified activities that it said duplicated programs at other federal agencies including the us air force and nasa see solar observations below the committee stated that while it s upported development of noaa weather radioall hazard national warning network it could not recommend funding until it had received and reviewed comprehensiv federal interagency plan for national emergency broadcasts8 the president had requested 55 million for development of national hazards emergency communi cations network that incorporated noaa weather radio for homeland security purposes the committee recommended 53 million to co mmence construction of third noaa fisheries research vessel frv3 of the five authorized by congress in fy2001 which was what the president had requested the committee report discussed the use of phased array radar par by the nws to enhance its ability to detect severe weather such as tornadoes par which is currently used by the us military would be reengineered for civilian applications the committee reco mmended 15 million to commence par conversion the president did not reque st funding for this purpose for fy2004 the senate incorporated the cjs ppropriations into the consolidated appropriations bill

in congress became concerned about appare ntly large shifts in noaa line item appropriations these differences occu rred in some cases when conferees recommendations were compared to amounts requested by the president for fy2004 and in others when compared with fy2003 appropriations in pa rticular there was difference for the national ocean rvice of 122 million between the fy2004 appropriation and the request congressional ppropriations for the orf account was 5139 million for for fy2004 nd the presidents request was 3910 million see table 1 other larg differences were in noaa satellite services account smaller differences are found in the noaa research vessel fleet funding and noaa facilities funding national ocean service funding differences are apparent between the presidents request for for fy2004 appropriations for fy2004 and ppropriations for fy2003 for specific budget subactivities and programs the most notable differences include new accounting method used by the sena appropriations committee for noaas fy2004 budget conservation activities coastal and cean observation services funding for coral reef activities nd personnel salaries and expenses truth in budgeting for fy2004 the senate appropriations committee adopted new method of accounting for the noaa budget inspired by the orf budget presentation application of this new method resulted in large increase 122 million between what the pres ident had requested for and what was finally appropriated the senate committees report srept 108144 lauded for introducing new approach to accounting in its plan for fy2004 which was included in the fy2004 noaa budget submission to congress the senate committee stated that separated funding reque sted for salaries and ot her fixed employee expenses from its base funding which also include d programmatic activitie s the report noted that for the rest of noaas line offices fixe d and variable obliga tions were virtually indistinguishable the senate committee called for truth in budgeting across all noaa line offices and suggested that if could report obligations of 151 million of its base funding as employee salari and expenses the rest of the agency could similarly differentiate obligations the senate committee also recommended full funding for fixed expenses for fy2004 plus mandatory increases however some committee members soon recognized that with the amounts requested by the president funding was insufficient for noaa programs wrapped up in base fundi ng that did not have individual budget lines noaas constituents who pend on noaa programmatic funding and services criticized what they referred to as the agencys policy to pay at its discretion increases for fixed expenditures at the expense of discretionary funds for noaa

projects in their districts which were funded in fy2003 would be completed the house appropriations committee recommended lump sum payment for remaining those remaining obligatio ns estimated at 73 million the house committee did not designate these appropriations as conservation spending as defined in the original act10 but included then under sepa rate budget subactivity for celcp in the fy2004 pac account however the senate appropriations committee recommended significantly more funding for celcp projects includi ng even more new projects amounting to 60 million final appropriations for celc p projects took the high ground between house and senate appropriations committee recommendations providing 514 million for celcp projects this amount was 86 million or 143 less than the senate committees recomme ndations and 441 million or about 862 more than the housepassed level in hr 2799 most funding increases for celcp projects approved by congress for fy2004 were recommended by
