weborder code rs20542 updated january 29 2001 major child support proposals considered in the 106th congress carmen solomonfears specialist in social legislation domestic social policy division summary during the period fy1978fy1999 child support payments collected by the child support enforcement cse agencies increased from 1 billion to 158 billion even so the program still collects only 17 of child support obligations for which it has responsibility and collects payments for only 37 of its caseload the clinton administrat ions fy2001 budget included several new initiatives intended to collect more child support from noncustodial parents that can afford to pay streamline program distribution rules so that more child support goes to custodial parents and establishes fatherhood grant program to help noncustodial parents to get the support and skills they need to find and retain employment and to become more involved in the lives of their children hr 4678 the child support distribution act of 2000 included many of these provisions hr 4678 as amended was passed by the house but not by the senate although the fatherhood grant program was not passed the consolidated appropriations act for fy2001 pl 106554 provides 500000 for each of two specified fatherhood organizations and pl 106553 provides another 3 million for one of the aforementioned fatherhood organizations this report describes some of the child support provisions that were left pending by the 106th congress it will not be updated background the child support enforcement cse program part d of title iv of the social security act was enacted in january 1975 pl 93647 the cse program is administered by the office of child support enforcement ocse in the department of health and human services hhs and funded by genera l revenues all 50 states the district of columbia guam puerto rico and the virgin islands operate cse programs and are entitled to federal matching funds the cse program provides six services on behalf of both welfare and nonwelfare children 1 parent location 2 paternity establishment 3 establishment of child support orders 4 review and modification of support orders 5 collection of supporthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20542crs2 payments and 6 distribution of support payments moreover since 1984 cse agencies have been required to petition for medical support as part of most child support orders during the period fy1978fy1999 child support payments collect ed by the cse agencies increased from 1 billion to 158 billion moreover the program has made significant improvement s in other program components as well such as the number of parents located paternities established and child support orders established advocates of the cse program say that this dramatic program performance is aside from the indirect and intangible benefits of the program such as increased personal responsibility and welfar costavoidance critics of the cse program contend that even with an unprecedented array of big brother enforcement tools such as licence professional drivers recreational and passport revocation seizure of banking accounts retirement funds and lotter winnings and automatic income withholding from pay checks the program still collects only one 17 of child support obligations for which it has responsibility and collects payments for only 37 of its caseload some reasons for the low rate of child support collections are 1 the low rate of paternity estab lishment in fy1998 paternity was established for only 41 of the 36 million children without legally identified fathers legally identifying the father is prerequisite for obtaining child support order and 2 many fathers cannot afford to pay some members argue that significant percentage of noncu stodial parents are dead broke rather than deadbeats and have urged the adoption of fatherhood initiatives to help noncustodial fathers obtain employment and the necessary information and encouragement to become responsible parents child support proposals considered not enacted in the 106th congress the clinton administrations fy2001 budget included several new initiatives intended to collect more child support from noncustodial parents that can afford to pay streamline program distribution rules so that more child support goes to custodial parents and help noncustodial parents who are unable to pay child support get the support and skills they need to find work and retain employment it also included other cse programmatic changes hr 4678 the child support distribution act of 2000 which was approved by the house ways and means committee on july 19 2000 and reported on july 26 2000 hrept 106793 part 1 contains some of the provisions that were in the clinton administrations fy2001 budget proposal on september 7 2000 the house passed hr 4678 which requires states to distribute more child support to exwelfare families with federal fundi ng and permits states to give child support collections to tanf families without having to repay the federal government its share of the money in addition hr 4678 simplifies child support assignment and distribution rules establishes fatherhood grant program and makes other changes optional passthrough and disregard of child support payments under old law the first 50 of current monthly child support payments collected on behalf of family receiving aid to families with dependent children afdc was given to the family and disregarded as income to the family so that it did not affect the familys afdc eligibility or benefit status the 1996 welfare reform law pl 104193 eliminated the 50 passthrough payment under current law when child support is collected for families receiving temporary assistance for needy families tanf assistance the money ishttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20542crs3 divided between the state and federal governments based on the states medicaid matching rate the federal government keeps its share pl 104193 gave states the choice to decide how much if any of the state share some all none of child support payments collected on behalf of tanf families to send to the family states also decide whether to treat child support payments as income to the family about half of the states have chosen to keep their entire share the other half pass through portion of the collection to the family usually 50 per month and disre gard that amount in calculating the familys monthly tanf benefit as noted above under current law the states bear the entire cost of passing through and disregarding child support to families on tanf the clinton administration and several members of congress maintain that if child support is passed through to families while they are on welfare the family may be able to leave welfare sooner because they can more accurately assess how much child support they would have to supplement their earnings hr 4678 as amended and reported on july 27 2000 by the house rules committee hrept 106798 includes provisions that would 1 allow states to pay child support arrearage payments collected on behalf of families who are longer on welfare to the families without paying the federal government its share of the money and 2 allow states to pay child support collections to tanf families without being required to pay the federal government its share of the money provided the state does not count the child support income in determining the familys tanf benefit for mothers on welfare the federal government would share in the cost of amounts passed through and disregarded to the family up to 400 per month for families with less than two children and up to 600 per month for families with two or more children the rules committee amendment also would permit states to discontinue child support assignments that were in effect on september 30 1997 that were assigned to the state as condition of tanf receipt preliminary cost estimates by the congressional budget office cbo indicated that these provisions would cost 541 million over 5 years simplify child support assignment and distribution rules to qualify for tanf benefits tanf applicants and recipients must assign their child support rights to the state for periods before and during the familys tanf receipt pl 104193 required states to pay higher fraction of child support collections on arrearages to families that have left welfare by making these payments to families first before the state and the federal government are reimbursed for tanf assistance to the family however in cases where the child support arrearage is collected via the federal income tax refund offset program the states and federal government keep the support collection in addition the state keeps and divides with the federal government child support arrearages that accrued before the family went on tanf if they are collected while the family is receiving tanf benefits further the states retains and shares with the federal government arrearages that accrue for child support obligations that were assigned to the state before october 1997 these factors have resulted in making an already complicated set of rules for determining who actually gets the child support arrearage payments more complex although much of the complexity of the distribution rules will end when the rules are completely implemented on october 1 2000 many policymakers contend that congress needs to simplify the distribution system which currently requires the tracking of six categories of arrearage payments in order to properly pay custodial parents hr 4678 would limit the child support assignment to the period in which the family receives tanf benefits in addition hr 4678 includes provision that would allowhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20542crs4 states to adopt simpler rules for distributing child support collections under the proposed rule collections received on behalf of families receiving tanf benefits would be retained by the federal and state governments as reimbursement for tanf assistance as under current law and child support collected on behalf of families who are longer on tanf would be paid to the families first the policy would have an effective date of october 1 2001 preliminary cbo estimates indicated that increased collections to families would amount to 905 million over 5 years cbo estimates that the net federal cost of the provision would be about 1 billion over the 5year period from fy2002fy2006 review and adjustment of child support orders pl 104193 requires states to have procedures under which they must review child support order and adjust it if appropriate every 3 years or more often at state option if either parent or the state requests review in welfare cases or if either parent requests review in nonwelfare cases in other words the review is mandatory once every 3 years only if one of the specified parties requests the review hr 4678 would require states to review and adjust child support orders for tanf families once every 3 years in addition states would be required to review the child support orders of families leaving tanf cbo indicates that such mandatory review would increase collections to families and also increase the number of children with private health insurance thereby reducing the reliance of welfare families on public assistance programs cbo estimates that the net federal savings from reviewing support orders of persons on tanf would amount to 58 million over 5 years fy2002fy2006 and that the net federal cost of reviewing support orders of families that leave tanf would amount to 50 million over 5 years reduction of threshold for passport denial pl 104193 also authorized the secretary of state to deny revoke or restrict passports of debtor parents whose child support arrearages exceed 5000 according to hhs the passport denial program has collected more than 225 million in lump sum child support payments and is currently denying 30 to 40 passports daily to delinquent noncustodial parents hr 4678 includes proposal that would authorize the denial revocation or restriction of passports to noncustodial parents whose child support arrearag exceed 2500 rather than 5000 as under current law cbo estimates that this proposal would increase child support collections to families by about 13 million annually and would save the federal government 9 million over 5 years fy2002fy2006 reduce federal matching rate for paternity establishment the federal gover nment currently reimburses each state 66 of the cost of administering its cse program it also refunds states 90 of the laboratory costs of establishing paternity the federal governments funding is openended in that it pays its percentage of expenditures by match ing the amounts spent by state and local governments with upper limit or ceiling the fy2001 budget included proposal that would eliminate the enhanced match for paterni ty establishment under the proposal the federal matching rate for paternity testing would be reduced to 66 the lower overall child support administrative matching rate the clinton administration estimates that the savings from this proposal would amount to 41 million over the 5year period from fy2001fy2005httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20542crs5 demonstrations invol ving establishment and enforcement of child support obligations by public nonivd agencies the cse program is authorized by title ivd of the social security act federal law requires every state that operates tanf program to operate cse program states must operate their cse programs in accordance with federal guidelines federal funding is available for the cse program at 66 matching rate other public agencies in the state such as county government or clerk of the court may perform some child support enforcement functions without receiving federal funding or havin g to adhere to the federal child support enforcement rules generally these other public agencies do not have full access to the same enforcement tools or information databases that are available to the cse agency hr 4678 would authorize the hhs secretary to approve up to 10 states to participate in demonstration program the demonstrations would determine the extent to which public child support enforcement entities other than the cse agency can contribute effectively to the establishment and enforcement of child support obligations on behalf of custodial parents who have not been helped by the regular cse program and seek aid from an alternative entity cbo estimates that the net federal cost of the demonstrations would be 25 million over the 5year period from fy2002fy2006 use of information in the new hires database the 1996 welfare reform law pl 104193 required all employers in the nation to report basic information on every newlyhired employee to the state states were in turn required to collect all this information in the state directory of new hires to use this informa tion to locate noncustodial parents who owe child support and to send wage withholding order to their employer and to report within 3 business days all information in their directory of new hires to the federal government information in the state directory of new hires is used by state employment security agencies the agency that operates the state unemployment compensation program to match against unemployment compensa tion records to determine whether people drawing unemployment compen sation benefits are actually working however many states have residents who are drawing unemployment benefits from previous job in their state but then obtain work in an adjoining state because states have access to the new hire data only in their own state and not to the national directory of new hires states are not able to detect these cases hr 4678 would authorize state employment security agencies to gain access to information in the national directory of new hires cbo estimates that the net federal savings resulting from this provision would amount to 76 million from fy2002fy2006 use of tax refund offset program to collect pastdue support on behalf of children who are longer minors under the federal income tax refund offset program the internal revenue service operating on request from state filed through the secretary of hhs intercepts tax returns and deducts the amount of certified child support arrearages the money is then sent to the state for distribution this program is available to tanf recipient s in cases in which the noncustodial parent owes at least 150 in pastdue child support and nonwelfare recipients in cases in which the noncustodial parent owes at least 500 in arrearage payments with respect to tanf cases the federal income tax refund offset program can be used to collect arrearages on behalf of children who are longer minors hr 4678 would allow the federal income tax refund offset program to be used to collect arrearages on behalf of nonwelfare children who are longer minorshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20542crs6 fathers workfamilie s win pl 106113 the consolidated appropriations act for fy2000 amended the welfaretowork program which is intended to help hardto serve welfare recipients with the transition to work but did not provide for additional funding for fy2000 the new amendments

provided over 350 million in funding on respo nsible fatherhood initiatives see crs report rs20207 welfare reform competitive grants in the welfaretowork grant program the proposed fathers work grant program which would be administered by the department of labor is designed to help lowincome noncustodial parents who are not living with their children carry out their financ ial and emotional responsibilities to their children the clinton administration estimates that these grants would help about 40000 lowincome noncustodial parents primarily fathers work pay child support and reconnect with their children and would cost 125 million in fy2001 the proposed families win grant program which would be administered by the department of labor is designed to help hardpressed working families obtain the suppor ts and skills they need to get job and succeed in the job and avoid tanf assistance these funds are intended to leverage existing resources to help families retain jobs and upgrade skills and get connected to critical work supports such as child care child support health care food stamps earned income tax credit housing and transportation the clinton administration estimates that these grants would serve about 40000 lowincome parents including former welfare recipients and persons with disabilities work pay child support and reconne ct with their children the clinton administration estimates that the program would cost 130 million in fy2001 of this amount 10 million would be for grants to native american workforce agencies neither the house or senate fy2001
