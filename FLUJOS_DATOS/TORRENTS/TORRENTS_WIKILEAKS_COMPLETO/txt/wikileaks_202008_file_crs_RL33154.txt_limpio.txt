alabama louisiana and mississippi november 15 2005 steven maguire analyst in public finance government and finance division congressional research service the library of congress the impact of hurricane katrina on the state budgets of alabama louisiana and mississippi summary after major disasters affected state and local governments face the dual challenge of responding to the crisis and absorbing the economic losses associated with the disaster typically tax revenue collections both state and local decline immediately following disaster the severity and range of the destruction determine when and to what level tax revenue will rebound for states the revenue loss is inopportune given both the cost of repairing government infrastructure and providing assistance to affected local governments and individuals most states have emergency funds to tap into when disaster strikes for catastrophic disasters on the scale of hurricane katrina however the emergency fund may be insufficient in cases where the scale of the disaster overwhelms the fiscal capacity of state governments the states may borrow to finance emergency spending each of the states most severely affected by hurricane katrina alabama louisiana and mississippi could be forced to address budget shortfalls with increased borrowing this report outlines the budget issues facing each of these states the last section of the report provides rough approximation of the potential state tax revenue loss in the month september 2005 following hurricane katrina crs estimates that if the disaster region lost about half of its economic activity in september 2005 then the state of alabama would have lost 380 million in revenue louisiana 1796 million and mississippi 1080 million this report will be updated as

5 estimated tax revenue loss in september 2005 following hurricane katrina 13 the impact of hurricane katrina on the state budgets of alabama louisiana and mississippi introduction and overview the gulf coast region has endured significant disruptions in economic activity in the aftermath of hurricane katrina state and local governments in the affected region along with their citizens will face considerable financial obstacles during the recovery period in the short run the expected drop in economic activity likely will be accompanied not only by an increase in public spending on wages of public employees working overtime but also the accompanying costs of providing benefits to the unemployed and sick in addition repairing public infrastructure will strain state budgets the combination of lower revenues and increased spending will likely create substantial short term budget problems for state and local jurisdictions the anticipated budget problems will be exacerbated by state and local balanced budget rules which prohibit these entities from funding current expenditures with debt historically the federal government has provided assistance to state and local governments following national crises arising from economic downturns natural disasters and large scale terrorist attacks most recently congress provided states with 20 billion in fiscal assistance in 2003 and 20041 and throughout the 1970s and 1980s congress provided state and local governments with direct aid through general revenue sharing program congress is currently studying the amount and format of alternative federal response proposals to the katrina disaster2 each county or parish in the federally declared disaster area contributes tax revenue to its state government tax revenue may disappear completely in some jurisdictions in others tax payments may be delayed or significantly reduced because the swath of destruction wrought by hurricane katrina is so broad and in the case of new orleans louisiana has continued for such an extended period tax revenue loss to the state may be particularly dramatic displaced economic activity that remains in each state however reduces the potential revenue loss arising from dislocated state sales taxes the economic activity would still generate revenue for the state although it would shift from one part of the state to another the loss in personal income taxes may be significant as many workers in the coastal region may not have jobs to return to and will elect to 1 see pl 10827 the jobs and growth tax relief reconciliation act of 2003

areas by the federal emergency management agency fema and residents were declared eligible for individual and public assistance in 31 parishes counties these 31 hardesthit parishes constitute significant portion of state economic activity and thus tax revenue table 2 presents the amount of personal income and retail sales that can be attributed to the 31 parishes declared disaster areas by fema and whose residents are eligible for individual and public assistance almost threequarters of state personal income and retail sales 728 and 722 respectively are generated in the declared

katrina one news report has the cost of environmental cleanup alone tagged at 615 billion which includes 35 billion to restore wastewater treatment facilities and 25 billion to clean up hazardous waste4 before katrina the louisiana budget was in deficit with fy2004 operating shortfall of 11 million5 clearly the drop in revenues and anticipated cost of rebuilding public infrastructure will create serious strain on the louisiana state budget the budget process balanced budget rules expenditure limitations and state budget stabilization funds will all be critical elements in the states response to the katrina disaster following is brief review of these elements in louisiana budget process louisiana employs an annual budget cycle that begins on july 1 in september the governor sends budget guidelines to each agency agencies then submit requests to the governor in november the governor submits the budget to the legislature in february or march and the legislature adopts the budget in june the timing of hurricane katrina will very likely alter that budget schedule when the legislature is not in session the louisiana interim emergency board ieb may appropriate up to 01 of total state revenue from the previous fiscal year according to the louisiana executive budget for fy2006 total general fund revenue in fy2005 was 68 billion6 the cost to the state of the response and recovery effort will substantially exceed the ieb appropriation amount consequently the state legislature will likely hold special session to address the spending needs related to postkatrina recovery state balanced budget rules and debt limits all states except vermont are required to balance the budget for each budget cycle either by state constitution or by statute in louisiana the rule is both statutory and constitutional states like louisiana have two options to finance spending beyond current revenues 4 dolores w gregory susanne pagano maybelle cagle and sherry jones katrinas impact on gulf state revenues still being assessed as irs states offer relief to taxpayers affected by hurricane daily tax report 182 sept 21 2005 p j1 5 state of louisiana annual report fy2004 6 state of louisiana executive budget for fy2006 crs5 additional debt or higher taxes the latter option higher taxes would seem the less viable following major disaster after which economic activity has declined and the state tax base narrowed borrowing to finance response and recovery spending seems the more likely option for louisiana without legislative action however additional borrowing to finance an operating budget shortfall could violate state balanced budget rules in addition like many states louisiana imposes debt limit that could be constraining given the magnitude of the katrina disaster in louisiana for example the constitution requires that the debt service cost general obligation debt be more than 6 of total revenue taxes licenses and fees of the same fiscal year7 total revenue by this definition in louisiana for fy2004 was just over 8 billion and the debt service cost was 152 million or just 1888 the latest available louisiana treasurer report projected that in addition to the state being able to issue 425000000 in the 20042005 fiscal year the state can issue 425000000 each year thereafter and remain within the state debt limit based on the projection model9 the restrictions would likely prevent louisiana from financing reconstruction on statebacked debt alone the federal government would be likely more to augment rather than replace state finance of recovery and reconstruction what is unclear however is what portion of reconstruction should and could be the responsibility of the federal government budget stabilization or rainy day fund states typically maintain fund to access during unanticipated budget shocks such as natural disasters in louisiana at the close of fiscal 2004 the budget stabilization fund had 2393 million10 according to the national association of state budget officers nasbo in louisiana up to onethird of the fund can be used with legislative approval11 the fund will likely provide temporary liquidity for the state to meet some immediate spending needs though the balance is likely insufficient to address the potential long term cost of postkatrina repair and recovery 7 national association of state budget officers budget

indicates that louisiana may not be able to withstand economic shocks as well has higher rated issuers news story reported that the debt for many projects in the gulf coast area are under credit

rule16 in mississippi the balanced budget rule is statutory rather than constitutional in contrast the debt limits in mississippi are constitutional thus exceeding the debt limits in mississippi would entail amending the state constitution the debt limits in mississippi are applied to general obligation go debt and shortterm debt for go debt the limit is 15 times total revenue this type of limit based on the relationship between the outstanding debt and total revenue is unlike the louisiana method which is based on debt servicing costs not the amount outstanding when interest rates are relatively low the volume based limit is more constraining than the louisiana method shortterm debt in mississippi is limited to 5 of general fund appropriations according to the mississippi department of finance and administration total go debt outstanding in fy2004 was 2997341000 and the state had established constitutional debt limit of 842905500017 thus it appears there is some flexibility for mississippi to borrow without amending the state constitution nevertheless using debt to finance current operating expenditures may require statutory changes 14 nasbo fiscal survey of

statute and the funds can be used to 1 meet cash flow needs borrowed funds must be repaid within the same fiscal year 2 cover deficits up to 50 million in any one fiscal year and 3 provide funds for disaster assistance 18 in the present circumstance the stabilization fund is likely insufficient to fully finance the repair and recovery spending needs in the most severely affected part of mississippi state fiscal response some observers believe the utilization of existing bond capacity will be the likely response to katrina recovery financing in mississippi the states bond rating in fy2004 was relatively strong aa implying that the interest rate on state debt should be somewhat reasonable19 bond investors however may be less willing to lend to mississippi if the economic infrastructure is judged permanently impaired the increased risk associated with mississippi debt may in turn increase debt servicing costs on the other hand the increased economic activity associated with rebuilding and recovery could compensate at least in part for the likely increase in debt servicing costs alabama of the three hardest hit states alabama escaped with the least adverse economic impact nevertheless hurricane katrina inflicted significant damage in the gulf region of alabama approximately onesixth of personal income and retail sales in alabama is generated in the hardest hit

counties listed are designated by fema as eligible for individual and public assistance budget issues the alabama budget situation before hurricane katrina was improving with reported fy2004 ending balance of 141 million20 according to recent bond rating update prepared by moodys investor services the state of alabama financial status has improved noting that in alabama financial recovery is underway with revenues exceeding estimates and declining reliance on nonrecurring revenue measures21 budget process alabamas annual budget cycle employs fiscal year that begins in october for fy2007 beginning october 1 2006 agency budget requests were due on november 1 2005 and the governor would be required to present the budgets to the legislature on february 4 2006 under normal circumstances this schedule may be altered in light of the katrina disaster state balanced budget rules and debt limits alabama like 48 other states has balanced budget rule the alabama constitution requires that the 20 bob riley state of alabama executive budget 20052006 p iii 21 moodys investor services moodys upgrades alabama general obligation debt to aa2 from aa3 aug 26 2005 hereafter cited as moodys crs11 governor submit balanced budget the balanced budget rule is reinforced by statutory requirement that the legislature pass balanced budget the alabama constitution does not impose general obligation debt limit though shortterm debt is limited by the constitution to 30000022 general obligation bond issues however must pass public referendum simple majority and the legislature must approve the debt by threefifths majority the public and legislative approval requirements may constrain borrowing in alabama according to the moodys report net taxsupported debt amounts to 20 of personal income compared with national median of 24 and 523 per capita compared with national median of 70323 alabama thus has relatively less debt than other states budget stabilization or rainy day fund alabama maintains budget stabilization fund that had balance of 104 million in fy2004 and was estimated to rise to 140 million for fy200524 the stabilization fund in alabama has two parts the state general fund and the education fund the stabilization fund is structured to preserve the integrity of the education fund the largest operating fund state fiscal response in connection with the recent hurricanes alabama does not appear to face serious financial crisis particularly in comparison with louisiana and mississippi the ability of alabama to issue debt seems reasonably strong though the state balanced budget rules would likely require revisiting if debt were used to cover operating expenditures the alabama bond rating from moodys of aa2 is roughly equivalent to aa rating from standard and poors or fitch rating services note that mississippi also holds aa rating again the constraint for alabama as with the other states is how to use debt to finance current operating expenditures without violating state balanced budget rules estimated revenue loss by state if affected states must borrow critical first step is determining how much to borrow the description of state budgets and the data detailing the relative economic impact form the basis for the following estimate of the potential revenue loss arising from hurricane katrina the general assumption is that the hardest hit counties and parishes will generate significantly less tax revenue from the dislocated economic activity occurring after hurricane katrina more specifically the estimates are based on the revenue that would have been raised in september 2005 the estimate will overstate the longterm sales tax revenue loss for the following reasons 1 some portion of retail sales and accompanying sales tax will shift to another part of the 22 nasbo budget processes in the states p 36 23 moodys 2005 24 national governors association national association of state budget officers fiscal survey of states june 2005 table a1 p 18 crs12 state 2 some retail sales will be delayed not eliminated and 3 some parishes and counties on the outer ring of the affected area may actually realize an increase in retail sales as relief workers and recovery efforts stimulate economic activity and thus increase tax revenue state personal income tax collections will also decline although as with retail sales its unclear if the loss in tax revenue would be as permanent larger employers could retain employees and continue to make scheduled payroll deposits although the tax payments would likely be delayed the states have granted employers extensions through january 3 2006 to comply with individual and corporate income tax payments the state will likely receive significant rise in tax payments both personal and corporate in late 2005 and early 2006 as postponed tax payments are made before the extension expires other taxes such as the louisiana severance tax though not tied directly to personal income or retail sales will likely decline in the short run but will rise considerably as natural resource extraction activities rebound recent congressional budget office cbo publication estimated the revenue loss of the state of louisiana at 3 billion to 6 billion local governments in the affected region of louisiana generate about 31 billion in sales and property taxes in mississippi local governments in the affected region generate about 225 billion to 23 billion in sales and property taxes and in alabama local governments in the region generate approximately 510 million in sales and property tax revenue25 the cbo report did not provide estimates for state revenue losses in alabama or mississippi estimation methodology as noted above the estimates in table 5 are based on the assumption that after hurricane katrina economic activity will slow and tax revenue decline the amount of lost sales tax revenue is estimated using the amount of retail sales that occurred in the affected counties parishes relative to the rest of the state the percentage of retail sales was then multiplied by the amount of sales and use tax revenue generated in the entire state in september of 2003 2004 for alabama this approximation does not adjust for the likely increase in prices and corresponding rise retail sales amounts since 2003 the bottom three rows provide estimates of the revenue loss under three different assumptions on the percentage of lost economic activity in the most extreme scenarios all revenue for the month of september is lost though likely in some areas its unlikely that all of the counties and parishes designated as eligible for individual and public assistance would lose 100 of state tax collections nevertheless the amount does provide an upper limit to the potential revenue loss the two other scenarios 50 and 25 loss would seem more likely because smaller portion of alabama was affected it is probable that economic activity shifted 25 us congressional
