kenneth katzman and james nichol foreign affairs and national defense division summary iran sees the central asian region as an arena for reducing its own isolation hoping to make itself an attractive economic and political partner to these states iran has been cautious in supporting radical islamic opposition movements in the region several central asian states are proceeding with or contemplating energy projects that transit iran these projects present the administration and congress with the dilemma of how to keep irans financial resources constrained while at the same time fostering economic and political development in central asia provisions in s 2334 covering fy1999 foreign operations appropriations srept 105255 as well as in s 1344 the silk road strategy act of 1997 appear intended to reduce central asian incentives to cooperate with iran this report will be updated to reflect legislative developments background1 successive us administrations have identified irans support for radical islamic movements as key justification for containing and applying sanctions against iran during the 1980s iran attempted to export its islamic revolution to lebanon afghanistan sudan algeria and the persian gulf states during the 1990s iran has built ties to palestinian islamic movements opposed to the arabisraeli peace process after the soviet union broke up in 1991 us analysts and policymakers feared that iran would attempt to use its varied ethnic linguistic religious and cultural ties to central asia to cultivate proiranian radical islamic opposition movements in the region tajikistan which does not border iran but whose people are of persian origin and azerbaijan which shares with iran the predominance of shiite islam appeared to be natural targets for increased iranian political and religious influence the worst fears of some in the united states and central asia about irans regional intentions apparently have not been realized irans revolutionary purists who wanted to take advantage of the soviet collapse to push irans ideology quickly lost out to iranian pragmatists who saw central asia as an export market and potential avenue to frustrate 1 in this report azerbaijan kazakstan kyrgyzstan tajikistan turkmenistan and uzbekistan are considered as central asian states azerbaijan kazakstan russia turkmenistan and iran constitute the caspian sea littoral states congressional research service the library of congress crs2 us attempts to isolate iran irans leaders apparently also believed that political meddling in central asia which russia considers its sphere of influence could jeopardize its ties to russia russia has been major supplier to iran of conventional weapons including submarines tanks and combat aircraft as well as nuclear reactor under construction in june 1998 iran allegedly tested an intermediaterange missile of north korean design reportedly with russian assistance since 1992 iranian leaders have been stressing to their central asian neighbors the economic benefits of dealing with iran iran argues that it has the most developed transport network and wellequipped ports on the persian gulf and sea of oman and that rail lines could be easily extended some in central asia have looked at iran as market for raw materials and industrial products such as cotton fiber currently iran still is minor trade partner for the states of the region but it has established economic commissions with most of the states to expand trade irans emphasis on economic cooperation has been reinforced since the may 1997 election of relative moderate mohammad khatemi as irans president either by design or lack of opportunity iran has not developed significant political influence in the central asian countries iran provided some support to coalition of islamic and democratic movements that briefly seized power in tajikistan september december 1992 iran also has provided sanctuary to tajik islamic opposition leaders such as akbar turajonzada and reportedly has built up an intelligence network there2 at the same time iran has built ties to the government of imomali rakhmanov and helped broker ceasefire september 1994 and further peace settlement june 1997 in the internal conflict in tajikistan the united states accepted statement in the communique of the p8 summit in denver in june 1997 praising irans mediation role in tajikistan iran also has tried to mediate in the dispute between armenia and azerbaijan over the disputed nagornokarabakh territory over the last few years iran has worked to improve often contentious relations with azerbaijani president heydar aliyev and has offered only minor support to proiranian islamic party in azerbaijan among the other central asian states turkmenistan has developed the warmest ties with iran president niyazov in june 1997 termed iran the closest friend and neighbor of turkmenistan and the two countries opened major rail link in may 1996 uzbekistans relations with iran earlier cool have warmed somewhat uzbekistan openly backed may 1995 us trade and investment ban on iran in 1997 after irans apparent goodfaith mediation efforts in tajikistan uzbekistans president islam karimov said he supported expanded trade and transport ties with iran kazakstan and kyrgyzstan have consistently been less concerned than the other central asian states about irans intentions in the region and have steadily broadened economic ties with the islamic republic energy relationships as it became apparent in the mid 1990s that the expected iranian effort to gain influence in central asia was not materializing the central asian states began to see iran as viable and desirable partner to help them exploit the resources they would need 2 gertz bill intelligence agency highlights threat of antiamerican terror in tajikistan washington times december 9 1997 crs3 to develop economically according to the us energy department proven and possible oil reserves in the caspian region are 171191 billion barrels of oil and 564665 trillion cubic feet of natural gas proven reserves are much smaller but are still comparable to north sea oil reserves and north american gas reserves the landlocked central asian states were anxious to develop alternatives to russia as transit route for exporting their energy resources iran has argued that the shortest and least expensive route to export these resources runs through iran to bolster this view and to discourage us energy firms from proceeding with projects iran has maintained that exploitation of oil and gas resources in the caspian sea and related uses cannot move forward until the status of the sea is worked out azerbaijan has led objection to this position in part because its caspian sea projects are more advanced than those of other littoral states despite widespread concerns about iranian foreign policy irans political stability gives iran an advantage in competing for projects over some regional countries such as afghanistan two energy teams3 are vying for the right to build gas pipeline from turkmenistan to pakistan through afghanistan although the clinton administration endorses such efforts it admits that transafghan pipeline is unlikely as long as inter factional strife continues in that country major energy projects that involve iran and central asian states either under way or planned include those discussed below in mid1997 kazakstan conducted test swap of oil to iran under plans for iran to use the kazak oil in its northern refineries and to then export an equivalent amount of its own oil from persian gulf terminals in the south crediting kazakstan for the shipments technical and other problems however have put this project on hold on december 29 1997 the president of iran mohammad khatemi and of turkmenistan saparmurad niyazov inaugurated 125mile pipeline linking the two countries gas transport networks initially iran will use the turkmen gas in its northeast to offset the 160 million iran funded to construct the pipeline under may 1997 memorandum of understanding between turkey and turkmenistan the turkmen gas will eventually be exported through iran to turkey when an iran turkey pipeline agreed to in august 1996 and now under construction is completed one day earlier khatemi and niyazov were joined by turkeys prime minister mesut yilmaz in endorsing plan by royal dutch shell to study the feasibility of larger 940mile gas pipeline from turkmenistan to turkey through iran the energy firm envisions that pipeline as eventually transporting gas from central asia and iran to europe kazakstan is in discussions with iran for the construction of an oil pipeline from kazakstans oil fields to irans persian gulf coast iran is offering to finance construction of that pipeline for kazakstan the pipeline to iran would cost fraction of that envisioned in an alternate pipeline corridor strongly backed by the united states that would avoid iran by running from baku azerbaijans capital 3 one grouping competing for the project is led by the us firm unocal the other is led by the argentine company bridas crs4 to turkeys mediterranean port of ceyhan to link this pipeline with kazakstan tanker or undersea pipeline transport are contemplated provision of s 2334 covering fy1999 foreign aid appropriations srept105255 requests an administration report by march 1 1999 on the status of us initiatives to promote financially the bakuceyhan pipeline route azerbaijan has given iranian firms 10 stakes in two consortia out of seven currently developing azerbaijans oil and gas resources in june 1998 the main foreign oil consortium in azerbaijan azerbaijan international operating consortium aioc which includes some us firms acknowledged it had begun talks with iran on oil swap arrangements in june 1998 iran solicited bids for 400 million oil pipeline from irans caspian port of neka to irans northern refineries the plan is intended to encourage oil swaps between iran and caspian region oil producers and could eventually form part of new energy route from the caspian to irans persian gulf ports turkmenistan has transported some crude oil by road and rail through iran to persian gulf ports however asian economic turmoil has reduced this trade and turkmenistan has shifted to western exports through georgian and russian ports us policy the financial attractiveness of energy export routes through iran has run up against the commitment of the administration and congress to constrain irans financial and military capabilities an april 1997 state department report on caspian energy development4 stated that the united states strongly opposes activities which significantly contribute to irans revenues and petroleum sector increasing the funds available to support international terrorism and development of weapons of mass destruction chief congressional backer of this position has been senator sam brownback who said in november 5 1997 speech on central asia that if the floodgates open through iran the eastern caspian will certainly fall into the iranian sphere of dominance and the south caucasus will lose out on its opportunity to prosper in october 1997 sen brownback introduced bill the silk road strategy act of 1997 s 1344 that provides incentives for the central asian states to cooperate with each other and with the united states rather than with iran the bill was reported to the full senate on june 23 1998 while trying to persuade the central asian states to exclude iran from major energy projects the administration apparently has sought not to interfere with the overarching objective of energy development in central asia in may 1995 president clinton imposed us ban on trade and investment with or in iran and in any territory or marine area apparently referring to portions of the caspian over which iran claims sovereign rights or jurisdiction however the ban specifically allowed for licensing on caseby case basis us participation in temporary marketbased swaps of crude oil from the caspian sea basin in support of energy projects in turkmenistan azerbaijan and 4 this report was requested by the conference report on fy 1997 foreign aid appropriations pl 104208 crs5 kazakstan one us firm mobil corp has already applied for us license to engage in oil swaps with iran decision has been announced on that application some observers believe the overarching goal of promoting central asian development coupled with us desire to reach out to the more moderate new president of iran has made the administration hesitant to apply the iranlibya sanctions act pl 104172 ilsa to central asian energy projects that include iran 5 the ilsa law signed august 5 1996 requires us sanctions on foreign firms that make substantial investments over 20 million in one year in irans energy sector6 at july 23 1997 hearing of the house international relations committee state department officials said that the iranturkeyturkmenistan project discussed above was not sanctionable under that law because turkey had agreed to purchase gas from turkmenistan not iran as currently constituted iran will earn only transit fees from the project whether or not it purchases iranian gas turkey maintained that its pipeline with iran was not sanctionable under ilsa because iran and turkey were each constructing portions of the pipeline on their respective sides of the border many outside experts agreed with the turkish interpretation that this did not meet the definition of sanctionable investment stipulated by ilsa the international energy community was further encouraged by may 18 1998 us decision not to sanction september 1997 deal between iran and total sa france gazprom russia and petronas malaysia to develop irans south pars gas field the administration judged the deal to meet the criteria for ilsa sanctions but it waived the sanctions on national interest grounds and indicated that similar deals by eu firms would also receive waivers many experts viewed the administration waivers as an effort not only to avoid trade frictions with the eu but as part of us effort to signal positively toward iranian president mohammad khatemi some observers believe that imposing sanctions under ilsa could undermine the more moderate khatemi as he is attempting to consolidate his position in tehran in late 1997 and especially following the may 18 ilsa waivers the administration has sought to counter the widespread interpretation that it is softening its position on central asian energy routes through iran apparently recognizing the widespread interpretation of us policy the administration sought to articulate more clearly its policy on energy projects that transit iran on october 23 1997 in testimony before the subcommittee on international economic policy export and trade promotion of the senate foreign relations committee under secretary of state stuart eizenstat said let be clear we do not support any pipelines through iran carrying either iranian oil and gas to western markets or that of any other country referring to the july 23 testimony about the iranturkey pipeline eizenstat said this announcement has been widely misinterpreted to mean that the united states has approved pipeline across iran this is definitely not the caseshould we find evidence of investment activity which could enhance irans ability to develop its own petroleum resources we will take appropriate actions under ilsa 5 us firms were already banned from making such investments in iran under the may 1995 executive order discussed above and march 1995 executive order 6 us firms were already banned from making such investments in iran under march 1995 and superseding may 1995 executive order crs6 in november 1997 energy secretary federico pena visited turkey and the caspian region in an attempt to build support for transcaspian pipeline route rather than one that transits iran president clinton pressed that same agenda during visit to washington in midnovember 1997 by kazakstans president nursultan nazarbayev he reportedly told president clinton he would support that route over one that transits iran if the united states could arrange financing for the transcaspian route by october 19987 during turkmen president saparamurad niyazovs april 1998 us visit the administration similarly advocated alternatives to transiranian oil and gas shipments and proffered some study aid but niyazov reportedly reiterated his support for iran as one of multiple transshipment routes contemplated for largescale turkmen energy exports on june 3 1998 two weeks after the ilsa waivers under secretary of state eizenstat testified before the house international relations committee that the united states remains strongly opposed to oil and gas pipelines which transit iran and that as policy matter we will continue to encourage alternative routes for the transport of caspian energy resources such as transcaspian pipelines and the bakuceyhan routewe will carefully examine any proposals for transiranian pipeline construction for possible implications under ilsa and any other relevant laws and take appropriate action in view of our strong opposition to such pipelines we intend to continue to challenge them despite the strong eizenstat and other us statements many in the oil industry continue to believe that us resolve to press for routes that exclude iran is weakening they received some support for their analysis from june 18 state department press briefing by department spokesman jamie rubin in answering reporter questions rubin suggested that the united states opposed reliance on iran as an export route saying that the united states does not believe it is in any countrys best interest to have iran as the only transit corridor for caspian oil and gas the statement left open the possibility that the united states might acquiesce to the development of some routes than transit iran some us ea casp baku officials stress that the ian s kazakhstan an eizenstat and other b aij uz
