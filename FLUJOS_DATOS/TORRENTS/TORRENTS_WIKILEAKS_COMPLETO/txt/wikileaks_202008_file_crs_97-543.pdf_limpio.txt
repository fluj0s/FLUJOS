analyst had estimated that prop 187 would reduce net state outlays about 100200 million per year federal district court temporarily halted prop 187s restrictions on benefits i n decemb er 1994 and this freeze was continued under november 1995 preliminar injunction this 1995 decision lulac v wilson also overturned most of prop 187 s enforcement procedures the courtordered halt of prop 187

elementary and secondary educati on which remains available under the supreme court decision in plyler v doe 457 us 202 existing state laws tha t allowed benefits contrary to prwoa were preempted but prwoa also authorized the states to enact new laws to provide illegal aliens statefunded benefits after prwoa california officials identified more than 200 programs from whic h they planned to bar illegal aliens thus prwoa appeared likely to result in curtailin g many benefits that would have been restricted under prop 187 with the major an d expensive exception of elementary and secondary education nevertheless the 199 8 elections resulted in new official attitude toward denying illegal aliens public services california is again giving illegal iens access to statefunded prenatal care also bills are before the legislatu re to allow illegal aliens to obtain drivers licenses qualify for instate college tuition and reclaim certain other benefits denied them the past several years at
