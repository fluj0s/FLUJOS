containing basic configuration data if this file is not found the so ftware proceeds through the terminal initialization and configuration screens and the operator has to configure the terminal manually if the file is found and contains valid configuration data this data is used as default data the softw are will still display the terminal initialization and configuration screens the operator should check that the dat as displayed in the initialization and power and frequency configuration screens i s correct and then click ok at each screen to confirm the data if any parameters need to be changed follow the procedure in chapter 4 for the specific screen for an nt the software also reads file on the hard di sk that contains network data to determine whether there was problem

resynchronization is performed during normal network operation since pcc ontroller clock skew can build up to unacceptable levels unle ss the time is occasionally updatedreset to accomplish this the nct compares the expected arrival time of the first packet of each row slot for given nt to the actual arrival time of the packet some filtering is applied where the difference is compared to other recent diffe rences and if it is greater than predefined maximum allowable variation the nct will send time correction message to instruct the nt to adjust its clock by the filtered difference 2234 network data messages the network data messages consist of the network database modem statistics rowfow statistics link configuration text orderwire file transf er nct message acknowledge undelivered message and notice messages the network database messag is used by the nct to distribute the information about the nodes in the network the modem statis tics message is used by the nts to disseminate the status of their control modem to the nct they are tr ansmitted at regular intervals and assist the nct in the proper maintenance of the control channel the status param eters include values such as the current bn0 the bit error rate and received signal level as measured by th nt the status of the fow channel as received by one nt is derived from measurements made by its control modem the fowrow statistics messages are transmitted by the nct and are used to inform all nts of the current status of all fow and row links tm 115895183813p chapter 2 replacement frequency modulated orderwire

orderwire is described in section g151 nt composing sending and receiving text orderwire messages the text orderwire function provides only unclassified communications transmission it is the responsibility of the operatorsender of the messages to sure that classified information is not transmitted over this m edium operations security opsec should be used when co mposing and transmitting text orderwire messages the secure voice orderwire is provided for those oc casions where classified information must be exchanged between the nct and an nt the file transfer message is used by any node in the network to send file to other network recipients the file transfer message will normally contain only part of larger file which is segmented by the originator and reas sembled by the recipient nodes b the nct message acknowledge message is used by the nct to acknowledge receipt of text orderwire file transfer or other assured delivery message this notification allows the source node to be informed that the delivery of the message was successful c the undelivered message message is used by th nct to inform source node that message was not able to be delivered to the specified recipient n t d the notice message is used by the nt to inform the nct operator of problem that has occurred at the nt that is not otherwise handled by the message protocol 2235 secure voice configuration messages the secure voice configuration messages are used in the process of setting up secure voice circuit between the nct and an nt they include the request vo vo queued cancel vo vo removed setup vo vo done and vo error messages these messages and how they are used is described in section 229 operation of the secure voice orderwire 224 forward orderwire fow channel the fdma broadcast link connecting the nct with all nts is called the fow the purpose of the fow is to transfer information in the form of messages from t he nct to the nts or from one nt to the other nts through the nct the nct is always transmitting the fow whether there are messages to be sent or not see figure 23 therefore there can be times where the fow contains messages ie it is idle and only scrambled carrier is transmitted each message s ent on the fow is formatted as shown in figure 23 messages received at the nct from nts on the ro w are interleaved for retransmission with nct originated messages and then get transmitted on the fow nt 1 msgnt 1 msgnt 1 msgidlent 2 msgnt 2 msgnct msgnt 2 msgnct msgnct msgnt 3 msg figure 23 typical fow sequence of messages 225 return orderwire row channel 2251 row structure the tdma return link connecting all nts with the nct is called the row the row as shown in figure 24 is tdma transmission wherein each nt transmits messages to the nct in specified time slots each nt is assigned unique time slot when it logs into the netwo rk the sequencing for nt row messages is similar to that for fow messages figure 23 nt 1 msgnt 1

the rfmow net work operates in two modes norm operate and access in the normal mode terminals are transmitting status text orderwire messages and other data associated with normal network operations in their assigned row tdma sl ots however only terminals that have logged into the network and hence have been assigned tdma slot can transmit messages on the row in this mode in order for terminal to be assigned row tdma slot the terminal must first log into the network to make this process possible the nct periodically direct s the nts to suspend transmissions on the row by announcing the start of an access window upon receip t of the start of access window message all nts currently logged into the network stop transmitting the nct operator can change the time period between access opportunities and the duration of the access window the appropriate interval and duration will depe nd upon the number of nts attempting to log in to the network at any particular time once the time between access opportunities has expired the nct equipment will automatically issue network c ontrol message that will change the network from the normal mode to the access mode in addition to the periodic scheduled access windows the nct operator can initiate an access window manually at any time major factor dictating how long it takes for an nt to log into the network is the frequency uncertainty in the nt relative to the nct this uncertainty manifests itself as an error or difference between the expected transmission frequency and the actual transmission freque ncy this error accumulates from number of sources uncertainties in the nt terminal transmit chain uncerta inties in the nct receive ch ain satellite frequency translation error and satellite doppler the larger the error the further the control modem may have to search to find the nt signal since the optimal arch bandwidth is scenario dependent this parameter is optionally set by the nct operator and is calle d the modem search bandwidth the access mode is entered when the nct transmits start of access window message that informs all nts awaiting the opportunity to log in to the network that they may attemp t to do so the nts already logged into the network know through the bb message when th is will happen and receive the announcement as well so they suspend their normal operations an ongoing cure voice call is not suspended when the network goes into the access mode the start of access windo w message also specifies how long the window will be open the access window duration each nt waiti ng to log into the network divides the access window replacement frequency modulated orderwire tm 115895183813p chapter 2 28 rev 01 duration into slots of five seconds in length th nt then randomly selects one of the slots to begin transmitting row access request message this rand omization of nt login times helps to reduce the number of terminals transmitting at the same time it is still possible that row access messages from multiple terminals will collide usually the transmit times and power levels of contending nts are different enough that the nct is able to select one nt over the others once the nct prop erly receives the row access request message from specific nt the nct will transmit grant of row access message to all nts but will only allow the specific nt to access upon receipt of the grant of row access message ov er the fow all other nts currently attempting to log in cease their transmissions and wait for the next b egin access window message the nct then completes the log in process for the terminal that was acknowledged the completion process consists of the nct adjusting the nt transmit power and frequency to minimize future acquisition times the adjustment process is implemented using the change modem parameter message that is transmitted by the nct to the nt after the nct adjusts the entering terminals modem meters the nt transmits its configuration data to the nct this information is incorporated into the overall ne twork database maintained by the nct once the nct has either successfully logged the new rminal into the network or given up on the attempt the nct transmits row release message followed by anothe r begin access window message the process then repeats the proc ess continues until the nct receives row access request during an access window for given subnet the nct then changes its d own converter to the frequency for another subnet and repeats above process determining that new t erminals wish to enter the network from any of the different subnets the nct transmits tdma sc hedule message to distribute the new tdma slot assignments to all loggedin terminals and transmits n etwork database messages to each of the terminals containing information about all terminals now in the net work after that bb message is transmitted so that all the nts can update their local time to network time once an nt receives the current tdma schedule it can begin participating in the network if an nt desires to log out of the network it will tran smit log out request mess age to the nct during its next tdma transmission the nct will process this message without operator intervention and transmit force log out over the fow if log out is not locked for the nt otherwise the nct operator must approve the request before the force log out will be transmitted over the fow when the nt receives the confirmation it will cease transmission of the row if the nct operator denies the nt log out request log out deny message is sent over the fow if force log out or log out deny message is received from the nct the nt operator is given the option to locally force log out after message indicating successful log out the nt is longer pa rt of the network as other nts receive the log out not ification they will update their local databases the tdma time slot reserv ed for the nt that logged out will be marked empty and w ill not be used by other nts until after the next access window when the tdma schedule is recomputed and redistributed 227 maintenance of control link quality efficient operation of the rfmow network relies on rela tively low biterrorrate on the fow and row to assist operators in maintaining link quality each control link is assigned high and low receive bn0 threshold these thresholds are settable by the nct operator and serve as basis for alerting the operator when maintenance actions are warranted in addition to the link alarm thresholds there is link automatic power control flag for each row link when this control fla g is set for row link the nct will automatically send power adjustment commands to the appropriate nt to maintain row link quality these commands are executed through the change modem parameter message the power adjustment for the row occurs in the following way since the nt tdma slot is too short to allow for an accurate measurement of the received nt row bn0 the nct sends begin row measurement message to specific nt when there are secure voice calls i n progress this message causes the nt to retune its control modems transmit frequency to the nct aux iliary modems receive fr equency the nt then turns its control modem on and waits until the nt re ceives the end row measurement message from the nct this transmission is sufficient for the nct auxiliary mode m to make good bn0 measurement and receive the frequency offset after stable measur ement is obtained the nct sends power and frequency adjustment commands as needed to adjust the nts row transmission the nct then transmits an end tm 115895183813p chapter 2 replacement frequency modulated orderwire rev 01 29 row measurement message to the nt to instruct the nt software to retune the control modem back to the normal row frequency this measurement process happe ns automatically without operator intervention control link transmit power is adjusted using the trans mit power attenuator internal to the control modem operator intervention is normally not required to main tain proper link performance when the automatic power control flag is set the situation can occur that the control modem reaches the dynamic range limit of the power attenuator in such case the operator is aler ted and operator intervention is required the operator must perform an uplink chain alignment to recenter t he operation of the modem within the available dynamic range see appendix f power balancealignment procedure row links associated with anct terminals are not subject to utomatic power adjustment the anct operator must check and if needed manually adju st the terminals output power to enable successful communication with other network terminals in the event of network handover this will normally require the anct to transmit at higher output power and the nct to receive the anct row with an bn0 which is outside the normal acceptable range however the nct will not adjust the ancts power nei ther during log in nor during row measurement the automatic power control flag for an anct terminal is set to n and is not modifiable 228 operation of the text orderwire the primary mission of rfmow is to provide text orderwire communicat ions between the nts and the nct this capability is executed through pccontroller text orderwire screen that is divided into three sections the top section displays the list of all messages sent to and from the current terminal the middle section of the messages window is the display screen for received and sent messages user only needs to highlight message from the top section to have it displayed in the display section messages can be copied and printed from the display section but not edited the bottom ction of the screen is an edit window used to create modify and transmit outgoing text orderwire messages the text orderwire capability is designed to support the transmission of unclassified messages only the size of message that can be sent by an nt is d ependent on the length of the timeslot assigned to it this length is not known until the nt goes to operat mode and receives the timeslot information so composing of text orderwire messages is restricted until t hat time once the length of the timeslot is known the software will prevent the operator from composing message that is too long to be t ransmitted in the available time nct operators may compose messages up to approxi mately 1000 characters in length once message has been composed and the operator has initia ted the send function the message is stored within the pccontroller in transmit queue during the nts next tdma slot the text orderwire messages and any other messages stored in the transmit queue are transmit ted to the nct all messages received by the nct are stored and processed for viewing by the nct operator if there are other nts in the destination list the message is immediately retransmitted on the fow the controller software on each nt then looks at the destination list of the text orderwire message as it is received messages addressed to that nt are stored for operator viewing and an indicator is posted on the operator display messages addressed to other nts are discarded as terminals log into and out of the network the nct trans mits updates to all nts in this way an address list is maintained at each nt letting the operator know the nts to whom he can send messages when the operator selects an nt as destination which has be come disconnected from the network he will be warned upon sending the message that delivery may not be possible i f the desti nation is later logged out of the network without accepting delivery of the message the operator will be noti fied of the failure to deliver the message all text orderwire messages have assure d delivery in the sense that either messages are delivered or the initiator is notified when it is determined that the delivery cannot be made as message is received at the node the server imm ediately enters copy of that message into an archive file new archive files are created each time the opera tor launches the software or when the current archive file reaches softwaredefined maximum currently 5 mb the server also relays the received messages to all clients connected to the server the client keeps up to 100 forwarded messages in firstinfirstout manner the operator can view and reply to the receiv ed messages on text orderwire screen the archive replacement frequency modulated orderwire tm 115895183813p chapter 2 210 rev 01 files saved on the server are also viewable on demand any text message being viewed can be printed from the screen to local dedicated printer if one is available recalling that each nt is assigned one tdma slot and that the number of tdma slots within the row is equal to the number of nts recently logged into the ne twork the time between when message is queued for transmission and the time at which it is received at the nct will vary depending on the network size once received at the nct message forwarding through the fow is essentially immediate thus assuming that tdma slot is three seconds and that on average an nt must wait onehalf tdma frame cycle before its slot occurs the message delivery delay will be approximatel onehalf times the number of loggedin network members times the slot duration in seconds for exam ple if there are 10 nts logged into the network the message delivery delay will average ½ x 10 x 3 15 seconds 229 operation of the secure voice orderwire the secure voice service provides an nt operator and t he nct operator with the capa bility to converse over secure voice orderwire circuit only the keying material included in the crypto ignition key cik of each of the stes tactical at the ends of the circuit and loca l security policies limit t he classification of this transaction direct nttont secure voice orderwire calls are not pported the secure voice orderwire capability is normally available at all terminal s in the network when an nt operator requests secure voice or derwire connection the nt equipment transmits request vo message over the row in its assigned tdma slot the nct i mmediately responds with vo queued message and places the request in queue the nct operator is provide d with list of queued secure voice call requests the nct operator may select any nt for the purpose of settin g up call when the nct operator selects destination from ei ther the queued call request list or the list of active terminals the activation of the secure voice call begi ns once the auxiliary modem is available if row bn0 measurement process is currently occurring the setup of the secure voice circuit will be delayed until the measurement has completed any furthe r use of the auxiliary modem for row bn0 measurement will then be suspended setup vo message is sent automatica lly over the fow informing the target nt to retune its control modem to the cure voice frequencies t he modem will retune itself aut omatically after short delay the secure phone at each end of the circuit will conn ect and once the nct operator picks up the phone the nts phone will ring if at any point the ncts pccontroller or the nts pcc ontroller determines that there is problem in setting up the voice orderwire circuit ie signal from the other terminal has been received then the pccontroller will reset the modems to their original settings at an appropriate time the nct will transmit vo error message andor the nt will transmit notice message th at indicates exactly what went wrong the terminal operator will be presented with an alert box on the displ ay indicating the nature of the problem the operator should use this information to correct the problem before re attempting the connection hanging up the phone terminates the call within the terminal equipment hangup is detected by the pccontroller and after short delay to allow the secure t elephone unit to perform hangup protocol the nt pccontroller retunes its control modem back to the fo w and row frequencies for continued participation in the network at the nct the pccontroller also tects hangup and use of the auxiliary modem for bn0 measurement is then restarted the nct will transmit vo done message to inform the other nts of the status of the voice orderwire circuit an nt pccontroller can choose to canc secure voice call re quest that is currently qu eued this will result in cancel vo message being transmitted in the nts assigned tdma time slot the nct will remove the nt from the vo queue and send vo remove message to inform ll nts that the nt longer has request queued if the nt operator decides to ca ncel the request even before the request vo message has been sent to the nct his tdma time slot has not yet arrived the request is simply removed from the transmit message queue at the nt after issuing setup for the secure voice call the nc ts pccontroller can choose to cancel the setup of secure voice call if needed once the cancel set up command is issued the call setup process will be terminated tm 115895183813p chapter 2 replacement frequency modulated orderwire rev 01 211 2210 file transfer the file transfer function can be used by network perator to send file from one network node to another this feature is designed to allow operators to communic ate information throughout the network that cannot be contained within text orderwire message which is of very limited size when an operator sends file to the network the file is segmented into file transfer messages which are delivered using the same underlying mechanism as text orderwire messages but at lower priority text orderwire messages may be composed sent andor received by node that is in the process of sen ding file and these messages will take transmission precedence over t he file transfer in progress for description of the file transfer operator interf ace see section g153 nt sending and receiving files 2211 network control handover during network operation the control of the network the nct role can be handed over to an anct the nct or anct operator can initiate handover as par t of planned network control function or the anct operator can initiate it as recovery attempt from an abnormal network condition the loss of the fow signal from the nct coordination is required between the nc t and receiving anct prior to initiation of network handover the anct can attempt to initiate network control at any time the network is in normal operating mode and the anct is not in row measurement if the nct is functio ning in the network and receives the request for control from the anct the nct operator will either ac cept or refuse the request and send the appropriate response to the anct if the anct is not current ly receiving communications from the nct the fow has been lost the anct may assume control of the netwo rk without nct approval via the rfmow software however the anct operator should always acquire ap proval by some means before attempting to force takeover of network control as this could seriou sly disrupt network activity if done inappropriately the nct operator may also initiate the handover of network control to an anct at any time the network is in normal operating mode and there is an anct terminal logged into the network the anct operator is required to approve this handover request once approval for handover of network control has been given the network is suspended temporarily to allow the nct and anct to exchange roles frequencies terminal id s etc t he nts in the network are advised of the change and the network operation is resumed normally wit h the new roles 2212 file management because rfmow creates several types of log files server event logs client event logs and message logs it is important that rfmow also manage those files to ens ure that memory never becomes an issue log files are retained until the operator removes them or if the hard d rive is over 80 full if the machine has less than 20 of hard drive space rfmow will ttempt to delete as many logs files as possible oldest first to reduce the used space on the machine to 70 rfmow displa ys warning dialog at 75 disk usage and another warning dialog will be displayed if there are log files to be deleted and the disk usage is still exceeding 80 these

alignment procedure f1 overview of power balance alignment the rfmow system allows tactical terminals to ac cess the positive control network without requiring dedicated use of up and down converters the converters that already exist in the terminal may continue to be used for both regular communications carriers and the rfmow system at the same time this is accomplished by balancing the communications carrier nd the rfmow carrier power levels so that they will meet the power requirements dictat ed by the saa when the two carriers ar combined they are able to use the same up converter also the received signals must be separated after the down converter and attenuated appropriately for normal operation this section provides stepbystep procedures to perform the power balancingalignment for rfmow terminals f2 the alignment program the alignment program has been developed to automate and simplify the power balancingalignment process this process must still be performed long before the terminal will be required to perform an rfmow mission because the terminal operator will need to calibrate and cha racterize the terminal equipment f3 alignment procedure for the an tsc85dv1 and antsc93dv1 performing the alignment note if the measured output power of the l3 md1340 modem the measured gain of the up converter and the measured gain of the klystron are t available they should be measur ed prior to beginning this alignment procedure default values for well calibrated terminal re available in the alignment program and may be used however the default power levels should be us ed with the understanding that the attenuator settings derived from the alignment may result in the incorrect power level of communications carrier carrier being much higher or lower than the predicted power level or the incorrect power level of the rfmow orderwire carrier which will prevent the terminal from logging into th rfmow network replacement frequency modulated

rly if debug logging is enabled this may require periodic manual log file and hard disk maintenance by the terminal operator tm 115895183813p appendix g replacement frequency modulated orderwire rev 01 g43 table g38 saving log files to an external medium and dele ting them from the hard disk 1 determine the external medium on which to save t he log files this could be any of number of choices including floppy disk cdr dvdr usb jump drive etc 2 insertattach the external medium to the computer 3 select my computer from the windows desktop by double clicking on it with the mouse 4 use the mouse to navigate to chrfmowbin on the hard disk there will be three directories containing rfmow log files within the chrfmow bin directory they are named serverlogs clientlogs and messagelog s refer to the windows referenc manual or microsoftcom for more information on windows navigation note the default installation directory for rfmow is chrfmowbin if the rfmow was installed in different directory the log file direct ories will be found in that directory 5 use the mouse to navigate to the messagelogs directory 6 select the files to be saved refer to the windows refe rence manual or microsoftcom for more information on selecting files 7 copy the files to the desired medium refer to the windows refer ence manual or microsoftcom for more information on copying files 8 now that the log files have been saved delete them from the messagelogs directory also be sure to empty the recycle bin on the windows desktop refer to the windows reference manual or microsoftcom for more information on eting files and emptying the recycle bin note the message log server log andor client g files currently being used by rfmow may not be able to be deleted ignore this file and delete the others 9 return to the chrfmowbin directory or other directory where rfmow has been installed 10 repeat steps 5 through 9 above to save and delet files from the serverlogs directories 11 repeat steps 5 through 9 above to save and delete fil from the clientlogs directories note depending on the size of the hard disk this pr ocedure will have to be execut ed periodically to ensure that all log files are saved before the rfmow dele tes them automatically at 80 hard disk utilization replacement frequency modulated orderwire tm 115895183813p appendix g g44 rev 01 this page left blank intentionally
