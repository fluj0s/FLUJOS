stevensherwoodyaleedu frank wentz frankwentzremsscom ben there are two very different things going on here one is technical and related to the actual science and the actual statistics the second is political and is much more concerned with how incidents like this can be portrayed the second is the issue here the unfortunate fact is that the secret science meme is an extremely powerful rallying call to people who have idea about what is going on claiming rightly or wrongly that information is being hidden has huge amount of resonance as you know much more so than whether douglass et know their statistical elbow from hole in the ground thus any increase in publicity on this whether in the pages of nature or elsewhere is much more likely to bring further negative fallout despite your desire to clear the air whatever you say it will still be presented as you hiding data the contrarians have found that there is actually limit to what you can ask people for raw data intermediate steps additional calculations residuals sensitivity calculations all the code workable version of the code on any platform etc and like somali pirates they have found that once someone has paid up they can always shake them down again thus i would not advise any public statements on this instead email you immediate superiors and the director with short statement along the lines of what you suggest below ie of course you want open science the data are in the public domain with links and calls for more intermediate steps are just harassment to prevent scientists doing what they are actually paid too i wouldnt put in anything specifically related to mcintyre much more satisfying response would be to demonstrate how easy it is to replicate the analysis in the paper starting from scratch using openly available data such as through joe sirotts portal and the simplest published msu weighting function if you can show that this can be done in couple of hours or whatever it makes the other side look like incompetent amateurs maybe someone has graduate student available gavin on tue 20081202 at 1552 ben santer wrote dear folks there has been some additional fallout from the publication of our paper in the international journal of climatology after reading steven mcintyres discussion of our paper on climateauditcom and reading about my failure to provide mcintyre with the data he requested an official at doe headquarters has written to cherry murray at llnl claiming that my behavior is bringing llnls good name into disrepute cherry is the principal associate director for science and technology at llnl and reports to llnls director george miller im getting sick of this kind of stuff and am tired of simply taking it on the chin accordingly i have been trying to evaluate my options i believe that one option is to write letter to nature briefly outlining some of the events that have transpired subsequent to the publication of our ijoc paper nature would be logical choice for such letter since they published brief account of our findings in their research highlights section the letter would provide some public record of my position regarding mcintyres data request and would note that all of the raw gridded model and observational data used in the 2008 santer et international journal of climatology ijoc paper are freely available to mr mcintyre if mr mcintyre wishes to audit us and determine whether the conclusions reached in our paper are sound he has all the information necessary to conduct such an audit providing mr mcintyre with the quantities that i derived from the raw model data spatiallyaveraged time series of surface temperatures and synthetic microwave sounding unit msu temperatures would defeat the very purpose of an audit email from ben santer to tom karl nov 11 2008 i think that some form of public record would be helpful particularly if llnl management continues to receive emails alleging that my behavior is tarnishing llnls scientific reputation since it was my decision not to provide mcintyre with derived quantities synthetic msu temperatures im perfectly happy to be the sole author of such letter to nature your thoughts or advice in this matter would be much appreciated with best regards ben benjamin d santer program for climate model diagnosis and intercomparison lawrence livermore national
