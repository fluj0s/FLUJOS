concluded fouryear saga of legislative attemp ts to reauthorize temporary assistance for needy families tanf and related programs the original 1996 tanf law authorized five years of funding through september 2002 between october 1 2002 and the dras passage the progra m operated under series of 12 temporary exte nsion measures efforts to pass comprehensive free standing welfare legisl ation during that period failed to reach fruition instead scaledback version of welfare reauthorization legislation was ultimately included in broader budget spe nding reconciliation gislation the dra of 2005 extends and maintains the basic t anf block grant at funding level of 165 billion annually through fy2010 increases the share of tanf fam ilies required to participate in work activitie s increases child care funding by 200 million per year over the fy2005 level of 27 billion for fy2006fy2010 ie total increase of 1 billion provides federal costshari ng for child support passed through to tanf and former tanf families but prevents federal matching of child support incentive payments reinvested in the program provides up to 100 million per year in demonstration grants for th promotion of healthy marriages and establishes 50 million per year for responsible fatherhood initiatives the administration originally proposed its welfare reauthorization plan in february 2002 the debate that ensued was dominated by controversy over child care funding levels and the administra tions proposed changes to tanf work participation standards the reauthoriza tion debate also reflected renewed focus on noncustodial parents usua lly fathers and on family formation issues the dra includes responsible fatherhood initiatives and scaledback version of the presidents initiative to promote healthy marriages the dra ultimately included the same child care funding increase that was proposed in earlier housepassed welfare reauthorization measures in 2002 and 2003 1 billion in additional mandatory child car funding over five years in the 108th congress legislation introduced in the nate likewise proposed 1 billion increase over five years down from the 55 billion in crease approved by the senate finance committee in the 107th congress however senator s nowe led efforts pressing for larger increase the bill approved by the 109th congresss finance committee s 667 reflected those efforts with propos ed increase of 6 billion over five years however s 667 was one of the freestandi ng welfare measures that was not taken up by the full senate and the child care f unding increase was set at 1 billion in the final passage of the dra with respect to the work requirement issue while the dra requires states to increase the share of their families participating in tanf work activities it does not include the administrations original pr oposal to set 40hour workweek standard or revise the activities that count toward it this mark s the final version of this report it will

healthy marriage promotion grants and responsible fatherhood initiatives background the 1996 welfare reform law the personal responsibility and work opportunity reconciliation act of 1996 pl 104193 was major piece of social legislation most known for ending the cash welfare entitlement for needy families with children creating the tanf block grant setting fiveyear time limit on aid and requiring more work from welfare recipients the law also restructured child care programs combining programs for cash assistance recipients and other working poor families modified the child support enforcement cse program restricted eligibility for noncitizens in various we lfare programs restricted eligib ility for disabled children in the supplemental security income ssi program and made changes to the food stamp program the goals of welfare reform include reducing welfare dependency through work job preparation and marriage reducing out ofwedlock pregnancies and promoting the formation and maintenance of twoparent families tanf gives states great deal of latitude in designing their progra ms resulting in each state having different program with different story to tell in their tanffunded cash welfare programs many states tightened work rules requiring applicants to search for work even before being certified eligible for aid most states adopted toug her penalties on families where member refused to comply with work requirements however states also adopted features that liberalized eligibility particularly for families where recipients went to work once on the rolls for example in most states families are allowed to keep more of their welfare benefits as their earnings increase have car and accumulate more assets spending on child care has increasedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33418crs2 1 for more discussion of these trends see crs report rl32682 children in poverty profile trends and issues by vee burke thomas gabe and gene falk and crs

reform period the period following welf are reform saw the cash welfare caseload plummet and child poverty rates drop to levels not seen since the 1970s employment of single mothers increased dramatically progress was more muted or could be less tied to changes in policy on number of other fronts the rate at which teenagers gave birth declined but that was continuation of trend that became evident before the mid1990s the percent of children born out of wedlock continued to increase though at rate slow er than during previous periods further much of the progress occurred during the period 1995 to 2000 in 2001 the economy entered recessi on nationa l caseloads remained steady for the 20012004 period they had begun to decline again in 2005 which is not shown in the table employment in 2004 of single mothers is down from its historical high in 2000 although is still higher than its 1995 level the number of children living in families headed by married couple decreased slightly from 2000 to 2003 child poverty rates increased again from 2000 to 20041 welfare dependency has been viewed as both result of and cause of chronic poverty welfare caseloads and child povert simultaneously declined during the late 1990s however the welfare caseload declin ed faster than child poverty meaning that cash welfare touches smaller share of the poor than it did before welfare reform further despite the decline in welfare dependency children are still more likely to be poor than the elderly and nona ged adults and outofwedlock births and single parenthood remain at hi storical highs despite the halving of the cash welfare caseloadhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33418crs3 2 for more discussion of the defic it reduction act see crs report rs22369 tanf child care marriage

child ca re funding however during the committee markup of that legislation senator snowe shar ed her intent to offer an amendment for greater child care funding increase if and when the bill was brought to the senate floor in march of 2004 hr 4 did indeed reach the nate floor for debate and senator snowes amendment to provide an additional 6 billi on in child care funding above the 1 billion already included in the underlying hr 4 wa s offered and approved by vote of 7820 however following the vote on the amendment the senate failed to resume consideration of hr 4 for the remainder of the 108th congressnote that while the basic tanf block grant is extended and maintained at the annual amount of 165 billion until fy2010 under the dra pl 109171 tanf supplemental grants are extended for only th ree years further previous welfare reauthorization proposals had included 200 m illion per year in grants for healthy marriage promotion 100 million per year for matching grants to states and tribes and second 100 million per year in research and demonstration funding controlled by the secretary of health and human services hhs the deficit reduction act scales back funding for h ealthy marriage promotion to 100 million in research and demonstration funding an additional 50 million in mandatory funding is for responsible fatherhood initiatives all existing tanf bonuses high performance bonus based on states progress toward meeting the block grants goals 200 million per year and bonus for reduc ing outofwedlock pregnancies 100 million per year are eliminated the level of mandatory child care fundi ng has been contentious point of debate over the past four years th congressional budget office cbo has estimated that to maintain the current level of child care subsidies over the five years covered by the dra that is to maintain current child care caseloads and average subsidy levels and keep pace with inflation to tal of 48 billion in extra federal or state funds would be needed the cu rrent child care caseload includes families on the cash welfare rolls as well as other lowincome working families in fy2001 only one in five families aided by the ch ild care block grant received tanf cash assistance the other four families were either former tanf families in the transition from welfare to work or were working poor families without connection to the cash welfare program the deficit reduction act includes an increase of 200 million per year from 2717 billion to 2917 billion per year in fe deral mandatory child care funding or total increase of 1 billion over five years the increase reflects twice that proposed earlier in the housepassed budget reconciliation bill 05 billion mirroring the funding level passed by the house in welfare reauthorization measures of both 2002 and 2003 the 1 billion increase stands in contrast to the proposed increase of 6 billion over five years included in the bill reported out of the senate finance committee early in 2005 s 6678 the deficit reduction act s 1 billion in additional federal child care funds requires state matching this leverages some additional state dollars for each new federal child care dollar if states dr aw down the full 1 billion approximately 08 billion in state child care funds will also be expended bringing the total new federal and state spending for the child care block grant to about 18 billionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33418crs7 however the 18 billion in total new federal and state child care funds is estimated to be insufficient to maintain current caseloads and average child care subsidies and to keep pace with inflation as projected by the cbo in addition the deficit reduction act has tanf work pr ovisions see below that beginning in fy2007 are likely to substantially increase the share of tanf families that will be required to work or participate in job r eadiness activities this too is likely to increase the demand for child care subsidies the child care and tanf block grants do not entitle families to child care subsidies therefore states could re spond in number of different ways or combination of ways to inflationary pressures and the likely increase in the demand for child care subsidies caused by stricter tanf work partic ipation requirements increase funding from other sources particularly tanf tanf has been major contributor of child care funds the second largest spending category next to cash assistance within tanf states could allocate more tanf spending to child care however number of factors are likely to limit tanfs ability to contribute more child care funds specifically 1 the block grant will remain frozen at the same levels as it was in fy1997 165 billion and inflation continues to erode the purchasing power of those dollars 2 the dra will have the likely effect of increasing the percentage of tanf families that will have to participate in work activities increasing the tanf work costs in addition to child care costs and 3 allocating additional funding to child care would mean cutting back on other initiatives that have been funded with tanf dollars for instance tanfs contribution to funding child welfare benefits and services for children who have b een subject to or are at risk of abuse neglect or family breakup target more child care dollars to families receiving cashassistance as discussed above in fy2001 only one in five families receiving subsidies under the child care block grant received cash assistance to meet the higher child care costs due to the increase in tanf work participation standards states could target more child care dollars to families on tanf assistance reducing spending on subsidies for other lowinco working poor families restructure child care subsidies to reduce their average costs under both block grants states determine subsidy levels and how much family has to contribute from their own income co payments these rules can be restructured to reduce the average child care subsidy per familyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33418crs8 9 for more information on tanf see crs report rl32760 the temporary assistance for needy families tanf block grant responses to frequently asked questions by gene falktanf work requirements tanf requires states to run mandatory work and job preparation programs setting participation requirements and sanctioning families reducing or ending benefits that do not comply with them mandatory particip ation requirements can help achieve number of different po licy objectives including the following enforcing the notion that recipien ts are obligated to support their families through work that is they must do something in exchange for their benefits having recipients engage in activities that will enhance their abilityto compete in the labor market and ultimately leave welfare for work and deterring those who have other m eans of support eg those already working but not reporting income to the welfare office or participating in the undergr ound economy from applying and receiving benefits most states have generally adopted workfirst approach to implementing their programs emphasizing rapid entry in to the labor force through upfront job search evaluations of such programs indicate that they do increase employment and reduce welfare receipt however these pr ograms have generally not been found to raise the incomes of participants further tanf data show that participation in activities is not universal in fy2004 stat reported that of about 14 million adult recipients of cash assistance 57 were not working or in job preparation activity for month note that these adults are not reported in an activity states may underreport activity that is not countable toward tanf work participation standards 1996 law work participation standard nominally the 1996 tanf law set par ticipation standard that requires 50 of families with an adult to be engaged in work separate standard of 90 applies to the twoparent component of the casel oad however the actual participation standards states face are usually far lower than the nominal participation standards tanf law provides caseload reduction cr edit which reduces the 50 standard by one percentage point for each percent decline in the cash assistance caseload that occurred since fy1995 prewelfa re reform many states have had large caseload declines and in fy2004 there were 19 states with declines of 50 or more reducing the effective after credit standard to 0 on average the fy2004 national work participation rate was 329 the large caseload reduction credits have lessened the impact of the participation standards they have allowed states to have more participants in noncreditable activities eg educati on and perhaps led to lower overall participationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33418crs9 revisions to tanf work participation standards the 2002 bush administration welfare r eauthorization proposals envisioned substantial rewrite of the tanf work participation standards the participation standard would have been raised from 50 to 70 the caseload reduction credit would have been replaced with credit fo r employed welfare leavers families would have had to participate 40 hours per w eek and except for three month period allowed for recipients to focus solely on job search and shortterm training minimum of 24 hours per week in work or workfare would have been required for states to receive credit fo r familys participation the house passed slightly modified version of the administrations work proposal three times in 2002 2003 and in the housepassed version of the budget reconciliation bill in 2005 three time s in 2002 2003 and s 667 in 2005 the senate finance committee reporte d different modifications to the work rules though none of these proposals passed the full senate the fina nce committee approach was to generally expand the activities that count toward the participation standards in part by increasing the amount of educa tion that would have been countable under tanf work standards the deficit reduction act does not overhaul tanf work participation standards it retains th current 50 and 90 standards current rules for the minimum hours that count toward the par ticipation standard and current list of activities that are creditable for work par ticipation however the deficit reduction act makes the following changes the caseload reduction credit is revised so that work participation standards are reduced only for caseload reductions that occur from fy 2005 into the future this is effective beginning in fy2007 thus absent further caseload d eclines state will face 50 tanf work participa tion standard in contrast to the much reduced standards they w ould have faced under prior law will count families in statefunded separate state programs ssps in the work partic ipation rate calculation under current law states may assist tanflik families in state funded programs and count spending in those programs toward the tanf state spending requirement known as the maintenance of effort or moe families in ssps are not counted in the work participation rates the dra provides that beginning in fy2007 families in ssps are to be included in the participation rate calculation this prevents states from increasing their participation rate simply by moving nonparticipating families into ssps requires hhs to develop regulations to define work activities and standards for verifying work participation 2005 government accountability office gao report found that the lack of uniformity in work definitions and procedures for verifying participation means there is standard basis for interpreting states work participa tion rates and the ra tes cannot effectively behttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33418crs10 10 united states government accountability ffice gao05821 welfare reform hhs should exercise oversight to help ensure tanf work participation is measured

what count s as work participation by gene falk 13 further work participation rates varied grea tly among the states some states will have to increase their participation rates more than others see

families that are subject to work requirements and standards for verifying worker participation hhs issued th regulations on june 29 200611 the regulations define each of the 12 tanf work activities12 require that activities be supervised for education and training often on daily basis exempt families where an adult must care for disabled member from the work requirements but include families with sanctioned adult or one removed from the assistance case because of state time limit in the participation rate calculation and require states to submit plans for verifying work activities these changes are likely to increase required participation standards significantly for states the national aver age work participation rate in fy2004 was 32 so requiring 50 of families to par ticipate requires states to significantly boost their participation13 child support enforcement responsible fatherhood initiatives abstinence education and marriage promotion in 2004 children in fa milies

live in families headed by single mother welfaretowork initiatives have focused on getting such single mothers into the workforce while there has been sharp increase in work among single mothers many single mothers and their children remain poor the fifth annual tanf report states welfare reform has been very successful at getting significant portion of cases into the workplace and into second and sometimes third jobs but it has been ss effective in keeping them employed full time and in achieving substantial wage or career growth the sixth annual tanf report indicates that in fy2002 the averag monthly earnings of tanf recipients who were employed was 678 or 8136 per year the poverty level for threeperson family in 2002 was 1196 per month or 14348 for the year child support payments are now

solomonfearsincreasingly attention has focused on the role of the noncustodial parent usually the father in the economic s upport and developmen t of his children research has shown that lowincome fathers tend to face some of the same issues as do lowincome mothers such as being very likely to work intermittently andor in lowwage jobs thereby limiting their ability to help support their children these findings together with growing sentiment that noncustodial fathers are more likely to be dead broke than deadbeats have fostered more sympathetic view of noncustodial fathers beginning in 1996 c ongress has considered bills that would specifically authorize funding for programs designed to help noncustodial fathers meet both their financial and emotional responsibilities to their children also including components related to marriage pr omotion and effective parenting these programs are generally referred to as responsible fatherhood programs in recognition of the often negative longterm consequences associated with teenage pregnancy congress has provided f unding for the prevention of teenage and outofwedlock pregnancies reducing nonmarital pregnancy especially among teenagers was an important focus of the 1996 welfare law in recent years funding has shifted toward abstinence education rath er than comprehensive sexual education as the preferred way to reduce teenage pregnancy the 109th congress continued the debate on which approach is more effective the goals of welfare reform include re ducing welfare dependency through work job preparation and marriage reducing out ofwedlock pregnancies and promoting the formation and maintenance of twopa rent families although the 1996 welfare reform law did reflect new interest in marriage for welfare families most of the policy changes implemented after the 1996 law focused almost exclusively on encouraging work and did not directly address the marriage goals the deficit reduction act specifically in cludes funding for programs exclusively designed to promote marriage among lowincome persons which is seen by its supporters as way to improve the economic wellbe ing and development of children child support enforcement though much of the media focus on welfare reform in the mid1990s was on tanf and its work and time limit require ments the child support enforcement cse program has also been undergoing change14 the cse program began in 1975 as program to collect child support fro m the noncustodial parents of children on welfare if the child support collected on behalf of the welfare family was insufficient to lift the familys income bove the states cash welfare eligibility limit the family received the welfare cash bene fit and the child support payment was distributed to reimburse th state and federal government for cash welfare costs in proportion to their assistance to the family if however the welfare familys income including the child support payment ex ceeded the states welfare cash benefit standard the familys cash we lfare benefits were ended and the family received the entire amount of child support collected on th eir behalf in addition to costrecovery efforts with regard to welfare families the cse program has always collected childhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33418crs12 15 for more discussion of these provisions see crs report rs22377 child support continuedsupport on behalf of nonwelfare families in an effort to prevent them from coming onto the welfare rolls over time the cse program has evolved from program whose primary focus was costrecovery to program that is focusing on service delivery in fy2005 total of 23 billion was collected in child support this is more than twice as much as fy2004 cash assist ance with little less than half 45 collected on behalf of families with current or pr ior connection to the welfare system the 23 billion collected in fy 2005 was nearly double prewelfare reform cse collections though the increase in child support collections shows some progress in getting noncustodial parents to help support their children collections totaled only 18 of the tota l obligations in support or ders in the

need to set relationship limits and to resist peer pressure and also provides them with information on the use of contraceptives and the prevention of sexually transmitted diseases advocates of the abstinence education approach argue that teenagers need to hear single unambig uous message that sex outside of marriage is wrong and harmful to their physical and em otional health they contend that youth can and should be empowered to say to sex they argue that supporting both abstinence and birth control is hypocriti cal and undermines the strength of an abstinenceonly message17 marriage promotion research indicates that children in families headed by both of their biological parents do better on an array of ch ild development outcomes higher academic achievement lower teenage child bearing lower levels of delinquency etc than children living in singleparent families much of this is due to the lower incomes of children in singleparent families but the statistical association between family type and child outcomes holds even when considering families of equivalent incomes however in note of caution these better outcomes hold only when child lives with both of his or her bi ological parents they do not apply to stepchildren further there are concerns about promoting marriage when some relationships are violent additionally there is the caveat to interpreting social science research that correlation does not equal causation the actual cause of the difference in child outcomes could be diffe rences in characteristics and behaviors some not observed for purposes of statisti cal study associated with married versus unmarried parents the administration is currently funding research to address the question of whether marriage promotion programs could achieve their goals hhs is currently conducting largescale research projects to evaluate the impact of marriage promotion actual findings regarding the imp acts of these programs are several years away the deficit
