intersection of patents and marketing exclusivities summary in combination patents and marketing exclusivitie s provide the fundamental framework of intellectual property incen tives for pharmaceutical innovation in the united states patents which are administered by the united states patent and trademark office uspto provide their owner with the ability to exclude others from practicing the claimed invention for limited time in contrast marketing exclusivities are administered by the food and drug administration fda alternatively known as data exclusivity or data protection marketing exclusivity prevents generic competitors from referencing the preclinical and clinical test data that manufacturers of brand name pharmaceuticals generated in order to demonstrate the safety and effectivene ss of their products the fda currently awards qualifying innovators with marketing exclusiv ities for the development of new chemical entities or orphan drugs as well as for the performance of new clinical studies and pediatric studies although patents and marketing exclusiv ities are separate titlements that are administered by different federal administrative agen cies and that depend upon distinct criteria they both create propr ietary rights in pharmaceutical innovation these rights in turn allow innovators to receive return on the expenditure of resources leading to the discovery once these rights expire the marketplace for that drug is open to generic competition several innovation policy issu have arisen concerning the relationship of patents and marketing exclusivities some observers believe that marketing exclusivities are unnecessary because pa tents are generally available for pharmaceutical innovation on the other hand some observers belie ve that the terms of the marketing exclusivities established by us law are too short in particular they note that comparable european standards are often considerably longer than their us counterparts international agreements require each world trade organization wto member state to treat all patented inventions in the same manner as result marketing exclusivities provide congress with more flexible option for stimulating specific sorts of desirable private activ ity than do patents indeed the 109th congress is currently considering expanding upon ex isting marketing exclusivities in order to encourage the development of bioterrori sm countermeasures wto agreements as well as recent free trade agreements to which the united states is signatory also oblige nations to provide some manner of protection to pharmaceutical test data although general patent refo rm legislation has been th subject of significant discussion during the 109th congress current legislative proposals do not appear particularly to impact the relationship between patents and marketing exclusivities some maintain that continued attention to the impact of broadly oriented patent reforms upon the pharmaceutical industry is appropriatehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33288contents introduction to the patent system 3 p l i c g l s 3 p t n t c q u i s i t i n n d n f r c m n t 4 fundamentals of marketing

interest in stimulating innovation within the pharmaceutical industry has been reflected in considerable congressional activity some federal laws have provided pharmaceutical firms with the possibility of obtaining proprietary rights as an incentive for the developm ent of new drugs the drug price competition and patent term restoration act of 19841 commonly known as the hatchwaxman act2 included provisions establishing one form of proprietary rights the socalled marketing exclusivity marketing exclusivities consist of period of time during which the food and drug admin istration fda affords an approved drug protection from competing app lications for marketing approval3 this latter concept is sometimes termed data exclusivity or data protection4 the hatchwaxman act also modified the basic rules relating to patent protection for pharmaceuticals patents which are issued by the us patent and trademark office uspto provide their owner with the ability to exclude others from practicing the claimed invention for limited time5 statutory exemption from claims of patent infringement base d upon acts reasonably related to seeking marketing approval from the fda specialized litigation procedures for challenging patent validity and infringemen t and restoration of patent term to compensate for fda marketing approval delays were among the reforms accomplished by the hatch waxman act6 in order to update the hatchwaxman ac t to achieve what congress determined was an appropriate balance between incentives for innovation and compe tition within the pharmaceutical industry

act9 have also employed the marketing exclusivity mechanism in order to establish incentives to engage in socially desirable activity the 109th congress is currently considering further modifications to the existing marketing exclusivity framework in order to encourage the research and developm ent of counterterrorism measures10 both marketing exclusivities and patents are intended to encourage drug developers to invent new pharmaceutical products or to generate new information concerning existing products by shieldin g their innovations from competition for limited period of time although both mechan isms serve the same basic innovation policy goals they are in fact separate entitlements that are administered by different federal administrative agencies nd that depend upon different criteria11 together these two incentives provide relatively complex system of proprietary rights that regulate the timing of pate nt litigation the introduction of generic competition and ultimately the rate of return that pharmaceutical firms may obtain upon their innovative products although both patents and marketing excl usivities have been available within the pharmaceutical industry for over two decades comme ntators have raised number of innovation policy issues in this context some observers question the need for the fda to grant marketing exclusivities given the availability of pharmaceutical patents12 on the other hand others be lieve that the terms of the marketing exclusivities established by us law are too short in view of european standards13 issues have also arisen with respect to the use of marketing exclusivities to encourage specific sorts of innovation and with the obligations of other nations to grant marketing exclusivities in the manner of us law this

system policy goals the patent system serves to promote th creation and disclosure of technological information some commentat ors believe that absent patent system individuals and institutions would be less likely to enga ge in research and development without the availability of patent pr otection new inventions could be easily copied by free riders who incurred cost to develop and perfect the technology involved the resulting inability of inventors to capitalize on their inventions would likely lead to an environment where too few inventions are made by providing individuals with exclusive rights in their inventions for limited time the patent system allows inventors to realize financial benefits fro m their inventions14 other observers believe that if the pa tent system were unavailable innovators would maintain their inventions as trade secrets so that competitors could not exploit them trade secrets do not enrich the collective knowledg of society however nor do they discourage others from engaging in duplicative research the patent system avoids these inefficiencies by requiring inventors to consen t to the disclosure of their inventions in issued patent instruments15 legal scholars have offered additional ex planations for the patent laws the patent system may stimulate technological advancement by inducing individuals to invent around patented technology issu ed patent instruments may point the way for others to develop improvements exploit new markets or discover new applications for the patented technology16 moreover the patent system may encourage patentees to exploit their proprie tary technologies during the term of the patent the protection provided by pate nts proprietary rights increases the likelihood firm will continue to re fine produce and market the patented technology17 finally the patent law has been identified as facilitator of markets absent patent rights an inve ntor may have scant tangible assets to sell or license and even less ability to police the conduct of c ontracting party by reducing licensees opportunistic possibilities the patent system lowers tr ansaction costs and makes technologybased transac tions more feasible18 the patent system has inspired numer ous critics however some detractors have asserted that the patent system is unnecessary due to market forces that

competition in the late 1980s continuedsponsors competitors could file their ow n ndas using that test data and thereby avoid the expenses of developi ng the information themselves36 prior to the introduction of the hatch waxman act federal law contained separate provisions ddressing generic versions of brandname drugs that the fda had previously approved for marketing37 the result was that wouldbe generic drug manufacturer had to file its ow n nda in order to market its drug38 some generic manufacturers could rely on published scientific literature demonstrating the safety and efficacy of the drug because th sorts of studies were not available for all drugs however not all generic firm s could file these socalled paper ndas39 further at times the fda would request additional studies to address safety and efficacy questions that arose from experience with the drug following its initial approval40 the result was that some generi c manufacturers were forced to prove independently that their pha rmaceuticals were safe and ffective even though their products were chemically identical to those of previously approved drugs some commentators believed that the approval of generic drug was needlessly costly redundant and timecons uming process prior to the hatch waxman act41 these observers noted that alt hough patents on impor tant drugs had expired manufacturers were not moving to introduce generic equivalents for these products due to the level of resource expe nditure required to obtain fda marketing approval42 as the introduction of generic equivalents often causes prices to decrease the interest of consumers was arguably not being served through these observed costs and delays43httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33288crs7 43 continued found that generic prices decline on

drug application anda may be filed at the fda44 an anda may be filed if the active ingredient of the generi c drug is the bioequiva lent of the approved drug an anda allows generic drug ma nufacturer to rely upon the safety and efficacy data of the original manufacturer the availability of the anda mechanism often allows generic manufacturer to avoid the costs and delays associated with filing fullfledged nda andas also allow generic manufacturer in many cases to place its fdaapprove d bioequivalent drug on the market as soon as any relevant patents expire45 the hatchwaxman act placed certain limits upon the ability of generic competitors to reference the data generated by the manufacturers of brandname drugs these limitations termed marketing exclusivities consist of period of time during which competitors ability to obtain fda permission to sell generic version of previously appr oved brandname drug is restricted the federal food and drug laws establish several different sorts of marketing exclusivities relating to new chemical entities new clinical studies orphan drugs and pediatric studies46 this report describes each of these marketing exclusivities below new chemical entity exclusivity the hatchwaxman act established fiveyear exclusivity that is available to drugs that qualify as new chemical entity nce the purpose of this nce exclusivity is to encourage the developmen t of innovative drug products that include an entirely new active ingredient commonly termed the active moiety in contrast to metoo drugs that incorporate ch emical variants of previously known compounds nce exclusivity prevents s ubsequent generic applicant from relying upon the data submitted by the innovative dr ug company during fiveyear period as result generic firms are precluded fro m relying upon this data for five years from the date of the approval of the nda for that active moiety47 drug is judged to be an nce if the fda has not previously approved that drugs active ingredient48 the hatchwaxman act expressly stipulates that drug does not qualify as an nce if it consists of the salt or ester of previously approvedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33288crs8 49

product containing the same active moiety protected under th nce exclusivity this prohibition holds even if these applications are directed to ward different use dosage form or ester or salt of the active ingredient50 nce exclusivity does not preclude the fda from accepting an application submitte d by an entity that has performed all the required preclinical and clinical studies itself51 the hatchwaxman act allows the fiveyear term of nce exclusivity to be decreased to four years under one circumst ance if the nda holder owns patents that the generic applicant believes are invalid or not infringed then the generic applicant is allowed to file its app lication one year early upon th expiration of four rather than five years from the date the nda was approved52 the apparent purpose of this provision is to allow additional time fo r brandname and generic pharmaceutical firms to put their patent affairs in order prior to generic marketing the practical effect of nce exclusivity is to restrict potential generic manufacturer from bringing product to market for five years plus the length of the fda review of the generic application53 if for example the fda requires two years to approve particular ge neric application the real world impact of the nce exclusivity has been seven years of prot ection in this respect nce exclusivity operates differently from other forms of fdaadministered exclusivities these exclusivities generally prevent the fda from approving applications rather than accepting them in the first instance54 new clinical study exclusivity in order to encourage improvements upon drugs that are already in use the hatchwaxman act also provided for threeyear new clinical study exclusivity period new clinical study exclusivity may be awarded with respect to either an nda55 or supplemental nda56 that contains reports of new clinical studies conducted by the sponsor that are essential to fda approval of that application the fda has granted new

could not have been prev iously used for another fda drug approval proceeding second the study must be clinical study on humans as compared to preclinical study and not bioavailability or bioequivalence study59 third the study must have been conducted or sponsor ed by the applicant fda regulations stipulate that an applicant that s provided substantial support for the investigation fulfills this requirement60 the statement of certified public accountant that the applicant provided 50 per cent or more of the cost of conducting the study qualifies as substantial suppor t and the fda will also entertain explanations of why the applicant shoul d be considered to have conducted or sponsored the study if the applicant provide d less than half of the funding for that study61 finally the study must be essential to the approval of the application or supplement the fda has defined the term essential to approval as meaning that there are other data available that could support approval of the application62 study that provides useful background inform ation but is not ssential to approving the change in the drug does not provide sufficient basis for an fda award of new clinical study exclusivity63 in contrast to nce exclusivity new clin ical study exclusivity does not prevent the fda from accepting generic application with respect to the drug if the new clinical study exclusivity continues to bar the issuance of marketing approval at the close of fda review the fda will issue tentative approval for the generic product that will become effective once the new clinical study exclusivity has run its course64 in addition new clinical study exclusivity only applies to the use of the product that was supported by the new clinical study65 if for example the new studies support new indication or dosage form of the previously approved ingredient then the threeyear exclusivity applies only to that particular use or dosage form

number of patients to be studied the labeling that may result from such studies the format of the report to be submitted to the fda and the timeframe for completing the studies response to this written request is wholly voluntary if the innovative drug company submits report to the satisfaction of the fda however then it will be awarded the sixmonth pediatric marketing exclusivity78 notably the food and drug laws do not condition pediatric exclusivity upon the success of the study the sixmonth mark eting exclusivity period may be obtained whether or not the study successfully monstrates safety and effectiveness in children thus the fdama and bpca were merely intended to create incentives for drug sponsors to conduct research and submit their results to the fda the effect of pediatric exclusivity is to extend the approved manufacturers existing patent or marketing exclusivity protection for an additional six months79 note that pediatric exclusivity does not act ually extend the

grants to conduct clinical trials to s upport the approval of orphan drugs85 the most commercially significant of all of these benefits is sevenyear term of orphan drug marketing exclusivity86 this period commences from the date the fda issues marketing approval on the drug87 the original version of the orphan drug act extended marketin g approval only to drugs th at were not patented however congress amended the statute in 1985 to provide for marketing exclusivity both for patented nd unpatented products88 orphan drug marketing exclusivity applie s only to the indication for which the drug is approved as result the fda could approve second application of the same drug for different use the f da cannot approve the same drug made by another manufacturer for the same use how ever unless the original sponsor approves or the original sponsor is unable to provi sufficient quantities of the drug to the market89 as originally enacted the orphan drug act defined an orphan drug as one for which there was reasonable expectation that the cost of developing will be recovered from sales in the ited states of such drug90 in 1984 congress changed the definition to its present form91

effect of this change was to allow drug sponsors to avoid making showing of unprofitability if the target population consisted of less than 200000 persons the original version of the orphan dr ug act allowed sponsor to request orphan drug status at any time prior to fda marketing approval congress amended the statute in 1988 however to require th at the sponsor make this designation request prior to the submission of an application for marketing approval93 pediatric exclusivity may also extend the period of marketing exclusivity enjoyed by an orphan drug if product is subject to both orphan drug marketing exclusivity and pediatric exclusivity the total period of exclusivity is therefore seven years six months94 innovation policy issues two decades of experience with the hatchwaxman act have resulted in diverse opinions concerning the system of incentives for innovation within the pharmaceutical industry as pharmaceutical firms ma obtain patents from the uspto some observers question the need for the fda to grant marketing exclusivities as well95 other observers essentially take the opposite view asserting that the marketing exclusivities availabl under us w should be ngthened to match european standards96 issues have also arisen with respect to the use of marketing exclusivities to encourage the private sector to develop bioterrorism countermeasures as well as whether other nations are obligated by world trade organization wto agreements to grant marketing exclusivities similar to us law this report reviews these issues in turn policy justifications for marketing exclusivities several scholarly commentators have called into question the viability of fda marketing exclusivities they have explained that the developer of nce will ordinarily be able to obtai n patent covering the produc t itself in addition the sponsor of new clinical studies may be ab to procure patent s covering any new methods of medical treatment that these studies reveal97 further marketing exclusivities most often run concurrently with but expire prior to patents covering the approved pharmaceutical as result the practical effect of these marketing exclusivities is to award

rebecca eisenberg member of the law faculty of the university of michigan observes that patent protection does better job of motiva ting the development of the initial rd that is necessary to bring new products to market then it does of motivating the development of new information about old drugs100 this situation is due to the generally limited scope of patents resulting from new clinical studies usually such patents are limited to new methods of medical trea tment that are discovered for known product and thus are commonly of diminished impact upon compe titors in comparison with that cover drug products themselves under this vi ew new clinical study exclusivities provide needed incentives for pharmaceutical firms to continue to develop new information regarding approved drugs it should be ppreciated however that new clinical study exclusivity applies only to the use of the product that was supported by the new clinical study and in par ticular not to uses of the drug that were already known and as result it may also be of less value in the marketplace than nce exclusivity101 in addition the availability of nce ex clusivity may encourage more dramatic innovation than does the patent system compounds that are similar to known pharmaceuticals may nonetheless be patented in appropria circumstances because all patented compounds are subject to th same term and sc ope of protection patented too drugs are subject to the same entitlements unde r the patent act as more dramatic advances the availability of nce exclusivity may therefore provide pharmaceutical firms with add itional incentives to engage in more ambitious research and development efforts nce exclusivity may also be justified by the additional expenses an innovative pharm aceutical firm must bear not just to identify promising new pharmaceutical but also to shepherd it through the costly and time consuming fda marke ting approval process with respect to pediatric and orphan drug exclusivity

bills the biodefense and pandemic vaccine and drug development act of 2005 s 1873 would allow specified biol ogical chemical radiological and nuclear agents as well as certain toxins to qualify as

toxins would be entitled to orphan drug exclusivity s 1873 further stipulates that the period of orphan drug exclusivity will be ten years rather than seven years with resp ect to these countermeasures existing federal legislation has employed marketing exclusivities to encourage specific forms of technologi cal innovation such as the velopment of new chemical entities and orphan drugs this option remains more attractive than an alternative possibility extending the terms of patents on particular kinds of inventions due to international agreements that restri ct the enactment of technologyspecific measures within the patent system one component of the international agreement forming the world trade organization w to is the socalled trips agreement or agreement on

stipulate marketin g exclusivity periods is controversial because the fta marketing exclusivity requirements arguably exceed those of the trips agreement some commentators belie ve that the ftas have

university of bu enos ares faculty explains the cafta central american free trad agreement denies the ri ght of developing countries to use to the fullest extent possible the flexibilities allowed by the trips agreement to protect public health125 on the other hand the trips agreement already obliges wto members to protect pharmaceutical test data against unfair commercial use126 in this light the fta marketing exclusivity provisions ma be seen as affirming and further specifying an existing obligation it should also be noted that the minimum marketing exclusivity provisions compelled by the ftas are substantially less than european standards finally any intern ational agreement involves an exchange of promises between the signatory states the partners to particular fta would appear to be best situated to determine the advantages and disadvantages of entering into that agreement for themselves concluding observations in combination patents and marketing exclusivitie s provide the fundamental framework of intellectual property incen tives for pharmaceutical innovation in the united states due to the trips agreemen ts obligation of t echnological neutrality with respect to the patent system127 marketing exclusivities provide congress with more flexible option for stimulating specific sorts of desirable private activity than do patents as such marketing exclusivities have been and likely will continue to be the most viable option for encouragin g the development of discrete classes of products regulated by the fda the potential for expanded use of marketing exclusivities in turn raises number of innovation policy issues in the united states marketing exclusivities are viewed primarily as supplementing patent protection in that they provide more limited

supplan t the primacy of the current regime of usptoprocured and judicially enforced pa tent rights with system of automatic fdaadministered marketing exclusivities presents number of tradeoffs that policy makers may wish to consider among them are the impact of the contemplated exclusivity periods upon both the incentiv for pharmaceutical innovation and the availability of medications to consumers the desirability of individualized determinations about the t echnical merits of the pha rmaceutical invention and whether the uspto or fda is the better institution for awarding proprietary rights to pharmaceutical innovators international harmonization provides nother significant issue with respect to marketing exclusivities even as some commentators have expressed concerns over the use of ftas to encourage trading partners to establish marketing exclusivities at domestic levels others observe that european levels of protection are substantially longer than their hatchwa xman analogues future dialogue may concern setting global marketing exclusivity standards in view of national goals and priorities finally policy makers may appreciate that general patent reform legislation has been the subject of significant discussion during the 109th congress129 current legislative proposals do not appear to imp act the fundamental landscape of patents and marketing
