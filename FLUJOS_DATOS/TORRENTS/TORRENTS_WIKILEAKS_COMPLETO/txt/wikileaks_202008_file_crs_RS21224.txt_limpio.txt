passed by vote of 242158 the senate did not act hr 2143 and pomeroy democratic substitute amendment hr 2143 the permanent death tax repeal act of 2001 was introduced by representative dave weldon on june 12 2001 soon after the enactment of egtrra on june 7 2001 the bill would have removed the sunset provision only with respect to title v of egtrra which contains the estate gift and generationskipping transfer tax provisions the house passed hr 2143 as the act of 2002 on june 6 2002 by vote of 256 to171 representative earl pomeroy offered an amendment in the nature of substitute to hr 2143 for the democrats hamdt 502 submitted june 6 2002 the amendment would have retained the estate tax but increased the estate tax exclusion to 3 million per decedent3 effective january 1 2003 to remain at that level4 section 2057 the special provision for qualified familyowned business interests qfobi would have terminated at the end of 2002 one year earlier than under egtrra since the 3 million exclusion available to all estates would exceed the 13 million deduction per decedent for family owned businesses the maximum estate tax rate would have remained at 50 where 3 as under current law the exclusion remains per decedent in the pomeroy conrad and dorgan proposals unlike some proposals offered in previous years these proposals did not provide that any of the exclusion amount not used by the first spouse to die could automatically be applied later to the estate of the second spouse to die however with adequate estate tax planning couple could take advantage of two exclusions as well as two qfobi deductions where applicable to familyowned business 4 under egtrra the estate tax exclusion amount is scheduled to rise from 1 million in 2002 and 2003 to 15 million in 2004 and 2005 2 million in 2007 and 2008 and 35 million in 2009 before the tax is repealed in 2010 crs4 it was in 2002 under egtrra compared with 55 under prior law but the 5 bubble surtax would have been reinstated to phase out the advantage of the graduated rates as well as the applicable credit amount for range of estate values over 10 million making the marginal tax rate 55 rather than 60 under prior law in that range the pomeroy substitute amendment would have repealed the modified carryover basis rules that egtrra implements in 2010 and instead continued the stepup in basis rules under current law5 the pomeroy amendment also included valuation rules for certain transfers of nonbusiness assets and limitation on minority discounts the amendment was defeated by vote of 197 to 231 the revenue loss estimates for hr 2143 were 92 billion for fy2002fy2007 992 billion over fy2002fy2012 and 740 billion over fy2013fy2022 for total of approximately 850 billion over fy2002fy2022 in comparison the pomeroy substitute amendment was estimated to lose 219 billion over five years 53 billion over 10 years 165 billion over the second decade and 170 billion over 20 years6 senate amendments offered to hr 8 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21224 on april 23 2002 the senate reached unanimous consent uc agreement under which it was to take up hr 8 by june 28 20027 hr 8 the death tax elimination act of 2001 was passed by the house in the first session of the 107th congress on april 4 20018 following the terms of the uc agreement the senate began consideration of hr 8 on june 11 2002 and held its votes on june12 three amendments were offered 5 the stepup in basis rule sets the basis cost of assets transferred at death to the value at the date of the decedents death the effect is to eliminate capital gains tax liability for heirs who sell an inherited asset on the increase in an assets value before the decedents death egtrras modified carryover basis limits the permitted stepup in the original adjusted basis of assets transferred at death to 15 million in the aggregate per decedent plus 3 million for assets transferred to surviving spouse 6 revenue loss estimates from the joint committee on taxation as with any of the proposals that increased the exclusion amount sooner or higher than egtrra does but continued the estate tax into 2010 and beyond the pomeroy proposal would have had larger revenue losses in the short term five years but smaller losses in the long term 10 years or periods including fy2011 and beyond 7 under the unanimous consent agreement when the bill reached the floor only four amendments to the bill would be in order all of which must pertain to the estate tax senator daschle or his designee could offer one amendment to the bill which must be the first amendment offered and two seconddegree amendments to that amendment could be offered by democratic senators after action on the two second degree amendments senator gramm could offer one amendment to the bill for each amendment there would be motion requiring 60 yea votes to waive the budget act section 311 of the congressional budget act if the budget act were waived for particular amendment it would then be debated for two hours equally divided if any of the amendments were adopted the senate would proceed to vote on final passage of the bill if none of the amendments received the 60 votes needed to waive the budget act the bill would be returned to the calendar and further consideration would occur on hr 8 only if it were later again called up for consideration 8 hr 8 would have phased out the estate gst and gift taxes over 10year period and repealed them in the 11th year many provisions of hr 8 were included in title v of egtrra pl 10716 but not repeal of the gift tax crs5 to hr 8 but none received the 60 votes needed to waive the budget point of order9 the underlying estate tax reduction and repeal bill hr 8 was returned to the senate calendar democratic substitute amendment was offered by senate budget committee chairman kent conrad samdt 3831 submitted june 11 2002 it would have kept the maximum estate tax rate at its 2002 level of 50 and provided 3 million exclusion per decedent effective in 2003 and 35 million exclusion starting in 2009 the 5 surtax would be restored on range of estate values over 10 million to phase out the advantage of the applicable credit amount as well as the graduated tax rates the conrad amendment also included section setting valuation rules for certain transfers of nonbusiness assets in conjunction with business entities and limitation on minority discounts if an individual transferee did not have control of an entity but the transferee and members of the family did have control this was identical to the section contained in the pomeroy substitute amendment in the house the conrad amendment would have kept the estate and generationskipping taxes and the stepup in basis by eliminating their repeal under egtrra it would have kept httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21224 other estate tax changes under title v of egtrra by removing the sunset provision for them but it would have kept the sunset provision for titles other than title v it would have terminated the section 2057 provision in 2003 rather than 2004 under egtrra because the exclusion amount of 3 million would already be larger than the 13 million deduction available to qualified familyowned business interests the conrad amendment was estimated to cost 126 billion in revenues over the first ten years with vote of 38 to 60 the senate failed to waive the budget point of order on the amendment senator byron dorgan offered seconddegree amendment to the democratic substitute samdt 3832 offered june 12 2002 labeled estate tax with full tax deduction for familyowned business interests senator dorgans proposal like the conrad proposal would have amended several provisions in title v of egtrra the title which deals with estate gift and generationskipping transfer taxes and removed the sunset on them but it would have left the sunset for other provisions of egtrra notably effective in 2003 the dorgan proposal would have eliminated the dollar limits on the special deduction for qualified familyowned business interests qfobi defined in section 2057 of the internal revenue code and made the deduction permanent10 starting in 2009 the dorgan proposal would have increased the applicable exclusion amount the estate tax exemption to 4 million per decedent and set it to 9 although second democratic seconddegree amendment was permitted under the uc time agreement none was offered 10 currently through 2003 the maximum amount of the deduction for qualified familyowned business interests in combination with the applicable exclusion amount available to all estates is 13 million higher than the amount available to other estates under egtrra section 2057 is scheduled to be repealed in 2004 when the applicable exclusion amount for all estates rises to 15 million thus under egtrra there would longer be preferential estate tax treatment for familyowned businesses compared with other assets after 2003 the pomeroy and conrad proposals take similar position in direct contrast the dorgan proposal would have restored preferential treatment for familyowned businesses and made the dollar amount unlimited crs6 remain there it would have retained the estate and generationskipping transfer taxes after 2009 it would have kept the stepup in basis rule for determining the basis for assets transferred at death and not introduced the modified carryover basis in 2010 it would have let the maximum rate of tax fall to 45 as scheduled under egtrra but remain there from 2007 on with repeal in 2010 it would have eliminated the further reduction of the maximum gift tax rate from 45 to 35 in 2010 with vote of 44 to 54 the senate failed to waive the budget point of order on the dorgan amendment the grammkyl amendment samdt 3833 submitted june 12 2002 was identical to hr 2143 as passed by the house it would have removed the sunset provision only on the estate tax provisions of egtrra thereby making repeal of the estate tax permanent from 2010 on the bush administration supported senate approval of the amendment the vote of 54 to 44 failed to waive the budget point of order on the grammkyl amendment falling six votes short of the 60 needed estate tax amendments offered to other bills in the senate in february and april 2002 there were several attempts in the senate to address the httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21224 estate tax through amendments to legislation on other matters an amendment to remove the sunset on the repeal of the estate tax was offered for senator jon kyl on february 5 samdt 2807 was an amendment to samdt 2721 to hr 622 the economic stimulus bill the amendment was considered by the senate on february 6 but not voted upon on february 13 2002 the senate agreed by vote of 56 to 42 to an amendment expressing the sense of the senate that the repeal of the estate tax should be made permanent by eliminating the sunset provisions applicability to the estate tax samdt 2850 was introduced by senators jon kyl and don nickles as an amendment to s 1731 the senates farm aid bill11 the amendments regarding the estate tax that were offered but not voted upon in april 2002 in relation to s 517 the energy policy bill12 were the same as those later offered to hr 8 by senator gramm and senator dorgan on the republican side senator gramms amendment to s 517 samdt 3144 offered april 18 2002 would have made repeal of the estate tax permanent by removing the sunset provision for the estate gift and generationskipping transfer tax provisions of
