the past veral election cycles these groups are subset of the political organizations that qualify for taxex empt status under sec tion 527 of the internal revenue code irc1 beginning in earnest in th late 1990s 527 groups have funded broadcast communications that discuss the position of federal candi dates on public policy issues but carefully avoid expressly advoca ting for or against candidate although these issue advocacy communications are widely viewed as intending to influence elections some argue that they are not regulated and ca nnot be constitutionally regulated by the federal election campaign act feca due to an interpretation of the supreme courts campaign finance law jurisprudence only permitting regulation of communications expressly advocating for the election or

exempt function activitie s under irc 5272 thereby permitting these groups to qualify for 527 status as result 527 groups have b een able to utilize this regulatory gap between the irc and feca while their issue advocacy and campaign activities are sufficient to qualify for 527 taxexempt tr eatment arguably they are not sufficiently electionrelated to tri gger regulation under feca3 by the 2000 election cycle as the campaign activity of 527s continued to grow they were often referred to as stealth pacs b ecause they were not reporting to the federal election commission fec and only had contact with the irs if they had to file tax return in response congress amended irc 527 in 2000 and 2002 to generally require that most 527 political organizations report in formation to the irs the

following enactment of the bipartisan campaign reform act of 2002 bcra7 which amended feca and eliminated the flow of unregulated money to political parties the prominence of 527 groups continued to incr ease as unregulated political party soft money was longer available there was greater reliance on 527 groups to help candidates compete in increasingly expensive election campaigns regulating 527

beneficial tax treatment to qualifying political organizations10 these are any organization including part committee association or fund that is organized and operated primarily to directly or indirectly accept contributions andor make expenditures for an exempt function an exempt function is the influencing or attempting to influence the selection nomination election or appointment of any individual to any federal state or local public office or office in political organization or the election of presidential or vicepresidential electors11 it is immediately apparent that the irc definition of political organization is broader than that of fecas definition of political committee because it includes organizations intending to influence state and local campaigns and nonelective offices with respect to federal election activities the two terms based purely on their statutory definitions nonetheless appear to encompass the same types of groups however there is disconnect between them that stems from the supreme courts campaign finance jurisprudence establishing the constitutional limitations on congresss ability to regulate election activity constitutional parameters12 in order to preserve fecas regulation of contributions and expenditures against invalidation for constitutional vagueness the supreme court in its 1976 landmark decision buckley v valeo construed the terms contribution and expenditure to encomp ass only funds donated for or spent for express advocacy that is voter communications using explicit phrases and words such as vote for vote against elect and defeat13 likewise the court construed the term political committee to incl ude only organizations that are under the control of candidate or the major purpose of which is the nomination or election of candidate14 in so doing the buckley court established the major purpose test which determines whether or not an organization if it raises more than 1000 in contributions or makes more than 1000 in expenditures is subject to regulation under feca as political committee15 neither feca nor the supreme court however has yet defined precisely how to ascertain the major

it applies are at the heart of debate concerning the circumstances under which nonparty orga nizations and noncandidate committees can constitutionally be considered fecaregulated political committees some observers proffer that it is relevant to examine an organizations activitie s beyond express advocacy to ascertain its major purpose while others maintain that supreme court precedent still limits feca regulation through the designa tion of political committee status to only those organizations engaging in express advocacy16 these same constitutional concerns do not ar ise under the irc in other words the express advocacy and major purpose sts developed under the supreme courts campaign finance jurisprudence do not apply in determining whether an entity is 527 political organization under the tax laws thus an exempt function does not necessarily involve exp licitly advocating for or against candidate17 fec rule and enforcement action18 in 2004 after considering but not adopting several approaches for classi fying 527 groups as political committees under feca the fec adopted regulati on relevant to political committees19 the rule provides that political groups are regulated under feca based on whether they conduct fundraising with solicitations that include appeals to support or oppose the election of federal candidate funds or anything of value coll ected as result of such solicitations are considered contribution under feca ther efore any organization with 1000 or more in such contributions is subject to feca regulation20 notably it was reported that the fec acknowledged that the new rule failed to address the ke question of if and when based on their solicitation ssages nonparty groups such as 527s are required to register with the fec as political committees21 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22895crs5 21 continued groups money politics report january 21 2005 according to the money politics article liz kurland of the fecs information divisi on stated

more fully explain the basis for its 2004 rule and the reasons it declined to revise the regulatory definition of political committee in such manner to specifically regulate 527 groups22 according to the fec 527 status is insufficient evidence alone to determine whether an organization is political committee under fe ca it found that an organizations 527 status does not necessarily satisfy feca and the supreme courts contribution expenditure and majo r purpose requirements23 in addition the fec determined that the irss requirements for granting tax exempti ons under 527 are based on different and broader set of criteria than is used by the fec in determining political committee status24 pursuant to feca and supreme court preced ent the fec stated that it will continue to determine political committee status ba sed on whether an organization received contributions or made ex penditures over 1000 in calendar year and whether the organizations major purpose was campaign ac tivity to that end the fec noted that it will consider whether any of the organizations solicitations resulted in contributions because the solicitations indicat ed that any portion of the funds received would be used to support or oppose the election of clearly identified federal candidate and will analyze whether any of the organizati ons expenditures for communications made independently of candida constituted express advo cacy under its regulations25 the fec concluded that its casebycase enfo rcement actions and guidance provided through publicly available advisory opinions and filings in civil enforcement cases constitute very effective mechanism fo r regulating organizations that should be registered as political committees under feca regardless of that organizations tax status26 in its first significant 527 enforcement action in late 2006 the fec imposed civil penalties totaling appr oximately 630000 on three 527 organiza tions that had been active during the 2004

tension this may be an area of law that is ripe for litigation summary of selected legislation in the 110th congress the 527 reform act of 2007 hr 420 and s 463 would amend feca to define political committee to include any committee club association or group of persons that has given notice to the irs of its stat us as 527 political organization exceptions would exist for organizations that are not required to give the ir s such notification ie small organizations and state and local candidate and party committees are exclusively for paying certain fficerelated expenses or expenses of qualifying newsletter funds consist solely of state or local candida tes or officeholders so long as the organization refers only to nonfedera l candidates or applicable state or local issues in all of its voter drive activities and does not refer to federal candidate or political party in any such activities or whose election or nomination activities relate exclusively to electionswhere federal candidate is on the ballot to nonfederal elections or nonelected offices or st ate or local ballot issues exception would exist for an organization that spends more than 1000 for either 1 public communications that promote support attack or oppose clearly identified federal candidate within one year of the general election in which that candidate is seeking office or 2 voter drive efforts unless the effort meets strict crite ria ensuring the group and its efforts are involved in nonfederal election activities in addition the act would establish alloca tion and funding rules for certain expenses relating to federal and nonfederal activities by political committees it expressly provides that section of the act would affect fec regulations the definition of political organization or the determination as to wh ether taxexempt irc 501c organization is political committee if an action is brought for declaratory or injunctive relief to challenge its constitutionality the act would provide for the action to be heard by three judge court convened by the us district cour t for the district of columbia with direct appeal to the us supreme court would pr ovide for expedited judicial review and would allow any member of congress to bring or intervene in such case if enacted it is likely that the constitutionality of the act will be challenged due to the fact that as result of the acts requirement that most 527s register with the fec as political committees such groups would be requi red to use only fede rally regulated hard money contributions to fund advertisements that promote or att ack federal candidates without regard to whether the communications expressly advocate election or defeat of clearly identified candidate
