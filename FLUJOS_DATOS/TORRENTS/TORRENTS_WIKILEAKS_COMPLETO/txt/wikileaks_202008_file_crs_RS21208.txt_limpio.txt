europes convention on cybercrime was opened for signature on november 23 20011 the convention is the first international treaty designed to address several categories of crimes committed via the internet and other computer networks negotiations on the convention began in 1997 following determination by the council that the transnational character of cybercrime could only be tackled at the global level since then the increase in hacking incidents the spread of destructive computer viruses and the minimal prosecution of such crimes in many states have spurred on the councils efforts the september 11 2001 terrorist attacks provided further momentum by raising the specter of cyber attacks on critical infrastructure facilities financial institutions or government systems and by highlighting the way terrorists use computers and the internet to communicate raise money recruit and spread propaganda to date the convention has been signed by 38 council of europe members and five nonmembers the united 1 the council of europe has 46 members including all 25 members of the european union and seeks to promote and protect human rights and the rule of law throughout europe congressional research service the library of congress crs2 states canada japan montenegro and south africa that also participated in the negotiations2 the conventions main goal is to establish common criminal policy to better combat computerrelated crimes worldwide through harmonizing national legislation enhancing law enforcement and judicial capabilities and improving international cooperation to these ends the convention requires signatories to define criminal offenses and sanctions under their domestic laws for four categories of computerrelated crimes fraud and forgery child pornography copyright infringements and security breaches such as hacking illegal data interception and system interferences that compromise network integrity and availability signatories must also enact laws establishing jurisdiction over such offenses committed on their territories registered ships or aircraft or by their nationals abroad establish domestic procedures for detecting investigating and prosecuting computer crimes and collecting electronic evidence of any httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21208 criminal offense such procedures include the expedited preservation of computerstored data and electronic communications traffic data system search and seizure and realtime interception of data parties to the convention must guarantee the conditions and safeguards necessary to protect human rights and the principle of proportionality establish rapid and effective system for international cooperation the convention deems cybercrimes to be extraditable offenses and permits law enforcement authorities in one country to collect computerbased evidence for those in another it also calls for establishing 24hour sevendaysaweek contact network to provide immediate assistance with crossborder investigations current status president george w bush transmitted the convention to the senate for us ratification on november 17 2003 treaty 10811 the senates committee on foreign relations held

treaties 108th congress 2nd session june 17 2004 crs3 convention on november 8 20054 the senate ratified the convention by division vote on august 3 2006 the convention will enter into force for the united states approximately three months after the instrument of ratification is deposited with the council of europe in addition to the united states 15 other states have ratified the convention to date the united states has not signed an additional hate speech protocol to the convention and the bush administration stresses that it will not do so because it views the protocol as conflicting with freedom of speech rights this additional protocol approved in november 2002 defines racist or xenophobic acts committed through computer networks as criminal offenses and prohibits distributing racist material via the internet the protocol was opened for signature in january 2003 the original draft of the convention text contained language supported by several european countries criminalizing racist websites but this provision was dropped when the united states resisted as result negotiators agreed to address computerrelated hate speech in separate protocol which the united states and others could choose not to sign to date 29 members of the council plus canada and montenegro have signed the protocol and seven signatories have ratified it the protocol entered into force on march 1 2006 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21208 possible benefits and risks convention supporters argue that it represents significant step forward in tackling cybercrime because it commits signatories to prosecute computerrelated crimes vigorously which many countries fail to do currently council of europe officials say that the convention will end cybercriminals feeling of impunity5 they claim that by mandating sanctions and making cybercrimes extraditable offenses the convention will improve deterrence and reduce the number of countries in which criminals can avoid prosecution advocates also argue that the conventions procedures for collecting evidence will assist law enforcement authorities in the fight against terrorism in general the information technology industry in the united states supports the convention viewing it as helping to raise international legal standards against cybercrime to those already in existence in the united states6 skeptics however point out that in order to serve as deterrent more states will have to sign the convention and abide by its mandates they note that states that participated in the conventions negotiations are not the problem countries in which cyber criminals operate relatively freely hackers frequently route cyber attacks through portals in yemen or north korea neither of which are part of the convention in addition some analysts criticize the convention for not permitting police authorities 4 see senate committee on foreign relations council of europe convention on cybercrime exec rept 1096 109th congress 1st session nov 8 2005 5

to computer data which they argue creates an extra time wasting step7 the convention has also come under fire from civil liberties groups concerned that it undermines individual privacy rights and expands surveillance powers too far the american civil liberties union claims that us authorities will use the convention to conduct surveillance and searches that would not be permitted under current us law others fear that the convention lacks dual criminality provision making it possible for foreign governments to request that the united states investigate crimes not considered offenses under us law the us justice department counters that it may deny any assistance to foreign government that contravenes us sovereignty security or other interests8 european critics also worry that the convention allows the transfer of personal data to countries outside europe such as the united states that they believe have less protective laws regarding the use of such information council of europe officials dismiss such fears arguing that the convention provides adequate civil liberty safeguards and limits information transfers to specific criminal investigations meanwhile some business and consumer groups are concerned that the conventions provisions could increase costs to service providers impede the development of security technologies and httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21208 sale of encryption programs and negatively affect consumer confidence in ecommerce us policy both the clinton and bush administrations worked closely with the council of europe on the convention us officials believe that it removes or minimizes the many procedural and jurisdictional obstacles that can delay or endanger international investigations and prosecutions of computerrelated crimes9 the bush administration was pleased with the conventions data preservation approach which requires the storage of specified data relevant to particular criminal investigation and already in service providers possession for limited period of time it views this provision currently lacking in many national laws as key to improving the counterterrorist capabilities of law enforcement officials worldwide10 as noted above the bush administration submitted the convention to the senate for ratification in november 2003 and the senate ratified it on august 3 2006 the united states will comply with the convention based on existing us federal law new implementing legislation will be required legal analysts say that us negotiators 7 william new privacy agenda in 2002 has international flavor national

distinction between data preservation and data retention the latter requires service providers to routinely collect and keep all or large portion of traffic the united states largely opposes broad data retention regimes but views preservation as striking good balance between the needs of law enforcement business interests and privacy rights crs5 succeeded in scrapping most objectionable provisions thereby ensuring that the convention tracks closely with existing us laws proponents assert that many of the conventions provisions reflect the spirit of some congressional actions related to cybercrime cyberterrorism and cybersecurity including the following two laws the usa patriot act pl 10756 introduced as hr 3162 by representative james sensenbrenner in october 2001 authorizes the interception of electronic communications for the collection of evidence related to terrorism computer fraud and abuse sections 201 and 202 it also clarifies the definition of protected computers and increases fines and prison terms for damage section 814 the homeland security act pl 107296 introduced as hr 5005 by representative richard armey in june 2002 directs the us sentencing commission to reevaluate federal sentencing guidelines for crimes involving computerrelated fraud and hacking offenses especially against httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21208 restricted federal government systems section
