and weapons of mass destruction suppliers summary successive us administrations ce irans 1979 islamic revolution have viewed iran as potential threat to us allies and forces in the persian gulf and in the broader middle east and have sought to limit its strategic capabilities the greater visibility of moderate elements inside iran since 1997 led the united states to seek to engage iran in formal gove rnmental dialogue but the clinton and george w bush administration did not reduce us efforts to deny iran advanced conventional arms and wea pons of mass destruction wmd technology irans moderates appear to see regional threats to iran as do irans hardliners and have made apparent effort to curb irans efforts to acquire wmd even if moderate leaders had sought to do so they have been largely outmaneuvered on defense and other issues by hardliners who still control the armed forces internal security services the judiciary and key decisionmaking bodies in the past iran has generally lacked the indigenous skills to manufacture sophisticated conventional arms or i ndependently devel op weapons of mass destruction wmd and one of irans objectives over the past decade has been to obtain the technology and skills to become sel fsufficient iran has come long way toward that objective in certain areas including ballistic missiles and chemical weapons but in the aggregate iran re mains reliant on fore ign supplie rs this dependence has given the united states so opportunity to work with potential suppliers to contain irans wmd capabilities european allies of the united states have agreed not to sell conventional wea ponry to ir an and the united states has persuaded its european llies not to sell any technol ogy that could have military applications dual use items to iranian military or security entities to try to thwart us efforts iran has cultivated close relationships with foreign suppliers that are not allied to the united states especially russia china and north korea curtailing arms and technology supp lies to iran has formed an important part of the us agenda with all three of thes countries but more pressing us objectives with each of them have sometimes hampered the us ability to dissuade them from assisting iran iran appare ntly continues to receive cr itical technology from all three but us efforts appear to be limiting their supply relationships with iran congress and successive ad ministrations have enacted several laws and executive orders many of which are similar to each other that impose sanctions on countries nd firms that sell wmd technology to iran the most r ecent measure enacted is the iran nonproliferation ac t pl 106178 signed in march 2000 the clinton administration generally preferred diplomacy and engagement with supplier states and it used the threat of sancti ons to obtain supplier cooperation the bush administration has taken mu ch the same approach although it has appeared more willing than its

some foreign assistance was able to extend the range of sovietsupplied missiles to reach tehran some 400 miles from the iraqiran bor der iraq used chemical weapons to far greater extent and to greater effect against iran than iran used chemical weapons in retaliation afte r the 1991 persian gulf war when inspections of iraqs wmd programs began iran learned ong with the rest of the world that iraq might have been within two years of achieving nuclear weapons capability capabilities and intentions perhaps fearing the dangers on its borders and judging that wmd might be the best means of ensuring its security iran has advanced virtually all of its wmd programs in recent years according to official us proliferation reports irans nuclear program was and to large extent still is rudimentary by comparison with iraqs pre gulf war program however iran is not subject to the comprehensive internationa l embargo and the intrusive weapons inspections regime that applies to iraq and iran is therefore able to procure civilian nuclear infrastructure that coul d be used in weapons program there is substantial uncertainty about irans nuclear capabilities but the consensus among us experts appears to be that iran is still about ei ght to ten years away from nuclear weapons capability although foreign help or iranian procurement abroad of fissionable materials could shorten that timetable the uncertainty increased in december 2002 when commercial imagery assessed by us experts revealed iran is building two previously unknown nuclear sites at arak nd natanz that could be useful for nuclear weapons program the natanz site might include uranium enrichment facility and the arak site appears to contain heavy water plant that could be part of plutonium production effort1 iran developed these sites by itself without outside help according to what is known from press reports irans missile capabilities have made significant strides since the first unsuccessful test of its shahab meteor 3 missile 900 mile range in july 1998 july 2000 test appears to have succeede d but september 2000 test did not iran conducted an apparently ccessful test in late may 2002 and the

in 1998 iran admitted that it had developed chemical weapons in the later stages of the 1980 1988 iraniraq war but claimed that it unilaterally terminated the chemical weapons program after that war us proliferation reports state that iran is seeking to acquire sel fsufficient chemical weapons infrastructure that it may have some capability for biological weapons deployment and th at it has stockpiled chemical weapons including blister blood and choking agents this record raises questions about irans compliance with its obligations under the chemical weapons convention cwc which iran signed on january 13 1993 and ratified on june 8 1997 however the organization for the prohibition of chemical weapons opcw charged with monitoring the conve ntion has indicated general satisfaction with irans compliance thus far opcw toured irans declared chemical sites in february 1999 and iran has ma required declarations iran is party to the 1972 biological and toxin weapons convention

expertise in order to eventually become selfsufficient howe ver iran has tried to co mpensate for its technological deficiencies through sustained and broad effort to obtain outsi assistance for its wmd efforts most us llies have refused to supply ir an with technology that can be used for wmd although since august 2000 us government nonproliferation reports have noted that iran increasingly is seeking to procure wmdcapable technology from entities in western europe2 iran has primarily approached countries and entities within those countries that are willing or able to resist or evade us

establishment remains under the control of revolutionary purists linked to irans supreme leader ali khamenei who constitutionally holds the position of commanderinchief of the armed forces the may 1997 landslide popular election of relative moderate mohammad khatemi as irans president led some observers to believe that khatemi would extend his reformist agenda into military affairs however it is not certain that khatemi wants to curb irans wmd programs even if he were to acquire add itional national security decisi onmaking authority therehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30551crs3 has been suggestion that he disagrees with other leaders on irans threat perceptions or fundamental security needs us officials have said since 2000 that there has been observable slowdown of irans wmd programs since khatemi took office moreover his political position and that of his reformist allies has weakened significantly over the past year according to observers on the other hand khatemis thus far successful efforts to end irans international isolation pend on at least the appearance of cooperation with international nonprolifer ation regimes some iranian fficials particularly those in the foreign ministry assert that irans s ecurity is better protect ed through cooperation with international nonprolifera tion regimes and diplomatic efforts to dampen regional arms races than through wmd development whatever irans motivations the international atomic energy agency iaea has said on several occasions that iran is substantially in compliance with its ob ligations under the nucl ear nonproliferation treaty the organization for the prohib ition of chemical weapons opcw has said iran has largely complied with that convention as well nonetheless irans cooperation with these regime s has not diminished us suspicions that iran is covertly circumventing or could quickly circumvent the restrictions imposed by these conventions russia iran has sought russian assistance partly because of the limited alternatives and not necessarily because of strategic or ideo logical affinity between the two countries irans relationship with russia is tempered by lingering fear of russian power

these objectives acco rding to some observers sometimes overrode calls within and outside the administration to closely link us relations with russia to the abandonment of its arms and technology

sanctions on two russian entities the scientific research and design institute of power technology nkiet and the d mendeleyev university of chemical technology when there was firm evidence that these
