state of ot lecture given on 23 may 1963 well thanks for bringing up to present time what is present time audience twentythird of may twentythird of may ad 13 the year of the ot everybody is calling it the year of the clear and we never had chance we ran over that you know well we could say that weve started the ball rolling to very marked degree in australia and california weve got things pretty well going around the world in general there are some rough spots i was presented with bunch of government type corporation data and tax structure data and so forth today and was actually trying to get some time in little bit earlier in trying to put this stuff together this is very amusing every now and then an accountant or somebody of that sort wonders why i have not paid more attention to this particular facet of our activities the only lesson i have learned is when i let the control and copyrights of dianetics and scientology get out from under it gave some very aberrated wog wonderful idea that he could knock us all off and it caused lot of trouble so thats about the only thing ive been careful of and the idea of putting together earth type corporations government type corporations you see has always been rather amusing to im afraid thats the truth of the matter and at very much earlier time in the development of dianetics and scientology i was able to look this over and realize that there wasnt any government on earth that had any right to give us license to survive they all try to assert this right dont you see and i didnt go into any vast games condition with them but it was the realization that we needed structure fitted to our needs rather than mildewed earth type corporation that made somewhat lackadaisical in breaking my neck to put together earth type corporations you see and ive now collided with the necessity of setting up better corporate structure and the earth type corporation of course must be there because of taxation because of this and because of that and so on but to expect an earth government to protect us one way or the other is laughable it isnt like setting the lion to protect the lamb im afraid that is not it you see its setting an ant you see to guard the citadel and itit justit doesntyou know its just silly so i am faced with this and quite few other problems at this particular time and with everything else you say well how could he be faced with those problems too well i manage to get faced with lot of problems i learned the other night that present time problem is only caused by not having enough time that actually blew all my present time problems it was just cognition if you want to know why youve got present time problem well you just dont have enough time do you see time factor is missing out of it so therefore its present time problem its as simple as that now very many things come up and looking over and examining the state of planets and civilizations before the helatrobus implantscall them the heaven implants public will understand it little bit better but they are the implants implanted by thiswasnt even confederacy this interplanetary nation called helatrobuslittle pipsqueak government didnt amount to very much they had gold crosses on their planes like the american red cross or something of the sort and everybody thought they were nice ineffectual people nobody could trace down who was doing all of it they had developed some technology this technology probably was not totally unknown around about the place but nobody put it together or combined it with an energy which was peculiarly commanding upon thetan now that energy was cold energy and thats probably the big mystery about ityou wonder what this energy was actually its frozen energy its based on the fact that certain energies do not thrive in subsubsubzero temperatures and this is cold energy action so therefore your pcs get very cold and get very hot and so on while running it now they were able to put significance very directly into this energy so that it tended to talk and which was an interesting electronic trick but all of that so commands your attention that you overlook another factor they had figured out above all thingsthis is fantasticsomething which looked to everyone else like natural phenomenon and i can see the learned mittype scientist now sitting around explaining the presence of radioactive clouds we call them in earths astronomy lingo magellanic cloud those exist in tremendous profusion toward the center of galaxy there are tremendous quantities of these huge radioactive clouds anybody thats ever been through planetbuilding or anything like that recognize these things its the cloud that you bung big mass into to make it fission and collect all the particles to become sun and anyway these are in enormous profusions toward the center of galaxy now when we say galaxy we mean one of those wheels which you see in the astronomy textbooks and when we say an island of galaxies or an island galaxy or so forth we mean six or eight of these wheels and theyre clustered together and this universe is composed of galaxy collection of galaxies isolated from other collections of galaxies you see theyve recently started to call these things island universes i dont know why but that fits in with earth technology on the thing well anyway one of these great spinning wheels has of course in it just literally billions of stars i dont know what the factor is i was going to say trillions dontperhaps not that highmaybe its higher and every one of these stars is capable of having planets and its greater oddity to find star without planets than it is with one the egocentric characteristic of man dictates earth as the only planet that goes around sun i consider this very very interesting but it just shows you how bad off you can get after youve been implanted anyway the system of stars in its greatest aggregate of course is visible as this thing called galaxy and youll see pictures of them in astronomy textbooks you want to get one of these kids astronomy textbooks if any of this is beyond you as an auditor you may have need of the data to know what the devil the pc is talking about not because you tell the pc but there it is and one of these great wheels tends to be rather oblong and the stars tend to be massed up toward the hub theyre not sphere theyre flat wheel theyve got hub and theyve got rim and this pattern of stars scattered in when you look up toward the milky way and when you see the whitest portion of the milky way on clear night youre looking straight at the hub of this particular galaxy and when you look in the opposite direction youre looking at scattered patterns of clof stars even though some of them are quite large and youre looking out away from the hub and doing that you recognize that earth is an awful long way from being at the center of this galaxy in fact it is classifiable as rim star now these galaxies in composition are of course great condensed radioactive cloud of some kind or another that existed at one time or another and youve got condensation and this condensation brings about sun and then because of the orbital influences of bits of matter and so forth these collect around the edges of it and are formed as planets and these planets sometimes shatter they have political accidents or something and youll get belt of asteroids and the planets vary in numbers and classified at higher level of astronomy each type of star has its own classification depending not so much on its order of magnitude although that is there too but on the brilliance per mass its the brilliance per mass of star so that you get actually coalblack stars they look coalblack you get up right close to them and you find out theyre redhot well thats been referred to as dead sun or something like this and its pretty grisly if you ever happen to not navigate correctly because they get in your road most godawfully they dont radiate enough to be detected and that moves up to your dull reds the dullred sunyou can see these things lets see where is there one around here thereswhich one is it aldebaran i think is dullred one theres one up there in taurus the constellation taurus and it is bright red and then you move up from that you get to yellow sun and that is more or less the characteristic of earths sun it istends to be more yellow than otherwise and then you move up to higher radiation factor and you get white sun and you get blue sun those are the various radiation factors your white and blue there may be interchanged but the point im making is is theres different brilliances and then theres different masses for these brilliances and all thosethese things have some relationship now you go down into the tropics in meat body youre liable to get ultraviolet poisoning because the suns rays are so directly ahead that you get too much ultraviolet well around brilliantly blue sun of course these types of rays are just pounding away all the time all the time all the time and youd fry in the type of body youre in nevertheless just because meat body is at highly critical temperature and mass levelthat is to say it can only live on planet of so much mass it can only live on planet of so much heat or cold you see is reason why life forms or bodies which have two arms and two legs and head and so forthno reason why bodies dont exist that can stand these extremes and the upshot of this is that the science fiction writer is always trying to tell you about you see the science fiction writers memory is faulty and he gets himself all restimulated and so forth and he doesnt remember straight some of them remember it quite well but then they reverse their timewe wouldnt quite know why that isand put it all into the future which i consider quite interesting they of course wouldnt know anything about the implants that turn everyall time backwards now i imagine in the days of columbus you go along the docks youd hear some old salt who has been actually outside the breakwater explaining to some young aspirant as to why columbus cannot reach the other side of the ocean and you hear tales of monsters and that sort of thingbecause you mustnt go out there you seeand the horrible monsters of the sea and they have huge tentacles and they gobble you up you see and they swallow whole ships and all of this sort of thing you would have found that very current in cadiz the port of embarkation there just before columbus sailing well its worse than that these tales were probably spread by the phoenicians who made regular voyages from the mediterranean to england to pick up tin and didnt want anybody else cutting in on their racket see and so they talked about these monsters that existed at sea and it was all terrible and you didnt dare venture out through the pillars of hercules or out of the sight of land because youd get et up well mothers have the same trouble they tell their little children if they arent good that somebody will get them or the bogyman or something like this in other words this is standard mechanism about the bogyman and the terrible beings and all of that sort of thing its standard mechanism thats used for various reasons in various places and that has existed through this universe so that most people have parked somewhere in their consciousness the idea that if they went to the planet gyppo you see that there they would find huge tubelike creatures you see that would pfssse suck you all up at gluph see andyou know bogies and the science fiction writer being the furthest from reality on the situation is liable to perpetuate the bogy faster than he perpetuates fact i should not decry him because hes done very good job but the truth of the matter is that most planets are inhabited by and lived on by and run by animal forms quite similar to earths actually they classifytheyre classified by rings so many planets out from yellow or twelfthrate sun has certain type of flora and fauna for each one of its continents you see its all classifiable but you get this modified then when you go out into the next planetary ring and you get this modified when you go into the next planetary ring you see but its more or less classified its pretty standard its what can adapt to that particular type of environment and although i dont think youd have very much pleasure out of kissing girl from jupiterthats heavygravity planet and if you stepped on the planet jupiter in one of these meat bodies that you presently have you would become pancake promptly you see and what atmosphere it has lies in seas of liquid air and so on you might say that this is somewhat rigorous as an environment not completely similar to russia but so you do get these various variations and its not all that horrifying however you find somebody running around the planet jupiter hed be built to withstand that climatic condition and that gravitic condition and so forth and his legs might be bit modified and his arms and that sort of thing but he probably would look like an eskimo the truth of the matter is then that the universe is not strange place filled full of terrifying beings of one kind or another but in actual fact is rather pleasant place except where people have been very very busy making it an unpleasant place now if you face up to what has happened to meat bodies and what has been done with this universe you could become very disheartened and you could become very caved in and you could say well this universe then is fully and completely trap until you recognize that this factor has occurred the thetan is helped all the time by mestall the time all the time all the time all the time by mest it gives him consecutive scenery gives him location these are all things which he does notis not just been overwhelmed by but things which are actually things that he likes it gives him permanent persistent structure of matter he can put up little shadow of house today or something like that and its there tomorrow you see if he forgets about it it doesnt disappear all kinds of problems that thetan had have been solved by this universe and hes on oneway help flow when he gets too far down universe helps him he doesnt help the universe somebody who is in that frame of mind you can simply ask this simple question how could you help the physical universe you get the degree it helps him makes stuck flow all right how could you help the physical universe see and hes liable to comm lag on that first answer for little while but he suddenly will come up with whole bunch of answers and hell suddenly feel better about this universe in other words if the universe is anything its too good for you and people cant stand this so they decide the mest universe is evil so every once in while youll get some bloke that decides to make it very evil place and hell get some wild weird idea of what is wrong with it what he thinks is wrong with it is inevitably that it has free beings in it he always comes to this conclusion if hes that degraded and therefore starts to get very busy to make beings unfree the net result of this is chaos the origin of the universe in the first place is probablyand this is very hypothetical even though we have found this type of thing time and time again it hasnt been too well exploredprobably was collision of home universes everybody was busy building universe and it wasnt in any time period and its collision one by one and another by another would form this big universe its probably made out of fragments of home universessome such thing well the problem of why everybody stays in present time is one of the more fantastic problems and i got short breakthrough on that not very long ago which was just this as breakthrough theres vibration response to vibration and that response to vibration is so uniform that from one end to another of this universe you have one present time i dont care if it takes you long time to reach some other galaxy its still vibrating in this exact instant or even if its light takes so long to get from it to you that cuts ice in this very split second it is vibrating at exactly the same vibration not only that this universe this galaxy you see is vibrating at but that you and your bank are vibrating at in other words your bank is bank because it has vibration of mest interesting isnt it the only variation in that vibration is time so therefore you can move somebody on his time track and you can get different sections of the vibration one time or another somebody was overwhelmed by or did lot of overts and overwhelmed others with vibration it was very minute vibration now were talking about very minute vibration not the vibration of sound thats terribly coarse or even supersonic sound or even the vibration of that were talking about the vibration of light particle were talking about the vibrations of the lring of the electron were talking about vibration now which is unimaginably far away and forgotten as far as thetan is concerned and the unison of this vibration of matter is something to which the thetan responds all of that is very hypothetical but ive been looking for things which would detach time track and this was an hypothesis i came up with which might explain the phenomenon of present time and i couldnt think of anything else that would explain the phenomenon of present time offhand now the time track itself is formed by an involuntary intention now in studying the power of an operating thetan i have had very many pauses in my thinking i knew intellectually the power of an operating thetan this i knew and have discussed it and youll find it in various books and writings and lectures and so forth about operating thetans and we all know what were talking about when we talk about operating thetan thats whats another weird thing you see something that interdefines itself but instead of just this intellectual appreciation of the data i myself have in very recent weeks have been exploring the actual potentialities of an operating thetan and i was giving demonstration the other day in the instructors meeting you take the cellophane off of packet of cigarettes and set it down all by itself and ask somebody to pick it up without denting it and dont let it dent even slightly and he actually wont be able to do it if you dont believe why make it as an experiment sometime its quite impressive you think well you can get your fingers on it and so on youll always see flutter of dent you cant handle it delicately enough to pick it up without denting it it isnt just the structure or fabric of it its the fact that if you could actually exactly measure the exact pressure to put on that cellophane packet you could pick it up without dent occurring in it and without any collapse of its wall or side thats probably the basic problem of an operating thetan and that problem itself may give him his time track this is wild bow isnt it i mean how do you make that connection of logique well its this way the power of an operating thetan is such that if he were to pick up steel cylinder capable of resisting several hundred pounds to the square inch he would have that same problem that you have with the cellophane his problem is how does he touch things without crushing them he picks up this steel cylinder and he looks at it and its got dent on both sides and you actually should practice this with some cellophanewith this cellophane cigarette wrapper to get the exact sensation of being careful that an operating thetan has in handling mest youll find it quite restimulative now in handling this then he seeks another method of handling after youve politely picked up little boys toys for him or some friends mockup to give it back to him you see and its now lying there in remarkable state of crumple you get the idea that youre quite destructive this brings about the idea of destructivity as suzie said the other day i think the reason they do this is theyre just jealous of an operating thetan people who havent that level of action then are coaxed into believing that an operating thetanor free thetan is better designation because we knew of ourselves as free thetans you see there were various kinds of thetans and free thetan was somebody who was free of body he wasnt free of organizational commitments or ethics but he was free of body he didnt require any body now this would coax them to believe that free thetan was destructive and they would then lay this into him and even trap him with the idea of making him touch something to break it up and even build something that looked strong but was fragile to convince him even further dont you see thats your first trap because it caused the free thetan to pick up new trick instead of squash things by picking them updoing things by intention now weve always thought of that as primary and it is not primary it is secondary the postulate and action through postulate is secondary to action through energy you have to be able to do both it is more natural for thetan to pick up this crayon by picking it upnot necessarily mocking beams to pick it up but by picking it up you understand just picking it up but if his idea of his own destructivity is so great he then will develop secondary means of picking it up and this secondary means of picking it up is operation by intention hell pick it up by postulate hell pick it up by intentionhe will intend it up you understand and he can do that too but it imposes great restraint on him and is in actual fact great downgrade from simply picking it up you sit over something and strain at it to make it move and this will tend to prove to you that you cant make things move anymore where as matter of fact that is quite unnatural what youre doingintending to make this move intending to make this move thats quite unnatural your actual bent is just to move it just move it do you get the difference there is world of difference and the reason one stops moving it is because hes afraid hell destroy it there wont be anything there to move except some powder so he develops this trick which we call an intention now this intention he trains to become involuntary the involuntary intention now that is very far from imaginarythe involuntary intention you have involuntary muscles which make your heart beat involuntary breathing arrangementswere used to this sort of thing now i dont know they taught in school about voluntary and involuntary meat bodies one way or the other and i used to get awfully mixed up as to which was the ones which went off by themselves and which was the ones that didnt lets just bypass the mixup and lets say that it is type of muscle which you dont have to pay any attention to to have it work or continue to work its nonintentional action you see same thing as youre saying when you say an involuntary intention you intend things get that as big difference to intend this piece of chalk to rise thetan can do it but he doesnt have to touch it and doesnt touch it he intends it and it will rise and thats very downscale thats monkey business and nonsense thats the same as putting yourself on fantastic withhold youll get that same sensation when you do this one with the cigarettepacket cellophane take it off the cigarette pack and after youve seen that you cant pick it up without making it ripple in some way or another then do the rest of the exercise and sit back and get the idea of intending it to rise and youll at once get what you once did with other things now on the involuntary intention it sounds very funny an ot answering telephone you say what would he be doing answering telephone well hed be doing everything answering telephone telephones existed before alexander graham bell oh well i dont know that thats true but anyway the telephone is actually problem to an operating thetan things are fragile they shortcircuit their lines fuse now once in while youll see this come up in coaudit it came up the other day in some coaudit some place or another ive forgotten if it was in new york or sydney but they threw the goal to forget into the co audit and one of the first reactions was somebody fused an emeter melted the lines weve had before somebody drive hole through an emeter electrode but not fuse an emeter that was the end of that so i think probably well have to put fuse well what did that that was actually some involuntary reaction on the part of that thetan was triggered here he is sitting here in meat body holding himself down and being good and somebody just suddenly triggered this see and he went psssheww see and that was the end of those leads melted yeah but you can only do that in blast furnace blast furnace we were talking about power heat were talking about thetan well unless you understand this as too great an exerted power and force within the ethical limits of the individual then you will never understand the problems an operating thetan has strong men and big people very often have these problems theyre afraid theyll hurt somebody and they always go around talking about hurting somebody and so forth you know and they pick up the little woman in their great blast of enthusiasm you know and they set her down and theyre just about to say dear i brought you box of candy to celebrate the anniversary and shes standing there with two cracked ribs you know what they never get through their thick skulls is that really she didnt object but the point im making here is thetan in dealing with himself is dealing with somebody who is stronger than the fragility with which he is surrounded and he compensates for this by reducing his power now lets talk about this telephone again how do you answer telephone as an ot well the right way to answer telephone is simply to pick it off of its cradle and put it up somewhere in your vicinity and talk into it thats very simple isnt it but supposing you get mad at somebody on the other end of the phone you go crunch and thats so much bakelite the thing either goes into fog of dust in the middle of the air or drips over the floor how about the telephone line well that fuses of course if you say into it now listen oh itsoh severed your connection that was the end of that all right now there are two solutions to this and this is the solution that the operating thetan ordinarily took and was wrong and thats to develop an involuntary intention when the telephone rings it springs into the air in his vicinity and he talks it actually will spring into the air and stay there in other words hes got an automatic action ring telephone telephone springs into the air you talk got that involuntary intention hes got postulate then which does things without his having to actively intend them theres nothing wrong with this but why an involuntary intention well thats to keep from crushing telephones and that makes it very easy to answer telephones and the telephone stands there in the air and you think this is very tricky well thats all very well thats all very well but its that same thing that gives you time track apparently theres difference between an involuntary intention to act and an involuntary intention to duplicate and an involuntary intention to create and thats probably the genus of the time track thats hypothetical the other im giving you is absolutely actual the telephone bit is the mccoy im trying to get at the basis of this time track you see to strip away the whole time track it gets into athis so you mock things up according to certain vibrations and it gets to be an automatic intention and then he doesnt know what this automatic intention is and then somebody comes along and gives him things for the automatic intention to mock up which are things that would be bad for him or they jam the machinery of his automatic intention dont you see and they make him fight his own automatic intention and the next thing you know hes got messedup time track and the next thing you know hes solid and the next thing you know he picks up meat body see how it goes but the withhold begins with the piece of cellophane steel is cellophane and the other solution that i just spoke to you about is surround yourself with things that dont go boom get the idea whats the idea of having telephone that you cant pick up that goes to powder of bakelite and fused wires every time you pick it up well the devil with it its something like youre trying to play croquet with ladys watch as mallet you wouldnt do that ordinarily youd go out and find croquet mallet well you see telephone like this that youre supposed to use all the time recognize whats happening to you and put something there that you can handlethats simple solutionand you wont be going downhill if you find yourself on big withhold all the time what are you doing youre withholding you know the basis of withholding that sets you up to all sorts of things but the main thing it sets you up to is this mechanism of automatic intention and that sets you up to an automatic time track next thing you know why somebodys running out your engrams whos putting the engrams there well you are how do you stop putting the engrams there well there isnt any way to stop putting the engrams there unless you eventually track it back to your automatic intentions and get your early track material which undoes this but youre not going to undo this time track so long as its so charged you cant come near it or run anything with reality dont you see youve fixed up your own theta trap just because youve been betrayed by theta traps all sorts of things like this occur all right now thatsthats thatso much of that but whats this got to do with this galaxy and that sort of thing well it has lot to do with this galaxy i dont think you could go into an ant house one of these anthills with human fingers and rebuild these various places where they lay their eggs and store them and i dont even think you could pick up very many ants with human fingers without crushing some well whats the idea see what are you trying to do what are you doing fooling around with an anthill thats one of the questions now these questions actually have to be answered from technical viewpoint but they have great deal to do with the organizations of scientology very great deal to do with that oaah whats this where are we going because the second we look at the character the actual true character of an operating thetan well recognize what we are dealing with here we see very clearly that all this could be veryuahupsetting in various directions i think we have some responsibility in at least heading it off in the right direction and organizing it to some degree and this is the only point of upset which i feel about this is early on conceiving that free thetans were very dangerous and should be shot down in their tracks people such as this group in helatrobus started laying in implants and picking people up and weakening people down and doing all this sort of thing and all this nonsense and worked on it very hard what industry think of what would have happened if that industry had been devoted to worthy cause and this you possibly have not run into but you will eventually before these implants planets were surrounded suddenly by radioactive cloud masses and very often long time before the planet came under attack from these implant people waves of radioactive clouds magellanic clouds black and grey would sweep over and engulf the planet and it would be living in an atmosphere of radioactivity which was highly antipathetic to the living beings bodies plants anything else that was on this planet now this period might be as longwell it could be billions certainly quite ordinarily million years before the first capture of your pc or something like that and certainly was hundred or two all of sudden these otherwise clear skies that would ordinarily have merely rain clouds in them would become radioactive and this was explained by the wise savants of the day they weresat there stroking their long useless diplomas they explained it as disintegration of the universe natural phenomena and so on how did they explain it this way well the hub of galaxy has in it great deal of radioactive material its not that it doesnt have stars and planets in it that are perfectly free from this but there just happen to be more magellanic clouds scattered around there than other places and universe has vectors of force they go out like anot really like an archimedes spiral but i dont know quite what the geometric figure is its the line that goes from center out to the rim in curve and hits the rim at an oblique youve seen some old wheelsspring wheels and so forth are made this way sometimes anyway there are lines of force in galaxy and these cookies had actually found how to detach matter along line of force and so theyd set magellanic cloud loose along one of these lines of force and it would swing out of balance and move on out and engulf system and then swinging out further would engulf another system and would spend an awful long time hanging around the system as it went by you see and frankly these clouds would get to systems which they didnt come near for maybe thousands and thousands of years they didnt direct these clouds intimately they just set them loose and they would drift out through space and these wise professors ive never trusted professor since would sit around stroking their diplomas saying well this is the natural consequences of the disintegration of galaxy certain period in the life of galaxy the magellanic radioactive masses at the interior of the hub begin to disperse themselves out toward the rim and this is known as the keplinspreplin law and the booplumbooplin law and the calculations are m to the gupgup squared or the rippetyripbop to the tenth power everybody sat around being very very amazed see the truth of the matter is somebody was letting them loose and because of that scientific theory nobody found out about it for long time that it was being done because it was incredible that anybody would do it the natural law of it was not known that you could do it and so planetary systems would become engulfed in radioactive masses gray and black and the earmarks of such planetary action was gray and blackgray towering masses of clouds these magellanic clouds would not otherwise have come anywhere near planetary system well theres such thing as the dark horse nebula in orion today you can maybe see some pictures of that in astronomy books well that is one huge radioactive black mass towering up there its oh lightyears across you see its heavy its thick well any piece of that of such mass existing at the hub any chunk of the dark horse head nebula set loose in the galaxy would spin on out and engulf systems now when system had been engulfedand they had it on their timetablethey would send ships in and they had little orangecolored bombs that would talk and speech and so forth was frozen into electronic capsules it was all very clever the utter insanity you see this makes it so incredible nobody believes it you see and that was one of their greatest protections why would anybody go to this much trouble so the clouds would talk and here youd have gray cloud going by and itd be saying hark hark hark you see watch out look out whos there whos that you know sounds like fun house or somebody would find his front yard all full of black spots that looked like rabbits and hed come within them and theyd suddenly explode and all the vegetation would start dying off around there and hed say ouugh somethings going wrong here or theyd plant something up like this theyyoud see big tangle of barbed wire on the edge of the seacoast and wrecked aircraft and pilot in doll body pinned on theta pole and hed say the poor fellow i wonder what happened to him you know and hed go over and heres this aircraft and so on he must have crashed and investigated this thingwhats wrong here see of course its just plant you walk into it and the ground all of sudden starts going crack bapgrap and saying various things well the thetan didnt know what the devil was happening for some reason or other the symbol of aircraft goes through all of thisweaves its way through this aircraft they looked like pan american planesrather stubwinged well actually that begins much earlier thats back around eightysome trillion you will find aircraft being used as part of implants because the aircraft is the translating symbol of you need machine to get you off planet or into the air you cant just levitate see anyway here you might find then that for some years or for thousands of years or for even some much greater higher figure of years that planet had been engulfed with radioactive clouds and nobody had done anything at all on that planet it went along like that for long time and then all of sudden one day there was an orange burst and it said hark hark look out watch out come here go back you know come here cant come here its always the double you know come here cant come here where we get i guess the idea of double talk and then theyd hang around now dont think that your pc as thetan was picked up the first time oh theyd try and theyd tug at him and theyd pick him up and try to pull him into the sky it was very clever they had some means of contracting beam traction beam these guys were pretty smart electronically way advanced and hed resist it but in year or two why hed ran into another one of them and again hed resist it and while later hed run into another one of them and again hed resist it and then hefinally he hasnt got his attention on it and hes already been weakened down and hes collapsed bit himself already and hes beginning to worry and the beam goes tsccup and pulls him up into the sky encloses him in capsule and there he goes one of the ways this was done small capsule evidently could be placed at will in space it shot out large bubble the being would grab at the bubble or strike at it and be sucked at once into the capsule then the capsule would be retracted into an aircraft very interesting technology all of this assaulted his credulity he couldnt understand what was happening nobody had ever seen anything like this before puzzled him and then of course theyd ship him off and anywhere between the next month or six months or something like that they would shoot him into this period of the implant area and fix him on post in big bunch of stuffprobably looked like railway sheds i havent had very good look at it myselfput him on post and wobbled him around and ran him through this implant of goals on little monowheel little monowheel pole trap and it had the effigy of body on it you see he didnt have body and was put on the pole trap the pole trap has body on it they didnt care whether somebody was used to having bodies or not used to having bodies and away hed go through this thing well hed eventually get off of it and go home and then sooner or later he was liable to have been picked up again and this time he would be found much weaker and they would throw him through now whether they could identify somebody who had been implanted once which i rather think was the case and send him through second implant series because hed had the first one or not i dont know well know when we find our first person with only the second and so far we havent we have found two and weve found four but we have not found one or three well know more about that but thats not particularly the subject of my lecture today now the helatrobus implants call them the heaven implants for the public these things were preceded then by tremendous period of unrest you could imagine what would happen on planet which has been going along its peaceful ways minding its own businessno trouble wars nothing like thatand suddenly its clouds turn into radioactive masses well maybe there wasnt great deal of trouble for while but then all of sudden youd have these orange bursts suddenly coming down out of these clouds representing god and chariots or something you know and all kinds of rumors being thrown around and talking this and that after that period the planet would be almost totally in revolt organized government was possible people were going out sacrificing themselves everybody was in terrific state of gloom or fantastic warfare they would fight anybody they laid their eyes on because they didnt know what was happening trying to hold the fort during any period such as that was well nigh impossible during those days planetary forces usually consisted of territorial or terrestrial officers terrestrial governments and galactic officers who more or less didnt interfere particularly in the terrestrial affairs but supervised its activities you had higher level of technology in other words terrific chaos terrific chaos looked like this planet during the last couple of wars during the last halfcentury you had this kind of an operating atmosphere you see madmen suddenly get up and say down with the jews you see kill all the jews and so forth and then wed have all kinds of people piled into the frontline trenches shooting at all kinds of people or something you see and mad stuff going on and troops got madder and madder and everybody got crazier and crazier and things were more and more armed and so on so it got to be usual almost that your brave boys were charging over the top just fine and they turned around to man and shot you got so you just didnt know what to do what to control anything see thats that period before the implants you had very worried thetan by that time now what were these planets like before the implant occurred and before all this nonsense took place well occasionally some eager beaver would show up and plant few theta traps various things would occur from time to time and cause an arc break and so forth actually it didnt disturb too much there have been periods of tremendous activity in the past but the time when the helatrobus implants took place were period of great tranquillity which had gone on for quite while these planets were pretty peaceful and if anybody wants to say then that free thetans are the cause of revolt upset and unrest on planethaha he had better examine the facts off the track and find out that it was only when they were threatened and made unfree that the government of planets became chaotic mess and you got such loathsome things as the government of russia or the united states as it exists today just bunch of corn these were bad boys appropriate sixteen billion dollars for the psychiatrists electric shock everybody oh they dont like us well tell them theyre insane and you know i mean just corny you know nuts that is the atmospherethat is the atmosphere of an ungovernable area thats the atmosphere of hysteria youre going to find the world going crazier and crazier in that particular direction why because radioactive fallout is adequate enough to start keying it in various other little symptoms will fly up in the air we are not looking at calm future on this planet if we werent sitting here today doing our job lord knows what would happen on this planet now i dont wish to overemphasize it because its there this planet would be billiard ball in just few years and anything left would just be madhouse but we have some responsibility in this direction ourselves what do you think thetan feels like when he suddenly finds himself freed or third free and perhaps able to operate some much and sees around him the symbols which have been carried forward on the track which destroyed his civilizations in the past now what do you think his reaction is going to be i consider this very interesting and this becomes to you and boys and girls very interesting problem because ive gotten mad few times about it myself its all right for to say well actually it isnt the kennedy government that planted the helatrobus implants and i can say this to myself you know sit there very rationally and say well they didnt do it you see and theyre just implanted too and the reason they act this way and so forth is theyre just implanted too and just implanted too why the hell do they have to carry along all of the symbols you see why do they have to act this way you see they dont have to perpetuate the misery that this created in this universe and the next thing you know im roaring mad about the whole thing you see well all youd have to do with something like that is just let go of some of your voluntary intentions you see well i can appreciate this frame of mind i can appreciate this frame of mind this planet is in sort of situation of at least for while where theyre damned if they do and damned if they dont because if we start in with our program we can do everything we possibly can to make it go smoothly now im sure that it will over any kind of an operating period of time go quite smoothly but this does not avoid period of chaos we can make that minimal and should and if we plan like mad and work like mad in that direction we will make it minimal but i dont think we can eliminate it because the chaos out of which all this travail was born was in itself too chaotic some of that will restimulate one way or the other look at it this way the planet is doomed if we dont operate so therefore we should do all we can to operate smoothly and orderly and my attention is therefore on organizational concerns which have very little to do with the legality of corporations under governments how do we move through such period oh i leave it to your imagination what might happen you remember the fisherman and the genie you know the first time they let him out he said the first man that lets out i will reward him with the riches of earth and nobody let him out for ten thousand years so in the next ten thousand years he began to nurse grouch and he says the next ten thousand years if somebody lets out i will hahahaho see and the very clever fisherman asked him to get back into the bottle but i dont think that was clever of the fisherman thetans are mad down deep theyre mad you get them halfway through one of these things youll find out theyll start getting madder and madder not more apathetic and more apathetic they philosophically have been understanding everything and theyve understood it thoroughly and so forth well as long as they have that much rage in their hearts their ability and power will of course be remarkably curtailed just by the nature of the situation that in itself is to marked degree safeguardthey who have power who can control it that stands in our stead and in our favor but if were just totally irresponsible for what we are doing and just let it happen and dont make any plans of any kind whatsoever and make organizational structures of any kind whatsoever to handle anything not hook anything up in any way but just let it happen on big broad chaos i think we will greatly have slowed down our forward progress over the thing and i think we have some responsibility for straightening that out before it happens it even answers up to the state of the universe were not even interested in that island of galaxies over there or the galaxies which are up the line next galaxy or something like that were not even interested in that well find ourselves however in almost immediate collision with the forces and powers of this galaxy this is inevitable if earth hasnt already cut her own throatshes been sending out space probes shes about ready to fire on the moon her actions are quite interesting and its only her extremely isolated position and condition and other peoples comm lags that wont do anything about this at all so theres another factor immediately interjected into the situation earth has blasted herself off into meatbody space opera nuts you know absolute nuts its impossible to make them do it you know but there she is attempting this sort of thing somebody may not appreciate this now we talk about the man from mars and that sort of thing and we say this is very farflung and this is very unreal to the people of earth as matter of fact it is so unreal to the people of earth that the last time anybody announced landing from marsorson welless broadcastthey practically tore everything to pieces in the united states well that didnt interest that didnt interest at all that they tore things up in the united states weve had lot of science fiction around and that sort of thing people could be worried theyd be hysterical and so forth what interested was that in quito ecuador that had space opera that had tradition along in this line it might not have been quito but it was one of their big cities their main radio station put on orson welless landing of the men from mars and the people rose up in the streets as spontaneous action and tore that radio station skyscraper to bits and killed seventeen people in the process bang well this answered an interesting question for these people we call the natives of earth theyre blood brothers as far as this is concerned and they know all about this otherwise they wouldnt become that hysterical so there are several factors that confront our immediate future these are political and organizational factors they have to do with facts of things as they are not as things as we would like to have them well if we handle the things as they are it may possibly come about that we can also have things as theywe would like to have them but im afraid we have to take it in that order and plan and work accordingly and if we do everything will be well of course your job at once is to make somebody clear make somebody ot of course youre trodding on my heels see this is happening fast people who couldnt handle 212 can handle this material were issuing right now oh they handle it in very knuckleheaded fashion i assure you but they are handling it therefore this process that we are using and these processes were using are far more workable theyre fast and finite and therefore with everything else i have to do ive got to look at this other side of the picture what happens next well lets hope itll be as pleasant as possible thank you audiencethank you
