gses congress responded by authorizing the treasury to provide emergency funding to either firm in 1992 congress established the office of federa l housing enterprise ov ersight ofheo an agency within the department of housing and urban development hud to oversee the financial safety and soundness of the two firms of heo is authorized to set capital requirements conduct annual riskbased examinations and generally enforce compliance with safety and soundness standards with the rapid subsequent growth of the gses and major accounting scandals at both fannie mae and freddie mac the effectiveness of current regulation has been widely questioned several legislative proposals considered in the 108 th and 109th congresses addressed gse regulatory reform but none was enacted however the adequacy of gse regulation remained prominent legislative issue although improving supervision of fannie mae and freddie mac is the major focus regulatory reform also involves the 12 federal home loan banks which comprise one collective gse the federal home loan banks lend to lenderstheir member banksprimarily for housing but also for many other purposes they will now be brought under single regulatory umbrella with fannie and freddie the housing and economic recovery act of 2008 hr 3221 pl 110289 enacted on july 30 2008 replaces ofheo with an independent agency to oversee the gses with enhanced safety and soundness disclosure and enforcement tools the new law raises the conforming loan limit which sets ceiling on the size of mortgages that the gses can buy in high cost areas to 150 of the national limit pl 110289 also establishes fund to be financed by fannie and freddie to support lowincome housing programs finally the law authorizes the treasury to buy gse securitiesdebt or equityin any amount if necessary to provide stability to financial markets prevent disruptions in the availability of mortgage credit or protect the taxpayer this emergency rescue authority expires on

profitseeking businesses whose shares are traded on the new york stock exchange their governmentsponsored nature confers certain advantages over their purely private competitors1 as result their operations have expanded rapidly over the years and they long ago assumedand continue to playcritical roles in the residential mortgage market in exchange for government sponsorship their statutory charters restrict fannie and freddie to buying holding guaranteeing packaging and selling mortgages that other firms originate and require them to meet set of housing goals whose general thrust is to promote and support home ownership among low and moderateincome families even where such activities may not be profitmaximizing congress has long been concerned that the safety and soundness of the governmentsponsored enterprises gses be maintained in order that they meet their public policy mission and not pose risks to the housing finance system or to taxpayers prior to 1992 oversight was the responsibility of the department of housing and urban develo pment hud and the federal home loan bank board in 1992 in recognition of the two gses growing importance to the mortgage market congress established the office of federal housing enterprise oversight ofheo an independent agency within hud whose exclusive mission is to oversee the financial safety and soundness of the two firms ofheo is authorized to set capital requirements conduct annual riskbased examinations and generally enforce compliance with safety and soundness standards since congress created ofheo in 1992 fannie mae and freddie macs business has continued to expand table 1 illustrates the expansion by comparing certain figures for 1992 and 2006 the principal business activity of the two firms is mortgage securitization they buy mortgage loans from the original lenders pool them and repackage them as mortgagebacked bonds which may be sold to investors or held in the gses ow n investment portfolios the two firms purchased 4427 billion in mortgage loans in 1992 and more than double that amount in 2006 as percentage of all mortgages originated however the gses share fell an indication that other financial institutions are active in the mortgage market 2 1 the most significant advantage comes from an implicit guarantee although fannie and freddie bonds are not explicitly backed by the full faith and credit of the government market participants behave as if they were believing that the treasury will never permit either firm to default the implicit guarantee allows them to borrow at lower rates than private financial institutions and to take on greater financial risk without corresponding drop in their credit ratings or rise in their cost of capital in addition their ch arters include certain tax and regulatory exemptions and line of credit with the us treasury 2 fannie and freddies market share growth is constrained by two factors they are not allowed to purchase mortgages over certain value socalled jumbo loans and they have not been the leaders in securitization of subprime mortgages the declining percentage shown in table 1 may suggest that jumbo and subprime lending grew faster than the conventional or conforming mortgage sector where they are dominant however because of the many factors in play single years figure does not necessarily indicate longterm trend

earlier figures re not available for freddie mac in terms of issues of new mortgagebacked securities mbs the figures in table 1 tell similar story the value of mbs issued by fannie and freddie in 2006 was more than double the 1992 figure but their share of all mbs issued increased much more slowly the value of all fannie and freddie mbs outstanding more than tripled over the period but the percentage of mbs outstanding accounted for by the two firms remained relatively unchanged again this suggests rapid growth in all segments of the mortgage securitization market including those where the gses are not the major players the figures in table 1 relating to purchase and securitization of mortgages and the value of mbs outstanding indicate that the gses have grown rapi dly but also suggest that most of that growth can be attributed to the general expansion of the home mortgage market the fact that large increases in the volume of business occur without correspondingly large increases in market share is evidence that there are other major players in the marketplace although these institutions generally do not compete headtohead with fannie and freddie in the same market segments the last two lines in table 1 however show change in the natu re of the gses business rather than simple increase in scale the 651 increase in the gses mortgage portfolios suggests that the gses business model has changed significantly they appear to be less focused on serving as conduit between mortgage lenders and bond investors and instead are placing more emphasis on earning interest income by holding mortgage loans and mbs in their own in vestment portfolios fannie and freddies low cost of capital derived from their gse status allows them to finance the purchase of mortgage assets by selling debt at interest rates below the yield on the acquired mortgages the difference or spread between the rates is profit as profitseeking firms the gses have an incentive to maximize the size of their portfolios table 1 illustrates the magnitude of their response to this incentive holders of mortgage loans and mortgagebacked bonds face range of financial risks like any fixedrate debt asset mortgage loses value if market interest rates rise in addition mortgage

interest rates fall because home owners have the right to prepay or refinance their loans and high interest mortgagesmost desirable from the investors point of vieware the first to be prepaid to manage these risks fannie and freddie turn to the derivatives markets where contracts may be purchased that provide insurance against or hedge the risks of unfavorable changes in interest rates table 1 shows that as their portfolios have grown the gses use of derivatives to manage risk has exploded financial management at fannie and freddie has become more complex job and safety and soundness

derivatives transactions needed to manage those risks would likely have made gse regulatory reform priority in the 110 th congress as it was in the 109th3 even if that growth had been managed smoothly but it was not serious problems with financial accounting came to light at freddie mac in 2003 then at fannie mae in 2004 both gses had to restate their earnings for several years4 pay fines totaling hundreds of millions of dollars and replace their top managers the accounting scandals revealed serious weaknesses in accounting policies and controls in essence both firms ignored generallyaccepted accounting principles gaap and chose their accounting policies to produce the financial results that management wanted particularly disturbing beyond the basic willingness to manipul ate financial results was that many of the lapses involved accounting for financial derivatives contracts upon which the gses depend to manage the financial risks they face

concerns about the future of the companies the immediate fear was that credit market participants would refuse to lend money to fannie or freddie since the gses portfolios are financed by hundreds of billions of dollars in shortterm debt which must be constantly refinanced or rolled over neither firm could survive long without access to the credit markets this is what happened to the investment bank bear stearns in march 2008 essentially nonbank run james b lockhart the director of ofheo issued statements reaffirming that the two companies were adequately capitalized although this was true in regulatory sense in economic terms both firms were extremely vulnerable to loss of market confidence treasury secretary henry m paulson jr asked congress to pass legislation that would give the

version would create the new regulator six months after enactment the senate version would create the new regulator immediately upon enactment other key differences in nongse portions of hr 3221 include the following the house version continues to permit sellerassisted downpayments on loans guaranteed by the federal housing administration fha and to allow fha to implement riskbased pricing the senate version would eliminate seller assistance and would not authorize riskbased pricing7 6 hr 3221 then called the new direction for energy independence national security and consumer

established priority for activities in areas affected by hurricanes katrina and rita and in other areas designated by the president as major disaster areas these amendments are incorporated into hr 3221 with some modifications other changes include the allocation formula in hr 1461 the enterprises were to contribute 5 of their profits to the fund and the distribution mechanismunder hr 3221 the money would be paid to the new agency which would pass it on to the states who would select the ul timate recipients under hr 1461 fannie and freddie would have controlled the funds themselves and dealt with recipients directly the senate version also provides for such fund although the amount of funds to be contributed and the allocation of funding are structured di fferently the contributions would be divided between affordable housing 65 and new community development capital magnet fund 35 initially however contributions would be used to provide contingency fund for the fha mortgage relief program created elsewhere in the bill after this is phased out 25 would continue to go to fund to hep to pay off bonds sold to finance the mortgage relief program the senate version would require fannie and freddie to contribute 42 basis points 0042 of the unpaid principal of mortgages purchased during year the house version would require fannie mae and freddie mac to contribute 12 basis points 0012 of the annual average total of mortgages retained in portfolio or sold in the secondary market whether or not the mortgages are pooled into an mbs to the new gse affordable housing fund based on 2007 the house version would have raised 592 million and the senate version would have raised 501 million for the affordable housing funds these provisions are in marked contrast to the

portfolios of mortgages and mortgagebacked securities leading some observers to describe them as the worlds largest savings and loan institutions the size of their portfolios represents concentration of mortgage market risk that led former federal reserve board chairman alan greenspan and others to urge congress to consider ways to shrink the size of the gses asset portfolios 11 supporters of portfolio limits argue that reducing the size of the portfolios would prevent financial trouble at either fannie or freddie from spilling over into the financial system at large in the 109th congress section 109 of s 190 which was marked up by the banking committee but never brought to the floor included statutory provisions that would have limited fannie and freddies ability to hold mortgage assets in portfolio the gses would have been allowed to acquire mortgages and mortgagebacked securities only for purposes of securitization with certain limited exceptions under this proposal fannie and freddies business models would have been considerably altered instead of very large investment funds they would be transformed into conduits buying mortgages from the original lenders pooling them

securities and sellin g them to bond investors this change would have greatly reduced their portfolio earnings currently one of the chief sources of their profits proponents of portfolio limits have argued that such step is needed to reduce the cost of the gse subsidy to taxpayers which takes the form not of annual appropriations but of the assumption of risk that is the potential cost to the treasury of having to bail out either fannie or freddie opponents argue that reducing the gses interest earnings would mean less support for low and moderateincome housing goals house legislation in the 109th congress did not contain portfolio limits this was one of the key disagreements between house and senate that prevented enactment of gse reform section 325 of the house version of hr 3221 repr esents compromise position the director of the new agency would be specifically directed to monitor portfolios and would have the authority to direct an enterprise to acquire or dispose of any asset without requiring formal determination that such an action was consistent with the safe and sound operation of the enterprise during committee and floor consideration of hr 1427 two amendments were adopted that appear to constrain the regulators authority to impose portfolio limits based on systemic risk concerns in the amended version the regulator is directed to establish portfolio standards by taking into consideration risks to the safety and soundness of fannie and freddie themselves but not risks to the financial system that might arise from the gses activities the senate version of the bill takes similar approach the director of the new agency is authorized to monitor the enterprises portfolios and to ensure that the holdings are backed by sufficient capital and consistent with the mission and the safe and sound operations of the enterprises thus the sharp differences between house and senate approaches in the 109th congress appear to have been bridged

called jumbo loans are less likely to be securitized than the conforming mortgages that fannie and freddie are allowed to purchase partly as result mortgage rates for nonconforming loans are slightly higher than conf orming loan rates critics of the conforming loan limit argue that the limit has disparate geographical effect in some areas of the country the limit which was 417000 for singlefamily homes in 2007 covers all but the high end of the market while in other areas such as san francisco or new york city virtually all real estate transactions take place over the limit hr 1427 the gse reform bill passed by the house on may 22 2007 would have raised the limit permanently by up to 50 in highcost housing areas allowing the gses to expand into markets now served by nongse institutions in response to turmoil in the mortgage market however the economic stimulus act of 2008 pl 110185 enacted temporary increase in the conforming loan limit for mortgages originated between july 1 2007 and december 31 2008 the limit is capped at 175 of the statutory limit or 729750 in certain highcost areas section 333 of hr 3221 house would make the temporary measure in the stimulus act permanent it would raise the conforming loan limit in metropolitan areas where the median home price exceeds the current limit in those areas the limit would be set at the median home price up
