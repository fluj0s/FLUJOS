technical cooperation of peace without justice npwj an international nonprofit organisation that supported the conceptualisation and implementation of the documentation and investigation work on the postelection violence national experts supported the analysis of the information gathered many others spent long hours filling and inputting information and data received we are grateful to them the commission appreciates the backing of many development partners who supported this work through their nairobi offices lastly we acknowledge the participation and contribution of commissioners and staff on the brink of the precipice ahuman rightsaccount of kenyas post2007 election violence embargoed bythe order of the woki commission5 executive summary terms of reference the kenya national commission on human rights knchr is kenyas national human rights institution with statutory mandates to protect and promote the human rights of all individuals living in kenya following the postelection violence in kenya after the 2007 general election we determined that it was incumbent on us the national commission to undertake an investigation on the character and scope of the human rights violations which happened during the perpetration of violence particularly in the period between december 2007 and the end of february 2008 the overall aim of the investigation was to document the postelection violence to ensure that there would be comprehensive record of the violations committed during that period as basis for enabling redress of such violations the specific aims of the investigations were threefold our first aim was to assess treatyfounded human rights obligations of kenya as state as well as the obligations of various nonstate actors whose actions or omissions contributed to the violations in this respect the investigation would identify breached obligations and recommend appropriate remedies for victims it would identify state failures in the immediate context of the violence and recommend measures to prevent future failures identify the underlying causes of the violence and recommend measures to address them and recommend accountability measures to effectively redress these violations and to deter future violations the second aim of the investigation was to analyse the criminal responsibility of alleged perpetrators within the frameworks of international criminal law and domestic criminal law to enable us make appropriate recommendations to national and international authorities including on determination of culpability and enforcement of sanctions against perpetrators third the investigation also aimed to make other general recommendations on governance issues that would for example enable kenya to undertake an effective truth justice and reconciliation process we framed this investigation in terms of section 16 of our constitutive act the knchract pursuant to this act we may investigate on our own motion or upon complaint any human rights violation _ section 16a we may recommend to parliament effective measures to promote human rights including provision of compensation to victims of violations of human rights or their families section 16d to ensure the government complies with its human rights obligations section 16f and to cooperate with various institutions for the better promotion and protection of human rights section 16g the outputs of the investigation and documentation were recommendations on accountability measures to effectively redress these violations and to deter future violations b analysis of the triggers of the postelection violence c comprehensive documentation of the events that took place and mapping of the patterns of violence wherever it occurred d names of perpetrators state and nonstate alleged to have caused the violence policy legal and other recommendations on the brink of the precipice humon rightsaccount of kenyos post200 election violence embargoed bythe order of the waki commission to undertake the investigation effectively and expeditiously we trained and then deployed teams of investigators to collect data from eight regions of kenya which were the principal theatres of the postelection violence we then used this data to prepare the findings and recommendations set out in this report these investigations continues the work of the commission in recent years to address impunity and promote political accountabily in 2005 the commission monitored the referendum on new constitution and reported on miuse of public resources in the campaigns and the use of incitement politica leaders similar findings emerged when the commisson monitored several by elections in 2006 the main thrust of the commissions involvement was based on concern towards the ethnic angle that politics in kenya took particularly after the collapse of the narc coalition in bit to expose legislators to the potential danger of negative ethnicity the commission organised visit to rwanda for number of members of parliament thereafter the commission together with other stakeholders developed draft bill on hate speech it also monitored and documented the 2007 election campaigns for incidents of hate speech and negative ethnicity in its two reports behaving badly and still behaving badly it documented and named individual politicians who were employing hate speech and questionable language in political campaigns it also documented various text messages and emails circulated prior to the elections that were based on negative ethnicity there is doubt that failure by us as kenyans to address the concerns raised by the national commission through these initiatives in part contributed to the post election violence 1 1on the brink of the precipicea human rightsaccount of kenyas post2007 election violence embargoed bythe order of the waki commission7 1 key findings findingson patterns of the postelection violence 1 the violence was widespread it erupted immediately almost within minutes after the announcement of the presidential election results on 30 december 2007 this immediacy was apparent in most of the theatres of violence nairobi rift valley coast and western regions the violence eventually impacted up to 136 constituencies in six of kenyas eight provinces 2 forcible evictions and mass displacements of people not indigenous to particular regions took place about 350000 kenyans were displaced there were multiple instances where some politicians from the kalenjin community urged their constituents to evict nonkalenjin communities from their midst some kikuyu politicians also rhetorised and sought action on the need for the community to defend itself against attacks by other communities 3 the ideology and infrastructure of the postelection violence predated the 2007 general elections the character of the postelection violence was akin to electionrelated violence which had happened during the 1992 and 1997 general elections the violence which happened during these two elections was driven by political objectives there was clear nexus between elections and commission of violence and the intention to perpetrate violence for political objectives was clearly discernible violence became strategy for remedying political and resource grievances which the electoral process might have been unable to resolve 4 there was organisation and method to the violence the attacks and counterattacks were carried out with military discipline for example attackers in the rift valley participated in oathing ceremonies and donned semblance of uniform their attacks anticipated the need to mobilise reserve forces to assist the main attackers both the attacking kalenjin forces and the counterattacking kikuyu forces were transported into areas of operation in vehicles strategy common throughout the theatres of conflict was the barricading of roads by young men intent on identifying killing or otherwise injuring travellers from nonlocal communities this pattern of behaviour was particularly notable in the rift valley nyanza western coast and central regions 5 the violence was characterised by widespread or systematic ethnicallytargeted killings of people and looting and destruction of property belonging to communities aligned with pnu by odm aligned supporters and counterattacks similarly intent on killing people and destroying property owned by odm aligned communities we found at least 1162 instances of deaths and many other instances where buildings property and homes were burnt down across the country the counterattacks organised by the kikuyu community particularly in central province and in the central rift against odmaligned communities such as the tuo luhya and kalenjin were also premeditated attackers were tooled and transported to strategic points such as nakuru and naivasha where they unleashed coordinated terror against specific communities in this instance violence became strategy for avenging the fatalities and destruction of property which pnualigned communities had sustained 6 the infrastructure of violence was financed and sustained mainly by local politicians and businesspeople to support costs such astransport of attackers weapons and other logistics 7 the violence was largely instigated by politicians throughout the campaign period and during the violence itself via the use of incitement to hatred onthe brink of the precipice ahuman rightsaccount of kenyas post2007 election violence embargoed bythe order of the waki commission8 j i l i8 sexual and genderbased violence occurred throughout the theatres of conflict in nairobis informal settlements women and children were particularly targeted for rape on account of their ethnicity although some men too were similarly raped lot of opportunistic rape happened in the camps for internally displaced persons lops 9 number of egregious or gross human rights violations were perpetrated during the post election violence key among these was the kiambaa church burning in eldoret where 35 kikuyus were killed the burning of house in naivasha where 19 individuals from the luo community were killed the forcible circumcision of luo men in naivasha and parts of central nairobi and rift valley provinces police shootings in places including kisumu and kericho and the rape of women and girls findings on the conduct of state agencies 10 the governments response to the postelection violence was slow and ineffectual the rule of law nearly collapsed in large swathes of the countryside and informal settlements in urban areas where the government acted its responses tended to be unwieldy and disjointed 11 throughout the period of the postelection violence there were multiple instances where kenyas security forces including the regular police administration police ap and general service unit gsu used excessive and lethal force in actual or apparent endeavours to quell violence multiple instances of this including in kisumu the rift valley and the coast may be cited 12 the institutional integrity of kenyas security forces was compromised in number of instances where security officers opted either to protect individuals from such officers ethnic groups or in the alternative failed to protect endangered individuals from other communities 13 at the same time some security forces on occasion showed great restraint as they sought to manage the postelection violence this was the case respecting g5u officer in nairobi who negotiated with demonstrators not to cause violence further police stations ap posts and chiefs camps were one of the first ports of call for persons fleeing the violence the kenyan army also participated in the ferrying of lopsfrom trouble spots to safer parts of the country 14 the character of the violence indicates either failure on the part of the national security intelligence service nsis to provide good intelligence or failure of the government to act on intelligence provided by the nsis the nsishas subsequenty stated that in fact it provided the government with relevant intelligence regarding the violence 15 the government provided or facilitated the provision of some although not adequate relief support to lops including food and tents it also endeavoured to put infrastructure to enable displaced children to continue schooling findings on the role of nonstate agencies 16 the media and particularly local language media influenced or facilitated the influencing of communities to hate or to be violent against other communities radio stations broadcasting in kalenjin languages as well as in the kikuyu language were culpable in this respect live phonein programmes were particularly notorious for disseminating negative ethnic stereotypes cultural chauvinism and the peddling of sheer untruths about the political situation or individual politicians on the brink of the precipicea human rightsaccount of kenyas post2007 election violence embargoed bythe order of the waki commission9 17 faithbased organisations fbos played both positive and negative roles during the post election violence the partisanship of some fbos had become apparent during the 2007 election campaigns and such organisations lost the credibility necessary for them to be impartial arbiters of the postelection violence even after the violence began some fbos simply chose to defend the positions of the ethnic communities with which they were associated at the same time however some fboswere at the heart of efforts to provide succour to the population of kenya which became internally displaced as direct consequence of the postelection violence 18 the kenya red cross and other humanitarian organisations performed in an exemplary manner to ameliorate the suffering of idps findings on the criminal culpability of alleged perpetrators 19 many acts constituting crimes under kenyan domestic law may have been committed during the postelection violence crimes at issue include murder manslaughter attempted murder conspiracy to murder grievous bodily harm robbery with violence arson malicious damage to property theft and related offences incitement to violence illegal oathing illegal possession of firearms and sexual crimes such as rape findings on whether the crime of genocide was committed 20 kenya presently exhibits characteristics which are prerequisites for the commission of the crime of genocide one such feature is the dehumanisation of community using negative labels or idioms that distinguish the target group from the rest of society communities such as the kikuyu and kisii resident in the rift valley were referred to by some kalenjin politicians as madoadoa stains before and during the postelection violence another characteristic present in kenya is the impunity subsequent to which past acts of violence in 1992 1997 and 2005 have gone unpunished consequently unless the state and kenyans take remedial measures the probability of genocide happening in kenya at some future point in time is real findings on whether crimes against humanity were committed 21 crimes against humanity as defined under international customary law took place acts such as murder deportation or forcible transfer of population and rape and other forms of sexual violence were committed further ingredients for these acts to amount to crimes against humanity are that they be systematic or widespread be in the knowledge of the victims and be pursuant to state or organisational policy we have determined that the listed acts were not performed randomly and hence they were part of policy we have been able to infer that policy from the extent to which the violence was systematic planned and organised findings in respect of kenyas human rights obligations 22 the postelection violence heralded violation of fundamental human rights such as the right to life the right not to be forcibly evicted or displaced from ones home the right to hold opinions without interference the right to participate in public affairs and to vote in periodic elections the right to property the right to education the prohibition not to engage in incitement to discrimination and the right to freedom of movement on the brink of the precipice ahuman rights account of kenyas past2007 election violence embargoed bythe order of the waki commission10 23 in view of the above at point when kenyans required the most protection the government of kenya retrogressed in the fulfilment of its obligations under various human rights conventions including the international covenant on civil and political rights iccpr the international covenant on economic social and cultural rights icescr the international convention on elimination of racial discrimination icerd convention on the rights of the child cre and convention on elimination of discrimination against women cedaw findings on governance issues 24 kenyas political leadership failed to prevail on their supporters not to perpetrate violence against other kenyans in instances where leaders intervened violence did not escalate to the levels experienced elsewhere this was the case in narok where elders prevailed on the maasai community not to involve themselves in violence and mombasa where religious leaders and the police prevailed on local youth to desist from violence recommendations i in respect of domestic criminal culpability 1 the attorney general of kenya and or the kenya police force should undertake investigations in terms of section 26 of the constitution on the list of alleged perpetrators set out in annex 1 of this report to determine their criminal culpability for human rights violations under kenyas penal law lj2 since our list of alleged perpetrators is not comprehensive the attorney general and the commissioner of police should provide concrete assurances to kenyans that postelection violations are being investigated evenhandedly across all the regions of kenya and across all ethnic communitiesj 3 the crimes allegedly committed by members of the security forces should be investigated by team of special investigators and prosecuted by special prosecutor appointed for that purpose the president should cause these two special offices to be establishedl4 the minister in the office of the president responsible for security should fulfil the pledge he made early this year that civilian board to oversee the police force would be established asa matter of urgency this board should be established without further delayj 5 the chief justice should establish administratively special courts in theatres of violence where many crimes may have been committed to expedite the determination of postelection violence related criminal casesj in respect of international criminal liability j6 the prosecutor of the iccshould open investigations on kenya to determine who bears the greatest responsibility in the commission of crimes against humanity detailed in this report jin respect of human rights violations and governance issues j7 the government should speed up the establishment of forensic laboratory to assist investigation and prosecution of sexual crimes the treasury the ministry of health the ministry of gender and the kenya police force should facilitate this on the brink of the precipicea human rightsaccount of kenyas post2007 election violence embargoed bythe order of the waki commission11 8 the government in partnership with civil society organisations should facilitate efforts to heal the country by taking deliberate steps towards enhancing coexistence community based systems should be established to spearhead reconciliation 9 parliament should enact hate speech legislation within this year the ministry of information that of justice national cohesion and constitutional affairs and the attorney general are already aware of draft legislation on hate speech which the knchrprepared last year this draft can be the basis for hate speech legislation 10 recommendations arising from the commissions established under the kenya national dialogue and reconciliation initiative including the commission of inquiry on postelection violence cipevshould be implemented expeditiously 11 the constitutional review process should be finalised axpeditiouslv as basis for enabling the resolution of the inequalities which have been such afundamental source of conflict in the country 12 the communications commission of kenya should be empowered to monitor the content of local language as well as other media 13 legislation should be passed by parliament barring from appointive or elective offices leaders who are found liable for perpetration of gross human rights violations 14 the ministry of justice national cohesion and constitutional affairs and the ministry of education should revitalise the nationbuilding project so asto enhance unity in diversity the idea that kenyas communities can live harmoniously together in one country in spite of their ethnic differences 15 more concerted and sustained program of human rights education should be undertaken by public institutions csos and fbosto enable kenyans to have better regard for humanity 16 the ministry of special programmes should effect and communicate to kenyans atimebound programme to resolve the lop question the ministry should ensure that lops are fully appraised of and actively involved in making the decisions that affect them 17 lopsshould be provided

against his main rival raila odinga of the odm even as this was happening odm supporters disputed the outcome of the presidential elections independent bodies that observed the elections including the european untonthe commonwealth observer group and the east african community reported major flaws in tallying of the presidential votes furthermore the eck chairman samuel kivuitus statements before and after the announcement of the results cast doubt on the credibility of the presidential tallies 4 following the ecks declaration of mwai kibaki as the winner of the presidential contest subsequent to which he was swiftly sworn in as president on the evening of 30 december the country descended into chaos and violence that left at least 1162 people dead and about 350000 others displaced from

bythe order of the waki commission13 justification 5 for years kenya had come to be regarded by the rest of the world as perhaps the one african country that was little different it had managed to hold regular elections since independence but matter how predetermined the outcome of many of these elections might have been violence on an unprecedented scale such asthis was never envisaged how could it have gone so wrong how could population long used to electoral malpractices now arise and reject them so violently what happened in different parts of the country and why who was responsible for the violations and what could be done to address the immediate triggers and underlying causes of the violence these are the difficult questions that the knchr postelection documentation investigations and documentation activities sought to address 6 the various acts of violence that took place in kenya immediately before and following the announcement of the disputed 2007 presidential elections results were in contravention of the constitution and kenyas international human rights obligations that require the government to protect the right to life guarantee security of persons and safeguard private property and respect of the rule of law provision of security is fundamental human rights issue and its realization is necessary for the enjoyment of practically every other right chapter 5 of the constitution of kenya among other things provides that every kenyan is entitled to the right to life liberty security of the person and protection of the law article 6 1 of the iccprwhich kenya acceded to in 1972 states that every human being has the inherent right to life which right shall be protected by law and that one shall be arbitrarily deprived of his or her life 7 kenya has signed and ratified international criminal law instruments including the international criminal law icc statute establishing the international criminal court which the country ratified in 2005 whereas the 2007 international crimes bill is yet to be debated and passed by parliament kenya would never be safe haven for would be perpetrators of gross human rights violations and international crimes as country therefore kenya has an obligation to prevent and respond to human rights violations and hold those responsible for such violations accountable 8 the knchr was established in 2003 pursuant to the knchr act which was legislated by parliament in 2002 the commission among other things advises the government on human rights compliance while also holding government accountable for its human rights obligations and nonstate actors for their duty to respect the national commission draws its mandate to investigate the postelection violence from section 16 of its constitutive act the act mandates the national commission to investigate on its own initiative or upon complaint made by any person or group of persons the violation of any human rights this was the context and framework within which the commission undertook this investigation objectives and outputs 9 the objectives of the investigations and documentation were to investigate document map and analyze the serious human rights violations that took place surrounding the elections on the brink of the precipice ahuman rights account of kenyas post2007 election violence embargoed bythe order of the waki commission b to assessthe responsibility of kenya asastate and of nonstate actors under various human rights treaties to which it is aparty with aview toward i identifying the obligations breached and recommending appropriate remedies both individual and collective for victims including civil and criminal remedies ii identifying failures of the state in the immediate context of the violence and recommending measures to prevent future failures iii identifying within human rights framework the underlying causes of the violence and recommending the implementation of measures to address them and iv recommending accountability measures to effectively redress these violations and to deter future violations c to analyse the criminal responsibility of alleged perpetrators including all those who in any way participated in these crimes within the frameworks of international criminal law and domestic criminal law with view toward making appropriate recommendations to the relevant international and kenyan authorities d to make any other relevant including political analyses whose recommendations may enable kenya to i undertake athorough truth justice and reconciliation process and iiemploy any other innovative solutions to redress these human rights violations 10 the outputs of the investigation and documentation were recommendations on accountability measures to effectively redress these violations and to deter future violations b analysis of the triggers of the postelection violence c comprehensive documentation of the events that took place and mapping of the patterns of violence wherever it occurred d names of perpetrators state and nonstate alleged to have caused the violence and policy legal and other recommendations methodology 11 between the months of february to june 2008 knchrteams comprising commissioners and staff undertook over 36 missions to more than 136 constituencies across the country and to uganda with an average duration of eight days per mission during period of four months 1102 statements recounting over 7500 episodes of violence or incitement to violence were gathered from individuals with whom interviewers spoke this information was complemented by hundreds of secondary data including media stories reports from organisations such asthe kenya red cross and internet materials among other sources that have been gathered from variety of credible sources in kenya and abroad 12 sincejanuary the knchrinvolved itself in various activities aimed at putting in place both the physical and intellectual infrastructure for the investigation and documentation of serious violations committed during the postelection violence since the end of 2007 this involved 5the human rights watch hrwthe international crisisgroup icgand ateam from the office of the high commissioner for human rights ohchrwhich have since issuedreports on kenyas postelection violence had missions lasting more than acouple of weeks on the brink of the precipice ahuman rightsaccount of kenyas postl007 election violence 15 embargoed bythe order of the waki commission great deal of planning and preparatory work particularly given that violence was ongoing at the time the investigations began in its initial stages knchrstaff undertook indepth training on all aspects of investigations and analysis with the assistance of peace without justice npwj an international nonprofit organisation with expertise in the documentation of mass violations of international law including in places like kosovo sierra leone and afghanistan this training and support was maintained throughout the duration of investigations to ensure continuous improvement and quality output team briefings and debriefings both while in the field and in the office constituted an important part of this learning 13 because of its commitment to providing this accountability service for the people of kenya the knchr prioritised these investigations within the general work plan and rearranged its offices to create focus on the documentation work this meant that all staff and commissioners replanned their work to take on investigation and documentation work as matter of prlorltv the investigations were supported by an operations centre that provided 24 hour support and assistance to investigative teams in the field ensuring their logistical and other needs were met to allow the teams to focus on the investigative work and to ensure their safety as teams returned from the field the information they had gathered was fed into professionally developed data collation and preservation system which also stored open source and other types of information and included fullysearchable and secure database it is from this database that our analysts have pieced together the full story of what happened during the postelection violence 14 dealing with the sheer amount of information gathered in the field and through open and other sources has been major challenge faced by knchr in this work managing the information required the design and implementation of an entirely new system to allow for its easy storage and retrieval in as timely manner as possible to support the investigations process and the analysis work information gathering 15 knchrteams which were carefully constituted to reflect ethnic and gender diversity in order to insulate data gathering from open bias and give protection to data collectors given the hostility that had been generated by the violence talked to victims and witnesses of the post election violence to those who may have been involved in the violence and to people who have good understanding of what happened in their areas including community and opinion leaders information was gathered from the men and women of kenya of all ethnicities and all walks of life including farmers lops pastoralists fishermen public officials security personnel the provincial administration religious and political leaders elders shop keepers students and many other people we got information from 46 senior police officers across the regions we visited 40 members of the provincial administration pcs dcs dos and chiefs 33 councillors and around 10 sitting and former members of parliamentsa key element in identifying the people with whom we spoke related to ensuring diversity of experiences opinions and backgrounds in order to enhance the participatory nature and impact of this work this in itself is an important step towards accountability for the postelection violence through engagement 6in normal circumstances investigations and documentation work of the knchrisundertaken by its staff in the complaints and investigations program 7accessrights were strictly defined and guarded by assigning passwords oncedata was entered it could not be altered this was intended to enhance the integrity of the data 8given that this was electionrelated violence the knchrsought to speakwith all members of parliament and consequently wrote aletter on april 15 2008 inviting all mpsto sharetheir understanding of what happened following the december elections onthe brink of the precipice ahuman rightsaccount of kenyas post200 election violence embargoed bythe order of the waki commission16 of the people of kenya in establishing record of what happened and recommending how it might be prevented in the future 16 the initial missions focused on collecting information from interviewees in the various lops camps while the subsequent missions focused on collecting information from those mentioned wherever this was possible as well as information from sources that could corroborate or clarify what had already been collected the broad mantra of operation was that missions would follow wherever evidence led them with view to obtaining information that would clarify whether the violence was planned and organised who the perpetrators were where the events happened how the violence happened as well as to reveal egregious incidents of human rights violations 17 at press briefing of25 january 2008 we mentioned some specific areas in kenya on which we intended to focus the investigations as areas where serious violations were alleged to have occurred namely eldoret kericho molokuresoi nyanzakisumu mombasa and other parts of the coast province as we gained better understanding of the violence we visited more places by may 2008 we had visited 136 out of the 210 constituencies in kenya as the map indicates these 136 constituencies were either directly affected by the violence or hosted those fleeing from it 18 we employed objective criteria to determine which areas to visit including the degree to which information gathered indicated high level of violations had occurred visiting people with information for example in lop camps 52 had been visited by may as well as visiting the sites of violations themselves ensuring representative geographic spread across those areas of the country that were affected by the postelection violence ensuring representative spread of alleged victims and perpetrators including both individuals and state institutions and considerations related to access and security 19 as national human rights body our statutory mandate is very specific the protection and promotion of human rights as we travelled the country to speak with people who have suffered during the postelection violence we witnessed firsthand the enormous humanitarian crisis caused by the violence we therefore made it part of our work to liaise with organisations that have the mandate to provide for humanitarian needs to ensure that the plight of people with whom we spoke was not overlooked and to help move kenya as quickly as possible towards better future for all of her people for example we were able to help orphaned children obtain placement in schools provide link between people with psychological trauma with institutions that could provide specialised and expert assistance and ensured that the humanitarian needs of people in lop camps were brought to the attention of those organisations and public bodies that specialise in meeting those needs 20 throughout the period of this work we abided by the principle of doing harm to all those who were giving us information this also entailed protecting the information itself for this reason basic protocols were developed and implemented to ensure the safety and security of our interviwees and the information they gave us 9on 2 march 2008 the knchrmet with the minister for special programmes naomi shaaban and presented

remote perpetrators overall planners financiers instigators and organisers midlevel perpetrators give and receive instructions or orders lead local implementation of plans lowlever perpetrators directly committing acts of violence 21 while the investigations focused on all these areas reaching the apex of the triangle of responsibility has been daunting challenge hardly do remote perpetrators anywhere leave visible trail information about their involvement is usually scanty and obtainable either from insiders or from confidential sources which are also difficult to identify however an important goal of our work is to ensure that violence is not rewarded if we allow the use of violence as political tool in this generation we doom future generations to repetition of the same suffering that we have undergone during and after the last elections there are many levels of responsibility from direct perpetrators through to those who planned instigated financed and directed violations as illustrated in the violations triangle above 22 we gathered information about those who may be responsible for violations at all levels of the triangle as human rights institution committed to protecting the human rights of all people including those accused of the most serious violations of human rights we undertook the analysis of the information with due regard to kenyan criminal law and international law as such in addition to identifying violations committed during the postelection phase the ensuing report on the results of these investigations names only those individuals and institutions about whom there is threshold of credible and reliable information pointing to their potential responsibility this threshold was constructed around the following criteria i level of information and detail describing the role the alleged person may have played ii existence of corroboratingverifying information on the person including confessions iii believability and credibility of the allegations iv subjectingl heard type of allegations to criteria in b and c above before admission v consideration of the totality of information available including that obtained

name should be included or not based on any or all of the above criteria onthe brink of the precipice ahuman rightsaccount of kenyas post2007 election violence embargoed bythe order of the woki commission18 the analysis 23 having gathered as much credible and reliable information as possible reflecting the diverse makeup of kenyan society we moved into the second phase of our investigation and documentation work analysis of the information we had gathered by comparing incidents of violence across time and across space and undertaking any followup investigations determined as necessary to give comprehensive picture of important incidents 24 consequently nine teams were constituted by staff and commissioners who had been involved in investigations in those particular regions to begin interacting with the information in the data base each regional team produced zero draft report that was subjected to an initial peer review this zero draft was then given to newly constituted teams composed of staff commissioners and an external national expert most of who were interacting with such reports for the first time this was meant to give fresh and critical relook at the story that had been pieced together from each of the regions in keeping with the principle of confidentiality that this investigation had adopted all people working on the data had to sign confidentiality statements the report analysis covered the following regions central province coast nairobi north rift valley south rift valley central rift valley nyanza and western 25 these teams examined the information at hand to determine the extent to which the violence may have been committed pursuant to policy to commit systematic attacks against civilian population and to what extent they were ordered directed or coordinated by persons or groups of persons acting with common purpose this analysis also examined the extent to which the state itself may have been complicit either by way of commission of omission the teams also provided list of names of perpetrators who in their view met the threshold of acceptable responsibility using the provided criteria and the domestic and international legal frameworks 26 further smaller team was constituted to condense the various reports into one coherent whole this team drew from commissioners and the national experts finally the report was submitted to the commission for adoption as knchrreport 27 the ensuing report isthe end product of this process which details what happened during the postelection violence and proffers an explanation and credible information on those who may have been responsible for the commission of serious violations of human rights as defined by kenyan penal law and international criminal law overcoming challenges 28 we faced several challenges undertaking investigations in situation of ongoing violence of different levels of intensity in different parts of the country in an environment of general fear and interethnic suspicion such challenges were managed through ensuring strict yet flexible security protocols were in place to protect both the people with whom we spoke and our staff and through the development of set of frequently asked questions which enabled us to answer the many questions that people had about our work and its purpose 29 another big challenge was collecting information from those who had been mentioned adversely one the time lapse between the occurrence of the violence and the field missions made it difficult to trace affected persons who could give valuable information two there were instances of outright hostility and refusal to cooperate with our interviewers while in other cases it was not always possible to trace those who may have had corroborating information three information about those who may have borne the greatest responsibility as reflected in on the brink of the precipice ahumon rightsaccount of kenyas post2007 election violence embargoed bythe order of the waki commission19 the triangle of responsibility proved difficult to gather unlike conventional investigation that sets out to collect evidence in the case of knchrthe investigation was human rights one that collected information with view to recommending to the relevant authorities further investigation given the preponderance of the information the national commission provided this exercise was further complicated by the fact that communities felt obliged to protect their own while also engaging in revisionism the investigation has taken note of this and has recommended further investigation in cases where we have identified inadequacy of information 30 be that as it may the national commission took all precautions to ensure that the report presented to kenyans would be credible and had been meticulously and analysed on the brink of the precipice ahuman rights account af kenyas post2007 election violence embargoed bythe order of the waki commission chapter two triggers fuelers and root causes of postelection violence an overview 31 in looking at the immediate causes of the violence that engulfed parts of kenya we identify three analytical although not mutually exclusive categories these are triggers fuelers and root causes of violence to fully appreciate kenyas 2007crisis it is important to understand the countrys political history but also the unique and distinctive features of the 2007general elections though these too draw their roots in this political history this section looks at these two symbiotic aspects of kenya but only in so far as they can be said to put the 2007post election violence in perspective 32the2007general elections returned historic best in terms of registration of voters 142 million or 82 of the total eligible voters and an overall voter turnout of 72 it also attracted 2547candidates for the 210parliamentary seats and nine presidential candidates it was also historical in that it turned out to be one in which the incumbent unlike any incumbent before faced real and serious chellenge this meant that on its own this election generated immense interest would mwai kibaki decide to remain the mp for othaya were he to lose the presidency and how would his backbencher and former president status be managed at the same time supposing raila odinga was elected president but failed to win the langata parliamentary seat it was an election therefore that had unique dynamics and one characterised by unprecedented political mobilisation however hardly anyone anticipated that among such dynamics would be the generation of real civil war dvnarnlc that saw heightened interethnic animosity that threatened to tear apart not just security agencies but also religious and other social institutions first the history latent tensions root causes and underlying issues 33 there is agreement among most analysts that the violence that swept through kenya following the disputed december 2007elections was

management of the elections and other events surrounding the process were the triggers for the violence years and even decades of wrong policies and failed policy implementation had already prepared the ground for the postelection violence as nic cheeseman has noted the media hyperboles of the violence aside the events of the december 2007 elections and the postelection violence have many continuities with kenyas recent past broad national level sociopolitical and economic dynamics as well as localised statesociety and community contexts interacted to generate the conditions germane to the crisis historical injustices and landgrievances 3s scholars and commentators on kenyas politics and postelection violence have pointed to unresolved historical grievances especially with regard to land allocation as an important underlying factor in the violence15the colonial government alienated most of the agriculturally productive land for settler agriculture particularly in what is present day rift valley province and central province this alienation generated large number of squatters especially among the kikuyu at independence the kenyatta government created land market of willing seller willing buyer with many of the landless being encouraged to join landbuying companies rift valley province was earmarked for settlement of the landless through this scheme however land did not necessarily revert to those who had lost it through colonlallsmt the resettlement scheme was also riddled with corruption with senior individuals in the kenyatta government allocating themselves large tracts of land over the years asthe population of the kalenjin who view rift valley as their ancestral home increased the perception also grew that the post colonial land policies had disadvantaged the community these grievances featured prominently in the 1990s violence as well as the 2002 elections that saw the election of president mwai kibaki and the national rainbow coalition narc government 36 the failure of the kibaki government to address the land question meant that yet again in 2007 the unresolved land question was an election agenda especially for the opposition odm 2004 commission of inquiry on irregular allocations of public land ndungu commission appointed by the narc government of president mwai kibaki detailed the corruption in land allocation however even after the report was handed to the president the government failed to act on it dampening public hopes for land reforms 37 another important underlying factor in the violence is the widespread poverty and radical inequality the kibaki government managed to resuscitate the economy that had been ailing under the moi government to record respectable 6 to 7 percent growth by 2007 however the benefits of this economic growth did not translate into improved real incomes especially for those kenyans living in extreme poverty in urban slums at the same time public perceptions that the political leaders were much more interested in their own personal welfare and the pursuit of lavish lifestyles cemented the view that the government was out of touch with the economic reality of the most vulnerable the opposition odm ran an effective campaign painting the kibaki government as removed from the daily realities of the poor kenyans the fact that members of parliament from across the political divide had in reality voted large benefits for themselves appeared lost in the heat of political campaigns 14nic cheeseman the kenya elections of 2007 an introduction journal of eastern african studies vol 2 no2

l n r r r r r r r r r rrr t38 to many of the poor kenyans who had invested hopes for better future in the narc government of 2002 this represented the betrayal of those hopes consequently the odm message of itself as the savoir from the corruption of the kibaki government resonated with many of the poor the complicity of odm members in the profligate spending of public resources notwithstanding in the battle of perceptions the kibaki government had lost ethnic politics and zerosum games 39 underlying the polarisation in kenyan politics are the modes of political organisation in kenya while it is important to recognise some limited shifts in trends ethnicbased political organisation has bedeviled kenyan politics since colonial times it will be remembered that for long time colonial authorities did not allow for nationalist parties but encouraged ethnic based associations by africans one of the underpinning differences between the two independence period political parties kenya african national union kanu and the kenya african democratic union kadu was the fear by kadu that the large ethnic groups that supported kanu would trample over the interests of the smaller groups after independence the ability to mobilise ethnic constituencies continued to be important to politicians seeking the countrys leadership when constitutional changes allowed for multiparty politics in the 1990s the ethnicisation of politics gained an even sharper edge all the political parties formed after the reintroduction of multiparty politics have drawn their core support from the ethnic kin of their top leadership kenyas political system that allows for an overwhelmingly powerful presidency contributed to the reduction of political competition into an ethnic zerosum game until the postelection constitutional amendment providing for prime minister in the past winning the kenyan presidency has meant taking it all moreover the clientilist nature of politics meant that many kenyans have come to view the ascendancy of one of their own ethnic kin to the presidency as the best assurance of benefiting asindividuals and ascommunities contending citizenship narratives 40 related to the politics of ethnic mobilisation and the clientilism isthe question of citizenship rights and practical implications of the of the outsider and indigenous discourses in the multiethnic parts of the country whereas the kenyan constitution recognises the rights of every citizen to live and own property anywhere in the country it coexists with the socio political reality that membership to an ethnic community grants access to certain rights particularly with regard to land ownership as mahmood mamdani has argued while the post independence african state deracialised the sphere of civic rights ethnic citizenshipand more specifically clan membership remained the only means the poor people could access land 41 where civic rights have opened the doors for acquisition of land they have often come into collision with the rights granted by ethnic citizenship this is what frames the discourses of the foreignerindigenous outsiderindigenous in places like the rift valley and the coast provinces even where the foreigneroutsider might be allowed to continue holding the land they might have purchased indigenous sentiments have been strongly opposed to any attempts by the foreigneroutsider to seek political leadership 18the most damaging of the corruption allegations was the angloleasing scandal which implicated senior ministers in the kibaki government and which became public in 2004 the scandal had its origins in the previous government of president danielarap moi 19see mahmood mamdani citisen and subject contemporary africa and the legacy of late

valley for instance the failure by the kikuyu kisii luo luhya and other foreigneroutsider communities to support then president daniel arap moi in the 1990s were perceived as an abuse of the generosity of the host kalenjin community in 20072008 it is the groups that were perceived as having gone against the political grain of support to the odm that were the target of political violence and yet again they were in the rift valley and coast provinces retaliatory violence in central province on the other hand targeted members of ethnic groups seen as odm supporters and aggressors against the kikuyu the long train of violence and impunity 43 to understand the postelection violence of 20072008 it is equally important to cast an analytical eye on kenyas past of electionrelated violence it is correct to argue that what was new about the post2007 elections was the magnitude and level otherwise kenya has long history of the deployment of political violence during the election periods in particular political violence is not new to the rift valley province which was one of the epicentres of the most recent violence 44 following the clamor for the restoration of multiparty politics in early 1990s violence broke out in the rift valley province targeting the luo kikuyu luhyia and kisii communities perceived as opposition supporters rift valley is predominantly home to the kalenjin and maasai communities whose members in the 1990s supported then president daniel arap mol the violence was preceded by threats by politicians allied to then president moi that members of communities seen as sympathetic to multiparty politics would be expelled from the province if the agitation for reforms did not stop 45 the violence that began in 1991 left an estimated 1500 kenyans dead and about 300000 internally displaced by the time it abated in 199421the violence recurred in smaller dimensions during and after the 1997 elections this time spreading to the coast province 22as in the rift valley the 1997 coast province violence targeted members of ethnic communities perceived to be hostile to president moi and his ruling party kanu 46 1992 parliamentary select committee kiliku committee concluded that the violence in the rift valley had been planned and instigated by senior politicians in the government of president moi23a judicial commission of inquiry akiwumi commission in its report of 1999 similarly concluded that the violence was the work of senior pohtlctans other inquiries by civil society groups had reached similar conclusion nevertheless one was

political violence the violence of the 1990s also laid in place the infrastructure of violence in many parts of the rift valley the moi government had explained away the 1990s violence as ordinary insecurity subsuming ordinary crime into political violence over the years this ordinary insecurity cover has allowed violence to emerge out of the infrastructure to become almost regular feature of daily life in certain parts of rift valley and western provinces as nic cheeseman has noted three months before the december 2007 elections about 600 people had already been killed in this kind of violence 2s 48 well before the december 2007 elections violence was already raging in kuresoi constituency of molo district indeed the electoral commission had to move polling stations to the camps hosting internally displaced persons from kuresoi 26in western province mt elgonwas already engulfed in violence with an outlawed group the sabaot land defence force sldf staging attacks on members of the local population perceived as hostile to their cause as in kuresoi and in the violence of the 1990s in the rift valley and the coast provinces the violence in mt elgon was wrapped up in the politics over land and electoral demographlcs 49 moreover in the capital nairobi as well as in neighbouring central province since 2006 the outlawed mungiki group had been engaged in violent killings that seriously challenged the states assumed monopoly over violence29as in the case of the other organised gangs there was evidence that politics was wrapped up in the activities of the group 50 as in the 1990s the government in the 2000s appeared reluctant or uninterested in decisively dealing with the problem of political violence the lackadaisical response of the kibaki government to the violence in kuresoi and mt elgon for instance was the subject of constant criticism by human rights groups and lnstttutlons collapse of the narc coalition and stalled constitutional reforms 51 at the national level the unfinished constitution reform in significant way underlies the events leading to the postelection violence one of the recurring reform agenda items going back to the prodemocracy movements of the 1990s is the need for comprehensive reform of the kenyan constitution to ensure balance between the various arms of the government the narcgovernment led by president mwai kibaki was elected in 2002 on the wave of the promise of comprehensive reforms priority among these was the constitutional reform that had over the years become the assumed panacea to the countrys problems however problems with the narc coalition began with allegations by the liberal democratic party group of the coalition that president kibaki had failed to honour memorandum of understanding the party had signed with kibakis national alliance of kenya before the 2002 elections 52 when the narc coalition effectively collapsed in 2005 constitutional reforms was one of the casualties the defeat of the kibakisupported draft constitution in the 2005 referendum effectively stalled any further attempts to radically reform the state with the kibaki government fighting for political survival and the odm of raila odinga focused on capturing political power 2scheeseman the kenya elections of 2007 2008167 26see peacenet kenya elections watch kenya 2007 issue no4 novemberdecember 2007 at httppeacei

also set the stage for the kind of ethnic polarization that was to characterise the 2007 campaigns in asense therefore the seeds for the ethnic stereotyping and mobilisation that gave birth to postelection violence were sown way back in 2005 electoral commission and administration of elections 53 whereas in december 2007 kenyans were holding the fourth multiparty elections it is important to remember that historically the administration and management of elections had never been seen as independent of political interference since the kenyatta presidency the executive has always found the means for fixing the electoral machine to the benefit of preferred candidates the most notorious instance of interference with the electoral process was the 1988 general elections where many losing candidates were declared winners the then sole ruling party kanu had already secured the monopoly for political power through constitutional amendment in 1982 that made it the sole political party 54 electoral fraud did not end with the restoration of multiparty politics in 1991 the 1992 multiparty general elections were also riddled with irregularities with some opposition candidates even being physically prevented from presenting their nomination papers the incumbent then president daniel arap moi enjoyed an unfair advantage over the opposition candidates where the opposition could not campaign freely all over the country president moi traversed the country using government resources moreover he enjoyed monopoly of media coverage from the official broadcaster the kenya broadcasting corporation kbc in addition the electoral commission was made up of presidential appointees whose loyalty to the incumbent was never in doubt 55 the reform of the electoral environment was to become acentral plank in the platform of the reforms movement of the 1990s in response to both domestic and international pressure an interparties parliamentary group ippgjwas convened in 1997 bringing together the opposition and the government to negotiate and recommend on some of the minimum reforms to be enacted before the 1997 general elections among other proposals the ippg reforms recommended the involvement of the opposition in the nomination of commissioners to the electoral commission while the electoral environment was not even in the 1997 general elections it is generally agreed that this measure lent the electoral commission measure of public confidence 56 the electoral commission was to generally acquit itself well in the 2002 general elections that saw the retirement of president moi and the defeat of his ruling party candidate uhuru kenyatta by coalition of opposition parties in 2005 yet again the electoral commissions supervision of the referendum on the proposed constitution in which the government sponsored draft was defeated further solidified its reputation as credible and independent electoral referee in kenya 57 however in the runup to the 2007 general elections the opposition and other observers began questioning the independence of the electoral commission after president kibaki ignored the 1997 ippgagreement and named new commissioners without consulting the opposition it did not help that some of the newly appointed commissioners were perceived asfriendly to the government of president kibakj33 the fact that the president did not renew the tenure of 32on the 1992 general elections see the multi party general elections in kenya the report 01the national election manitoring unit nemu nairobi 1993 33the standard

november barely month before the december general elections further heightened the perception among the opposition and other observers that the government was planning to manipulate the elections these controversies so close to the elections took heavy toll on the credibility of the commission therefore even well before the elections the events surrounding the appointments to the electoral commission had already sowed the seeds of suspicion among the opposition and the public over the conduct of the elections consequently it was clear if not to the electoral commission to the watchers of kenyan politics that anything less than whistleclean management of the elections by the electoral commission would provoke strong challenges crisis of confidence in the judiciary 58 when the dispute over the elections erupted the odm leadership was categorical that it would not petition the matter in the courts in odms view the judiciary was not independent and would very likely do the bidding of the incumbent critics have however noted that the odm was ready to use the judiciary to petition parliamentary results and have criticised this carte approach by the odm as subversive to the rule of law34whatever the view may be on the odm approach however there is little doubt that kenyas history of judicial subservience to the executive and inefficiency precluded strong pitch on behalf of its independence the kenyan judiciary was complicit in the execution of the single party repression of the 1980s and many other acts of the denial of human rights in the 1990s moreover there is shortage of examples of the executives incursions into judicial independence in 1993 and 1994 two high court judges on contract justice edward torgbor and justice j couldrey who ruled that petition against the election of president moi had been properly filed had their contracts terrnlnated 59 while the kibaki government was not known for directing judges on how to rule on specific cases the suspicion that the judiciary was stacked with judges sympathetic to the government persisted there have also been allegations that some judges viewed as prokibaki in their decisions have remained in key positions for an inordinately long period of time in manner reminiscent of the moi era permanent duty judges moreover owing to the inefficiency in the judiciary election petitions in kenya are sometimes determined well after the end of the five years electoral terms for mps when the odm announced that it could not trust the courts to render justice in its course therefore it was striking chord of long history of public skepticism on judicial independence and efficiency 60 those were the background conditions to the postelection violence to the cocktail of historical tensions and root causes the divisive campaigns added the fuel which the events of the actual elections and its management triggered into the tragic violence in december 2007 34seefor instance africa policy institute

election violence 27 embargoed bythe order of the woki commission divisive campaigns fuelling divisions and triggering events 61 tensions that had started building up during the campaigns were heightened on the polling day with rumours that marked ballots had been discovered in an office building in nairobi the temperatures soared further when the odm presidential candidate raila odinga could not initially find his name in the voters register of his old kibera primary school in langata constituency 38in an interview on ktnodinga described the omission as itadeliberate attempt to rig out of langata constituency though the matter was resolved and odingas name found in register in different room the fears that the elections would be rigged were now fully revived while the actual voting was largely incident free the tensions were to heighten again with the delay in the tallying and announcement of presidential election results in the next two days as the country waited for the results eckchairman samuel kivuitus statements that he could not reach some of his returning officers and his speculation that that they probably were cooking results irreparably damaged any confidence left in those who feared rigging may have taken place 62 the tension that was building was further fueled by the onair pronouncements of leaders disputing the results coming in from the constituencies fanned by the live broadcast of exchanges between leaders of the two leading political parties odm and pnu and finally sparked off by the announcement on the evening of december 30 that mwai kibaki had won the 2007 election this tension was not eased by the manner in which the presidential result was declared on the state broadcaster kbc alone immediately after live pictures of the eck commissioners filing out of the kenyatta international conference centre under tight security and the swearing in of the president few minutes after that few hours after that in televised press conference the odm leadership rejected the results and promised the country that they were poised to form parallel government and install raila odinga as the peoples president the message from the leadership in nairobi hardly gave confidence to their supporters that the country was one 63 in the buildup to the elections the environment had been such that strong divisions had emerged between the supporters of odm and pnu and to lesser extent those of odmk parties ran campaigns that were heavy with grievancevictimhood nuances which exacerbated the feeling of us and them just asthey were laden with emotionalism and subjectivity which left little room for moderate positioning of either individuals or institutions president kibakis pnu was cast as party of old men clinging onto power with the support of mt kenya and therefore monoethnic party while odm was presented as the broadbased party for progressive change the wedge issues of religion and majimbo added to the polarisation with antimajimbo sounding comments by john cardinal njue of the catholic church leaving the impression that that church supported pnu similarly the decision by the odm to enter into memorandum of understanding mou with national muslim leaders forum namlef thrust religion into the centre stage of politics fake mou between muslims and raila was widely circulated in press reports and on the internet leading some christians to lose faith in him the close cooperation between the kibaki government and the united states in counterterrorism initiatives had increasingly alienated considerable population of the kenyan muslims from his government on the other hand since the 2005 referendum the catholic church was seen as allied to kibaki thus the divisive campaigns polarised the nation and the institutions expected to provide leadership did not present themselves asimpartial entities 38the campaigns were themselves tense with repeated allegations of rigging during the campaigns there had been rumours that raila odinga would be rigged out of his langata seat to disqualify him as candidate for the presidential race 39this was communicated in december 30 messageread by william ntimama at orange house odms headquarters on the brink of the precipice ahuman rightsaccount of kenyas post2007 election violence embargoed bythe order of the waki commission j j j64 few months to the elections odm decided to include majimbo in its campaign platform at independence majimbo was response to the fears for ethnic domination of the small ethnic groups by big groups with the kenya african national union kanu drawing its support from the populous kikuyu and the luo the kenya african democratic union kadu sought to rally smaller ethnic groups the kalenjin luhyia maasai and coastal communities around version of federalism majimbo that gave measure of autonomy to ethnic regions in the 1990s calls formajimbo had prefaced political violence in the rift valley province as human rights watch has noted in its report on the kenyan violence highranking politicians at the time many of whom are still active in politics in 2008 made inflammatory speeches in support of this chauvinistic interpretation of majimbo that led to ethnicallybased vtolence consequently calls formajimbo in an already polarised context added to the tensions 65 framing by politicians and media analysts on what the key election issues were also played role in animating dangerous divisiveness for example the 2003 sacking from government positions of some public officers from the kalenjin community for alleged misdeeds during the president mois government was reinterpreted as one of the measures the kikuyu dominated government had undertaken to punish the kalenjin the media particularly suffered intentionally and sometimes inadvertently from biases of commission and omission that ended up creating sense of inevitability of defeat andor victory for their unfavouredfavoured political parties street wisdom had it that the standard was rooting for odm while nation group was for pnu 66 of particular concern were however the ethnicised campaigns that the

agenda increasingly it became easy to establish the political positions of analysts and commentators merely by reference to their ethnicity 67 while kenyas voting patterns especially since 1992 have demonstrated that ethnicity is an important predictor of electoral outcomes ethnicity is hardly ever cause of conflict but rather way in which people in conflict label their grievances target the

kenyan media are reputed asthe most sophisticated in the region and have over the past 10 years grown tremendously in terms of ownership diversity and coverage the media have over the years played critically important role in the democratisation process especially in relation to exposing corruption and checking government excesses as well as providing useful platform for opposition and civil society organisations csos moreover the growth of local language fm stations has in the past five years availed to ordinary kenyans extraordinary platforms through which to air all manner of views some of these platforms especially live talk shows and callin programs have since the watershed 2005 constitutional referendum campaigns been associated with spreading dangerous propaganda and hate

solicited sms blogs emails newsletters leaflets not to mention the newspapers tvs and radios sources one scholar has described the 2007 general elections as an election that was characterised by mtstntorrnatton in closely contested election such as this one was the large media outlets became contested spaces by the leading parties and in some cases it became difficult to differentiate between particular media houses position and that of the party politicians or its chosen political analysts and commentators commenting on the conduct of the media during the 2007 elections an analyst of the kenyan media has concluded that ita lot of cooption happened 70 while it would be an oversimplification of issues to appear to blame the media for fanning the fires the uncritical reproduction of careless statements by politicians may have contributed to reinforcing perceptions of political problems as community problems since the 2005 referendum and particularly by election time the imagery and idioms being used by politicians in the campaigns did not merely ridicule their opponents but were aimed at entire ethnic groups for example kikuyus who circumcise their male children profiled raila odinga and the luo community who do not circumcise as unfit for leadership and odm aligned communities such as the luo and kalenjin projected the kikuyu as assuming always the right to lead the country as well as being arrogant grabbers and corrupt while the media on some occasions criticised negative ethnicity in its editorials in its newsgathering and in its programming it failed to aggressively hold political leaders to account for their actions and utterances instead in the closing days of the election the media covered the goingson as they would an electrifying football match

too close to call by the most respectable of the poll houses steadman associates helped animate determination by voters that saw unprecedented turnout throughout the largely peaceful polling day on december 27 barely after few polling stations completed their count in disparate constituencies tv and radio stations began reporting who was leading with only 10 of the vote in as such an imperfect picture was kept alive anchors did not accompany their tallies with for example background information such as number of registered voters in the constituencies whose results had not come in or historical voter turnout trends in those areas to help viewers and listeners make informed interpretations of what the results meant when some stations hosted analysts who on the morning of december 29 were talking of an invincible lead for odms presidential candidate raila odinga several constituencies in kibakis strongholds had still not filed in their results when those figures began coming in and kibaki figures started steady climb and closein on raila and the pnu side became bullish tension began to build amongst odm supporters and leadership live coverage of the exchanges between the leadership of pnu and odm on the night of december 29 set the country on the delicate path it had to walk in the months ahead conclusion 72 from the foregoing it is evident that kenyas postelection violence had historical preface that fed into the more immediate events and issues underlying causes gave the political manipulation of grievances scapegoating of communities and appeals to ethnic chauvinism resonance with the populace in an election year the ideological infrastructure was already in place and only needed refurbishment to fit the conditions of 2007 it is instructive that the polarized trends that characterised the 2005 constitutional referendum were not addressed steps were taken to heal the country and so kenyans went into the 2007 elections in the exact same mode of referendum similarly the physical infrastructure for the violence was already in place in areas such as the rift valley where violence had remained intermittent since the early 1990s in places like central nyanza and nairobi the existence of organised criminal groups such as mungiki chinkororo and others also created similar structures to those in the rift valley50 it is the combination of these factors and conditions with the political and electoral events in the runup and during the december 2007 general election that lit the match and set the fire of political violence that engulfed the country 49the main groups were info track harris consumer insight steadman associates and strategic proat some point during the build up to the elections the ownership competence and credibility of

commission31 chapterthree protestsviolence and dialogue 73 to understand or explain events in various regions of the country it is also important to bear in mind that they were not removed from what was happening at the national level indeed in many instances political developments at the national level often had an almost immediate impact on the violence in the various parts of the country the national context was also shaped and influenced by international responses to the unfolding crisis 74 the fiasco over the presidential results had been preceded by rumours and claims that rigging was taking place that ap officers had been killed in several places that more aps had been deployed across the country and that ballot boxes had been found stuffed in favour of presidential candidates the inordinate delay in announcing the results of the presidential count in strongholds of the incumbent mwai kibaki in particular raised suspicion among the oom leaders and their supporters that the numbers were being manipulated the odm leaders began challenging some of the results being announced by the eck arguing that important accompanying documents were missing and called for the postponement of the announcements as seen in chapter two on december 29 as the country awaited the results from these areas eckchairman samuel kivuitu stoked the fire when he announced that he had lost touch with some of the returning officers in the areas that had not yet sent in their results his suggestions that the returning officers may be cooking the results further solidified the public suspicion that the election results were being manipulated 75 also on 29thdecember incidences of looting blocking of roads and violence began to be reported across the country at the end of the saturday zsdecember with the anxiety intensifying the eckdecided to invite representatives of the oom and the pnu to scrutinise all the contentious results overnight the overnight scrutiny led by james orengo for odm and martha karua for pnu reached an agreement on all but 47 constituencies having failed to reach an agreement the parties resumed their positions at the tallying centre at the kicc on the morning of december 30 76 as the day went on the drama of challenges and counter challenges to the accuracy of figures as announced by the eckwas played out on live television according to one senior politician other incentive was needed to ignite across the country the televised events of the confusion and disagreement between odm pnu and the eckat the tallying centre at the kicc on december 30 heightened the tension in the country to an explosive point following protests confrontations and verbal scuffles between the political leaders and the eckon live television security officers cleared the tallying centre and escorted the eckchairman samuel kivuitu out of the room the odm leaders led by raila odinga returned to the room and announced that they would not accept the results accusing the eckof inflating the numbers in favor of mwai kibaki the odm leaders also introduced an eck official kipkemoi kirui who claimed that he had witnessed the results being manipulated by eck officials the leaders announced that they would hold public rally the following morning at uhuru park in nairobi to announce to the country the next course of action on the brink of the precipice human rightsaccount of kenyas post2007 election violence embargoed bythe order of the waki commission 77 as they addressed the media security officers massed around the kicc and power was switched off the media was also cleared from the kiccand the odm leaders left the building as the police reinforced the security cordon around the area few minutes later on the evening of 30 december kivuitu announced mwai kibaki as the winner of the presidential poll on the stateowned kenya broadcasting corporation shortly afterwards mwai kibaki was sworn in at state house for second term of office in matter of minutes the media started broadcasting reports of violence in various parts of the country other reports indicated great jubilation in parts of the country which had supported the kibaki candidacy although the ministry of information responded by banning live broadcast transmissions the information gap led to rumours circulated through sms this act by the ministry meant that there was official means for kenyans to know what was going on and in the circumstances worsened an already volatile situation 78 arguing that it had in fact won the largest number of seats in the parliamentary election odm refused to recognise kibakis victory and called for country wide demonstrations to pressurise the president to agree to rerun on 31 december 2007 odm announced their intention to hold rally to swear in raila odinga asthe peoples president by december 31 violent streets protests and looting had broken out in many towns around the country as well as the countryside horrifying images of looting burning and hundres of displaced people fleeing the violence filled the media 79 the government banned live broadcasting and banned political rallies indeed odm later argued that these actions impeded communication with their supporters even in terms of any leverage that they may have had to intervene as violence rocked the country public outrage against the violence and calls for peaceful resolution of the disputed election mounted with the killing of 35perceived pnu supporters in an arson attack on church in eldoret on the eve of new years day 31 december 51this particular attack also transformed the political context as both parties in the conflict began to accuse each other of ethnic cleansing and genocide about week after the election successive atrocities triggered fullblown humanitarian crisis in kenya which attracted the attention of key actors in the international community including the united nations the african union au and the united states on january 1 the european union elections observer team issued report on the elections concluding that the process had fallen short of key international and regional standards for democratic elections 52 80 the odm kept its public campaign calling for the resignation of mwai kibaki and rejected the suggestions of appeal to the judiciary on their part pnu insisted that they had won fair and square and were therefore rightfully in office on january 4 2008 us assistant secretary of state jendayi fraser arrived in nairobi to support efforts to resolve the crisis as kibaki announced that he would accept rerun of the disputed election only if it was ordered by court in the meantime he suggested the formation of government ofnational unity but his offer was rejected by the odm which continued to press for rerun after meeting with fraser kibaki and odinga appeared to soften their position agreeing in principle for mediation to the crisis 51knchrinterview on april 4

and hardening of political positionss3in the announcement kibaki named the admkenya candidate kalonzo musyoka as vice president on its part the odm termed the cabinet announcement slap in the face to mediation efforts and called for further protests throughout the country the handling of kufuors visit became another sour point as the government spokesman dr alfred mutua insisted that kufuor was in kenya for cup of tea to the chagrin of odm leaders and their supporters nevertheless kufuor managed to bring raila odinga and mwai kibaki to the first facetoface meeting since the onset of the crisis and to secure pledge from both to accept the mediation by panel of prominent african leaders chaired by former secretarygeneral kofi annan 82 on january 15 parliament reconvened with its first business being the election of the parliamentary speaker in day of high political drama the odm candidate kenneth marende won the speakers post against pnus francis ole kaparo with 105101 vote adms farah maalim also won the deputy speakers position perhaps buoyed by the win in parliament odm defied the governments ban on public meetings and called on its supporters to attend countrywide rallies over the next few days to protest against the flawed presidential election again the protesters clashed with the police leaving about 23 people dead in kisumu and eldoret 83 on 24 january 2008 there were reports of members of the mungiki gang mobilising for reprisal attacks in nakuru and naivasha in naivasha town 19 members of the luo community died in an arson attack allegedly caused by mungiki the army was deployed for the first time in nakuru and naivasha 84 formal peace talks between the pnu and the odm started on january 28 2008 under the chairmanship of kofi annan nevertheless serious violence continued across the country at the same time bythe end of january 60 more people had been killed in nakuru and naivasha in the rift valley province the killing of odm parliamentarian melitus were on january 28 2008 outside his house in nairobi provoked even more violence in parts of nairobi and the rift valley 85 as violence raged in various towns and the countryside annan brought the pnu and the odm parties each with three representatives to the negotiating table for the first time on january 29 2008 on january 31 second odm parliamentarian david kimutai too was killed triggering eruption of violence particularly in his hometown of kericho political tempers flared again on february 1stwhen kibaki accused the odm of instigating the violence during an african union summit in addis ababa clearly angered odinga responded directly arguing that kibakis statement was proof of his noncommitment to resolving the crisis at time when the odm had adopted more conciliatory approach the talks suffered another setback when the pnu caused one of the proposed chief negotiators of annans mediation team cyril ramaphosa of south africa to withdraw after alleging that he was odingas business associate 86 despite the hardline positions and repeated backtracking of both parties annan pressed on with the talks achieving political breakthrough in midfebruary under which both sides agreed to number of reforms including an overhaul of the electoral system the enactment of new democratic constitution the strengthening of human rights protections and the transformation of interethnic relations in addition both parties agreed to the creation of truth justice and reconciliation commission tjrc that would comprise eminent persons of local and international origin 53tough task for kenya diplomacy bbc january 9 2008 on the brink of the precipice ahuman rightsaccount of kenyas post200 election violence embargoed bythe order of the waki commission 87 by the end of february the violence had largely petered out and the mediation talks had turned to the question of powersharing between the pnu and the odm disagreements among the parties continued to persist however especially with respect to powers of the office of the prime minister which was to be created to accommodate raila odingas odm on the one hand the pnu pushed for the creation of nonexecutive premier on the other the odm demanded an executive premier who would head the government there was also discord over other key government posts and the possibility of an early election where the envisioned powersharing arrangement collapsed midterm 88 throughout the month of february the question of powersharing generated greater animosity and rivalries between the two parties to the extent that annan felt compelled to suspend the talks at the end of the month in order to engage the principal leaders kibaki and odinga directly after night of shuttle diplomacy coordinated by himself and jakaya kikwete the president of tanzania and chairperson of the au political settlement was signed between the odm and the pnu on february 28 2008 under the terms of the agreement the two leaders accepted to form grand coalition government in which kibaki would retain the presidency while odinga would be the prime minister with powers to coordinate and supervise government affairs the agreement would also see cabinet positions shared on an equal or 5050 basis between the pnu and odm civil society initiatives 89 traditionally civil society has been one of the most active voices in keeping the state in check however one of the notable developments since the 2002 general elections has been clear evidence of weakened civil society this could in part be explained by the fact that the narc government which came to power in 2002 was largely supported by civil society hence on its descent to power there was significant migration of civil society professionals into government and state agencies resulting in less vibrancy in the sector even though not to the scale of the churches civil society had become progressively partisan and probably this should not be surprising considering that the leadership of civil society that went into leadership under the narc coalition would similarly be replicated in terms of loyalty after the split in the coalition indeed unlike the previous elections where civic education was extensively carried out the 2007 elections was marked by less and disjointed civic education 90 the kenya civil society remained active throughout the crisis pressing for political settlement in january the national commission and kenyan civil society groups announced the formation of network of organisations kenyans for peace with truth and justice kptj to provide unified voice on the unfolding crisis kptjwas instrumental in calling for intensification of international pressure on the kenyan leadership to reach political settlement and ensure an end to the violence 91 in february the kptjpetitioned the african commission on human and peoples rights on the human rights violations in kenya the african commission issued statement calling on the kenyan government and leaders to end the violence the independent medical legal unit imlu also released report on postmortems carried out on victims of the violence in the report imlu concluded that majority of the dead were killed by bullets 92 international ngos also added to the international attention on the violence in february the international crisis group released report on the kenyan crisis calling for quick political on the brink of the precipice ahuman rightsaccount of kenyas post200l election violence embargoed bythe order of the woki commission35 resolution on its part human rights watch issued report of its findings in march detailing the serious violations that had taken place and calling for investigations and punishment of perpetrators 93 humanitarian assistance to the victims of the violence was largely spearheaded by humanitarian groups with the kenya red cross as focal point for many of the initiatives on their part religious groups also worked to provide relief although they attempted to playa role in the search for political settlement religious groups were not seen as neutral arbiters by the key actors and their mediation efforts were largely unsuccessful 94 clear lesson for civil society is the need for retrospection and continous clarification of agenda and however difficult it is to strive to be issue based to avoid political polarization also what happened in kenya only goes to demonstrate the need for strong civil society organisations that not only empower citizens but also have productive relationships with state organs to the benefit of citizens faith based organisations 95 the perception of and indeed partisanship by the church emerged immediately on the collapse of the narc union and intensified during the referendum kenyans had previously counted on the church as one institution that stood for the rights of kenyans particularly during the moi era where the likes of the late bishop muge the late bishop okullu and bishop gitari together with other leaders gallantly led kenyans to require accountability from the political leadership it was therefore shocking and disillusioning to kenyans that instead of expected unity of voice some churches and church leaders preached hatred against other communities in total disregard to biblical teaching it became increasingly predicable which churchchurch leader would support which political stand depending on which politician was advancing it and invariably the underlying reason was ethnic loyalty 96 to their credit the faith based organisations were the greatest source of refuge for the internally displaced persons secondly they are the only body that got together and confessed to their partisanship and apologised to kenyans for failure to speak with one voice 97 it is clear that that the all the faith based organisations including the muslim and hindu ones have very strong role to playas the country tries to find healing and reconcilliation the fact that they have presence in every part of the country and that their followers transcend ethnic and class lines places them in unique and special position to provide leadership in this regard private sector 98 it was notable that during the campaign period key personalities in the private sector idenfied with political parties or individuals and were indeed targeted for fundraising many of them contributed to political parties kitties some held meetings with presidential canditates and discussed issues relating to the economy but it was quiet clear that this sector was more concerned with economic and investement related issues than with governance issues that were polarizing kenyans in this regard their voices were not really heard even when dangerous political overtones threatened the country 99 however immediately the violence started it was clear that they would be the most affected sector first and foremost was the fact that their workers became targets of ethnic violence some were stranded up country due to lack of transport demonstrations protests real and on the brink of the precipice ahuman rightsaccount of kenyas post2007 election violence embargoed bythe order of the waki commission threatened led to imobility of the workforce especially in nairobi mombasa eldoret and other towns movement of their goods and produce was largely affected by the road barricades and the derailment of the railway line it was therefore not surprising that they through their various organisations such as kenya manufacters association the federation of kenya employers the kenya private sector alliance became extremely vocal and visible during the negotiations for the national accord 100 hopefully the private sector in kenya learnt lesson that they should not only be concerned about the economy but that they must be part of the community of kenyans that hold the state accountable in all ways including politically and further that they must consider the part that they playas employers in creating socially cohesive environment for all kenyans the violations that occurred were clear demonstration of the interdependence and inter relatedness of human rights so however well the economy is doing if sections of the citizenry feel alienated and marginalised whether politically or socially the possibility of violent conflict and havoc can never be ruled out international diplomatic efforts 101 as the violence continued to spiral the international community quickly tried to secure political settlement the initial attempts to secure political settlement were spearheaded by former country director of the world bank collin bruce who according to reports had managed to secure an agreement between the odm and the pnu leaders the efforts however proved futile nobel laureate and south african cleric desmond tutu flew into the country and held talks with both the odm leader raila odinga and pnu leader mwai kibaki who both pledged themselves as open to negotiations 54 102 the tutu appeal for peace was echoed by the head of the roman catholic church pope benedict who in letter to the kenya episcopal conference called for an immediate end to acts of violence and fratricidal conflict fourteen independent experts issued joint statement on january 4thcondemning the kenyan violence and called on all parties to work fora peaceful and rapid solution to end the violence55 103 the following day usassistant secretary of state jendayi fraser arrived in nairobi to press the political leaders to open the doors for mediation adding to the diplomatic presence four former presidents ketumile masire of botswana joachim chissano of mazambique benjamin mkapa of tanzania and kenneth kaunda of zambia arrived in nairobi to lend their support to the peace efforts the diplomatic race to contain the crisis picked pace with the announcement that ghanaian president john kufuor the chair of the african union would spearhead the diplomatic search for peace this announcement was endorsed by the african union the eu britain and the united states 56 kufuors visit to the country turned out to be groundsetting mission for more sustained round of negotiations

for investigations at the the pressure on kenyan leaders remained with the special adviser on the prevention of genocide francis oeng announcing on january 29 that he was sending representative to

report the national commission for purposes of these investigations identified eight distinct but yet entwined subnational stories of the post election violence which cumulatively constitute the national story at issue were nairobi the south rift central rift nyanza western and coast regions this chapter tells the individual stories of each of the regions nairobi region introduction 111 nairobi is kenyas capital city the seat of government parliament and the principal commercial centre the population of nairobi is multiethnic and like many african cities unemployment is high and large number of people are engaged in informal activities 112 nairobi has always been the hotbed of political activity in kenya in the multiparty elections ot1992 and1997 for instance it was the bastion of the opposition politics and voted opposition leaning members of parliament and councillors electoral contests in nairobi has always been characterised by violence managed around organised gangs such as the notorious jeshi 10mzee which caused mayhem during the 1992 and 1997 elections jeshi mwenje siafu mungiki bukhungu jeshi darajani and taliban 113 of the approximately four million people living in the city over two million live in informal settlements in overcrowded and overstressed environments for instance one out of every five nairobians lives in kibera one of the most crowded places in africa with population density of 3000 people per hsctare other settlements with large populations include mathare and korogocho in kasarani dandora and in huruma in embakasi kangemi in westlands and mukuru in langata constituency 114 each of these areas has great significance to the politics of nairobi area the ethnic dynamics in the city constituencies play out in the informal settlements which are largely balkanised along ethnic lines specific ethnic communities have dominant presence in specific areas within such settlements for example in langata constituencys kibera settlement the luo are the majority in kianda raila village gatwikira and kisumu ndogo makina is mainly populated by nubians while kikuyus have dominant presence in laini saba and soweto luyhas dominate in mashimoni and lindi areas this ethnic balkanisation has been used for electoral and political mobilisation 65httpaffordablehousinhinstituteorg on the brink of the precipice ahuman

musyoka obtained 8 overall turnout for the presidential election was 57 of the registered voters while parliamentary turnout was 52 118 as is the case in the rest of the country the political inclinations of the vast majority of residents are strongly influenced by ethnicity pnu was perceived as having the support of people from or whose origins are from central kenya or the mt kenya region oom had the support of people whose origins can be traced to nyanza western rift valley and coast provinces consequently the election campaigns were extremely competitive and tense patterns of violations 119 threats of violence as well as isolated incidents occurred prior to the election period in the city some accounts of the violence indicate that it started in one form or another after the actual polling on 27 december 2007 however systematic violations started after the polling day tension gripped the city as the first results started trickling in on that same night indications are that there were number of violent acts during the counting and tallying of the votes in most nairobi constituencies tallying centres such acts of violence were recorded in starehe constituencys tallying centre nairobi polytechnic hall kamukunji at the tallying hall which necessitated cancellation of election results and in makadara constituencys tallying centre at the railway training institute hall where the tallying was interrupted by supporters of contestants 120 the police had to intervene with force in at least two of these instances more and general sporadic acts of violence were reported on the 28 and the 29 of december as the presidential results were awaited thus raising anxiety among the nalroblans 66thepeopledaily of 29 december 2007 nairobi 67knchrinterview in

announcement of presidential results that widespread and more severe and methodical violence occurred on the night of the 30 december 2007 violence broke out in kibera mathare dandora kariobangi and kawangware following the announcement of presidential results odm called for protests and rally at uhuru park the rally was allegedly planned for the swearing in and installation ceremony of odm presidential candidate raila odinga asthe peoples president 122 during the month of january 2008 and early part of february 2008 the entire city experienced incidents of violence including in the city centre similar or worse violence also occurred following the death of mellitus mugabe were then mp for embakasi constituency who was shot dead in the early hours of 29 january 2008 123 violence in nairobi wherever it happened was mostly spearheaded by illegal gangs that pre existed before the 2007 election violence these gangs include siafu mungiki and bukhungu jeshi darajani taliban and ghetto these gangs were associated with the leading political parties odm and pnu mungikis membership is largely drawn from central province the political base of the pnu while the rest of the other gangs draw membership from the western region particularly from the luo and luhya communities who form part of the political base of the odm the exception is jeshi darajani identified with the kiberas nubian community 68 killingsforced circumcision and physical attacks 124 the violence saw great deal of death and bloodshed in the informal settlements of nairobi these illegal organised groups armed with clubs machetes stones and other crude weapons barricaded roads and violently attacked those they perceived to have voted for rival candidates 125 between 27 december 2007 and 30 january 2008 city hospitals and other medical centers treated many cases of injuries caused by postelection violence close to so people are estimated to have been killed the night presidential results were announced in kibera alone 126 forcible circumcision was one particular form of violence visited on male members of the luo community mainly by alleged members of the mungiki sect as one witness recounted one night soon after the announcement of the presidential results members of the mungiki cell moved around the houses in the area calling on all male members of the kikuyu community to come out and defend their people they claimed that our women and children were being raped and killed while we slept i was forced out of the house and joined them that night i personally witnessed the members of this group led by their commander forcefully and crudely cut the foreskins of eight male adults mainly the luo community they would stop matatus and force them to alight some of the matatu drivers helped them identify the luo passengers the mungiki then ripped the trousers and underwear of the person using sharp pangas exposing the persons private parts if the person was found to be uncircumcised they crudely pulled out and cut the foreskin 71 knchrinterview at jamhuri park on 7 february 2008 68seealsohttplibraryfesdepdffilesbueroskenia01399pdf accessedon 19july 2008 69report from masaba hospital

other reports of forced circumcision for example the local dailies reported of fifteenyearold boy who was attacked beaten and forcibly circumcised during fighting at kiamaiko in nairobi on january 1 2008 and eight luo men who had their genitals cut off on the 21stof january 200873young boys under the age of 11 and some under the age of five had their genitalia crudely cut with blunt objects such as broken glass 74 129 the forced circumcision of members of the luo community by people perceived to be members of the mungiki appears to have been aimed to punish them for their support of odm arson destruction of property and looting 130 arson destruction of property and looting occurred mainly in the informal settlements and the contiguous areas while violence may have been sparked off by the announcement of the presidential results witness after witness informed us that the youth took advantage of the situation to loot 131 in virtually all the areas affected by the violence residential and commercial housesproperties were broken into looted before being razed according to interviewees in kibera for example gangs bragged that they were going shopping where they were not looted or razed the residential houses were taken over by illegal occupants 132 in the midst of squalor in nairobis informal settlements there are thousands of thriving micro and small enterprises while other establishments including churches were not spared these bore the brunt of the violence 133 the worst of the looting and chaos went on from the 31 december 2007 to 2 january 2008 it started dying down on the 6 january 200876 134 in langata constituency makina area largely inhabited by nubians more than 3000 stalls in toi market were set on fire and property worth millions of shillings lost before being razed to the ground toi market housed over 3000 traders similar or bigger number of people were employed by the traders and many others depended on the market as suppliers or customers the chairman of toi market traders association ezekiel rema estimates that besides propery worith worth millions of shillings that was destroyed the destruction of the market affected over 200000 people

has been rebuilt there are reports that members of the kikuyu community who previously had stalls at the market have unlike other communities been excluded from reestablishing their businesses by the nubian community which has claimed the market as part of their land 137 along the mugo kibiru road near ayany estate approximately 90 kiosks selling groceries were destroyed permanent structures were

human rightsaccount of kenyas post2007 election violence embargoed bythe order of the waki commission 143 toi market and kijiji cha chewa marked particularly notorious looting and burning of houses and property and where the livelihoods and in some cases lifetime savings and investments of many were destroyed overall in nairobi many of the victims were able to identify some of their attackers some claimed they even know individuals who stole and continue to keep their property however some of the names they gave are what may be referred to as street names or nlcknarnes 144 the arson destruction of property and looting described above had decidedly ethnic dimension the victims were invariably those perceived to have voted against the wishes of the majority population in particular settlement or area forced displacement andevictions 145 the violence was also characterised by widespread forced evictions and displacement of people by 10 january 2008 there were about 75000 internally displaced people in nairobi the kenya red cross for example reported distributing emergency relief services to over 72000 affected people in kibera mathare korogocho dandora and huruma informal settlements 146 in kibera langata constituency for example an estimated 5000 people were displaced in silanga village in there was extensive displacement of all landlords who are mainly from the kikuyu community and invasion of houses by new and illegal tenants 147 in dandora phase 4 embakasi constituency tenants who were mainly from the luo community violently evicted landlords and other residents from the kikuyu community 148 many victims fled their houses on their own volition to escape violence and threats to violence while some fled to idp camps others shifted to more friendly neighbourhoods in other parts of the city and in some cases to rural areas 149 in areas such as kibera dandora and mathare north deepseated resentment over rent has festered for long time in december 2001 kibera faced one of the most violent periods following fights between landlords and tenants after president moi on the request of raila odinga had directed that rents in kibera be reduced again this resentment erupted as part of the violence mainly occurring between december 30 december 2007 and midfebruary 2008 150 in mathare north for instance and according to one witness over 90 of the landlords are kikuyu first the perception of the tenants luo and other ethnic communities is that they are overcharged eg ksh2 500 for single room which would go for kshlooo in other similar neighbourhoods the living conditions are deplorable for example being vertical slum they hardly get water in the house beyond the second floor the landlords were also alleged to discriminate along ethnic lines in choosing tenants asking potential tenants for their id cards in 81knchrinterview at kijiji cha chewa in mathare on 10april 2008 knchrgroup interview with 5 interviewees from kiberaslum

practice the tenants also complain of degrading treatment eg the landlords switch off electricity during the day similar situations are found in dandora phase 4 151 once the violence broke out tenants from some ethnic communities forcibly evicted landlords and other tenants from other communities and took over the houses and in some cases started charging reduced rents witness in kibera told the commission how he could not access his 80 rental houses which had been illegally taken over91this situation precipitated another round of violence asthe owners hired gangs to reclaim their property 152 although the disputes appear to have been about rent there is an ethnic dimension as well in most of the informal settlements where this violence occurred the majority of landlords appeared to be kikuyu genderbased violence 153 there was widespread rape inthe citys informal settlements during the election violence women men boys and girls were sexually assaulted as part of the unrest one doctor says that between 29 and 30 december 2007 he received about 50 victims of sexual assault in his clinic in mathare lot of these were cases of gang rape he reported of kikuyu women being targeted by luo and luhya men and luo women targeted by kikuyu men92 154 from 30 december 2007 to 2 february 2008 some 230 sexual assault patients from all over the country were admitted at the nairobi womens hospital between 44 and 48 of the victims were children below the age of 18 years about 90 of these cases were as result of gang rape carried out by between two and 11 men rape victims were not only women and girls several cases of men and boys who were raped were also reported for example in one day in the first week of violence the nairobi womens hospital received 19 cases of men women boys and

planning and organisation 158 the magnitude of the attacks looting and destruction of property and lives the resources used the swiftness with which the attackers moved and the deployment of reinforcements occasioned by prevailing situations point to good level of planning coordination and organisation monitoring communication networking financing provision of transport services and facilities medical treatmentservices indeed it is alleged that local politicians and business people financed the violence illegal organised gangs 159 criminal gangs have become part of urban settlement reality some of the gangs engage in organised criminal activities through the creation of parallel or alternatives to services that ought to be provided either by state agencies or local authorities these gangs are mostly organised around ethnic identities and while they normally engage in selfserving activities during elections politicians have been known to use them for political activities including unleashing violence on their opponents in the 2007 elections period the gangs associated themselves with the pnu and odm 160 perhaps the strongest indication that the violence was planned and organised is the fact that much of the violence in nairobi was perpetrated by these organised illegal gangs as mentioned earlier many informal settlements areas are balkanised and have such gangs that operate in each region at will 161 in langata constituencys kibera area organised gangs are common and have operated in there for long time they control economic as well as political activities in this area they are hired by politicians and even other organisations who wish to hold events in the area and charge for use of grounds such as the open spaces the gangs that were reported to have actively engaged in attacks were siafu bukhungu jeshi darajani ghetto and mungiki the siafu gang operates from gatwikiraolympic area and is suspected to be the one that usually initiates and oversees violence and other forms of protests throughout the time that violence and protests occurred witness accounts reported seeing the gang members armed with pangas and other crude weapons engaging the security forces barricading roads looting and burning they are said to have coordinated their activities through mobile phones some reports indicated that the gang received logistical support from some councillors reports indicate there was pickup within the area that was transporting gang members around and was also involved in the transporting of those injured to hospitals the owner of the vehicle was said to erastus okul person associated with kffand gor mahia99 162 the bukhungu gang is said to operate in the areas of lindi kichinjio where people from the luhya community are the majority it is reported to have been largely responsible for the mayhem in this part of kibera it consists mainly of luyha youth and operates from an open area bearing the same

particularly against the luo community in parts of kibera laini sabaand soweto mathare kariobangi and dandora were alleged to have been committed by members of the gang mungiki has operated in these areas for quite while in kariobangi for example the local mungiki cell charges residents for security claiming that it is part of community policing among other extortionist practises they know the residents well and can identify the ethnic community from which they come from key interviewee informed investigators that this cell rounded up kikuyus in the area to attack and forcibly circumcised members of the luo cornrnunttvp 168 mungiki is also alleged to have been hired by landlords whose houses had been illegally taken over to evict the illegal occupants it isalso thought to have been behind the forcible eviction of nongema communities and the marking of non kikuyu houses in high riseand parts of upper hill area in early february 2008111 169 according to interviewees number of meetings were held during the months of january february and march 2008 at kenyatta international conference centre landmark hotel and the marble arch hotel ostensibly to discuss the plight of internally displaced persons but they took sinister turn and organised retaliation raised funds and sourced weaponsll2 170 other information also suggests that the violence may have planned and organised in many cases some of attackers were not residents of the area in which the attacks took place although they colluded with locals to identify victims and property for looting this suggests that they were transported or deliberately moved from their areas of residence to mete out violence elsewhere 113 171 once the initial violence broke out and information spread that particular ethnic groups were being targeted in certain areas people mobilised their tribesmen for retaliation or defence in dandora for example when word spread that kikuyus in phase 4 were being killed kikuyus in phases 2 3 and 5 reacted by arming themselves to assist those in phase 4 large group of them met at the tom mboya grounds but were dispersed by the police at the same time the luo community from ngomongo and korogocho areas were moving towards phase 4 to assist their kin114 172 man who was forcibly evicted from his house in ndumbuini in kabete around 10 january 2008 said he was informed that

illegal gangs in the violence as well as the scale of mobilisation suggests sophisticated levels of planning and organisation of the violence in nairobi that evidently used the preexisting infrastructure of violence which was easily recalled during the postelection violence 174 the factors of ethnicity political affiliation and location largely dictated on the patterns of violence one was at great risk of violence if say one was kikuyu luo or kamba living or owning property in an area predominantly occupied by rival community the role of security agencies 175 police used excessive force in attempts to contain the demonstrators they used tear gas and live ammunition on unarmed protesters in one incident at ligi ndogo where prayers organized by odm were being held for deceased protesters mainly from kibera police used live ammunition to disperse protesters blocking the nearby ngong road116 176 the security agencies appear to have been singularly determined to contain the violence particularly within and to nairobis informal settlements for instance they cordoned them off and often resorted to brute force to ensure protesters did not go beyond the informal settlements to the city centre and uhuru park where the odm had called protest rallies ordinary citizens who were not necessarily protesters and who had intentions of protesting were not spared and some got killed while in general the freedom of movement of the area residents was severely curtailed the police on occasion used live ammunition on demonstrators according to human rights watch for example nine people were shot dead and 19 others injured by police in kibera between 27 december 2007 and 10 january 2008117 the same report cites imlu as having reported around 50 bodies in nairobi mortuaries in the first half of january dead from gunshot wounds most likely killed by the police 177 information gathered from other groups commends police for their intervention as they feel that the situation would have become worse without their help we also heard interviewees recount cases where the police just stood by and watched the looting and burning and sometimes even the hacking of people 178 for instance in dandora mathare 4a and ghetto residents reported that police watched helplessly as their houses were torched and property looted ussome interviewees claimed that some police officer s supported and participated in the violence resident of mathare north said on the 29 or the 30 of december 2007 he saw gsu officers who were patrolling the area actively take part in the looting of supermarket called super kanny 179 it isalso evident that the police force was divided with police officers taking sides with their ethnic communities victims confessed to having received assistance from police officers from their ethnic community while facing hostility from officers from outside their ethnic communities we were told for example that police officers from the kikuyu community at police station near ghetto village greatly assisted the kikuyu who are the main residents of othaya village some officers from the kalenjin and luo communities when asked to stop the looting are reported to have told the victimswacha kazi iendelee let work go on drawing from the pnu sloganll9 some police officers also took advantage of the situation to charge victims for safe

leave and return back to their ancestral lands vhe campaign to evict the nonlalenjin from the region by political leaders mainly parliamentary and civic aspirants used idioms such as ysnm nnk lknnknnk

experienced interethnic clashes related to cattle rustling among the different communities mainly between the naasai lipsigis sub group of the lalenjin and the lisii358 192 vhe naasai argument was that they had given the lalenjins land and therefore could not give them leadership too hence the disruption during the tallying of votes leading to clashes between the lipsigis and the naasai jt is evident that there is struggle for supremacy among the different naasai clans and the lipsigis in vransmara jtis notable that even though both the naasai and the lipsigis were predominantly pen supporters and indeed voted overwhelmingly for taila when it came to the parliamentary seat they retreated to ethnic candidates irrespective of party affiliationsvhe tension has greatly been reduced by the election of nassai on rowticket in the kune 2008 byelection 193 jnaddition to cattle rustling there is also problem of land distribution in the area bt the moment the wasin hishu naasai clan and noitanik naasai are fighting the lipsigis over land mand in this region is still under adjudication and demarcation and therefore the fighting is supposed to lay claim to territory before the title deeds are issued to ensure that outsiders do not get title to land in the area 194 jn lipkelion the violence began on 30 eecember after the presidential results were announced uoon after the

with the primary responsibility of providing security to the citizenry and even in the midst of all the violence the state was expected to rise up and provide security and safety to the public iowever in the course of carrying out this duty the state excesses or wrongs manifested in three main ways firstly there was inaction by the police this is where the police were supposed to act but did not26usecondly the use of excessive force by state agents this especially being the police and in some areas the military against persons who were found breaking the law vhere are reports of instances where the security agencies were in possible collusion with perpetrators to carry out unlawful acts during this period266mastly there were reports of police being tzivniqrih1 or being the target of attacks 4960yhereas the wrongs by the state were manifested in the above mentioned ways there are other situations that may probably explain actions by the police girst there were large numbers of attackers who were pitted against handful of security police officers and use of force may have been considered necessary in number of instances the large numbers of attackers were armed and could

even before the violence preceding and following the 4229elections jn the 33clashes for example nonlalenjin and nonnaasai ethnic groups were attacked their houses set on fire their properties looted and in certain instances some of them were killed or severely injured with traditional weapons like bows and arrows spears pangas swords and c1ubs2i2 jn its investigations witnesses told the lenya

forcefully and violently evicted from their homes in various parts of the dentral tift including in luresoi oarok nolo oakuru and oaivasha28s 289 jt is important to note that inter ethnic clashes occurred in the dentral tift in 1997 as well 1997 like 1992 was heneral flection year vhus the ethnic clashes in 1992 1997 and 2008 had the common feature of having occurred preceding or following heneral flection48vhe pattern of attacks particularly in nolo in 19971998 showed that lalenjin raiders first attacked and killed the likuyu community before burning their homes jn retaliation the likuyu community organised themselves and launched counter attacks in which they killed the lalenjin and burnt their homes49 290 b report by the jnternal eisplacement nonitoring denter released in 2006 2006 noted that 431153 people had been forcefully displaced from their homes288vhis is consistent with information received by the lodit in its interviews gor example on 9 oovember 2006 attackers from pgilge burnt houses in nwaragania not far from luresoi and killed businessman in the area rolice did nothing to stop the attack4b witness also told the lodit that the 2007 postelection violence was related to the 2006 clashes during which leading politicians in the area including the former nember of rarliament said the likuyu community would be evicted from the area42d 291 pn the basis of the interethnic animosity in the dentral tift that had resulted in violent clashes between them in 19912 1997 and 2006 it can be surmised that the violence following the 2007 elections was not as spontaneous as it initially appeared jn other words the conditions that had sparked the previous incidents of violence remained intact and it was therefore predictable that with the stoking of the flames of ethnic hatred in the 2007 election campaigns similar violence would result only this time with new vengeance 292 dlashes broke out in luresoi following the referendum that split the country between supporters of the libaki governments obtd party and the breakaway opposition movement the prange eemocratic novement pen vhese clashes involved the expulsion of the likuyu community and lisii from luresoi43 293 jnterviewees also told the lodit several times that in 2005 there were several meetings of leading lalenjin leaders during the case for the eviction of nonlalenjin communities from the tift xalley was openly discussed and supported by leader after leader jnaddition ceremonies such asthose commemorating the death of respected lalenjin cultural and political leaders such as vegantony uomoei were used as occasions for preaching lalenjin nationalism and the ownership of the tift xalley to the lalenjin to the exclusion of other gtvsvsysqxxiw0o 47jtisnotable that after the 1992 clashes in those areaswhere likuyus were afraid to return lisiis bought land and in the postelection violence in 2008 they were subject to the same kind of attacks that had characterised the 1992

land likuyu monopolisation of businesses including retail and transport businesses in the tift xalley as well asthe choice by the likuyu community to belong to political parties that were not those of the people of the tift xalley had chosen to belong to rolitical meetings during election time in the dentral tift particularly those attended by lalenjin politicians often became venues for preaching ethnic hatred against the likuyu particularly through the long held debate on najimboism that leaders in the tift xalley have adopted najimboism for these leaders was supported particularly in the runup to the 2005 referendum on new donstitution to refer to the policy of ethnic exclusivity of the lalenjin and naasai in the tift xalley and the eviction of the likuyu community lisii and other

likuyus and other nonindigenous groups in the violence preceding and following the 2007 elections the naasai did not join cause with the violent cause of the lalenjin communities in the generalized violence that followed the 2007 elections 297 vhe other distinguishing feature of the violence preceding and particularly that following the 2007 elections was the extent to which roads were blocked in such an organised rnanneri zouths from both sides participated in this activity vhis evidenced rather high level of organisation and the mass mobilisation of large segments of the youth among those who were attacking and simultaneously preventing those attacked from having much in the way of an escape route rrevious incidents of violence were not accompanied by such organised blockages of the road transport network 298 iowever in both periods of violence strong intratribal pressure on young men to defend their communities and to engage in the fighting against other communities was especially high vhis pressure certainly contributed to the high occurrence of violence since young men often had little choice in deciding whether to participate or not participate in the violence fven among the business community there was very strong pressure to conform to the ethnic agenda jnoaivasha for example those business people who refused to support the cause of the likuyu violence against the luo and lalenjin communities had their buildings slated for burning295 299 jt is important to note that inter ethnic clashes occurred in the dentral tift in 1997 as well 1997 like 1992 was

raiders first attacked and killed likuyus before burning their homes jnretaliation likuyus organized themselves and launched counter attacks in which they killed lalenjins and burnt their hornesa 300 gurther like in other parts of the country the election was significant triggering event vhis is particularly evidenced by the fact that the mass evacuation of nonlalenjin communities from the oorth tift in particular and their arrival in the dentral tift in turn caused significant backlash against the muocommunity and the lalenjin fven when there was ongoing violence rumours contributed to the heightening of the anxiety and the mass forced displacement of people from their homes anticipating attacks that were rumored to be ongoing or planned298bs such one cannot see the violence in the dentral tift in isolation of the violence in the rest of the country 301 jn oarok there were brief skirmishes between the naasai and the likuyu on the cometoarok border from 30 eecember 2007 but this violence fizzled out by 2 kanuary 2008 after elders from the two communities met and struck peace deal 302 rrior to the announcement of presidential election results on 30 eecember 2007 there had been numerous incidences of violence in several areas particularly in luresoi constituency cy the flection eay at least 20 people had been killed and thousands displaced4vhe investigation team established that sizable number of voters from luresoi donstituency cast their votes at specially established polling centers in the neighboring nolo donstituency where they had fled to after being forced to leave their homes30ogrom the statements given by the interviewees violence in this region fell into four main categories vhe first category was spontaneous uprisings of mobs protesting the delay in releasing the presidential results and sporadic reactions after the controversial declaration of rresident libaki as the winner on 301207 vhese mobs attacked their opponents looted and burnt buildings vhe second category was violence organised by pensupporting organised groups mainly the lalenjin and the naasai aimed at perceived rowsupporters mainly the likuyu and the lisii communities vhis type of violence was witnessed in all the districts in the region but most dramatically in nolo eistrict and resulted in counterattacks by organised rowgroups vhe third category was organised revenge attacks by rowallied supporters mocalorganised groups in prorow areas particularly the likuyu on receiving the fleeing internally displaced persons lprs mobilised in sympathy and turned on perceived pen supporters killing them forcefully circumcising them and burning their houses vhis mainly happened in nolo oakuru and oaivasha districts 303 vhe fourth category was excessive use of force by the security agencies in their bid to contain the violence vhis category of violence was experienced in the entire region vhe statements from interviewees reveal that scores of people were shot dead and many others injured after being shot by police and prison warders523_uections of the police have been accused of looting and taking sides in the conflict jnsome pen strongholds the police shot to kill

faithbased institutions and government failure to prevent the violence vrends and ratterns of the xiolence 5dmwkeiegh ep7go0fbeddwdr edm4eegmwdeiwed epivobwebodko 521 b prominent feature of the violence that followed the 2007 heneral flections in lenya was its immediacy following the announcement of the presidential election results on 30 eecember 2007 gor example in the tift xalley particularly in the oorth and uouth tifts as well as parts of the dentral tift as well as in yestern and doast provinces the first major spurts of violence occurred immediately after the announcement of the presidential election results on 30 eecember 2007 vhis violence was characterised by the burning looting and destruction of property belonging to communities aligned with rowvhe violence was meted out in this first major phase of violence by penaligned supporters and primarily involved demonstrations citing irregularities with the presidential election results jnthe libera area of oairobi as well as in lisumu and nombasa violence was reported sooner than the results were announced jn this initial phase of violence in these cities the police used tear gas and water canons to disperse demonstrators 522 jnmost of the tift xalley the pattern of violence that occurred immediately before and after the 2007 elections was similar to the violence that erupted in the 19912 1997 and 2006 periods particularly in its apparent spontaneity flements of the violence particularly in the 199192 period on the one hand and the violence following the 2007 elections on the other were similar bs such the latest round of violence immediately and following the 2007 elections was unlikely to have began on the spur of the moment jn particular we gathered lot of information that showed preparations were underway particularly among the lalenjin community to participate in violence as in prior election periods 523 vhere was an existing expectation that election time was time to engage in violence to defend the tift xalley as the land of the lalenjin community not only in terms of institutional memory among those that instigated it and participated in it but also in the preexisting infrastructure created in prior rounds of violence vhis infrastructure included the preparation of young men in advance of the elections by oathings the making of arrows in manner that suggested once violence was triggered mass mobilisation and participation would have been possible because the preparations had already taken place hc hur8fvcydshurifrpvevpr5 7 bibnc jvtuhg 7ppdich dsdrclngidgh3

the doast from the invasion of inlanders who were taking what they perceived to be their jobs and resources uuch pattern of violence in the doast had been witnessed in 1997 which was an election year as well vhe violence in bugust 1997 at the doast had erupted in mikoni eivision of nombasa before spreading to lwale district30kjtlasted at least two months and like the violence following the 2007 election period it took the character of targeting upcountry communities such as the likuyu and lamba who were accused of squatting on ancestral land or buying it to the detriment of coastal communities mike in the period following the 2007 elections the divisions during the 2005 referendum were drawn along political and ethnic lines in the doast indigenous communities voted against the draft donstitution while nonindigenous communities voted primarily in favor of the draft donstitution jn the tift xalley pen opposition to the draft donstitution was embraced by the lalenjin communities while the nonindigenous communities such as the likuyu primarily supported the draft donstitution jn other words the battle lines for the violence were drawn up in earlier periods 525 jnsome places clashes broke out in 2006 following the referendum on the draft donstitution in oovember 2005 gor example in luresoi clashes broke out between the supporters of the libaki governments obtd party and those of pen vhese clashes involved the expulsion of likuyu and lisii people from luresoi 304b 2006 jnternal eisplacement nonitoring denter report noted that 431153 people had been forcefully displaced from their homes305vhe violence that followed the 2007 elections followed similar pattern 526 jn terms of similarity between earlier episodes of violence and the violence that followed the 2007 elections the apparent sudden initiation and ending of the violence was similar to that in the 19912 period vhe bkiwumi teport on the violence in the 19912 period noted for example that the clashes in dhirchila lipkelion and mondiani eivisions started almost without notice and ended abruptly 528 527 jnyestern province evidence that the violence following the 2007 elections was preplanned was in the manner in which the only property that was destroyed burnt or looted was exclusively that belonging to likuyu people while leaving neighboring property belonging to indigenous communities intact gor example in uol likuyu owned property was razed to the ground according to one interviewee in less than ten minutes307fxamples of similar attacks from the tift xalley point to preplanning and coordination 528 bnother indicator of preplanning and coordination of attacks are the numerous statements of interviewees from the communities who were victimised by the violence who said that before the violence started they were threatened with violent evictions whichever way the election results came through vhere were leaflets that were distributed ahead of the elections warning of evictions in many parts of the country including in the doast dentral and tift xalley provinces vhe fact the distribution of leaflets happened in yestern province where the violence was not as extensive as in the tift xalley shows that in regions with an overwhelming number of ppn supporters it was very likely that galvanisation an of ntirow sentiment took place often translating into violence against the likuyu and the lisii communities living outside dentral and oyanza provinces respectively jnthe doast province asalready seen in chapter gour the lodit 30kpn the violence in the

translates into incitement for the destruction of property belonging to likuyu people 529 b similar pattern occurred when second round of violence was unleashed particularly in dentral rrovince and in the dentral tift by likuyu people against pen supporters from late kanuary into early gebruary of 2008 vhis time the attacks were mainly against luo and lalenjin communities showing again the attacks were not sporadic but premeditated and executed with ruthlessness jnsome instances violence was unleashed in response to celebrations of libakis victory by row supporters gor example in dhebilat the celebrations of libakis victory by members of the lissi community on the ebof eecember 2007 sparked off the violent demonstrations that soon became full fledged war between the lisii and the lispsigis cusinesses and houses belonging to members of the lisii community were burnt down31jn response the lisii dommunity mobilised youths to defend frnenuhee vhe youths who included the infamous puvcydfdfd organised gangs began targeting homes that belonged to lipsigis 530 ye were told in various parts of the country that there were plans to engage in violence before it erupted jnthe doast province we were told that the election was simply an occasion to express the real grievances of the niji lenda which include deprivation inequitable distribution and lack of access to resources jnthis as in other areas politicians were said to have fanned the flames of violence either by funding those that took part in the violence or making statements that were regarded as either condoning or supporting violence xiolence in this area therefore appears to have been embraced to support such grievances or perhaps as way of resolving their grievances 531 jnthe tift xalley various politicians are said to have incited the violence in political campaigns by asking local communities to evict nonlalenjin people vhese politicians used idioms such as didcqdnbnqdnqdn which translates into removing dark stains or spots uuch idioms were used throughout the tift xalley by lalenjin politicians vhis idiom was understood to refer to the necessity of evicting from the tift xalley people considered to be nonindigenous to the region vhis idiom had become the signal for similar violent evictions of nonlalenjin communities from the tift xalley in 1991 vhe use of the term madoadoa in the run up to the 2007 election created an atmosphere of fear among nonlalenjin people in the tift xalley vhis together with their violent evictions and expulsions after the elections resulted in snowballing of displacements among people who had not been reached by the violence but who did not want to get engulfed in it asthe violence encroached on them from every direction 532 vhere were other indicators that the violence was planned gorexample in the tift xalley the information gathered showed that violent attacks were mounted by raiders who came in groups of 50 or 100 and even more in other cases vhey came from different directions overwhelming those they attacked vhe attacks included forceful evictions killings looting burning of properties and food granaries jnthe dentral tift there was high level of organisation and coordination vhere were particular days for evicting nonlalenjin communities from the area looting would then be undertaken on different days vhe same applied to burning business premises and residential houses pn other days the raiders would focus only on blocking roads 31lodit interview at dhebilat lericho on 4 gebruary2008 lodit postelection violence investigation

arson the attackers used petrol bombs packed into small bottles and tied with flammable materials to burn all types of structures and buildings vhe extensive burning of houses in the tift xalley shows that there was predictable and sustainable supply of petrol and sources of funding 534 b further element that shows the violence was organised and not sporadic or random in the tift xalley was that the information gathered pointed towards mobilisation and reinforcement of youthsattackers from across the regions districts vhere were reported incidents of simultaneous and parallel attacks from all directions by well organised and coordinated groups gor instance in lipkelion the lalenjin attackers placed traditional calabashes in front of all dwellings that belonged to members of their community jnthe days that followed attacks of settlements were done from all directions and at the same time with clear direction and mission 535 jnvransmara attacks would begin in the afternoon and on the signal of war cry other attackers would join the raids bll other groups of attackers would join from different directions jndhebilat the attackers were alleged to have been fighting in shifts uome would attack in the morning and others in the afternoon vhere were occasions on which the attackers were ferried in vehicles 536 gurther the magnitude of the destruction that the attackers caused in the tift xalley in particular and the swiftness with which they moved pointed to high level of organisation financing and provision of transportk10jt is alleged that local politicians and business people financed the violence vhe local community also gave support by providing food transport to ferry the attackers and out of pocket allowances vhere were reports that the attackers were promised pay after successful execution of an operation jn lipkelion there was information that some attackers were arrested and found in possession of crisp fifty shillings notes bllegations of payments being made to attackers were however not restricted to the tift xalley vhere were similar allegations in dentral province aswell 537 ye were told of training and oathing in camps that took place in preparation for the attacksa vhe training allegedly took place in the farms of senior leaders of different communities or in forests kackson libor who has since been charged with election violence

homes as well as supermarket in nearby shopping center pn 25 gebruary 2008 some 205 armed men were arrested on the farm of former nember of rarliament while allegedly undergoing training vhese allegations of training gain particular credence when one thinks of how well equipped the attackers were with weapons and materials that they needed to undertake their various tasks gorexample some attackers carried power sawswhich they used to cut down huge trees that were then used to block roads 310uomeof the vehicles used to transport attackers are know to the local people and some have

vhose who did not speak language from the region were harassed molested and in places such as oaivasha even killed vhese groups of young people in pattern repeated throughout the country also lit vehicle tyres stoned cars in places where roads were not completely blocked stopped trucks and used them to block roads used huge boulders to block roads while engaging in demonstrations in support of their political party 540 vhe barricading of roads constituted major infringement of the right of movement of those whose travel plans were cut short or completely denied jnthe oorth tift the barricading of roads began on eecember 26 2007 vhis was day before the election vhe purpose of the barricades was to inspect vehicles entering fldoret because of suspicions that fraudulent ballot papers were being ferried to rig the election vhese barricades indicated the high level of tensions and suspicions before election day 541 vhe announcement of the election results on eecember 30 2007 was immediately followed by huge demonstrations in major cities or areas of cities that had majority pen support vhese demonstrations happened in the doast yestern and oyanza provinces with major protests in towns such as lisumu and pen strongholds in oairobi such as libera where smoke was already seen rising in the air moments after the announcement of the election results eemonstrations of

were targeted for eviction in the tift xalley 323jn all the places where the violence occurred the looting destruction and displacement of communities not regarded as indigenous was in part explained as necessary because local communities had lost out in employment and business opportunities that these so called foreign communities had acquired to their disadvantage 324yhen the counter violence

violence before it occurred yhen the violence first erupted the government was also illprepared to stop it 564 vhis lack of preparation is reflected by the fact that when the violence first erupted in places such asthe doast province the police force was overwhelmed by its magnitude bs result the police told the demonstrators to loot but not to kill or to destroy private property jnother places such as the dentral tift and the oorth tift the police shot in the air apparently with view to scare those barricading roads and engaging in violence against others uuch efforts rarely if at all stopped those who were engaging in the violence bt times the police took to long to respond to the violence and yet at other times they were too few to contain criminal elements during the violence

other instances particularly in lisumu the police used lethal force in stopping demonstrators resulting in the deaths of protestors grom the ebof eecember 2007 security agents in lisumu town used live

people living in the area yhile not all violence was prevented the police largely quelled road blocks and violent protests by likuyu youth particularly in towns like likuyu and mimuru thereby perhaps
