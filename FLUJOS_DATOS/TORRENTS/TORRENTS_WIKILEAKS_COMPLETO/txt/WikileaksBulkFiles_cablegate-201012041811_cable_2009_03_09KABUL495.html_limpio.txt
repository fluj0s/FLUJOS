14 b and d 1 snf summary iranian government officials routinely encourage parliament to support anticoalition policies and to raise antiamerican talking points during debates prowestern mps say colleagues with close iranian contacts accept money or political support to promote irans political agenda some staff members believe iranian intelligence officials have infiltrated the parliaments legal and information technology support offices compromising the professional staffs legal advice and the legislatures electronic communications allegations are difficult to verify and may be inspired more by conspiracy theories and interethnic rivalries than actual facts however the number of mps willing to tell us of firsthand encounters with iranian agents appears to confirm dedicated effort by iran to influence afghan attitudes toward coalition forces and other issues end summary iranian embassy relations with parliament 2 snf iranian embassy officials exploit contacts with number of afghan politicians to influence parliaments agenda many mps accuse hazaras who like irans leaders are mostly shia muslims of having the closest ties with iran moderate hazaras insist iranian outreach influences only conservative hazaras many of whom received religious educations or lived in iran while in exile mps single out sayed hussein alemi balkhi kabul ahmad ali jebraili herat and ustad mohammad akbari bamyan as the hazara mps who receive the most support from iran the iranian embassy has also cultivated deep relations with members of opposition groups including the united front tajik sayeds and mps from herat and other western provinces 3 snf iranian embassy officers frequently visit parliament but rarely sit in the public gallery and usually avoid hightraffic morning hours according to parliament watchers after iranianinfluence allegations exploded few years ago the iranian embassy began hosting mps more often at offsite meetings where other mps suspect payments are delivered in exchange for commitments to advocate iranian policies 4 snf according to several contacts irans top policy goals in parliament are increasing criticism of civilian casualty incidents caused by coalition forces encouraging the afghan parliament to legalize foreign forces advocating rights for shia including separate judicial system promoting persian culture and limiting western support to afghan media these subjects often dominate parliamentary debates even when not on the official agenda iranian official hands over talking points to deputy speaker 5 snf lower house deputy speaker mirwais yaseni nangarhar pashtun told poloff an iranian intelligence officer visited his office in midfebruary coinciding with the visit of irans vice president to kabul to pressure him to allow debate on the status of coalition forces that would push other scheduled items from the 217 agenda speaker yunus qanooni was out of town leaving yaseni to chair the session the intelligence officer offered to provide support to yaseni if he cooperated yaseni declined only to face the wrath of mps balkhi and akbari who raised the issue during debate on another item when yaseni suggested the mps wait for better time to discuss foreign forces balkhi accused the deputy speaker of betraying his country and being western puppet yaseni said balkhis and akbaris remarks were identical to the talking points provided to him by the iranian official earlier that day 6 snf other mps have described similar interactions with iranians they believe to be embassybased intelligence officers some believe iranian officers work in conjunction with karzais palace staff to stir up heated reactions from mps following civilian casualty incidents prowestern mps worry that iran exploits such incidents to decrease public support for coalition troop presence the iranian embassy plays lowerkey role on social issues paying mps to support persian cultural programs and oppose western countries support to local media despite irans ambitious lobbying efforts there are limits to mps willingness to toe the iranian line lower house debate last november on water rights quickly struck nationalistic tone with several mps accusing iran of stealing afghanistans water mp spoke up to disagree suspicions with staff too 7 snf parliamentary staffers believe the iranian embassy has planted moles in parliaments legal and information technology offices an employee in the lower houses legal affairs and research office told poloff last fall that his new supervisor was editing the staffers responses to questions from mps to reflect iranfriendly interpretations of afghan law lower house secretary general gulam hassan gran has repeatedly complained to poloff that most it staffers have been trained in iran and pass electronic communications to the iranian embassy as result gran and other pashtun staff refuse to use parliaments email system grans deputy keeps list of mps who criticize the us and analyzes trends in antius rhetoric comment 8 snf if iranian efforts to influence mps are as dedicated as some believe it means the iranian government has successfully identified and exploited parliaments greatest strength the bully pulpit the fouryearold parliament has often struggled to find its role and usually comes out on the losing end in battles with the judicial and executive branches still mps have been quick learners when it comes to using the media to draw attention to their causes even if their views are at times incoherent or serve other purpose than to badmouth the government or political rivals iran has deftly taken note forgoing attempts to influence actual legislation and instead exploiting mps proclivity for media coverage by strongarming mps to incorporate iranian talking points into their public statements iran has opened potential channel to influence public and elite opinion against us goals and policies for afghanistan at minimum iranian interference has helped keep parliament bogged down in unproductive debates and away from more pressing matters dell
