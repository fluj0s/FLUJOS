obviously an idiot mullet doent even know he is only parroting jonathan williams in saying i stole money from the church i guess thats all jonathan can come up with to blast with since it cant be proven either way jonathan was fraud from the start everytime jonathan needed money for something in the church if it was in the account i sent it to him funny after we parted ways last year that i found out he was claiming the website cost more money than it actually did it costs approximately 1299 month and yearly renewal fee of about 2000 im not even going to get into it any further im through with all this movement drama im christian identity i belong to group church or organization lot less stress that way and lot less people to not ever please the only people that ever paid dues in cjccan were yourself and rich stantons guys in pa anyway sad isnt it that money went to merchandise putting on events booklets website and ink stamps paper envelopes etc yahweh bless you paul laslo original message from paul bartron to clark patterson sent tuesday september 22 2009 125 am subject re cian report did you really send this email anyway paul mullet says that you stole money from the church basically i do not believe him the feds like to send false emails to cause trouble we have to be on the defense against it phone calls are harder to fake since you can recognize the voice we over in the northwest have concluded that paul mullet could not be trained federal agent he says such stupid stuff that he most likely has been compromised yahweh bless paul b from laslocharternetto

0500 jay this is welcome news now i wont feel bad continuing to ignore them henry stout has been blowing my phones up for the past two months i refuse to talk to him and while he was calling from his texas number i just wouldnt answer the phone too agravating and nothing to say except just to talk then one day call comes in from our area code and my wife answers its him i dont know if its calling card or how he pulled that one this guy was associated with us while we had cjcc going he was constantly calling wanting to send money or have merchandise made neither money or merchandise ever showed that he was supposedly sending we chalked it up to him being kid that was probably little slow i dont know for sure never met the guy the message he left my wife was wanting permission to use the church name after your email to i presume now that he was talking about cjccan hes nut he just wants someone to talk to him on the phone paul mullet came to us in an from minnesota we were under the impression he couldnt go back there crimes he made some screwed up comments at meeting in georgia concerning planting pipe bombs on the perimeter of the property we were on and i didnt want to even be around him after that r spring and j mcmanus were there when comment was made also r stanton can verify this jonathan williams brought him in so mullet most likely is tainted mullet after living in georgia for while got on meth and migrated south to louisiana he called after i cut ties with jonathan williams jonathan is in my opinion an agentinformant for the adl as far as ucoy is concerned that is my church i am not pastor so i keep the website up for informational purposes only i havent decided if im going to keep it going or not as my heart is not in it anymore i am glad you are continuing an by the way the conquerwemust email was jonathans at gmail so henry stout is also working with mullet to aide jonathan in good ol boy roundup most likely good heads up brother good hearing from you dont be stranger yahweh bless laslo patterson original message from jay faber to pastorjayfabermsncom pastor visser obrien1488hotmailcom cc clark patterson commander commander nsm dan chovan ezekiel

subject henry stout paul mullet subject 1 henry stout dishonorably discharged purpose conspiring with traitor betrayal of the aryan nations in high treason contacts conquerwemustaolcom email aryanforyahweh on newsaxon and other forums httpunitedidentitychurchofchristcom website henry has been promoting his own church using our contacts also those of gerald obrien through connection with paul mullet below to usurp parties membership lists our contacts and also those of obriens 1 pastor faber received call from our colorado contact who stated that henry had asked him to come to the aryan nations congress in idaho as supposedly loyal member of our organization the question was raised whom is he supporting see 4 2 ezekiel christianson called quite perturbed apparently henry confided in him that he was starting his own thing and was trying to sway the church of jesus christ kinsman into his creation 3 others complained about some of his comments 4 the only person advertising congress in idaho is the upstart operative paul mullet also dishonorably discharged months ago for suspicion of conspiring with jews below enough evidence is presented following to justify this allegation 5 henry had been in contact with pastor gerald obrien and according to obrien was trash talking us and mockingly stated that he was taking our contacts and supposedly bringing them to httparyannationsorg obrien supports this comment as accurate during this time obrien noticed that stout and mullet spoke via phone at ridiculous frequency when obrien discharged mullet mullet started httparyannations88com and linked texas contact also linked is south carolina person that had contacted henry about our membership however henry never forwarded his information over to the aryan nations appropriated staff stout claims that the texas contact is from another town regardless if so stout in treasonous act provided this contact toward mullet 6 mullet is the only claimant to be hosting an aryan nations congress in idaho as per discussion with obrien certain objectives in regard to this usurping claim are being organized 7 henry intends to throw what he calls yahweh fest at the ika grounds in tennessee pending that when the ika realizes what he is they still allow it the church of the sacred race of tennessee will be briefed on our objectives privately subject 2 contacts httparyannations88com web ancjcc newsaxon and other forums paul mullet dishonorably discharged counterproductive and embarrassing public releases unauthorized caught attempting to gain membership names and befriended henry for this purpose stout was advised not to associate with mullet 1 mullet claimed to be former chief of security for the nsm so contact was made with commander schoep the claim was accurate however short lived as mullet was discharged for series of derelict activities and questionable behavior 2 mullet claimed to be former member of redfearins church of the sons of yahweh where members pastor visser and mannus as well as former member lindstedt once were involved further mannus goes back to the days when redfeairn ran the aryan nations and he never heard of mullet this was an outright fabrication 3 mullet offered the membership list of ucoy as provided by johnathan williams who may be involved with this last development with mullet i declined we still have not substantiated relation between mullet and williams which would only be negative is proven 4 mullet sent out general email to ucoy members without authorization and posted on many forums and blogs under his name and under the aryan nations revival that all members must report to him upon this event which was within week of contact with mullet pastors visser and faber had decided to dismiss mullet for this action mullet made claim that he had just purchased home in ohio and asked henry to move in with him and asked faber if that mailing address could be sent to ohio faber declined 5 pastor faber called mullet only to find that all phones had been shut off including mullets cell phone with intent to dismiss during this blackout period mullet claiming to be member of the anr went accusing commander schoep of various activities right on newsaxon and other forums pastor faber contacted schoep to apologize for this looser and explain his dismissal from the anr schoep further informed faber of more activities of mullet making the nsm suspect past treason 6 pastor faber phoned henry stout to inquire about new phone number for mullet henry stated that mullet was as they spoke traveling to texas to meet henry 7 pastor faber advised stout of the potential problem mullet represented ordering him not to cooperate or allow mullet entry access to an info and to discontinue contact pastor faber also contacted mr stout henrys father and informed him of the situation mr stout agreed and stated that mullet would not be permitted onto his property or he would receive leaded welcome 8 mullet phoned henry and advised that he had been pulled over by the texas state police and would be running little late Â½ hour from texarkana mullet was again pulled over and this time arrested in texarkana later that date mullet contacted henrys mother who lives at separate residence from texarkana police facility and stated that he had been arrested later mr stout contacted the texarkana police as well as the texas state police who stated that they had record of paul mullet being arrested detained or even pulled over 9 mullet from texarkana immediately went north phoned pastor obrien claiming to be on his way to the real aryan nations claiming to be in minnesota driving west to idaho mullet set up residence in idaho not his new home in ohio took part time job as cleanup person at resort and on this income was able to room and feed himself set up websites plural print out fliers etc upon meeting obrien his tactic was to talk crap about commander schoep and pastor faber whom he only knew via phone for less than two weeks worming his way into position to gain names and other info obrien states that mullet was never able to ascertain such information however apparently henry stout received the ucoy list for mullet from williams it can be assumed that in the texas affair the federal agencies overheard the phone traffic and realized that mullet was in danger and would not be able to ascertain the required list so they redirected him the sponsor of mullet is believed by faber and obrien to be the splc and morris dees 10 mullet having failed to receive either membership list started httparyannations88jew promised stout position in the new high council for his participation in betraying the aryan nations stout turned traitor sold our new contacts out to mullet along with williams ucoy list this is when reports from colorado and california started coming in about henrys comments be it also known that mullet is the one claiming to be holding the next aryan nations congress as seen on his website whom henry stout facilitated by his own admission with the help of the of the ika leader who does web design the same also produced henry stouts new church site and facilitated the use of the ika grounds in tennessee it is assumed that the of the ika leader is unaware of who he is working for 11 mullet confided in pastor gerald obrien that he had been charged with credit card fraud clearly the motive for the treason it is the view of the cian that mullet is jews snitch and that despite warnings stout has betrayed the aryan nations in high treason compromising all new associates and all allied members who cooperated with henry stout operations will be assigned to follow only the church of jesus christ kinsman ca has been briefed all organizations listed on henry stouts new church website will be informed of these findings we shall advise that they recant their alliances the ika will be contacted as one of their members is unknowingly assisting and commander schoep will be asked to remove both parties from newsaxon since they are obviously working together the evidence being that stout mentions mullets site as the aryan nations and mullets an website has texas leader sources pastor faber pastor obrien commander schoep george stout ezekiel christiansen henry stout anonymous colorado contact bing brings
