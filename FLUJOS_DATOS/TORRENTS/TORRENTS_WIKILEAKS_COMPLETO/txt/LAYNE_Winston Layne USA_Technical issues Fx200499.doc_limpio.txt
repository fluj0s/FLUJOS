to mr winston layne fax 1 212 from valerie mullen fax 345 949 0993 telephon345 949 7212 of 1 pages date 20 april 1999 this facsimile transmission is intended only for the use of the addressee and may contain confidential or legally privileged information if you received this information in error any pages are missing or anything is illegible please call us under 345 949 7212 dear mr layne i have now had an opportunity to review all the correspondence relating to the creation of the new declaration would you believe that it was over year ago that we first discussed this in summary the new declaration would be created with 15 beneficiaries the fact that there is power in the new trust to add beneficiaries means that the beneficiaries would have to be named in the deed it is therefore imperative that the fact that the various persons are named beneficiaries remains secret as beneficiaries have certain rights to information from the trustees we need to obtain letter of wishes from you or confirmation that your latest letter of wishes is still up to date the letter of wishes will have to be reproduced bearing current date perhaps you would confirm that the letter of wishes we hold for you dated february 1998 is up to date and reflects your current wishes moving forward then if at any time in the future you wish to trustees to consider any of the beneficiaries who are not mentioned in the current letter of wishes then we will need new letter of wishes from you detailing your request if any of the persons listed as beneficiaries do not feature in your letter of wishes prior to your demise then the trustees would most likely not make any payment to them i note that the charity you have selected is the lambda legal defence and education fund on reviewing the lawyers opinion i note that he states that an american charity would have to be corporation for it to be added as beneficiary he suggested that letter be obtained from the charity confirming that it is an incorporated charity rather than say charitable trust or charitable associate can you please obtain this clarification from the charity as if this charity does not qualify another charity which does will need to be added to avoid resulting trust in your favour in the event of all the beneficiaries being dead at the time of the pay out i appreciate that there are several technical points raised in this letter and i hope that if anything is not clear to you that you will contact so that i can provide the necessary clarification finally did we send you copy of the second trust deed from the lawyer if not would you like one at this stage or would you rather see the final version prior to it being executed i look forward to hearing from you kindest regards yours sincerely valerie mullen
