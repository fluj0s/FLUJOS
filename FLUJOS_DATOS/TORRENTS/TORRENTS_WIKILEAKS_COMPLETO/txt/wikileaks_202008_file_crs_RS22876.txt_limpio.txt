construction it will be updated periodically overview in 2008 the world bank is planning to launch an 18month comprehensive assessment of the socalled reddead canal joint arabisraeli project designed to save the shrinking dead sea using water from the red sea1 the canal has been in the works for decades and is controversial the israeli and jordanian governments are its staunch advocates asserting that the only way to restore the dead seas water level is to construct 112mile pipeline to transfer water northward from the red sea officials claim that this water while descending 1870 feet on its journey to the dead sea would generate enough hydroelectricity to power desalination plants for producing fresh water this water could then be delivered to cities in israel jordan and parts of the west bank 1 the reddead canal project is officially referred to as the red seadead sea water conveyance concept see red sea dead sea water conveyance feasibility study and environmental and social assessment information note july 2007 the world bank middle east and north africa crs2 the canals arab and israeli supporters believe that the proposal is not only creative solution to an environmental challenge but potential model for arabisraeli cooperation opponents of the canal charge that israel and jordan are exaggerating its the reddead canal political symbolism in order to generate the needed 5 billion dollars or more in international financing for what is in essence desalination and hydroelectricity project with potentially serious environmental drawbacks as an alternative environmental and peace activists have called on regional governments and the international community to push for comprehensive settlement to the arab israeli conflict that would include water sharing agreements and the restoration of httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22876 the jordan river and dead sea scientists assert that the reddead canal could potentially harm the dead sea further by changing its unique chemistry through the introduction of red sea water and is too expensive to justify the costs of construction moreover there is some concern that without an israelipalestinian settlement that addresses the dead sea border and water rights israel and jordan which concluded bilateral peace treaty in 1994 will disproportionately benefit from the canal at the expense of the palestinians the united states government has at times played key role in fostering cooperation on arabisraeli water issues2 the bush administration has donated small sum 15 million to facilitate the world banks feasibility study however us administration has officially endorsed the project if the current study supports the canals construction israel and jordan will most likely seek significant us pledge and appropriation from congress to assist in financing the canal due to the slow progress in reviewing the canals construction some believe it may take as long as 20 years to build few us policymakers have addressed the issue in november 2007 senator richard lugar sponsored sres387 passed by the senate november 16 2007 which among other things called for more international attention to the serious and potentially irreversible degradation of the jordan river and the dead sea 2 the 1955 johnston plan called for arabisraeli cooperation in sharing the jordan river though most arab states rejected the ussponsored plan jordan and israel adhered to its suggested allocations for decades in the 1990s the united states helped establish the multilateral working group on water resources which led to the founding of the middle east desalination research center in muscat oman in december 1996 crs3 the shrinking of the dead sea the dead sea located at the lowest elevation on earth is slowly vanishing due to gradual water loss the sea has split into two separate lakes and its coastline has receded significantly for years israeli and arab governments have diverted for agricultural and industrial purposes up to 95 of the southward flow of the jordan river which naturally replenishes the dead sea3 israel diverts an estimated 60 of the river while syria and jordan divert the rest the palestinian authority has demanded that it receive fair share of the rivers flow4 in the last 55 years the dead sea has lost 33 of its surface area scientists estimate that the water level of the salt lake drops approximately three feet per year israeli scientists estimate that even though the evaporation of the dead sea may slow in the coming decades it may lose another 33 of its surface area observers are concerned that its disappearance will have severe ecological and economic repercussions and will deprive future generations of historical and religious landmark

after years of study and evaluation the current plan as envisioned by the beneficiary parties israel jordan the palestinian authority is to construct 112mile partially covered pipeline across the wadi araba arava desert region between israel and jordan that stretches from the gulf of aqaba in the south to the 3 like the dead sea the jordan river is under severe ecological strain in addition to having its waters diverted the river absorbs large amounts of raw sewage flowing untreated from east jerusalem israeli settlements in the west bank and cities under the control of the palestinian authority political deadlock and ongoing violence have prevented israelis and palestinians from finalizing water management agreements tentatively reached during the oslo peace process 4 in testimony before the house international relations committee dr ihab barghothi advisor to the palestinian water authority stated that as result of water diversion of the upper jordan river tributaries by the israelis there is fresh water down stream of lake tiberias and the negligible quantity that reaches the palestinian riparian in the west bank is of deteriorated quality testimony of ihab barghothi phd advisor palestinian water authority committee on house international relations water scarcity in the middle east may 5 2004 crs4 dead sea in the north the canal would likely straddle the israelijordanian border but remain almost entirely on jordanian territory because of the wadi arabas hilly terrain water traveling through the pipeline would initially have to be pumped between 500 and 550 feet upward before dropping 1900 feet via natural elevation decline on its way to the dead sea theoretically enough red sea water flowing into the dead sea could restore most of its water level over time moreover hydroelectricity generated from the water coursing down the gradient would power large desalination plant potable freshwater could then be delivered to urban areas such as jordans capital amman to relieve existing shortages in addition the canals supporters argue that construction could spark more joint israelijordanianpalestinian tourism and development projects in the wadi araba region historical background for over century israelis and zionist visionaries have called for national undertaking to link the dead sea to either the mediterranean med dead or red sea reddead via canal it was not until the peace process of the early 1990s that the reddead canal evolved from purely national israeli project to multilateral one associated with arabisraeli cooperation5 during the energy crisis of the early 1970s the israeli government began to pursue the construction of meddead canal httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22876 seriously in order to generate hydroelectricity and end the countrys dependence on oil it commissioned several feasibility studies and in one instance actually broke ground for the canals construction financial constraints eventually halted the project in 1985 cost estimates then ranged between 2 billion and 5 billion in addition jordan objected to meddead canal claiming that if built it would illegally traverse the previously israeli occupied gaza strip and harm jordans potash mining industry in the dead sea6 the optimism that accompanied the arabisraeli peace process of the early 1990s helped bring about new canal proposal one that linked the interests of israel and jordan its champion was and still is former prime minister and current israeli president shimon peres in his book the new middle east peres wrote that politically this earthshaking enterprise can help maintain peace and establish mutual long term interests this benefits not only the nations of the middle east but those outside the region i believe it will be built the water will flow along the arava the power stations will give light and the wasteland will bloom with life the region will experience peace serenity and progress people from other countries will use the sea port and airport visit the spas and vacation centers and enjoy the products of our flourishing desert7 though peres has been praised for his positive vision other observers perceive the red dead canal as having tangible benefits for israel and jordan that transcend more abstract notions of regional peace jordan is one of the ten most waterdeprived countries in the 5 in 1855 english admiral william allen first proposed constructing canal to link the mediterranean and red seas with the dead sea as an alternative to the thenplanned suez canal theodore herzl the founder of political zionism wrote in 1902 about fictitious meddead canal in his book altneuland the old new land 6 israels decision to build canal linking the mediterranean sea to the dead seareport of the united nations secretary general a39142 august 1 1984 7 shimon peres the new middle east element book ltd 1993 p 144 crs5 world and the estimated 850 million cubic meters of desalinated freshwater water that could be generated by the canal would help alleviate jordans chronic water shortages the canal also could help restore the dead seas water levels task that neither israel nor jordan could undertake unilaterally for both political and financial reasons many experts assert that by marketing it as an essential component of the peace process israel and jordan are able to solicit international financing for the multibillion dollar project according to roni milo former israeli minister for regional cooperation jordan is the key to obtaining support from the world bank if the pipeline were situated on the israeli side we would not be able to get this financing8 upon concluding peace treaty in 1994 jordan and israel pledged to rehabilitate the jordan valley region and since then plans to construct the reddead canal steadily moved forward in 2002 at the world summit on sustainable development in johannesburg south africa jordanian official proclaimed that the announcement of the canal proposal sent message that we do live in one area with common destiny the environment ecology and nature know boundaries and political conflicts however other arab countries and the palestinians expressed their opposition to the announcement made at the height of the second palestinian intifadah uprising httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22876 palestinian representative at the conference claimed that the project involves drawing new border between israel and jordan at the expense of the palestinian people9 israeli palestinian violence continued to hamper efforts to advance the canal for the next three years after the death of palestinian president yasir arafat in november 2004 the process regained momentum at the may 2005 world economic forum held on the jordanian side of the dead sea israel jordan the palestinian authority pa and the world bank announced that the beneficiary parties had agreed to launch twoyear 15 million feasibility study for the reddead canal after the 2006 hamas victory in pa elections the process stalled again as israel insisted that palestinian moderates rather than hamas members sit on the tripartite committee overseeing the project as of early 2008 the world bank is steadily moving the feasibility study process forward it established multidonor trust fund for the study the united states contributed 15 million to the fund other donors include france spain greece japan netherlands sweden spain britain and germany environmental concerns israeli and arab environmentalists argue that rather than undertake complex and expensive engineering project the regions governments should stop diverting the jordan river and allow the dead sea to replenish naturally10 however there is consensus even amongst the canals opponents as to how countries could use less water amidst rising demand or find new sources of freshwater moreover some scientists believe that mixing water from the two seas would lead to algae blooms causing the dead sea to both change color from turquoise to brown and lose its famous buoyancy11 if this were to occur it could cripple the tourist industry on both banks of the sea other experts suggest that saltwater leaking out of the canal could seep into the 8 john williamson dead sea under threat middle east augsep2003 issue 337 p60 9 dead sea rescue plan unveiled bbc news september 2 2002 10 in practical terms this would require riparian states to irrigate less and may result in shift to crops that require less water 11 better red than dead the economist march 17 2007 crs6 ground and contaminate aquifers as the canal would lie along major earthquake faultline some engineers question the costbenefit analysis justifying the canal given the large amounts of energy that would be needed to pump water uphill before it reaches the dead sea and to send it to urban areas for consumption after desalination some scientists suggest that there would be insufficient surplus hydroelectricity to power what would be the worlds largest water pumping station and desalination plants model for regional cooperation israeli and jordanian officials argue that the reddead canal would spark israeliarab cooperation in number of fields according to israeli national infrastructure minister binyamin beneliezer the peace channel project will lead to regional and economic cooperation with our jordanian colleagues in the areas of energy water and agriculture regional development is an important step in promoting the political process12 the canals israeli project manager erez ron has argued that the canal may further integrate israel and jordan economically stating we are not maximizing the potential that can be obtained from the 1994 israel jordan peace treaty look how long border we have with them and how little is happening but the moment you create shared economic interests they will have to continue running with it its completely political project13 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22876 some critics believe that the projects peace dividend has been oversold gideon bromberg head of friends of the earth middle east stated that there was tremendous pressure on the world bank to support the reddead canal because its the only joint project between jordan and israel to come out of the palestinian intifada14 uri wirtzberger who headed company to develop the canal two decades ago said the project may make shimon peres close friend of king abdallah ii but thats its only virtue finally other peace activists claim that the canal avoids the larger issues of managing transboundary water sources according to one observer the world bank and its sponsors have intention of actually forcing regional actors to address their own responsibility in the water shortage as this would present very awkward questions for the wests regional allies why for example is the average israeli able to consume four times as much water per capita as the average palestinian15 despite the vocal opposition to the reddead canal many analysts believe that barring final settlement to the arab israeli conflict action is urgently needed to restore the dead sea and address other water issues particularly as climate change may threaten further environmental degradation and water supply reliability some experts note that even if the canal is never built it has already brought israel and jordan closer on issues related to water conservation and environmental restoration whether governments go even further in addressing regional water shortages and the deterioration of the dead sea depends on political will external support and the ability to withstand political pressures emanating from the expected continuation of israelipalestinian conflict 12 realizing herzls pipe dream haaretz december 13 2006 13 israel opposition to
