beijing xxxxxxxxxxxxx classified by economic minister counselor robert luke reasons 14 b and d summary 1 c cda spoke by phone with xxxxxxxxxxxxx to discuss recent pressure by the chinese government to censor the companys chinese website accelerated perhaps by the approach of significant political anniversariesxxxxxxxxxxxxx averred that the root of the problem was chinas politburo standing committee member xxxxxxxxxxxxx who wants the company to remove link to the uncensored googlecom site from its sanitized chinese version googlecn xxxxxxxxxxxxx said google china has resisted that step as against company principles though it has taken other smaller measures to try and placate the government thus far that tactic has been unsuccessful and the government has already taken commercial steps against google including telling the three dominant soe telecoms to stop doing business with the company cda and xxxxxxxxxxxxx discussed possible usg advocacy including having imminent visiting codels and possible cabinetlevel officials raise this directly for the moment google does not wish to go public preferring to see if current efforts produce results end summary 2 c xxxxxxxxxxxxx cda dan piccuta and xxxxxxxxxxxx talked xxxxxxxxxx about the increasing censorship pressure google is facingxxxxxxxxxxxx said politburo standing committee member xxxxxxxxxxxx recently discovered that googles worldwide site is uncensored and is capable of chinese language searches and search results xxxxxxxxxxxx allegedly entered his own name and found results critical of him he also noticed the link from googlecns homepage to googlecom whichxxxxxxxxxxxx reportedly believes is an illegal site xxxxxxxxxxxx asked three ministries note most likely the ministry of industry and information industry state council information office and public security bureau to write report about google and demand that the company cease its illegal activities which include linking to googlecom commercial consequences already visible 3 sbu xxxxxxxxxxxx said that removing the link to googlecom is against the companys principles and its leadership has definitively refused to make such change despite the importance of the chinese market google recently has officially but politely told the government this xxxxxxxxxxxx noted and their chinese interlocutors at the time were visibly unhappy and said they would report the news to xxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxx reported that google had however already made some changes to its chinese site and will continue to make others nonetheless he said china has already asked its three stateowned telecom companies to stop working with china hard blow because mobile internet is googles big bet in chinaxxxxxxxxxxxx said one telecom company is seeking to back out of an existing contract with google while the two others have stopped moving ahead with negotiations other soes have also been asked to stop working with google in chinaxxxxxxxxxxxx said 4 sbu the best case scenario xxxxxxxxxxxx foresees is that china responds to googles official refusal to take down the link by issuing an order warning against further noncompliance more likely is beijing 00001336 002 of 003 that googlecom will be blocked in china either sporadically or permanently this would be similar to chinas current blocking of youtube but with greater implications for users including business travelers and tourists advertisers and for googles network and technology platforms possibly affecting other services like gmailthought it also possible that the government might revoke googles license to operate in china he acknowledged that sensitive anniversaries in 2009 present special challenges to the chinese government especially the xxxxxxxxxxxx june 4 tiananmen anniversary note possibly in preparation for this anniversary year chinese censors have engaged in monthslong anti vulgar campaign to shut down hundreds of illegal websites see reftel google deems its legal basis sound 5 sbu google lawyers have found legal basis for chinas demands xxxxxxxxxxxx reported while the government has called googlecom an illegal website to justify its request for removal of the link chinese law does not explicitly identify the site as illegal the site is not blocked by china and thousands of other chinese websites include links to googlecom 6 c xxxxxxxxxxxx said google faces the dilemma of losing the chinese market in retaliation for maintaining googles integrity and brand the cda and xxxxxxxxxxxx discussed the difficulty of engaging china on this matter since trade obligations cover chinas censorship regime but considered what us government actions might be possible nonetheless usg highlevel advocacy requested 7 c xxxxxxxxxxxx suggested that highlevel usg officials phone or write to xxxxxxxxxxxx to indicate support for googles operations in china in accordance with chinese law he suggested the letter could urge further dialogue toward mutually acceptable resolution and suggest diplomatic or commercial consequences in the event of rash or disruptive action after some discussion xxxxxxxxxxxx concluded that intervention by secretary locke might be the most effective step 8 cxxxxxxxxxxxx he noted that google has also raised the issue with representatives kirk and larson however he stressed he would like usg support in making contact 9 c the cda said senior embassy officials will meet with relevant chinese ministries to make it clear the usg is aware of the issue and to urge them to work constructively with googlexxxxxxxxxx stressed that before the usg engages on their behalf google would prefer to wait few days to see what other steps the chinese government might take google history in china 10 sbu xxxxxxxxxxxx explained that google entered the chinese market in 2006 under scrutiny from congress and shareholders both concerned with the companys agreement to be subject to censorship to enter the china market legally but remain faithful to its values the company took path of beijing 00001336 003 of 003 responsible engagement that included three commitments google will never disclose to the chinese government any personal information about its users or their search habits google will always include disclosure notice to identify when search results had been removed due to censorship and google will always provide an uncensored ushosted site subject to us law 11 sbu xxxxxxxxxxxx said the chinese governments granting of the licenses necessary for google to operate in china implied passive approval or at least tolerance of the above principles since 2006 xxxxxxxxxxxx said the company has operated responsibly and legally following censorship orders just as other companies do the vast majority of chinese government requests for censorship have been related to pornographic material and illegal activities xxxxxxxxxxxx said in total only about one percent of search results are blocked in china according to the company 12 sbuxxxxxxxxxxxx observed that before google china was formed googlecom was blocked in china in 2002 for approximately two months at the time he said scholarly users were the companys largest constituency and their complaints about limited access to academic materials through google ultimately caused the government to reopen the site this timexxxxxxxxxxxx observedxxxxxxxxxx seems unconcerned with such repercussions and will likely not yield to pressure from chinas internet community xxxxxxxxxxxx he said believes google is tool of the usg being used to foment peaceful revolution in china comment 13 c while we can neither confirm nor deny the provocative language and views attributed to xxxxxxxxxxxx the claims of governmentforced retribution by the major soe telecoms companies are cause for serious concern the potential for continuing escalation by the chinese assuming google sticks to its guns and the likelihood of loud us congressional and public outcry if it caves suggest highlevel usg response may be in order while we cannot verify xxxxxxxxxxxxs claims of commercial retaliation such move seems quite possible end comment
