6205c31 shspec155 middle rudiments the middle rudiment consists of package question that handles suppressions invalidations missed withholds and careful of middle ruds may also contain the halftruth untruth impress and damage end rud see p 244 the question or command end rud and the influence the meter end rud have you failed to answer any question or command i have given you in this session have you deliberately tried to influence the emeter see hcob 21dec61 model session script revised to expand the middle ruds further you could run in the auditor and the room the former less advisedly and the latter only if there was lot of disturbance in the environment if you need more you would do better to shortsession the pc with endruds break then beginning ruds it is sometimes more economical to start new session than to patch up the one you are running ordinarily in prepchecking and routine 3 only one package middle ruds question would be mandatory you always do middle ruds in prepchecking and routine 3 you should use time or subjectlimiter is there anything you have suppressed invalidated failed to reveal or been careful of the first blank could be in this session on goals on listing or even in auditing when it gets outside the framework of one session it becomes the equivalent of prepcheck and must be regarded as such in this case it is best to take on the subject of goals is there anything you have suppressed as zero question and prepcheck it if you did this before starting routine 3 the pc would come up shining if you do one of these as prepcheck zero question do all four they obey all the rules of prepchecking you get the overts you should realize that the overt is often against self the chain may only go to last year ok so it goes very rapidly the buttons you are using are good strong think buttons prepcheck buttons are the basic think buttons of the thetan the above section on middle rudiments is of interest as part of the ontogenesis of modern prepchecking the first term used was prepclearing which was intended as euphemism for sec checking when sec checking was used as an auditing action intended to be preparatory to clearing see p 184 the term prepchecking replaced prepclearing for general usage after short space of time see p 186 prepchecking was here defined as way to get each rudiment in fairly permanently so it wouldnt be likely to go out during 3dxx at this time the withhold system was used for prepchecking later p 194 lrh made distinction its prepcheck and the whole activity is prepclearing in may of 1962 lrh suggests the possibility of repetitive prepcheck process using some of the midruds buttons p 249 the middle ruds buttons also began to be prepchecked as standard thing p 251 repetitive prepchecking came in officially in july 1962 as an application of repetitive rudiments technology to prepchecking see hcob 3jul62 repetitive prepchecking while any zero question could be used for this type of prepcheck prepchecking of middle rudiments modern prepcheck buttons was emphasized use of the withhold system was soon cancelled because it was too hard to teach p 278 modern prepchecking was essentially present by the end of july 1962pp 291293 except that more buttons were added to the midrud buttons the final list of prepcheck buttons was brought out in hcob 14aug64 scientology two prepcheck buttons middle rudiments have use in prepchecking you can use them to get rudiments in when you use them as rudiments run prepchecking like any rud where you acknowledge and check on the meter assuming that the pc has answered the question you may have to get the pc to repeat it if you didnt understand take the onus on yourself by saying i didnt get that this is part of tr4 dont ever be fake if the pc has heavy accent you will do better to ask for repeat on every answer than to fake understanding which leaves you with missed withholds on the pc this applies particularly to these middle rudiments since the pc has to have answered the auditing question the other use of middle rudiments is prepchecking them as zero question the question have you ever suppressed anything is zero question not middle rud use middle ruds with great thoroughness but with great discretion not just willynilly dont distract the pc with them when he is thoroughly into something else you can ask the four middle ruds as package in this session is there anything you have suppressed invalidated failed to reveal or been careful of watching each one if one falls stop there and get the rud in when that is done dont repeat what is clean or what has been cleaned just go on the general rule in routine 3 is to put in middle ruds when shifting doingnesses this is more frequent than the use in prepchecking so it should be done short sweet speedy and expertly though carefully you cant afford to drag or fumble on it dont insist on getting the pcs overts shortsession if necessary dont distract the pc with middle rudiments when listing for the goal you can use middle rudiments when the pc looks confounded and stops listing when he really gets boggy they should not be used every time the pc stops to think if it is hard to get the middle ruds to go or to stay in in the next session use the middle ruds to prepcheck listing the middle ruds play against themselves that is fail to reveal careful of and suppress can mean the same thing to the pc or they can at least be similar eg the pc who is being careful to reveal everything is really failing to reveal something so with the middle ruds you get several cracks at the same thing where did careful of come from it came straight from psychoanalysis because all psychoanalytic patients end up being very careful we dont want that in scientology and it is an embracive attitude or action it isnt really suppression or help it is just common denominator the end product of all aberration is being very careful this goes hand in glove with lrhs recent research into the overtmotivator sequence the more people consider doingness dangerous the less they do that is direct index to aberration the level of inactivity is measure of the degree of aberration the more sane activity the less aberration careful fits right in there what the pc gives you in ruds is seldom what you should run in the body of the session since if the pc knew what was wrong it wouldnt be wrong so dont run bodyofthesessiontype processes on things that come up in rudiments as rule the pc knows too much about it you can go astray in prepchecking by taking up some outrud unless it is ptp of long duration of course it must react frequently they dont never correct anything that isnt out if you cant get something in and it is still reacting and you are going to leave it tell the pc dont make profession out of one middle rudiment be honest if it is still live and you are leaving it tell the pc dust off ruds lightly dont make whole session out of ruds
