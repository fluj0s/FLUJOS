lynne corn and bernard gelb resources science and industry division kristina alexander american law division june 18 2008 abstract the conï¬‚ict between high oil potential and nearly pristine nature in the refuge creates dilemma should congress open the area for energy development or should the areas ecosystem continue to be protected from development perhaps permanently what factors should determine whether or when to open the area if the area is opened to what extent can damages be avoided minimized or mitigated to what extent should congress legislate special management to guide the manner of any development and to what extent should federal agencies be allowed to manage the area under existing lawhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33872g5g20g21g561g20g142g153g152g155g157g561g143g152g155g561g5g152g151g144g155g142g156g156 prepared for members and committees of congress g561

whether to approve energy development in the arctic national wildlife refuge anwr in northeastern alaskaand if so under what conditionsor whether to continue to prohibit development to protect the areas biological recreational and subsistence values anwr is rich in fauna flora and oil potential its development has been debated for over 40 years but sharp increases in energy prices from late 2000 to early 2001 terrorist attacks more price increases in 20042008 and energy infrastructure damage from hurricanes have intensified debate few onshore us areas stir as much industry interest as anwr at the same time few areas are considered more worthy of protection in the eyes of conservation and some native groups current law explicitly prohibits oil and gas leasing in the refuge changes in party control in the 110 th congress encouraged those who seek wilderness protection for this portion of anwr however any change from the status quo appears just as difficult for proponents of wilderness designation who seek to provide additional statutory protection as it did for development advocates in the 109th congress as gasoline prices increased those members who advocate increasing supplies as method of lowering energy prices have renewed their focus on anwr development as one response to the increase however opponents of opening the refuge have succeeded in stopping these attempts in the first session of the 110th congress the house rejected motion to recommit hr 3221 to the energy and commerce committee with instructions that it be reported back with language authorizing anwr development in the second session the house rejected motion to adjust budget levels to assume increased revenues from opening anwr to development also in the second session the senate rejected an amendment samdt 4720 to s 2284 to open anwr to energy development development advocates argue that anwr oil w ould reduce us energy markets exposure to middle east crises lower oil prices extend the economic life of the trans alaska pipeline and create jobs in alaska and elsewhere in the united states they maintain that anwr oil could be developed with minimal environmental harm and that the footprint of development could be limited to total of 2000 acres opponents argue that intrusion on such remarkable ecosystem cannot be justified on any terms that economically recoverable oil found if any would provide little energy security and could be replaced by costeffective alternatives including conservation and that job claims are exaggerated they maintain that developments footprints would have greater impact than is implied by limit on total acreage they also argue that limits on footprints have not been worded to apply to extensive native lands in the refuge which could be developed if the refuge were opened

the presidents fy2009 budget assumed legislation to open anwr to development and that the recoverable oil would be between 57 and 16 billion barrels it assumed that the first sale would be held in fy2009 and would generate 7 billion in new revenues to be shared equally with the state of alaska rising gasoline prices during 2008 intensified interest in opening anwr to development

administered by the fish and wildlife service fws in the department of the interior doi its 15millionacre coastal plain is viewed by development proponents as one of the most promising us onshore oil and gas prospects ccording to the us geological survey usgs the mean estimate of technically recoverable oil on the federally owned land in the refuge is 77 billion barrels billion bbl and there is small chance that over 118 billion bbl could be recovered on the federal lands the mean estimate of economically recoverable oil at 55bbl in 2003 dollars 1 on the federal lands is 714 billion bbl and there is small chance that the federal lands could have over 107 billion bbl of economically recoverable oil that amount would be nearly as much as the single giant field at prudhoe bay found in 1967 on the stateowned portion of the coastal plain west of anwr now estima ted to have held almost 14 billion bbl of economically recoverable oil moreover if congress opens federal lands in anwr to development current law would also open native lands in addition nearby onshore development would also make state lands already legally open to development along the coast more economically attractive and as result these state lands might also become more attractive to industry while only the federal lands would produce income from bonus bids rents and royalties usgs figures show that when state and native lands are considered the mean estimate of economically recoverable oil rises to 97 billion bbl and there is small chance that economically recoverable oil in the three ownerships might total over 146 billion bbl see oil below for further discussion the refuge especially the nearly undisturbed coastal plain also is home to wide variety of plants and animals the presence of caribou th reatened polar bears grizzly bears wolves migratory birds and other species in this wild area has led some to call the area americas serengeti some advocates have proposed that the refuge and two neighboring parks in canada become an international park and several species found in the area including polar bears caribou migratory birds and whales are protected by international treaties or agreements the analysis below covers first the economic and geological factors that have triggered interest in development then the philosophical biological and environmental quality factors that have generated opposition to it 1 equivalent to 6270 in 2008 dollars

controversial for decades from legislation in the 1970s to 1989 oil spill to more recent efforts to use anwr resources to address energy needs or to help balance the federal budget in november 1957 an application was filed to withdraw lands in northeastern alaska to create an arctic national wildlife range on december 6 1960 after statehood the secretary of the interior issued public land order 2214 reserving the area as the arctic national wildlife range the potential for oil and gas leasing was expressly preserved at that time in 1971 congress enacted the alaska native clai ms settlement act ancsa pl 92203 to resolve all native aboriginal land claims against the united states ancsa provided for monetary payments and created village corporations that received the surface estate to roughly 22 million acres of lands in alaska including some in the national wildlife refuge system under 22g of ancsa these lands in refuges were to remain subject to the laws and regulations governing use and development of the particular refuge kaktovik inupiat corporation kic the native village corporation in the anwr area received rights to three townships in the geographic coastal plain of anwr and fourth wa s added later ancsa also created regional corporations that could select subsurface rights to some lands and full title to others subsurface rights in refuges were not available the alaska national interest lands conservati on act of 1980 anilca pl 96487 renamed the range as the arctic national wildlife refuge and expanded the refuge mostly south and west to include another 92 million acres section 7 023 designated much of the original refuge as wilderness area but not the coastal plain nor the newer portions of the refuge instead congress postponed decisions on the development or further protection of the coastal plain section 1002 directed study of anwrs coastal plain therefore often referred to as the 1002 area and its resources the resulting 1987 report by fws usgs and the bureau of land management blm was called the 1002 report or the final legislative environmental impact statement fleis anilca defined the coastal plain as the lands specified on an

area both the recent oil price increases and changing costs affect oil prospects g22g145g142g561g5g158g155g155g142g151g157g561g15g138g155g148g142g157g561 higher oil prices may increase interest in oil development in anwr and increase the hope of higher oil production particularly since higher prices might support more expensive oil recovery techniques in addition the smaller fields thought to be present in the 1002 area might be more attractive in booming oil market particularly if they are near any larger more promising fields that would be developed first according the ergy information administration eia the main impact of such approaches on the amount of oil actually recovered from anwr is likely to occur after 2030 the current time horizon for eia analyses 5 in addition drilling costs have increased in recent years particularly in northern alaska where costs increased 564 between 2000 and 2005 to 1880 per foot drilled compared to 165 increase to 294 per foot in the lower 48 states 6 eia further states the basic intuition that higher crude oil prices would likely result in higher ultimate recovery from whatever resource exists in place is sound however given the timing and cost considerations outlined above eia does not expect the recent increase in oil prices to affect the projected profile of anwr development and production activities prior to 2030 therefore this current analysis of projected production from anwr through 2030 parallels our prior recent analyses that have used similar or identical information on anwr resources notwithstanding the recent runup in world crude oil prices 7 g17g146g149g561 estimates of anwrs oil potential both old and new are based on limited data and numerous assumptions about geology and economics recent interest has

lands10 these estimates reflect new field development practices and cost and price changes since usgss 1998 assessment moreover as noted earlier about onethird more oil may be under adjacent state waters and native lands11 the state waters adjacent to the 1002 area are far from any support system or landbased development and any oil under them is not presently economic if onshore development were to occur allowing leases in state waters to benefit from onshore transportation systems airstrips haul roads pipelines etc and supply bases gravel mines water treatment plants staging areas etc these areas might become more attractive to industry in addition lifting of the statutory prohibition on oil and gas development in the refuge would not only lift the ban on native lands but might make smaller fields on native lands more attractive if they were able to share facilities with nearby development or if they became preferred locations for support facilities due to fewer restrictions on surface development 12 eia estimated that if development began in 2008 production would begin in about 2018 and grow to peak in about 202813 the peak would range from about 510000 bblday to 1450000 bblday depending on the size of the resource14 if so in 2030 anwr production would range from 04 to 12 of world oil consumption and would reduce the world price of lowsulfur crude by 041barrel to 144barrel in 2026 eia further notes that these reductions could be neutralized by corresponding decrease in production among other oil producers anwr production at these levels would help to hold fuel imports steady at about 51 between 2018 and 2025 by causing corresponding reduction in crude oil imports it would also help to spread the costs of operating the trans alaska pipeline syst em taps over larger number of barrels eia reported that the operation of taps is considered uneconomic if flows fall below 200000 bblday g16g138g157g158g155g138g149g561g9g138g156g561 large quantities of natural gas are also estimated to be in the 1002 area being able to sell this gas probably would enhance development prospects of the 1002 area and the rest of the north slopeoil as well as gas however there currently is way to deliver the gas to market higher gas prices in the last few years increased interest in the construction of pipeline to transport natural gas from the north slope to north american marketsdirectly andor via shipment in liquified form in tankers the 108 th congress acted to facilitate such pipeline through loan guarantees pl 108324 see crs report rl33716 alaska natural gas

developed less environmentally intrusive ways to develop arctic oil primarily through innovations in technology new dr illing bits and fluids and advanced forms of drillingsuch as extended reach horizontal and designer wellspermit drilling to reach laterally far beyond drill platform with the current record being 7 miles at one site in china see crs report rl31022 arctic petroleum technology developments by bernard gelb m lynne corn and terry rayno twyman for more information reducing the footprints of development has been major goal of development improved ice based transportation infrastructure can serve remote areas during the exploratory drilling phase on insulated ice pads however for safety reasons use of ice roads and pads may be limited in the more hilly terrain of the 1002 area on slope gravel structures provide greater traction than ice structures and have been permitted for exploration on state lands south of prudhoe bay in addition to ice technology industry has been experimenting with essentially modified offshore platforms mounted on supporting legs to hold ex ploration rigs above the tundra these rigs may offer access for exploration in areas lacking sufficient water or too hilly to permit ice technology at the same time warming trends in arctic latitudes have already shortened winter access across the tundra by over 50 over the last 30 years and led to changes in the standards for use of ice roads if these trends continue heavy reliance on ice technology could be infeasible and might force greater reliance on gravel structures with inherently longerlasting impacts rigid adherence to ice technology instead of gravel construction might put some marginal fields out of reach due to the high cost of exploration velopment or operation moreover fields that begin with few roads may expand their gravel road network as the field expands because it is held as model of modern development the history of the alpine field located along the border of the national petroleum reserv ealaska npra west of prudhoe bay is relevant run by conocophillips it was considered innovative because of the short road connecting the two initial pads and the lack of road connection with the remainder of north slope development except in winter via ice road however with the approval of five additional pads the expansion of the field will add roughly 275 miles of gravel roads to the existing 3 miles of roads and create 1845 acres of disturbed soils including 316 acres of gravel mines or gravel structures 15 approximately 150 miles of roads would be constructed if the field is fully developed if anwr development follows similar pattern it is unclear whether energy development could be held to stringent limit on road or other gravel construction and still allow producers to have access to otherwise economic fields proponents of opening anwr note that these tech nologies would mitigate the environmental impact of petroleum operations but not eliminate it opponents maintain that facilities of any size would still be industrial sites and would change the character of the coastal plain in part because the sites would be spread out in the 1002 area and connected by pipelines and probably roads 15 see figure 2461 alternative f preferred alternative in alpine satellite development plan final environmental impact statement appendix 3 and p s8 s19 and

conservation system unit that protects in an u ndisturbed condition complete spectrum of the arctic ecosystems in north america p 46 it also said the 1002 area is the most biologically productive part of the arctic refuge for wildlife and is the center of wildlife activity p 46 the biological value of the 1002 area rests on intense productivity in the short arctic summer many species arrive or awake from dormancy to take advantage of this richness and leave or become dormant during the remainder of the year caribou have long been the center of the debate over the biological impacts of refuge development but other species have also been at issue among the other species most frequently mentioned are polar bears musk oxen and the 135 species of migratory birds that breed or feed there for more information on biological resources of the 1002 area see crs report rl31278 an updated assessment of the array of biological resources in the coastal plain was published in 2002 by the biological research division of usgs 16 the report analyzed new information about caribou musk oxen snow geese and other species in the arctic refuge and concluded that development impacts would be significant followup memo17 on caribou by one of the assessments authors to the director of usgs clarified that if development were restricted to the western portion of the refuge an option that was being considered by the administration the porcupine caribou herd pch would not be affe cted during the early calving period since the herd is not normally found in the area at that time any impacts that might occur when the herd subsequently moves into the area were not discussed in the memo march 2003 report by the national academy of sciences nas highlighted impacts of existing development at prudhoe bay on arctic ecosystems 18 among the harmful environmental impacts noted were changes in the migration of bowhead whales in distribution and reproduction of caribou and in populations of predators and scavengers that prey on birds nas noted beneficial economic and social effects of oil development in northern alaska and credited industry for its strides in decreasing or mitigating environmental impacts it also said that some social and economic impacts have not been beneficial the nas report specifically avoided determining whether any beneficial effects were outweighed by harmful effects fws recently listed polar bears as threatened under the endangered species act 19 see crs report rl33941 polar bears listing under the endangered species act by eugene h buck m lynne corn and kristina alexander among the information considered in listing the species was the effect of accelerated polar climate change on polar bears and their prey primarily seals threats to denning habitat and effects of oil and gas development the listing of polar bears could have significant impact on energy development in anwr since the fleis stressed the unusual importance of the 1002 area

as whether the area should be maintained as an intact ecosystemoff limits to developmentnot whether development can be accomplished in an environmentally sound manner in terms that emphasize deeply held values supporters of wilderness designation argue that few places as untrammeled as the 1002 area remain on the planet and fewer still on the same expansive scale any but the most transitory intrusions eg visits for recreation hunting fishing subsistence use research would in their view damage the integrity and the sense of wonder they see in the area the mere knowledge that pristine place exists regardless of whether one ever visits it can be important to those who view the debate in this light

issues that have been raised most frequently in the current anwr debate are described briefly below in addition to the issue of whether development should be permitted at all key aspects of the current debate include restrictions that might be specified in legislation including the physical sizeor footprintsof development the regulation of activities on native lands the disposition of

if congress authorizes development it could address environmental matters in several ways congress could impose higher standard of environmental protection because the 1002 area is in national wildlife refuge or because of the fragility of the arctic environment or it could legislate lower standard to facilitate development the choice of administering agency and the degree of discretion given to it could also affect the approaches to environmental protection for example congress could make either fws or blm the lead agency with many observers assuming that fws management would give more support to protecting wildlife values it could include provisions requiring use of the best available technology or the best commercially available technology or some other general standard congress could also limit judicial review of some or all of development program including standards and implementation or congress could leave much of the environmental direction to the secretary

environmental impacts of development one aspect of the debate in congress has focused on the size of the footprints in the development and production phases of energy leasing the term footprint does not have universally accepted definition and therefore the types of structures falling under footprint restriction are arguable eg the inclusion of exploratory structures roads gravel mines port facilities etc 20 in addition it is unclear whether exploratory structures or structures on native lands would be included under any provision limiting 20 see crs report rl32108 north slope

subsequently cited in various other bills in the 110th congress includes the native lands in its definition of the coastal plain leasing area but how the federal leasing prog ram will apply to those lands is not clear see new maps below development advocates have emphasized limit on the acreage of surface disturbance while opponents have emphasized the dispersal of not only the structures themselves but also their impacts over much of the 15 million acres of the 1002 area one single consolidated facility of 2000 acres 31 square miles would not permit full development of the 1002 area instead full development of the 1002 area would require that facilities even if limited to 2000 acres in total surface area be widely dispersed dispersal is necessary due to the limits of lateral or extended reach drilling the current north slope record for this technology is 4 miles if that record were matched on all sides of single pad at most about 4 of the coastal plain could be developed from the single pad even if the current world record 7 miles were matched only about 11 of the 1002 area could be accessed from single compact 2000acre facility in addition drilling opponents argue that energy facilities have impacts on recreation subsistence vegetation and wildlife well beyond areas actually covered by development g16g138g157g146g159g142g561g14g138g151g141g156g561 generally the alaska natives inuit along the north slope have supported anwr development while the natives of interior alaska gwichin have opposed it though neither group is unanimous ancsa resolved aboriginal claims against the united states by among other things creating village corporations that could select surface lands and regional corporations that could select surface and subsurface rights as well kaktovik inupiat corporation kic selected surface lands originally approximately three townships on the coastal plain of anwr but these kic lands were administratively excluded from being considered as within the administratively defined 1002 coastal plain fourth township was added by anilca and is within the defined coastal plain the four townships totaling approximately 92000 acres are all within the refuge and subject to its regulations the arct ic slope regional corporation asrc obtained subsurface rights beneath the kic lands pursuant to 1983 land exchange agreement in addition there are currently thousands of acres of conveyed or claimed individual native allotments in the 1002 area that are not expressly subject to its regulations were oil and gas development authorized for the federal lands in the refuge development would then be allowed or become feasible on the nearly 100000 acres of native lands possibly free of any acreage limitation applying to development on the federal lands depending on how legislation is framed the extent to which the native lands could be regulated to protect the environment is uncertain given the status of allotments and some of the language in the 1983 agreement with asrc none of the current bills specifically address development on the native lands in anwr see also crs report rl31115 and new maps below

may validly provide for disposition of revenues other than the essentially 90 state 10 federal split men tioned in the alaska statehood act court in alaska v united states 35 fed cl 685 701 1996 indicated that the language in the statehood act means that alaska is to be treated like other states for federal leasing conducted under the mineral leasing act mla which contains basically 90 10 split arguably congress can establish different nonmla leasing regimenfor example the separate leasing arrangements that govern the national petroleum reservealaska where the revenue sharing formula

oil in general and any anwr oil in particular has been an issue beginning at least with the authorization of taps and continuing into the current anwr debate the trans alaska pipeline authorization act pl 93153 43 usc1651 et seq specified that oil shipped through it could be exported internationally but only under restrictive conditions when california prices fell in the mid1990s causing complaints from both north slope and california producers congress amended the mla to provide that oil transported through the pipeline may be exported unless the president finds after considering stated criteria that exports are not in the national interest pl 10458 30 usc 185s north slope exports rose to peak of 74000 bblday in 1999 or 7 of north slope production these exports ceased voluntarily in may 2000 and have since been minimal to none due to high demand domestically if congress wished to limit export of oil from the 1002 area by applying the restriction to oil

to examine major federal actions with significant effects on the environment and to provide public involvement in agency decisions the last full eis examining the effects of leasing development in anwr was completed in 1987 and some observers assert that new eis is needed to support development now nepa requires an eis to analyze an array of alternatives including action alternative some development supporters would like to see the process truncated in light of past analyses and to hasten production development opponents and nepa supporters argue that the 21year gap and changed circumstances since the last analysis necessitates thorough update and stress the flaws they found in the 1987 fleis

refuges 16 usc668dd and under 43 cfr 310153 for alaskan refuges specifically an activity may be allowed in refuge only if it is compatible with the purposes of the particular refuge and with those of the refuge system as whole many past bills have addressed this issue by stating that the energy leasing program and activities in the coastal plain are deemed to be compatible with the purposes for which anwr was established and that further findings or decisions are required to implement this determination this language appears to eliminate the usual compatibility determination processes the extent of leasing activities that might be included as compatible is debatable and arguably might encompass necessary support activities such as construction and operation of port facilities staging areas and personnel centers g12g158g141g146g140g146g138g149g561g20g142g159g146g142g160g561 leasing proponents urge that any anwr leasing prog ram be put in place promptly and argue that expediting curtailing or prohibiting judicial review is desirable to achieve that goal judicial review can be expedited through procedural changes such as reducing the time limits within which suits must be

setting aside certain areas in the coastal plain for protection of their ecological or cultural values this could be done by designating the areas specifically in legislation or by authorizing the secretary to set aside areas to be selected after enactment the fleis identified four special areas that together total more than 52000 acres the secretary could be required to restrict or prevent development in these areas or any others that may seem significant or to select among areas if an acreage limitation on such setasides is imposed

unless congress were to change the law these options include allowing exploration only designating the 1002 area as wilderness and taking action some have argued that the 1002 area should be opened to exploration first before decision is made on whether to proceed to leasing those with this view hold that greater certainty about any energy resources in the area would lead to better decision about opening some or all of the 1002 area for leasing this idea has had little support over the years because various interests see insufficient gain from such proposal crs report rl31278 discusses the pros and cons of this approach another option is wilderness designation energy development is not permitted in wilderness areas unless there are preexisting rights or unless congress specifically allows it or reverses the designation wilderness designation would tend to preserve existing recreational opportunities and related jobs as well as the existing level of protection of subsistence resources including the porcupine caribou herd hr 39 would design ate the 1002 area as part of the national wilderness system under anilca and the 1983 agreement development of the surface and subsurface holdings of native corporations in the refuge is precluded as long as oil and gas development is not allowed on the federal lands in the refuge because current law prohibits development unless congress acts the action option also prevents energy development on both federal and native lands those supporting delay often argue that not enough is known about either the probability of discoveries or about the environmental impact if development is permitted others argue that oil deposits should be saved for an unspecified right time
