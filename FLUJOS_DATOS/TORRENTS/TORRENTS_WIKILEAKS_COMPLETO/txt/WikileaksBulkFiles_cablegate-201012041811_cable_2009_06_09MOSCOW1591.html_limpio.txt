tags prel marr pgov rs gg subject implications of rearming georgia for usrussian reset ref moscow 1225 b moscow 0840 classified by ambassador john r beyrle reasons 14 b d 1 c summary decision to move towards more robust military relationship with georgia will imperil our efforts to restart relations with russia if it is not carefully calibrated and deployed while medvedev understands the strategic and personal benefits of crafting productive partnership with the us this impulse is trumped by the gors absolute priority placed on expanding russian influence in the eurasian neighborhood preventing nato enlargement and demonstrating russias great power status the russian political class and populace is united behind these principles with the august war confirming for the leadership that the international community lacks the levers to coerce change in russian behavior russian criticism of pfp exercises was both sincere anger over the business as usual approach with saakashvili and tactical designed to raise the costs of cis cooperation with the west but was not matched by change in military posture however given consistent warnings over the consequences of weapons sales to georgia we believe lethal military supply relationship with tbilisi would come at the cost of advancing georgias territorial integrity and could lessen russian restraint on weapons transfers to iran we believe that keeping the focus on georgias economic and democratic development while continuing our military cooperation with tbilisi through transparent pfp programming with european partners and nonlethal bilateral milmil training and assistance is the only viable if very longterm strategy to induce better russian behavior and restore georgian territorial integrity critical to this effort will be building ballast in usrussian relationship that serves as break on russias worst instincts end summary showdown over georgia 2 c if not carefully calibrated and deployed decision to move towards more robust military relationship with georgia has the very real potential to trigger dispute on set of issues that are both neuralgic and strategic for the russian political and military establishment endangering the administrations effort to undertake fresh start with moscow while medvedev appears seized with taking charge of the usrussian account and placing it on new footing during the july summit this policy impulse will be subordinate to russias strategic interests in its eurasian neighborhood as defined by both medvedev and putin russian intransigence on the unomig rollover is conspicuous illustration of this we cannot accept this russian calculus but we need to understand what drives the kremlin and white house russia places an absolute priority on expanding its influence and deepening its integration with neighboring states as part of selfconscious policy to combat the wests creep towards its borders ref inevitably the question of russias status in the eurasian neighborhood and the presumed zerosum competition for influence along russias borders will remain our most contentious bilateral issue and the likeliest stumbling block to improved usrussian relations russia opposes any further enlargement of nato the august war in georgia signaled moscows readiness to expend materiel and men to achieve this goal even at the cost of international opprobrium the fact that nato membership for both georgia and ukraine is not front burner priority has not tempered moscows stance since the russian leadership sees this as temporary reprieve brought about by european reservations and not by change in policy by the obama administration absent standstill agreement on nato which medvedev hopes to achieve through discussions over new european security treaty russia presumes that we seek its strategic neutering our principled rejection of russian sphere of influence is read here as denial of russias status as great power and another example of us double standards rather than repudiation of warsaw pact mentality russia judges that we lack the bilateral or multilateral levers to coerce it into moderating its stance on georgia or reversing its recognition of the conflict territories moscow assumes that we have too many strategic interests in common to credibly threaten russia with cutoff in relations move that europe both old and new never moscow 00001591 002 of 003 seriously contemplated in the wake of the georgian war russian leaders enjoy policy carte blanche on georgia with respect to domestic public opinion polls consistently show that russians overwhelmingly welcome moscows resurgent foreign policy revile saakashvili and blame euroatlantic institutions for moscows worsening relations with former republics and warsaw pact partners there is absolutely difference between medvedev and putin when it comes to georgia russian warnings over milmil relations 3 c russia has used the previously scheduled cooperative longbowcooperative lancer pfp exercises and usnato discussions of georgian military reform to hint at political price tag for continued cultivation of georgia as nato aspirant while russian ambassador to nato rogozins characterization of the exercises as an absurdity and madness were discounted in nato circles he accurately channeled moscows anger over what was seen as business as usual policy towards saakashvili as well as moscows strategy of raising the potential costs of participation by other cis states medvedev labeled the exercises muscleflexing an outright provocation and mistaken and dangerous decision while putin questioned the reset in usrussian relations pointing to the exercises as signal in different direction even mildmannered dfm ryabkov fulminated publicly against the cheap and unconvincing arguments used to justify pfp prokremlin and opposition politicians emphasized that return to last august or new cold war might flow from continued nato embrace of tbilisi despite the harsh rhetoric however russia did not place its troops on alert during the exercises which proceeded smoothly 4 c when it comes to weapons sales to tbilisi russian actions have been harsher for those few russian officials willing to believe that the us did not directly goad georgia into attacking it is an article of faith that georgias military relationship with the us triggered saakashvilis fateful miscalculation on august 8 while accusing georgia of 30fold increases in military spending at 78 percent of gdp in addition to illicit purchases from ukrainian and israeli middlemen and an overconfidence spawned by us assurances of support the gor called for an arms embargo against georgia in the wars aftermath invoking osce and conventions against the provision of offensive weapons to conflict zones medvedev then promulgated january presidential decree allowing for unilateral sanctions against countries that assist tbilisi in its remilitarization both medvedev and putin appear to believe that the us already has supplied tbilisi surreptitiously with arms which illustrates the invidious role as well as dominance of the security services in running russian policy in the caucasus better focus economy cbms and pfp 5 c from our perspective the challenge is to demonstrate that the us will protect its legitimate interests in the caucasus including support for georgian sovereignty territorial integrity and the democratically elected government of georgia without triggering titfortat military escalation that we cannot win but that georgia can surely lose from our vantage point burgeoning military supply relationship with georgia is more of liability for georgia than benefit it would do nothing to secure longterm resolution of abkhazia and south ossetia allowing russia to justify its military buildup in the conflict territories increasing the insecurities of the abkhaz and south ossetian populations already distrustful of saakashvili and driving the separatist leaders further into moscows arms it would almost certainly raise the temperature rather than maintaining the unsatisfactory status quo long enough for economic development and confidencebuilding measures to chip away at the current hostile standoff the ramifications of policy clash on weapons sales could also be felt elsewhere with moscow seizing pretext to move forward on the delivery of s300s to iran 6 c as we have argued separately ref b the us will be most effective in countering russian actions by acting in concert with europe to help georgia demonstrate to the abkhaz and south ossetians that autonomy with tbilisi is better than submission to russia russian corruption heavyhandedness and reliance on criminalized local leaders ultimately will moscow 00001591 003 of 003 play to georgias advantage while georgia cannot reconquer its lost territory by force it can establish itself as democratically vibrant and economically successful model for the region by keeping the international focus on economic assistance to tbilisi and on creating credible international monitoring regimes we can create the time and space to intensify cooperation with russia in other areas of strategic interest adding ballast to the usrussian relationship that could make moscow think twice about exacerbating tensions in the caucasus 7 c this is not to say that the us should be constrained in providing bilateral nonlethal military assistance training or other equipment clearly directed at assisting georgias basic requirements to control its borders maintain law and order and counter terrorism in addition we believe that pfp exercises and programs should be pursued as part of the standard nato toolbox for cooperation with nonmember states notwithstanding russian rhetorical umbrage the value of building georgian capacity for international peacekeeping counternarcotics civilmilitary emergency preparedness and antiterrorism operations is obvious pfp has the advantage of greater transparency and reinforcing common useuropean approach to georgia conceivably when relations stabilize russia could be included as an observer while russian forces will remain concentrated in the neighboring territories for the nearterm our goal of securing russian drawdown and then departure will not be accomplished through us military sales relationship or lethal training program instead we should hold medvedev accountable to the principles of his european security treaty initiative which are based on respect for territorial integrity and sovereignty comment usrussia relations matter 8 c we in way accede to russian redlines by acknowledging that georgia could never win military confrontation with russia and should not be encouraged to pursue strategy that focuses on military force as the underpinning to stronger more stable country we recognize that our suggested approach would be deeply dissatisfying to saakashvili but we see shortterm fix to the generational estrangement triggered by the august war and way to neutralize the advantages of geography size and capabilities enjoyed by russia instead consistent and coordinated initiatives by the us and europe to assist georgia implement monitoring regimes and persuade russia to engage credibly will be better advanced in an environment where the us and russia are not in hostile standoff our assessment is that if we say yes to significant military relationship with tbilisi russia will say to any mediumterm diminution in tensions and feel less constrained absent reverting to more active opposition to critical us strategic interests beyrle
