through the crs weborder code rs21321 updated may 9 2003 aviation taxes and fees major issues john w fischer specialist in transportation resources science and industry division summary the existing federal aviation tax structure is primarily user fee based system that has developed over the last 30 plus years prior to september 11 aviation taxes and fees while not popular with the airline industr were not regarded by most as major policy issue this situation has now changed pecially as result of new security based fees imposed in the fall of 2001 give n the airline industrys continuing financial problems the industry is now asking congress for some form of tax relief the industry believes that such an action can be justified in light of the large security costs imposed on aviation as result of the events of september 11 with passage of pl 10811 emergency wartime supplem ental appropriations for fy2003 the industry has been granted four month suspension of the aviation security fee beginning june 1 2003 this report provides an overview of the ex isting aviation tax structure and provides brief discussion of some of th issues associated with it this report will be updated as warranted by events there are wide range of federal taxes and fees imposed on the airline industry almost all of which are statutorily linked to federal aviation progra ms the tax and fee structure shown in table 1 has evolved over time the passenger security fee which was imposed beginning in 2002 is the newest fee passenger fac ility charges pfcs originated in 1990 and were modified more recen

specific taxes and fees discussed in this report1 few of the fees discussed here have broad application that goes well beyond aviation the customs serv ice immigration and na turalization service ins

tax with couple of notable exceptions the taxes and fees under discussion here are collected by airlines as part of the airline ticket the taxes however are statutorily imposed on the airline passenger not on the airline itself this does not mean that the effects of the tax are borne entirely by the passenger airlines must for example address how much of the tax can be passed on to the consumer in terms of higher fares without negatively depressing traffic although fees as discusse d above have an impact on airline travel those fees imposed prior to september 11th probably did not create significant barrier to travel since september 11th however it is argued that the new higher fees along with other factors such as security related hassles and delays may be ving noteworthy impact on travel to the extent that travelers costs are raised and not all costs are directly measurable in dollar terms there is always the possibility of the consumer seeking alternate means of making trip or perhaps foregoing trip altogether the key is what constitutes an acceptable cost from the cons umers standpoint notwithstanding the repercussions of september 11 th long term evidence shows th at fees in existence prior to that date hardly dissuaded air travel which grew steadily on long term basis for decades as mentioned above airlines in most cases are collection agents for these fees in many instances an airline bills the passenger for the fee at the time ticket is sold at some specified interval the airlines are required to turn the proceeds over to the us treasury for deposit in the appr opriate account during the pe riod between ticket sale and distribution to the treasury airlines ar typically allowed to hold these funds in appropriate financial instruments and retain any interest payments made on these instruments by way of example the ap his program requires qua rterly payments but the rules are written in such way that an airline could retain some of these fees and earnhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21321crs4 2 for detailed discussion of agency budgets and activities see crs report rl31308 appropriations for fy2003trans portation and related agencies interest on them for up to four months the ability to retain interest has always been viewed as way to offset an airlines costs of collection the amount of interest that an airline might receive in this manner was not inconsequential during periods of high interest rates at the present time however low interest rates have greatly reduced the attractiveness of using this funding mechanism as way to offset the costs of collection incurred by the airline there are four fees that the airlines pay directly the first and smallest in dollar terms is the aphis aircraft inspection fee on aircraft arriving from outside the united states the second fee is 44 cent per gallon tax on jet fuel used by the airline industry of this amount 43 cents is deposited in th airport and airway trust fund with the remaining 01 cent placed in the nonaviati on related leaking underground storage tank lust trust fund the third fee is the ove rflight fee which is normally levied on non us airlines that are transiting united states ai rspace this fee is signed to offset the cost of air traffic control serv ices provided to these air carri ers during transit although the funds collected are used to fund portion of the essential air services program the newest direct fee is the air carrier secu rity fee imposed on the airlines as result of the aviation and transportation secu rity act atsapl 10771 enacted on november 16 2001 the actual size of this fee is still unknown but it is expected to be significant debate is currently underw ay between the airline industry and the department of trans portation dot regarding the size of the fee the annual fee is limited to the amount that the industry spent to provide security in calendar year 2000 the airline industry at the time of this writin g contends that the fee should be in the range of 300 million the dot inspector gene rals office contends that the airlines themselves indicated last fa ll that the amount in question should be around 1 billion an audit is currently underway by law this f ee cannot be adjusted until fy2005 it is worth noting that an effect of establishing this fee will be the long term elimination of the industrys potential future direct costs for increased security because it transfers the security responsibility to the newly establis hed transportation secu rity administration tsa what the taxes and fees pay

was that even with this match th unobligated balance in the trust fund would continue to increase passenger facility charges pfcs the pfc is essentially local tax received by the airport that can only be impos ed with faa approval pfcs have been lucrative source of income for us airports at the beginning of february 2002 the faa was reporting that 330 airport locations we re approved for pfc collection 310 were actually collecting on the basis of 1015 sepa rate approved appli cations the total amount approved for collection from these appli cations in the future is approximately 33 billion combined with increased aip spendi ng authorizations in fair21 pfcs have gone long way toward meeting assumed airport c onstruction needs transportation security administration fees tsa recently transferred to the new department of homeland security the tsa remains work in progress it has been charged with creating federal trans portation security presence for all modes of transportation in very short period of time for the moment most of tsas efforts are focused on airline and airport security by year end 2002 tsa had approximately 64000 employees well above 45000 vel suggested by congress of whom 44000 were passenger or baggage screeners at airports the agency also employees air marshals and others whose primary function is to ensure the physical security of the aviation system additionally tsa is charged with procuring new equipment to facilitate explosive detection and other security functions the ag ency is likely to grow even further in the years ahead as it assumes greater respons ibility for security of surface and maritime transportation modes other fees fees collected by customs ins and aphis are designed to pay for the inspection services that each of these agencies provides the revenue history in table 1 for the immigration and natura lization service ins has b een left blank because ins agency budget submissions do not appear to track this separately the ins budget is somewhat difficult to understand due in part to changes in agency accounting practices over the last few years also the ins makes attempt to separate its air and sea user fee by mode aphis on the other hand has very transparent process which is used to set its inspection fees major issues the airline industry has expressed consid erable concern that growing range of federally imposed taxes and fees is having major impact on their potential profitability this is not new concern the industry has expressed this view several times during the last decade when new fees were imposed nd existing fees were raised the dramatic decline in the financial fortunes of the airline industry since september 11th has reenergized industry complaints about high taxes and fees most recently the chairman of delta airlines has detailed the industrys concern that the existing tax structure is major barrier to industry prof itability and needs to be revi sited by congress and the bush administration3 the industry is especially concerne d about the new security fees added by atsa and would like to see them repealed or otherwise mitigated httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21321crs6 security fees security fees are the central issue in the ongoing discussion of the airline industrys request for assistance in dealing with their financial problems the airline industry is convinced th at these fees are harmful to them and in some cases that they are unreasonable the i ndustry contends that it is s till paying for some security at airports and that federal ac tions have greatly impacted th industrys cost structure potential federal actions such as the cost of training pilots to handle firearms are costs that the industry believes the federal treasury should bear the authors of atsa thought they had cr eated framework that would pay for significant portion of the new tsas annua l budget the budgetary needs of tsa have so far outstripped most of the funding n eeds estimates made at the time atsa was enacted for fy2002 tsa required 22 billion in initial funding and an additional 34 billion in emergency supplem ental fundi ng for fy2003 the administration requested 48 b illion but many observers believe additional f unds will be required atsa expected that 25 billion woul d come from the new security fees and be the primary source of funding for the new agency as can be seen in table 1 the security fees are not estimated to raise this amount in fy2002 and there is concern that the 25 billion may not be raised in future years as well an increase in the passenger security fee is understandably opposed by the airline industry in fact as noted earlier congress has recently suspended the aviation security fees for four months 603 903 congress is left therefore with the issue of respondi ng to tsas budgetary needs and at the same time considering the airline industrys continuing plea for fiscal relief trust fund revenues airline traffic yearoveryear between fy2001 and fy2002 was down well over 10 and re venues were down 15 fy2002 revenue collections for the trust fund were down sligh tly more further drop in collections for fy2003 as result of the iraq war and the sa rs outbreak in asia is also likely as mentioned earlier faa spending is closely linked to trust fund re venues as result of fair21 drop in availability of trust fund monies could cause appropriators to seek additional treasury general fund monies for faa programs not an easy task in budget deficit situation continuing decrease in tr ust fund revenues could so have significant implications for the next faa program reauthorization expected during the 1st session of the 108th congress passenger facility charges airlines continue to oppose the imposition of pfcs in some instances especially when th projects approved have more application to airport landside activities rather than to airside activities in the current economic context the airlines feel that pfc collections fo r what they consider nonessential projects are exacerbating their financial problems others argue however that pfcs have at least in some instances obviated the need for airports to raise landing fees charged to airlines in order to build desired infrastructure
