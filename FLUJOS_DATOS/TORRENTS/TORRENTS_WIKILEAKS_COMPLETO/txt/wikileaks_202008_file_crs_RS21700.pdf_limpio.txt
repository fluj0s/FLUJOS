the various summits3 political several hemispheric agreements have been adopted as result of the summit process the interamerican conven tion against corruption which was signed in 1996 has been reinforced by the crea tion of followup mechanism to assess countries compliance with its provisions in 2002 in response to the tragic events of september 11 2001 thirtythree countries signe d the

representatives from 15 countries continued drafting an american declaration on the rights of indigenous peoples at the same time the interamerican commission of human rights held an increasing number of hearings and continued to monitor the status of minority groups throughout the americas the summit process has also encouraged hemispheric leaders to engage in dialogue and to adopt and enforce agreements aimed at improving the quality of democracy in the region one such agreement the interame rican democratic charter states that governments in the region have an obligation to protect democracy and human rights and authorizes the oas to take diplomatic action to restore democracy when it is threatened the interamerican democratic charter is cu rrently the most comprehensive agreement on the collective defense of democracy in th world the oas first invoked the charter in april 2002 when it denounced the attempte d coup in venezuela that temporarily forced president hugo chavez from power and then facilitated dialogue between chavez and his opponents in 2001 the oas again acted under the charter to promote resolution of the political impasse in haiti by creating special mission to strengthen democracy in haiti in 2002 to encourage the convocation of free nd fair legislative elections economic leaders gathered at the miami summit in 1994 agreed upon the

andean nations and regional agreem ent with central america some observers question whether the original ftaa concept w ill indeed successfully be realized others counter that bilateral and subregional trade agreements may serve the dual purpose of providing the united states deeper trade ties with specific countries in the shortterm while providing incentives for reluctant countri to participate in more extensive free trade agreements such as ftaa in the long run social the social agenda of the americas has generally focused on improving the quality of life of all citizen s particularly women nd other underserved groups by providing them with equal acce ss to education healthcare and other social services in the 2001 summit hemispheric leaders recommitte d themselves to

presidents in latin america have failed to complete their terms although the re gions economies are expected to grow by 35 in 2004 per capita growth has falle n for four of the last five years as result of this economic stagnation unemployment has risen sharply and 20 million more latin americans live in poverty in 2003 than in 19978 while slightly more than half of latin americans polled remain committed to democracy in principle one poll indicates that they are becoming increasingly frustrated with corrupt institutions and that only 16 are satisfied with free market economies9 summit expectations in order to address some of these problems at the monterrey special summit cesar gaviria the secretary general of the oas predicted that leaders would work basically on issues of social policy and equity and look for new agenda for latin america and the caribbean that transcends the washington consensus10 some hoped that the monterrey summit would produce social charter akin to the interamerican democratic charter bush administration officials had recently acknowledged latin americans disenc hantment with free market reforms and governmental corruption and inefficiency in response roger noriega us assistant secretary of state for western hemisphere affairs asserted that while monterrey would reinvigorate leaders long term commitments to the quebec plan of action it

proved to be somewhat controversial12 free trade at the monterrey summit there was considerable debate concerning how free trade should be referenced in fina l declaration focused on social issues while all leaders agreed with the proposed economic reforms concerning the promotion of small businesses securing property rights and reducing the cost of sending remittances there was reportedly some opposition to president bushs assertion that the proper way to end poverty is by promoting trade between nations many leaders seemed to agree with recent world bank report on the north american free trade agreement which argued that free trade alone is not enough to brin g growth with equity without significant policy and institutional reforms13 leaders disagreed over whether as the united states suggested the summit declaration should reaffirm the january 2005 deadline for completing the negotiations of an ft aa while the br azilians initially opposed any reference to such deadlines all leaders with the exception of venezuela eventually agreed to declaration stating somewhat vague pledge to accept the framework and calendar for concluding ftaa negotiations reached at the miami
