the actual amounts that are spent within year generally budget authority is more accurate indicator of funding trends because outlays can vary widely from year to year depending on many factors such as the payment of funds obligated in past years for the completion of longterm projects 2 the six appropriations bills that fund programs under function 300 include 1 department of agriculture and

ocs receipts from offshore oil and gas leases superfund taxes which support cleanup of hazardous waste sites were another source of revenue under function 300 at one time but taxing authority expired on december 31 1995 whether to reinstate the taxes has been an ongoing issue in the superfund reauthorization debate9 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21154 in addition to existing revenues the presidents fy2003 budget assumed future revenues from leasing the arctic national wildlife refuge anwr for oil and gas exploration while these revenues would not have directly supported programs under function 300 the proposal was controversial on environmental grounds due to concerns over the potential harm to critical wildlife habitat that might occur as result of oil and gas exploration and development neither hconres 353 as passed nor sconres 100 as reported assumed revenues from such leases however house report language indicated that the lack of assumed revenues did not preclude the house from authorizing such leases10 under function 300 several tax incentives related to natural resource and environmental activities are also available to state and local governments and the private sector
