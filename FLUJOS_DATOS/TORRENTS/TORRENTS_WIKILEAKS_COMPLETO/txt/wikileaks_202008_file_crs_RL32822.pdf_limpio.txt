trust funds social security is statutory entitlement program beneficiaries have legal entitlement to receive social security bene fits as set forth under the social security act however the fact that social security benefits are financed by taxes on an employees wages does not limit congresss power to fix the levels of benefits under the social security act or the conditions upon which they may be paid congresss authority to modify provisions of the soci security program was affirmed in the 1960 supreme court decision in flemming v nestor wherein the court held that an individual does not have an accrued prope rty right in his or her social security benefits the court has made clear in subsequent court decisions that the payment of social security taxes c onveys contractual rights to social security benefits congress has the power to legislatively promise to pay individuals certain level of social security benefits and to provide gal evidence of congresss guarantee of the obligation of the federa l government to provide for the payment of such benefits in the future while congress may decide to take whatever measures necessary to fulfill such obligation courts would be unlikely to find that congresss unilateral promise constitutes contract which could not be modified in the future in addition congressional promise not to reduce specific level of social security benefits payable to certain eligible individuals would likely not overcome the constitutional principle subject to due process considerations that one congress may not bind subsequent congress to legislative action or inaction the calculations concerning the possible future insolvency of the social security trust funds raise question whether that result would affect the legal right of beneficiaries to receive fu ll social security benefits while an entitlement by definition legally obligates the united states to make payments to any person who meets the eligibility requirements established in the statute that creates the entitlement provision of the antideficiency act prevents an agency from paying more in benefits than the amount available in the source of funds available to pay the benefits the social security act states that social security benefits shall be paid only from the social security trust funds and the act appropriate s all payroll taxes to pay benefits although the legal right of beneficiaries to receive full benefits would not be extinguished by an insufficien t amount of funds in the social security trust funds it appear s that beneficiaries would have to wait until the trust funds receive an amount sufficient to pay full bene fits in the case of shortfall unless congress amends applicable lawshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32822contents congressional authority to modify

calculations indicating that in the long run the current social security program will not be financially sustai nable under the present statutor scheme have fueled the current debate regarding social security reform1 this report addresses selected legal issues which may be raised regarding entitlement to social security benefits as congress considers possible changes to the social security program and in view of projected longrange shortfalls in the social security trust funds2 social security benefits are administered pursuant to title ii of the social security act known as the old age survivors and disability insurance oasdi program 3 title ii is part of larger social insurance program in which congress uses its power to tax and spend for the general welfare to promote the social goals of aiding the aged survivors of workers disabled persons and persons of limited means beneficiaries under title ii have legal entitlement to receive social security benefits as set forth by the social security act and as administered by the social security administration ssa an independent agency in the executive branch an individuals right to social security benefits is in sense earned since there is general relationship between oas di benefits and wage s earned and the tax paid thereon however be nefits are not directly measured by the amount of payments made through the years into the system thus the fact that social security benefits are financed by taxes on an employees wages does not provide limit on congresss power to fix the vels of benefits under the so cial security act or the conditions upon which they may be paid4httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32822crs2 5 363 us 603 1960 6 the fifth amendment in relevant part stat that person shall be deprived of life liberty or property

institutions found not guilty by reason of insanity of offenses punishable by imprisonment for more than one yearcongressional authority to modify entitlements the supreme courts landmark decision in flemming v nestor 5 provided an analysis of the relationship between bene ficiarys legal entitlement to receive social security benefits and the power of congress to change that entitlement by amending the underlying statute the court in th at case upheld provision section 202a of the social security act 42 usc 402a that terminated social security benefits to person deported for membership in th communist party nestor had at one time been member of the communist party later he began r eceiving social security benefits which were cut off when he was deported to his native bulgaria nestor argued that he had property right in his social security benefits and that by cutting off those benefits the government had made an unlawful taking of his benefits under the fifth amendment6 the court however disagree d justice harlan wrote to engraft upon the social security system concept of accrued property rights would deprive it of the flexibility and boldness in adjustment to everchanging conditions which it demands it was doubtless out of an awareness of the need for such flexibility that congress included in the original act and has since retained clause expre ssly reserving to it the right to alter amend or repeal any provision of the act 1104 49 stat 648 42 usc 1304 that provision makes express what is im plicit in the institu tional needs of the program we must conclude that pe rson covered by the act has not such right in benefit payments as would make every defeasance of accrued interests violative of the due process cl ause of the fifth amendment flemming at 610611 the inherent ability of congress to modify the provisions of title ii of the social security act even to the extent of affecting the benefits an individual is currently receiving is thus well established7 the same principle that current benefit amounts may be modified has been applie d to other similar programs involving pensions such as federal civil service re tirement one significant example is the

1985 the court there uphe ld modification of civil service retirement cola saying that although retirees may have protected property interest when they are entitled to immediate payment under pr eexisting law their entitlement to any post retirement increases in an annuity stems from the underlying statute which may be adjusted at any time id at 758 f2d 638court in national association of retired federal employees v horner8 the district court in that case upheld provision of th balanced budget and emergency deficit control act9 which suspended paying scheduled costofliving adjustment cola for federal retirees saying that it did not violate the takings clause of the fifth amendment which states that private property shall not be taken for public use without just compensation the dispute centered on whether the provisi on of the act signed by the president on december 12 1985 which suspended any auto matic spending increase that first would be paid during the period beginning with the date of enactment constituted taking of private property of the retirees the section providing for the cola 5 usc 8340b provided that it would ta ke effect on december 1 of each year while section 8340b made the cola effective on december 1 it was not scheduled to be paid until january 2 1986 the retirees argued that the cola for the twelve months after december 1 1985 became their private property on december 1 1985 and consequently that the suspension signed on december 12 1985 took their property which had accrue d between december 1 and 12 without compensation in violation of the takings clause the court rejected their claim asserting that it is utterly clear however that the statute section 8340b cannot be read as plaintiffs wish10 horner at 514 it cited an earlier case stouper v jones 284 f2d 240 dc cir 1960 as dispositive the appellant in the stouper case retired in 1953 and began receiving disability annuity payments pursuant to the law then in force in 1956 congress amended the law to discontinue benefits to recipients whose earning capacity was restored to level fairly comparable to the current rate of pay for the position held immediately prior to retirement after the retiremen t division of the civil service commission determined that the appellant had been restored to that earning capacity her disability annuity was terminated the appellant asserted that the 1956 amendment could not constitutionally be applied in her case because at the time she retired she acquired vested right to an annuity that could not be taken from her by subsequent legislation stouper at 242 the us court of appeals for the district of columbia in stouper said that it is well settled that pension granted by th government confers right which cannot be revised modified or recalled by subsequent legislation united states ex rel burnett v teller 107 us 64 1882 the court in the stouper case added that benefits under the civil serv ice retirement act are similar to those under the social security act they are not based on an em ployees contributions to the retirementhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32822crs4 11 301 us 619 1937 12 id at 635 13 flemming at 610 14 id at 79 15 in bowen v public agencies opposed to social security entrapment 477 us 41 1986 the argument was advanced that agreements between congress and states regarding social security coverage of state and local employ ees conferred contractual rights upon the state and local governments when congress revo ked the states right to withdraw from its continuedfund but instead on the employees earnings r ecord and years of service it was noted that the retirement act pays higher benefits when deceased employee is survived by widow or widower and childre n than when he or she is survived only by widow or widower even though the em ployees contribution to the civil service retirement and disability fund had been the same in either case we conclude that an employee has right under the retir ement act based on contractual annuity principles and hold that the appellant d vested right to the disability annuity which was terminated id the us supreme court has also made clear that the payment of social security taxes conveys contractual rights to soci security benefits in 1937 the high court upheld the constitutionality of the social security act in helvering v davis 11 in doing so the court held that the soci security program was not an insurance program the court noted the proceeds of both employee and employer taxes are to be paid into the treasury like any ot her internal revenue generally and are not earmarked in any way12 the court in essence deferred to congress on the question of which welfare schemes fall within the ambit of the constitutions general welfare clause later in flemming the court rejected any comparison of social security with insurance or an annuity13 it is apparent that the noncontractual interest of an employee covered by the act cannot be soundly analogized to that of the holder of an annuity whose right to benefits is bottomed on his contractual premium payments the absence of contractual rights extends to government pensions in general in dodge v board education 302 us 74 1937 retired school teacher challenged the constitutionality of state statute th at reduced her retirement annuity from 1500 to 500 the statute in effect when she re tired said that each person so retired shall be paid the sum of fifteen hundred 1500 annually and for life from the date of such retirement the supreme court did not interpret this mandatory language shall annually and for life to supersed subsequent state statute that reduced the amount of the annual annuity saying that the presumption is that law is not intended to create private contractual or vested rights but merely declares policy until the legislature shall ordain otherwise14 the presumption that pens ion statutes do not preclude congress from decreasing or eliminating benefits at future time rests on the recognition that legislative bodies require flexibility in public welfare matters15 our cases are clear that legislationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32822crs5 15 continued coverage agreement california claimed t aking of private property under the fifth amendment however the court disagreed the provision simply cannot be viewed as conferring any sort of vested right in th face of precedent concerning the effect of congress reserved power on agreements tered into under statute containing the language of reservation to alter amend or repeal the underlying st atutory provisions rather the provision simply was part of re gulatory program over which congress retained authority to amend in the exercise of its power to provide for the general welfare id at 55 16 flemming at 611 note however that once be neficiary receives an actual benefit payment the government cannot take it back pension payments

expectations usery v turner elkhorn mining co 428 us 1 1516 while acknowledging this latit ude the supreme court in flemming nonetheless indicated that congressional action may be subject to some constitutional restraint16 whether wisdom or unwisdom resides in the scheme of benefits set forth in title ii of the social security act it is not for us to say the answer for such inquires must come from congress not th courts our concern here as often is with power not with wisdom helvering v davis 301 us 619 supra at 644 1937 particularly when we deal with withholding of noncontractual benefit under social welfare program such as this we must recognize that the due process clause can be thought to inte rpose bar only if the statute manifests patently arbitrary classification utte rly lacking in rational justification thus only if congress were to act in totally irrational and arbitrary manner would due process considerations invalidate subsequent amendment17 the court reiterated this view in united states railroad retirement board v fritz 449 us 166 1980 wherein it upheld congressional amendments to railroad retirement benefits that reduced benefits for some beneficiaries and eliminated benefits for others these changes were challenged under the due process clause on the ground that they irrationally distinguished between classes of annuitants however the court held that because congress could ve eliminated benefits for all classes of employees it was not constitutionally imper missible to draw lines between groups of employees for the purpose of phasing out the benefits the court said where as here there are plausible reasons for c ongress acti on our i nquiry is at an end the court added that drawing lines between categories of beneficiaries is matter for legislative rather than judicial consideration id at 17918018httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32822crs6 18 continued person who invoked his fifth amendment privile ge against selfincrimination was arbitrary

security reform current issues and reform by dawn nuschler 20 examples of this may be found in two 109th congress bills s 1750 which proposed to create legally enforceable guarantee for current retirees and workers born before 1950 to receive the level of their monthly social secu rity benefits as determined on the date of entitlement plus applicable costofliving increas for the rest of their lives and related bill hr 1164 which would have provided the same guarantee for all individuals eligible for social security benefits under title ii current retirees and workers upon being approved to receive benefits would under these proposals have received certificates guaranteeing the level of benefits that were in effect at the time of retirement certificates would have constituted budget authority in ad vance of appropriations acts and would have represented the obligation of the federal gove rnment to provide for the payment of social security benefits to individuals to whom cer tificates were issued in amounts in accordance with the guarantee as set forth in the certific ates similar bills have been introduced in the 110th congress as of the date of this reportcongressional guarantee of social security benefit payments the social security program has faced funding shortfalls in the past and congress has enacted variety of measures to deal with financial imbalances19 given the clear judicial precedents to the effect that social security benefits under title ii are not property rights and cannot be categorized as contractual in nature the question may be raised whether congress could legislatively create new legally enforceable right to the receipt of certain level of benefits by individuals eligible for social security benefits20 legislative guarantee of certain level of social security benefit payments with corre sponding obligation upon future congresses for payment of such benefits would requi re either finding of contractual relationship between the fede ral government and indivi dual certificate holders the modification or repeal of which would be constitutionally impermissible or right stemming from congresss implied promise not to enact legislation in the future that would bind future congress in the sense that the legislative enactment guaranteeing social security benefit payments could not be repealed or altered congressional power to modify its own contracts legally enforceable guarantee of certain level of social security benefits set forth in legislation may be argued to create contract between the federal government and individual social security recipients it may be argued further that such contract constitutionally protects an individuals right to continue to recei ve full benefits and prohibits the federal government from ab rogating such contract by reducing or otherwise modifying the full payment of bene fits an individual is entitled to receive under article i 10 cl1 known as the c ontracts clause the states are forbidden to pass laws impairing the obligati on of contracts even as applied to the states since home building loan assn v blaisdell 290 us 398 1934

alteration especially when the right to alter laws is reserved thus congress in legal tender cases knox v lee 12 wall 79 us 457 1871 wa s held to have the authority to make treasury notes legal tender in paym ent of debts previously contracted for payment in gold and in norman v baltimore ohio r r 294 us 240 1935 congress was held to have th authority to invalidate provi sions in private contracts

292 us 571 1931 statute abrogating contracts of wa r risk insurance held invalid as applied to outstanding policies21 the relevant distinction here is that th federal government acting as sovereign

entrenchment and retroactivity 1987 am b found res j 379if recipients right under law to certain level of social secu rity benefits is to be viewed as contract between the recipient and the federal government this contract is arguably not in the class of contracts that the federal government enters into in its proprietary capacity as contr actor title ii recipi ents whether receiving old age survivors or disability insurance benefits have not by virtue of the receipt of this promise paid any money provided any service or thing of value in exchange for the governments guarantee not to reduce the recipients payments in the future the governments commitment is unilateral and it arguably remains subject to 1104 of the social security act which reserves the right of congress to revise or modify the social security act by subsequent legislation while cong ressional modification of the express terms of the promise in law not to reduce benefits is limited by due process considerations ch constitutional concerns impose bar only upon the enactment of an arbitrary modificati on that has rational justification congressional power to promise future deference it may be argued that congress by giving eligible individuals legislative guarantee of certain level of social security benefits can legally bi nd itself in the future to pay the full amount of such social security benefits plus colas to certificate holders there is doubt that congress may validly enact such provision and promise to pay full social security benefits in the future congre ss may also provide for funding mechanism and judicial recourse for noncompliance thereafter congress may decide to take whatever measures necessary to fulfill such promise the undeniably strong moral duty to do so however would not trump th underlying constitutional principle that legislative enactment such as this cannot bind future congress in the sense that the legislative enactment cannot be repealed or altered23 the principle asserted is that one legislature is competent to repeal any act which former legislature was competent to pass and that one legislat ure cannot abridge the powers of succeeding legislature the correctness of this principle so far as respects general legislation can never be controverted fletcher v peck 6 cr 10 us 87 135 1810 chief justice marshall to be sure some congressi

available in an appropriation or fund for the expenditure or obligation b involve either government in c ontract or obligation for the payment of money before an appropriation is ma unless authorized by law the antideficiency act prohibits making expenditures either in excess of an amount available in fund or before an appr opriation is made it would appear to bar paying more money in benefits than the am ount of the balance in the social security trust funds primarily because as noted ear lier disability and oldage and survivor benefit payments shall be made only from the disability insurance trust fund and the old age and survivors insurance trust fund respectively34 violations of the antidef iciency act are punishable by administrative and criminal penalties an officer or employee who violates the acts prohibitions is subject to appropriate administrative discipline including when circumstances warrant suspension from duty wit hout pay or removal from office35 an officer orhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32822crs12 36 31 usc 1350 employee who knowingly and willfully violat the act can be fined not more than 5000 imprisoned for not more than two years or both36 after the social security trust funds become insolvent ie unable to pay scheduled benefits in full on timely basis it appears that beneficiaries who would file suit to be paid the difference between the amount that receipts allow paying and the full benefit amount to which they ar entitled would not be likely to succeed in getting the difference the supreme court in reeside v walker 53 us 11 how 272 275 1850 held that officer of the g overnment is authorized to pay any debt due from the united states whether reduced to court judgment or not unless an appropriation has been made fo r that purpose to support its holding the court cited article i section 9 clause 7 of the cons titution which states that money shall be drawn from the treasury but in conse quence of appropriations made by law the court reaffirmed this principle in office of personnel management v richmond 496 us 414 424426 1990 consequently unless congress amends applicable laws it appears that benefi ciaries would have to wait until the trust funds receive an amount sufficient to pay full benefits to receive the difference between the amount that can be paid from the trust funds and the full benefit amount conclusion the old age survivors and disability insurance program is statutory entitlement program beneficiar ies have legal right to r eceive benefits if they meet the social security acts eligibility requirements congress has however reserved the right to alter amend or repeal any provision of this socia l security act and the us supreme court has affirmed congresss power to modify provisions of the social security act in flemming v nestor 363 us 603 1960 and in subsequent court decisions the social security program does not accord individuals either vested property rights or cont ractual rights with regard to future benefits congress may modify provisions of the social security act as it exercises its constitutional power to provide for the general welfare congress has the power to legislatively guarantee to pay eligible individuals certain level of social security benefits and not to reduce that level of benefits to such individuals in the future while congress may decide to take whatever measures necessary to fulfill such oblig ation courts would be unlikely to find congresss unilateral promise to constitute contract that could not be modified or abrogated in the future congressional modification of the terms of guarantee to pay certain level of benefits would be limited by due process considerations however such constitutional concerns would impose bar only upon the enactment of an arbitrary modification that has rational justification in addition congressional promise not to reduce speci fic level of social security benefits payable to certain eligible individuals would not overcome the constitutional principle that legislative enactment in social welfare program cannot bind future congress in the sense that the legislative enactment cannot be re pealed or altered httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32822crs13 the trustees of the old age and survivors insurance trust fund and the disability insurance trust fund have project ed that these funds on combined basis will be exhausted ie unable to pay full benefits on time in 2040 the social security administration would not be able to pay beneficiaries full benefits at that time because the social security act states that benefits shall be paid only from the social security trust funds social s ecurity administration officials are bound by the antideficiency act which prohibits paying amounts that exceed the amount available in the source of funds available to pay them although the legal right of beneficiaries to receive full benefits would not be extinguished by the insufficient amount of funds in the social security trust funds court suit to obtain the difference between the amount in the social security trust funds available to pay partial benefits and the fu ll benefit amount would not be likely to succeed in getting the difference the supreme court has held that officer of the government may pay debt whether reduced to cour t judgment or not unless congress has appropriated funds to pay it consequently unless c ongress amends applicable laws it appears that beneficiarie s would have to wait until the trust funds receive an amount sufficient to pay full benefits to receive the difference between the amount that can be paid from the trust funds and the full benefit amount
