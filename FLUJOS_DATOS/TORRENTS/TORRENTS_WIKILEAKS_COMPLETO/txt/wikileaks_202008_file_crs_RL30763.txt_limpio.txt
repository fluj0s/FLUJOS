association economic impact us direct marketing today 2003 executive summary httpwwwthedmaorglibrary federal laws in recent years several federal laws that deal directly with telemarketing issues have been enacted each of the laws has different focus relative to telemarketing but all attempt to limit or prohibit certain abusive fraudulent or deceptive practices because both the federal communications commission fcc and the federal trade commission ftc are responsible for different aspects of telemarketing both agencies were directed to promulgate regulations the fcc generally covers consumers privacy rights relative to telemarketing practices and the use of the telephone system by telemarketers to transmit information whether via facsimile machine automated dialing mechanisms recorded calls or by live person the ftc is concerned more with the content and consequences of the call and its regulations focus on whether certain sales practices are misleading fraudulent or deceptive individual states have passed laws relating to telemarketing practices within state crs2 telephone consumer protection act of 1991 tcpa the tcpa pl 102243 was signed by president bush on december 20 1991 it was the first of the six federal laws passed dealing specifically with telemarketing issues this act directed the federal communications commission to issue rules balancing the fair business practices of telemarketers with the privacy concerns of consumers some of the provisions of the fcc rules resulting from this act are as follows telemarketing companies must maintain donotcall list for calls placed to residential telephone numbers if consumer requests that hisher name be placed on such list the company must honor the request for 10 years nonprofit and charitable organizations are exempted from this provision and the rules do not apply to calls placed to business telephone numbers if consumers name is on companys donotcall list and the company places more than one call to that consumer in the year after the consumer has been placed on the list the consumer may if heshe wishes sue the telemarketer in state court usually small claims court should consumer pursue court action heshe should maintain records of all calls and contacts with the company telephone solicitations to private residences may only be made between the hours of 800 am and 900 pm use

patient room in hospital health care facility or home for the elderly any phone number assigned to paging service or cellular telephone or services for which the person called would be charged for the call are prohibited unless prior consent was given to receive such calls prerecorded artificial voice calls to private homes are prohibited however such calls are permitted if the person called has consented to receive such calls the call is noncommercial from charitable nonprofit political or polling organization or government agency the entity calling has an established business relationship with person called or the call is an emergency such calls to business numbers are permitted any person or entity making telephone solicitation to private home must provide the name of the individual caller the name of the person or entity on whose behalf the call is being made and telephone number or address where that person or entity may be contacted crs3 any person or business using autodialers or prerecorded artificial voice calls including calls placed to businesses must state its identity at the beginning of the message and its telephone number or address during or after the message autodialer calls may not lock onto phone line within five seconds of phone being hung up the autodialer must release the phone line in some areas of the country due to different telephone system technologies this release may take longer customers should check with their local telephone company for additional information calls transmitting unsolicited advertisements to home or business fax machines are prohibited unless permission has been granted to do so or there is an established business relationship any message sent to fax machine must include the date and time the transmission is sent identity of the sender and the telephone number of the sender or the sending fax machine the fccs initial final rule can be found in the federal register of october 23 1992 on pages 4833336

httpwwwfccgovcgbconsumerfactsunwantedfaxeshtml unwanted faxes or httpwwwfccgovcgbconsumerfactstelemarketscamhtml telemarketing scams 2002 fcc tcpa review on september 12 2002 the fcc announced that it would review its existing telemarketing rules due to changes in telemarketing practices and the introduction of advanced technologies enabling new marketing techniques the fcc noted that these new practices and technologies have increased concerns about consumer privacy1 the commission sought public comment on issues such as the need to revise its rules to more effectively follow the directions of congress provided in the tcpa concerning balancing privacy rights public safety interests and commercial freedom of speech revising or adding to its rules concerning autodialers prerecorded messages and fax advertisements the effectiveness of company donotcall lists and the creation of national donotcall list the federal trade commission also considered establishment of national donotcall list however since the ftc is prohibited by statute from regulating certain industries banks credit unions savings and loans common carriers and insurance companies for example an fcc national donotcall list applies to industries not covered by an ftc list the fcc considered creation of national donotcall database during promulgation of tcpa rules in 1 in the matter of rules and regulations implementing the telephone consumer protection act of 1991 fcc 02250 federal communications commission adopted sept 12 2002 released sept18 2002 available via the fcc website at httpwwwfccgov crs4 1992 it decided not to create such database at the time because of issues such as cost maintaining the accuracy of such system security of telemarketer proprietary information and privacy of telephone subscribers with unlisted or unpublished numbers instead the fcc required companies to maintain their own donotcall lists summary of the fccs proposed rule review appeared in the federal register on october 8 2002 on pages 6266762681 comments relating to the review were due by november 22 2002 following the federal trade commissions december 18 2002 announcement of its amendments to the telemarketing sales rule the fcc extended the reply comment period to january 31 2003 the extension was to ensure that all interested parties could take the ftc actions into account before submitting their comments 2003 fcc update of tcpa rules and creation of national donot call registry on june 26 2003 the fcc announced that it would establish national donotcall registry covering both interstate and intrastate calls the fcc noted that its update of the tcpa rules does not require states to discontinue their individual donotcall registries but any state donotcall registry must include the name of any of its residents that are in the national database states may adopt more restrictive laws relating to intrastate telemarketing but may not establish practices less restrictive than the federal regulations as with the ftc rules consumers may continue to request that their names be added to individual company donotcall lists if they so choose on the other hand consumers may also provide written permission to specific companies from which they wish to receive telemarketing calls even if they are on the national registry the registry became effective on october 1 2003 when consumers could also begin registering complaints if necessary telemarketers may continue to call consumers with whom they have an established business relationship the fcc definition of established business relationship would permit company to contact customer for 18 months following business transaction and for three months following an inquiry or application however the company may not call the customer again if the customer requests to be put on the companys donotcall list the updated tcpa rules also included additional restrictions on predictive dialers in an attempt to reduce dead air and quick hangup calls by requiring that more than 3 of all calls placed and answered by person may be abandoned in addition when call is abandoned within the 3 range the telemarketing company must provide prerecorded message identifying the company also prohibited is the blocking of caller id information fax rules under the new rules before transmitting an unsolicited fax advertisement the sender must obtain written permission from the intended recipient before sending the fax however following the release of the new fax rule many businesses and nonprofits felt that the language of the rule was vague and would require them to get written permission from every one of their customers and members before sending any kind of fax to them even if the customer or member expected and was used to getting faxes from the company or nonprofit according to various companies and nonprofits the cost of obtaining permission from crs5 thousands of customers or members would be quite high and an administrative burden as result petitions were filed with the fcc to delay the implementation of the rule scheduled to go into effect on august 25 2003 and reconsider the language on august 19 the fcc announced that it would postpone implementation of the fax rule until january 1 2005 only implementation of the fax rule was postponed all other new telemarketing rules took effect as planned as result of pending congressional action concerning the fax rules the fcc released an order on october 1 2004 that extends its stay of the fax rules until june 30 20052 exemptions taxexempt nonprofit organizations and calls concerning political and religious speech are exempt from the fccs tcpa rules in addition consumers may still receive calls that are not commercial in nature or do not include unsolicited advertisements although banking insurance telecommunications and airline companies were exempt from the ftcs rules they are not exempt from these updated fcc telephone consumer protection act rules since the federal trade commission had previously announced the establishment of national donotcall registry the fcc will implement its rules in conjunction with the ftc the ftc will administer the national database with both agencies coordinating enforcement activities there will not be two separate national registries the fcc provides information on the updated tcpa rules at its website at httpwwwfccgovcgbdonotcall synopsis of the new fcc rules appeared in the federal register on july 25 2003 pp 4414444179 court challenge on july

exempt from the tsr see above notably those that consumers have given permission to contact them placing name on the list would not stop all telemarketing calls details concerning the procedures and operation of the national list were addressed during review of the ftc proposal4 in addition the ftc proposed that telemarketers be prohibited from blocking caller id systems that telemarketers be prohibited from obtaining consumers credit card or other account number from anyone but the consumer or from improperly sharing that number with anyone else for use in telemarketing and that use of
