3ga listing by tiger lecture given on 2 october 1962 thank you youll have to pardon for being late it was really quite an emergency you see there was gary cooper and he was all by himself you know and he was fighting off these indians gary you know he actually was raised next door to in helena montana it was very very funny to see him done up like rudolph valentino in the old 8millimeter movies you know from way back i run one off for the kids every night and even theyre starting to laugh well the subject of our lecture this evening this is the 2nd of october i think i hope youre in the same day as im in if youve been listed on these lines today telling what day youre in this is the 2nd of october ad 12 saint hill special briefing course lecture number one and the subject of this lecture is listing by tiger buttons3ga this replaces and you can to all intents and purposes destroy your notes of lecture number two 28 september ad 12 because since that time you have had complete revisal male voice 27th twentyseventh your notes of the 27th of september second lecture first lecture stands i made them that wayfigured thered be something that youd get into and you did because after that lecture you asked enough foolish questions and pronounced enough imponderables that it was very obvious that the work which i had been doing slowly and casually on listing had to be done in hurry so you cost my weekend and there will be fee at something on the order of 430 am monday i was just finishing this work up this was quite sprint there were many things wrong with listing there are many things right with listing and we must remember first and foremost that the old type of listing we were doingwriting down the buttonsanswers pardon writing down the answers to lines on four lineswho or what would want goal who or what would not want goal who or what would oppose goal who or what would not oppose goalbrought lot of people to free needles on these lines and made firstgoal clears it had to be in the presence of very smooth auditing it had to be in the presence of good auditing and wherever any rough auditing occurrednow pr tell you what happened to these four lineswhere any rough auditing occurred of any kind whatsoever you got jamup and the tone arm started up toward 45 or 50 which is standard position for tough stick thats standard position if youve got somebodys tone arm riding 45 or 50 during listing session and it just goes on riding there and on and on and on riding there man that is wrong something is very wrong as i will go into in this lecture but in the presence of rough auditing pc suppresses and in that suppression is able to produce sen and longer gets pain even when hes listing on the right goal thats quite important because right goal can be listed so roughly with the presence of sufficient rough auditing that itll look like wrong goal and of course in the presence of the smoothest auditing in the world the same phenomenon takes place when youre trying to list wrong goal but in other words rough auditing during listing session can make goal look wrong fire wrong act wrong and otherwise raise the devil with the ease and everything connected with it anyway there is substitute for good auditing see theres substitute for good auditing and good auditor now whats odd is that there are lots of people in scientology whose goals are not answered up to or compared to or measure up to or declare that they should be active in scientology who are in scientology and who are doing very good auditing its not true that everybody in scientology is dictated to be there because of their goal one way or the other thats lot oflot of nonsense but it also is true that goals very often assist people to be good auditor lets saylets have somebody with goal to listen to peoples troubles or something like that he wont be as smooth an auditor as somebody who has goal to build mountains or something but he will still have some little special skills of one kind or another that pcs will find quite quite attractive you understand and then there is the broad majority of goals of people in scientology which are just neutral i mean they dont necessarily make them better auditors and they dont necessarily make them worse auditors and that is the majority and then there is small group minority whose goals are in opposition to scientology who feel desperately that if their goals were ever to be achieved it would be over the dead body of scientology in other words as long as scientology exists why theyll never make it you see in other words their oppterm is scientology and those people make very rough auditors theyre practically unteachable its terrible and they also stop auditing and theyll do that sort of thing you determine what people these are just with your rock slam testyou know your hcob that gives you the new security checkwhich would just rock slam you know consider committing overts against and then you say well scientology the organization your auditor ron you get rock slam on one or more of those things you got somebody whod be awfully hard to train and who will make very lousy auditor until youve got that goal you just take it from ive watched them now ive watched lot of them ive wondered why is it that some of these people can audit and why is it that some of these people cant audit and why is it that the vast majority of people in scientology can audit well the goal sometimes assists sometimes retards and the vast majority has influence now the rock slam test takes care of the only part of it we have great interest in which is the people who cant audit the reason they cant audit is just that they can never get grooved in on the subject of auditing theyre always doing something weird in auditing the pc says something and they jump down their throats one way or the other they louse up what the pc does or says you understand and what they do is either add or omit and they never just audit they add or omit give you an idea pc gives him an item centipede all right the auditor who has an oppgoal to scientology says chrysanthemum and the pc says centipede and the auditor says well how does pchow does centipede answer the question who or what would have many feet well ive got it now naturopath and the pc says centipede centipede centipede centipede centipede see youve got missed withhold going here see and the auditor says have i missed withhold on you in this session well you havent taken this item that couldnt be it the missed withhold must be earlier well things like this happen in auditing well you start mucking that into listing session or never acknowledging anything the pc says he does 465 items see 465 items and finally he gets an acknowledgment which is mmhm see now thats an omission but you can use an acknowledgment the same way to just louse it up like crazy all of sudden the pc gets horrible gleam in his eye who or what would have many feet you know and my god he thinks of armies and centipedes and so forth and this avalanche is just about ready to roar you know just about ready to roar and he says centipede and the auditor says thank you the pc says uhehyeah all rightuhan arm thank you and the pc says what was i talking about where did they go what part of the roof didnt fall in get the idea well therefore in view of the fact that errors of one kind or another can interrupt listing session and in view of the fact that pc protest arc breaks and rough auditing can make goal simplywell it can be found againbut it makes the goal turn on sen look like wrong goal make the pc upset not go clear thats the main thing thats wrong he can list for months and months and months and months and months and he wouldnt go clear under this type of auditing in view of that fact we required type of listing which permitted minimal chance of error on the part of the auditor see so an auditorsan auditor would get minimally in the pcs road and we have it in 114 line listing listing by tiger buttons we will call it and we have that for this reason the auditor doesnt comm lag by writing the item down he simply makes little strike on card he cant forget the auditing command because its right on the card in front of him and all hes trying to do is get all the items he can on the cardnow this is important to you because it isnt in the bulletinhes trying to get all the items he can on the card without dragging the pc into an overlist he doesnt want this pc to go into long comm lag or feel badgered so items become missed withholds the only judgment the auditor has to make is is he demanding more items than the pc has or is he cutting the pc off before the pc has given him all he has and that is the only point of judgment in this listing that is the single most important point of judgment does he shut the pc off before the pc has given all items pc easily has or does he badger the pc into giving more items than the pc has on that line because hell drag the pc on the second case of demanding more items than the pc has available into condition of invalidate items when theyre overlisted feel invalidated so the pc becomes very doubtful and everything becomes unreal and in the earlier case the first case of cutting the pc off before the pc can give all of his items the auditor introduces sen so you see demanding more items than the pc has produces invalidation unreality on the part of the pc you understand then and keeping the pc from giving you all the items the pc has produces sen so if the condition of the pc degenerates on listing by tiger buttons into total sensation and pain you know that the auditor is demanding more items from the pc than the pc has you understand if hes got an unreality growing up you know that the pc is being made to overlist let put it that way very straightly dont want to mix you up on it 1 myself havent got it out here in front of you understand for instance pc will list on flow and hell list as long as the flow is flowing but when the flow stops flowing he is then listing against backflow which brings about sensation of invalidation because the items which are backflowing against the items which he is trying to give see causes an unreality to take place he doesnt think any item hes giving you is the right item for that line do you see that audience yeah so if you run this flow too long in any one direction by demanding more items than the pc has the pc will begin to think that the items hes giving you are unreal because the sensation of invalidation occurs when line has been made to flow too long in one direction now on the other side of the picture on the other side of this is you keep the pc from giving you the items he has then you put him on whole string of missed withholds he protests the session and turns on sensation so the two things you can expect principally and primarily from rough or bad auditing on pc where the auditor is getting in the pcs road most god awfullyit has to be pretty extreme most of you are sitting there thinking well you drop your pencil once in while and this upsets the whole session ityou have to stand back of session that is really being run by somebodyjust whisper scientology at him and the well you know it isnt the needle that rock slams you see the needle doesnt rock slam what happens is both ears rock slam and both eyeballs rock slam see ah you watch him trying to give session hell pull one or the other of these things and it has to be awfully extreme before it starts really showing up its colossal the little blunders that you make from time to time and so forth that isnt going to upset anybody you pick them up in the end ruds and so on but you start this kind of thing see this big avalanche and the pcs got centipedes armies so forth and these things are just sort of stacked up in the slot and theyre all ready to go down the chute see he just wants to hand them out to you brrrrrrrr see like that and you say to the pcnot you but this auditor says to the pc the pc says centi thank you and the pc says aaararmies ararmies ararmies i think ar armies thank you very much now you dont have any more items do you for this line were getting awfully long on this particular list anyway lets see how many do we have here lets see awful lot its pretty bad youll see it youll start coaudit someday and youll see it youll actually see it with your naked bare eyes and youll be ashamed be fantastic we stand back of some coaudit untrained auditor and hell be trying to do this listing on somebody and honest they practically do everything but pull the wall off the wall and shove it in the pcs teeth now what happens to the pc the pc suppresses hes being made to suppress he suppresses the auditor he suppresses the list he suppresses everything and so on stacks himself up on bunch of missed withholds with all the consequences of the missed withholds because each item then that he didnt give you becomes missed withhold and the next thing you know this goal that has been turning on sen once in blue moon and pain all the time now turns on sen all the time and pain never and hes just going wog wog wog and you can take real goal and monkey it up this way and you can actually have the pc getting the walls out of plumb i was fooling around with some research one dayduring demonstration session withhold from youand i had been doing some research lines and id been trying to put some lines together and was doing some researchactually analogous to this bulletin but this was many weeks ago before i went to america i was sitting there and i had been of course fooling around with bogus goal you know and trying to list this bogus goal and it was actuallythe way i was working it out you knowi got to point trying to work out lines where i turned on motion and you dont just turn on motion so that you sort of feel like things are moving and theyre not or you get dizzy or something like that man you can turn on motion which is really interesting and while i was giving that session it was to reg there why i didnt miss any meter reads as you noticed butwell i never havebut thatthe meter was moving away from like this suddenly it was little bit hard to find out where to look for the needle and the tablethe table was going swoop and every once in while the floor would go the opposite direction swoop i knew what it was so it wasnt disturbing any it was just where was i supposed to put my eyes but pcs dont have that much equilibrium and they often get very worried when they walk down the street and have the sidewalk in the middle of the road and then back where they arent you got the idea they also will become sick and nauseated if theyre really roused up and if this is done on wrong goal youll just put the pc in the hospital supposing you had wrong goal and then you wrong listed it pc hospital i mean thats about all there is to that psychiatric special if this stuff ever got into the hands of psychiatrists why theyd have full institutions brother theyd make up their mind what goal it was so i myself through listing wrong goals and through fooling with goals in research have very good subjective reality on what can happen to somebody like this its very rough now the other one is not quite what you would be very familiar with its sort of hidden manifestation but have you ever seen one of these characters walking around who is totally doubtful all the time youve tried to sell them scientology i know that from time to time one of the ways to get to them when they do this to you you say well now well you help people see thats what we do in scientology you help people you know you do things for them you help people and they say well how do you know you really help them you know and studies of the mind are good really because i know because i had brother once and it was all pretty bad and so forth and what do the medical doctors think of this you know all this kind of stuff that goes on and on and on its very interesting youve only got to ask them on any analogous subject such as medicine you say well what do you think of medical doctors well i dont know well how does anybody know whats amusing is is this person is so disoriented in general is they will do the same thing with all subject and you think theyre talking about scientology theyre just talking and this is the way they talk see and because youre interested and sincere in what youre talking about you neveryou miss the boat all youve got to do is take your index finger and just shift the conversation about degree and get them to talking about psychiatry you get agreement see because the psychiatrists are good either see see and you gettheyre just like the wind in the willows you know any breath of air will blow that unreality around and its all unreal the sensation is its unreal those walls arent real they know that people have been kidding them other people pretend things are real but this only convinces them that everybody pretends you see they know that there are well people see they know everything is bad but basically it isnt real nothing is real now although this is phenomenon which can be produced by lessening the overt which is how its normally producedthings arent real to somebody who has many overts against those things see the personwell fellows been burning houses and hes been spending lifetimes burning houses and hesjust does nothing but burn houses you watch him go up to the front door of house someday and he cant even find the doorknob you know he tries to walk through wallshouses dont exist there arent any different kinds of houses its the most remarkable thing you see tremendous numbers of overts against some object or item or type of person brings about an unreality on the overters part for that thing see and it becomes totally unreal for instance i have this to some degree on religion myself and it traces immediately back to burning whirling dervishes i just got into bad habit you know whirling dervishes show up why you execute them you know that kind of thing i mean thats the wrong thing to do let tell you it produces an unreality on the subject of whirling dervishes see you go around whirling dervishes and they just are blurwhen theyre whirling and when theyre not whirling theyre thin you can see straight through them almost see thats under the phenomenon of they become unreal because one has overts against them thats the rationale back of this but the same exact phenomenon can be produced by causing person to outflow too long in one direction on goal line see so that he gets backflow inevitable you understand you see this dramatization in life as somebody does bad things in the community until people have to do bad things to him well some doghe goes around biting people or something like this for long time and eventually theyll do something to the dog you see this in real life that an individual committing overts has things committed on him see you see this in life people enforce this one but im not talking about that im talking about the simple thing of the fellow who throws bowling ball out in front of him long enough will mentally restimulate backflow against bowling balls and the way to make bowling balls unreal is just to keep throwing them away from you and never recovering them and they will eventually get totally unreal you see why you see that so when you make pc overlist what hes done is go out the flow line remember this is very aberrated zone of action in the pcs mind hes pretty spinny on these subjects hes very identified and overflown and he jammed up well if his goal was to be pinball machine hed have marvelous mess on the subject of everything was pinball machines and the basic purpose of everybody in existence was to do things to or with pinball machines dont you see and everything is identified with everything all purposes are identified with his purpose you see and youre going down this channel you are operating now in book ones aaa you see youre operating right where it lives and dont be surprised sometime if the pc has some weird identification and you just cant make any sense out of it at all yet the pc says its an identification he looks at you quite blandly and says well all ashtrays are just exactly like roofs you know that all ashtrays are roofs you know or all women are mothers he believes this you see but you could understand thathow he could get into that but now how all ashtrays are roofs you say this guy is unhinged someplace well of course youre operating in the zone and area of unhinged hinges theyre by the gross lot on the goals channel because hes got everything identified with everything and so on because his flow lines have been all overflown and backflown you see hes got whole lot of specialized flow linesall of them overreached all of them backflown on and so forth and when youre taking those things apart you must take them apart as to whats there you can only take apart whats there do you understand and although it looks to you the auditor as you sit there listing on pc that hes dreaming up these items and handing them to you hes looking right straight down one groove and itll be just one single bunches of file cards in the file machine you see there it is its just that many items and it goes right on down to that many items and one more item will regenerate backflow so that the last item he gives you he will now be doubtful about now he can put it down aswith perfect certainty centipede and then you cause him to list ten fifteen more items in that direction he hasnt got them man hes got to go in past the opposite flow which is now generated and flowing and reach around its like going upstream against roaring river dont you see and after while he kind of says to himself it isnt worth it theres nothing there you know the spray in his eyes and everything so you ask him for all these additional items and he hasnt got them centipede that he put down as totally real now seems not to belong on the list see he put it down as totally real and if you gave him the item back hed tell you i really dont think that that would want to walk i dont think so similarly the next ten fifteen items they just go i mean theyre so unreal theyll just start disappearing he wont even be able to tell you what item he has just said or anything like this when you overflow this but the basic thing im trying to get to is you can produce total unreality on the part of the pc you can make him feel just like he is in world which doesnt exist now there are characters around whose world doesnt exist and who dont exist in any world of anything to them you run into brick walls but this pc never does see never seems to be able to run into brick wall of course hes always coming in scratched and contused but he cant tell you how see brick walls are unreal thats his difficulty and of course he always runs into themthey dont exist but his reaction toward life is uncertainty and insecurity so making pc list too many items brings about mental framework of insecurity unreality doubtfulness and of course that extends over to the auditor it extends over to auditing it extends over to everything so you could get guys goal and then list him wrong and have him believing at the other end of the line that scientology was totally unreal that itd never done anything for him i mean you could list him into hole to that degree now the weight factor of overweightness and so forth also belongs on the other side of this thats not letting somebody give you the items you can actually put pounds on somebody by continuing to miss the withholds isnt that interesting increase somebodys weight with this kind of auditing now smooth auditing would decrease somebodys weight definitely now do you see then these are justthese are the two major factors there are probably other things you can do you could confuse pc you can get him wogwog so you start in on the line who or what would want to catch catfish the pc answers who or what would want to catch catfish and you say youre answering not want to catch catfish you ask him who or what would want to catch catfish and then all of sudden you make mistake and the pche doesnt know see so hes sort of on notknow see you can produce confusion you can produce various things but theyre not as serious as these other two phenomena now therefore this type of listing is designed to minimize the amount of time necessary to record the fact that the pc is giving you items and that is its first advance lot of you have asked from time to time why we wrote them down at all well we had to record them in some fashion and i wasnt yet sure that we wouldnt have to do something about them and ive become sure we dont have to do anything with these items so therefore all you want is tally system you do have to have some check on parity to find lines are overlisted or underlisted you do have to have this so all you need there is tally system and ive introduced the crudest tally system there can be which is four slants and bar and if you will look down at your right hand youll find you have five fingers and man counts ably its instinctive you go slant slant slant slant crossbar you know that mans method of counting is based on five not ten see you know that you can conceive five objects just like that science was by the way trying to prove fifteen or twenty years ago that man could not conceive more than four and i didnt go into the root of this thing but i think it was being put out by some sociological electronics computer man who had thumb because the one thing you can count with glanceyou can count five as matter of fact there are four hinges on these doors and one lock if you consider the lock huge lock you can certainly grasp that number at glance so five is the easiest recording number its instinctive now thats chosen not because auditors are stupid but because auditors becoming involved with pc and so forth havent got all their attention on numbers so ive taken the most basic unit or cluster figure which is five so an auditor wont be thrown by it hes trying to handle pc whos having hell of time pcs squirming all over the floor and falling out of the chair and arc breaking and writhing and all that sort of thing well hes liable to get completely blooey on the subject of tallying but if you give him an instinctive tally figure that is an idiots figure you know he can keep on doing that without any attention you got the idea thats why thats chosen now that introduces slowdown that introduces slowdown and it gives the auditor time to watch his meter and its behavior and also keep up his auditors report and give the pc attention now most listing sessions the auditor has become so engrossed in writing things down that he has not been able to give enough attention to the session itself and so has lost control of his pc but if youre good at this you can take and you can look straight at the pc who is giving you five items lets say and you can go one two three four five strike you see you dont need to look at what youre doing to record it see that in other words has been reduced to an idiot simplicity you know its very interesting the research ive done on this it was up as high as 182 lines over the weekend and i had one systemyou can probably all think up better systems maybe one way or the other but i dont think you can think up simpler ones than this thats the one that takes genius anyway i thought of getting tabulator but every time the pc said something you stepped with your thumb on something you see so all you had to do was shift your thumb every time the pc said an item and then before you turned the card over you simply wrote the figure that was on the tabulator on your card and turned it over see thats very nice theres only one thing wrong with it it clicks they will inevitably click so the most silent meansand furthermore its mechanical you have to have something furthermore mechanical things often break and this requires minimum it requires pencil and some cards now one of the big things i had trouble getting over and it isnt totally solved how to make maximum number of items on one card without having to rewrite the card see well frankly this is not totally covered in the bulletin but you dont have to rewrite the whole card list you can get by overstrikes with three colors of pencil use because you can always see group you probably couldnt see the little individual slant lines if you had black one and red one and green one dont you see on top of each other but you can see theres black red green you see and the card is totally filled with black red green youve still got an approximation even though it was very badly done you get the idea i mean now the way to do that isnt in this bulletin that card which totally fills up you take stapler and you staple to it another card and rewrite that one line on the face of your fresh card so they turn over two at crack you understand and that doesnt let it all get separated out from underneath you now that will oddly enough leave you rewriting only some cards in other words you dont have to rewrite the whole list all the way down thats one of the easy ways to get on it now the odd partheres another one if you dont even want to rewrite the line you can take card that is less wide which still exposes the line and staple that onto the front of your filledup card you understand i dont care what you do with this but you can do this job with stapler now i wouldnt worry much about the backs of cards if you turn the card overif you turn the card overyou have lost sight of its overlistedness you can make little mistake there dont you see because this card turned over looks just like any card face up until you turn it over you follow audience uhhuh becauseand it looks like its single card whereas if youve got double width card comes up with this thing its immediately called to your attention that this line is awfully long do you see how that would be this line is pretty doggone long if youve got double card in your hand whereas this would not be observable to you if you had only one card turned over with the line written on the reverse side of it again well now these thingswe probably will do things to them youll probably find things change but ive gone over this pretty thoroughly and tried to reduce it down through its cycle all things go from complex from somewhat complex to more complex to simple basis youve seen this time and time again in scientology well run this cycle im bring out something thats very simple some auditor will be complete idiot with it im find out its not totally workable some goofball things will occur some pcs will have some hard luck with it and so pr make it more complicated see and then add the things that you mustnt do to it and then push it on forward into more complicated and all of sudden the whole thing falls downstairs to becoming simpler than it was in the first place well ive tried to make this listing run that cycle over the last weekend and i did it one time i had it up to 182 lines in other words i was cutting itit went way up the complexities were terrificand then cut it back to simplicity now as you sit there listing several questions will occur to you how often should you use this question that is on the card to the pc how often should you use this well you use it as often as the pc isnt answering it easily in other words your pc says centipede an army and black cat and you say thats fine thank you and you didnt get any comm lag there did you comm lag but he stopped he isnt still thinking particularly hes looking at you now he thinks hes done his duty dont you see so you ask him the question again and he says there arent any more now you think well thats going to leave an unanswered auditing question and sure enough it could but he wont tell you there arent any more until you really start straining him now the question youre trying to answer is how often should you ask the auditing command dont you see how often should you ask this thing how often should you repeat it and how hard should you pound on the pcs head in order to get answers well in actual fact you only want answers until he comm lags hard over them the comm lag is going to be followed by an invalidate his comm lag will end up with trying to find the right one and trying to find the right one will move over into an invalidation of anything do you see so your symptom of the pc having been driven too faralready driven too far is he cant get the right word hes trying to think of the right word now that isnt phenomenon of the mind that is an overrun of flow and youve already ridden him too far on that flow youve goofed that is classifiable as goof dont you see so where you want to stop is the comm lag which precedes that phenomenon the pc is saying centipede and ahahhmmah aahhmm ah and if you just let him go on with that why hell say well im trying to think of the right word for it is his next stage see and if you let that go through and he thought of the right word for it then the item he gives you after that is not the right item at all see first its the wrong word then its wrong item comm lag wrong word then wrong item see thats the way hes going to answer you up on these things so you got to catch him at that moment when he is just about to comm lag and hasnt done so very critically do you understand that actually then requires some sensitivity on the part of the auditor thats why ive unburdened the necessity of the auditor in hcob october 1stunburdened the auditors attention on the writing down lists and that sort of thing because thats the critical point now if the pc says there arent any more items on that line this is not balk do you understand something about listing pcs never balk do you understand that pcs never balk they can be overdriven or distracted to the point where theyre not insession but if theyre even vaguely in session they just never balk theyre not balking at listing do you understand pc will not balk at listing he will always give you an item or another item or three items or four items but he can be prevented from listing see the balk isnt there but the prevention is there and if you look at it in this framework both doing auditing and supervising auditing youll see where the goofs occur do you follow that you see pc balkingapparently seejust recognize pcs dont balk pcs have to be prevented from listing see the balk is just an apparency and theres something there thats preventing the pc from listing and it isnt in the pcs head its either the lines are wrongsomebodys written up his lines like who andwho or what would want to help not suppress because he didnt catch catfish and the poor pc is saying the line was never cleared with him in the first place you see nobody came along and said to him well can you answer this line as the first time the line comes up on the pile you see all right here it is who or what would want to run away when centipedes arent catching suppresshelp he says huh the lines are wrong or the auditor is actively preventing him from being insession session started out like this he got into the body of the session the needle was free everything was clean got the goal firing the goal fired beautifully and so forth and the pc is all sitting there and hes getting steamed up he knows just where he is theyre going to start on the create see he already knew this because he knew the bulletin or something and hes going to start on the create and hes already got the first item there see candy machine see and hes actually been thinking of this as the next item hes about to say you know hes just waiting all you have to do you knowall you have to do is just open that stack of cards at the right place and youre going to get candy machine see bang and the auditor says well now all right now lets get in the middle rudiments for this session you know that confounded candy machine will go through the rest of the session itll go clear around till they get around to it again and itll come up some day or another on suppress hes prevented from listing so pcsjust as rule of thumb on the thingfrom your standpoint as supervisor an auditors instructor and in auditing and so forththey just never balk theyre prevented and you look not for something thats wrong with the pc you look for something thats wrong with that listing session or whats going on in it because listen you list lines on pc its something like putting button in candy machine see penny goes down the slot hits the button in the machine something in there whirs and some candy comes out the bottom of the machine only this machine never breaks you cant ask him for anything on his goal line without him giving it to you you just cant do it you see its very nearly impossible unless when you ask him you wont let him give it to you you have to get in there with little sledgehammer and monkey up the chute you know you have to feed it an irish penny or something there ought to be ought on this he has to be prevented because frankly he just will deal these things out like professional gambler dealing cards he just cant help himself hell just deal deal deal deal deal deal deal deal deal deal deal you just turn up the stack there and you read the auditing command and youre going to get answers if youre anything on the beam at all once in while youll get into trouble because hes got two buttons of the tiger drill crossed that is to say you should be running suppress at this stage of the game and you arent and you figure it would be q and to go back to the suppress section and do anything about it and so on but youve already done something wrong if you get to that state youve already done something wrong if youve got two buttons mixed up or something see somethings already gone haywire with the auditing well the thing to do is just sit there and list get your rudiments in get the goal to fire make the pc happy and cheerful and sit there with your pencil alert and your stack just right and dont drop them on the floor just sit there and deal them off and ask the question and the pc says an army centipede bulldozer auhuhm thats about all i can think of and you say thank you very much and you turn the card and you ask the next question see just as neat as that and then you say now who or what would oppose catching catfish and he says oppose catching catfish and you say yes thats right dont make him give himself the auditing command dont you see the rules of auditing all apply in listing and you say all right yes thats right who or what would oppose say it softly so as not to blow him out of the water but give him the command he obviously hadnt got it hes muttering it see and you say who or what would oppose catching catfish and he says aahhmhmhmhm who or what would oppose catfish yeah thats right who or what would oppose catching catfish hmmf he says gamei dont quite get the wordpatrolman patrolman game patrolman patrolman patrolman warden and you say tick thank you very much and get the hell off of it man you got an answer to your auditing command see and you were lucky because that line was hanging fire right on the comm lag and you opened it up on the comm lag you understand get one item i sometimes ease the crush on pc by saying well just give one so the auditing question will be answered oh he says very happily game warden gives you some old item game warden you say all right well thats fine thank you get how the thing goes but the whole attitude of the session must be one which permits the pc to list items and if you want to know how to list then delete all out of it that prevents the pc from listing and youll find out this is what has happened here on this listing by tiger buttons theres practically everything out of it that prevents listing still leaving those things in it which make people clear now the wholewhole aspect then of listing auditor is somebody who is in benign control benign control now get this as definite difference to sec checking you say now have you ever robbed bank and the pc goes clang on the emeter and you say to the pc come on come on have you ever robbed bank i got read here whatever robbed bank and he says hohohohohaha not clang i as matter of fact i was the victim of bank robber one time uhuhi was actually in company that had bank that was robbed and they really did in and of course the sec check auditor is not worth his salt who wouldnt have said at that time done man done you know done have younow listen carefullyyou have you you you you the one sitting right in the chair you now you got that now now listen carefully robbedrobbed bank now thats the question now now im going to ask it on the meter have you robbed bank all right thats null thank you very much or clang all right what is it man what is it now what bank what bank come on give here man give give give you know you know you dont do that with listing there are different types of auditing appropriate to all occasions benign control youre running an airy session where were all pals together and sometimes the items are funny too and sometimes theyre very sad nobody is asking you the auditor to shed crocodile tears in sympathy with the pc but dont go laughing like bunch of goons when hes saying dying mother perishing infant starving puppy dont sit there going to pieces you see sometimes i know it exerts your control because you know what hell be doing few minutes later hell say starving mother you know another list this will come up who or what is damn good you see thatll come up on that list different frame of mind all right sobut the listing auditor is in benign control now actually benign control is far harder to exercise than very harsh cop 8 c guy is insession and doesnt even know it doesnt even think of being out of session auditor isnt in his way its little velvet little finger that nudges him back into session when he starts steering out well weif the pc is saying oh god i dont know i mean these pains through my stomach theyre just terrible i mean the pain have we got to list any more today just one or two more items you know and i thought moment ago my heart was going to stop or my umbilical cord was going to go to pieces man and you say all right all right all right now look weve just got few more here so forth just got few more here lets finish those up after all weve got few minutes left in the session you know thats the way you handle people under listing see persuasion its coaxing its the old smoothie and the way not to handle them is just to sit back who or what would want to catch catfish and yet you could very easily get into an overwhelm frame of mind the boisterousness the behavior of the pc is very often quite overwhelming the pc all of sudden goes into conniption fits of one kind or another the pcs interest is sometimes as burning as blowtorch you know like somebody said one time about somebody listing here early on the course and and the pc told all aboutall about spaceships and exactly how they worked and so forth this was girl that was auditing him that had wellknown antipathy to mechanicisms and the pc told all about spaceships and how they went and how they were built and everything else and you know if id had the money right there in session i would have bought one you know they get interested man now the only thing that can make pc disinterested in auditing off these lines is the auditor the auditors enter something in there now this is skill this is type of auditing it has to be pretty well done it has to be pretty well controlled the more you interject into an auditing session the sorrier youre going to be and you just sit there and get them off and keep the pc at it and doing it and youre interested and everything is fine the atmosphere is fine and the pc is insession so forth man hell just go ripping through at high rate of speed and if you sit there stopping him from listing paying attention to bunch of simple simonisms he hasnt answered the auditing command see he went erahergame game not gameuhuhuhno that wouldnt be the item anyhow auhuhuhuhuha person who supervises fish uhuhuh that wouldnt be the item person whouhuha person whouhuhuh would fish uhno that wouldnt be it uhlets seeuhuh well give the item come on come on give the item i want the item see i want the item well person who changed that couldnt be it uhuhwho has fi hmmm hmmm and so on and the auditor who just sits there and says i must have the auditing question answered see give the item ive got to get it answered it says right in the book the question has been asked and it must be answered and so forth and so forth hes just making mess out of the thing man hes got the guy to point where the guy is invalidate invalidate invalidate and the devil himself couldnt prepcheck the pc back out of it again the auditors got to be slippy got to be clever he unfortunately due to his own stupidity has asked one more time who or what would oppose catching catfish he was sleepy or something you see and the pc has already been searching for the word gameuhuhthat wouldnt be the right word auha park off uhnouhuhuhuhmmmummumm aaa game warden and the auditor has stupidly said all right thank you very much who or what would oppose catching catfish see and then saying ive got to get having made the mistake have to compound the felony of making the pc answer the mistake see idiocy the thing to do is to come off of it and say look we got lots of items here i mean on the line and so on just serub that one lets get onto the next one you know the pc says oh oh oh huh whats the next one who or what would not want to oh who or what would not oppose catching oh thats all right oh fishmongers fishwives safrasusafru you get the different aspects so you have to tune in you have to know about this flow thing and i spent whole hour talking to you about this flow thing because its the most important thing in listing you miss that youve missed everything so it is very far from unimportant its the aspect of the pc which determines what you do in listing whether you ask for more or ask for less forgive the auditing command that sort of thing smooth him out and so on you want the pc listing easily all the time and perfect listing session is the pc is just sitting there pocketapocketapocketapocketa pocketapocketapocketa thats all next card pocketapocketapocketa pocketapocketapocketapocketa thank you thats all next card pocketa pocketapocketapocketapocketapocketa next card see thats perfect listing thing practieally comm lags pc knows when the line is finished pc in good communication with the auditor and on very good session that was run today twelve hundred items were listed in single session interesting huh well thats fast clearing so youve said goodbye i hope to two hundred hours of listing to get goal to clear but remember the one thing that can mess up listing is an auditor who doesnt understand itan auditor who doesnt understand what hes doing hes trying to keep that happy balance hes trying to prevent the pc from overlistinghe is actually trying to keep the pc from overlisting because pcs sometimes will see orand hes trying to prevent the pc from withholding items inadvertently hes trying to keep out of the road everything in the session the pc for instance all gone wogwog auditor doesnt get the rudiments in for his session the pc then cant stay in session long enough to remember what items hes supposed to tell you or hes being distracted by the fact his wife is going to phone him at three oclock and say whether or not hes been divorced see auditor didnt clean it up you know bad auditing has happened and in good auditing you make fast clears and the cleverness of auditing takes place in goals finding the smooth hammer and insistence and 8c of auditing takes place back there in prepchecking and so forth see and then the clever reassuring auditorthats what it takes there in goals finding when it gets over into listing that takes benign control pc doesnt even know hes sitting on control and he just sits there and spits out items of express train jet speed theyre all down on the list finished clear free needle on everything thats all there is to it it looks very easy if anybody is dead against anybody being clear though he wont do it dont you see okay thank you
