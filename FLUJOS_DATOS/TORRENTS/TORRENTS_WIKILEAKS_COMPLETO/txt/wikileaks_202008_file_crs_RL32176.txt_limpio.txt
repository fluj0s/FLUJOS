analyst in economics government and finance division the liability risk retention act background issues and current legislation summary risk retention groups rrgs and risk purchasing groups rpgs are alternative insurance entities authorized by congress to expand insurance supply through simplification of insurance regulation the mccarranferguson act of 1945 generally leaves the regulation of the business of insurance to the individual states in 1981 and 1986 however congress crafted narrow exception to the usual state insurance regulations for these groups largely exempting them from multiple state oversight membership in risk retention and purchasing groups is limited to commercial enterprises and governmental bodies and the risks insured by these groups are limited to liability risks over the past two decades interest both in congress and in the market in these groups has varied largely with the vagaries of the regular insurance market from 20012004 the insurance market was in one of its periodic hard markets and regular insurance became increasingly expensive and sometimes unavailable since 2001 the numbers of risk retention groups rose dramatically and calls have been heard to expand the scope of insurance that they are allowed to offer at the same time some problems occurred in individual risk retention groups and cautionary voices have also been raised although the market since 2005 has softened somewhat risk retention groups have continued to form in significant numbers the fundamental questions surrounding liability risk retention act lrra expansion are essentially the same as those addressed by congress in prior consideration of the issue stripping away jargon this question can be posed as an issue of availability vs reliability those who would support expansion often focus on failure of the current insurance market and the current regulatory system to make sufficient supply of insurance available so that consumers who need insurance can find it at reasonable price the question they pose is essentially what happens to community when business school or doctor can not afford or find insurance those who would oppose expansion often focus on the dangers in allowing insurance to be sold that is not subject to same regulatory standards as normal insurance the question this group poses is essentially what happens to community if the insurer from which this business school or doctor purchases insurance ends up bankrupt or if the policy does not cover what needs to be covered legislation to extend the lrra to commercial property insurance hr 5792 was introduced by representative dennis moore on april 15 2008 this report outlines the current regulatory structures affecting risk retention and risk purchasing groups as well as the legislative and market history of these groups it also discusses the debate regarding possible expansion of these groups into areas beyond commercial liability insurance this report will be

current legislation 11 hr 5792 11 the liability risk retention act background issues and current legislation introduction the insurance industry particularly propertycasualty insurance1 is known for alternating periods of hard and soft markets turns in this cycle are typically traced to unexpected changes in the investment climate unexpected changes in insurance payouts or both during typical hard market the supply of insurance goes down insurance prices go up and underwriting standards become more stringent this often leads to consumers encountering difficulty in finding and affording insurance during soft market prices are typically flat and insurers are more willing to underwrite greater risks so consumers typically do not face such problems in obtaining insurance legislative attention tends to focus on insurance matters during hard markets as constituents relate complaints about finding or affording insurance to their legislators because regulation of the insurance market was left to the states in the mccarranferguson act of 19452 however the legislature in question is most often state legislature among the solutions offered at the state level has been the creation of or allowance for alternative market entities to increase the amount of insurance available to consumers the alternative market is made up of entities or arrangements that spread and finance risk like an insurance company but that operate outside the normal regulations governing the world of regular insurance companies3 risk retention and purchasing groups rrgs and rpgs are alternative market entities that have grown out of attempts at the federal level to expand insurance supply by simplifying insurance regulation in 1981 and 1986 congress crafted narrow exception to the usual state insurance regulations for these groups largely exempting them from multiple state oversight interest in risk retention and purchasing groups has increased over the past few years as prices for insurance have climbed some have suggested that congress needs to expand the narrow exception that was made in the 1980s in order to expand the supply of insurance in areas 1 the insurance industry is typically broken down into lifehealth and propertycasualty insurance lifehealth is relatively straightforward following its name and includes annuity products propertycasualty is more diverse group including auto homeowners professional liability and many others propertycasualty essentially refers to everything that is not life or health insurance 2 15 usc 1011 et seq 3 the alternative market s

outside of the liability coverage allowed under the current law legislation that would extend the liability risk retention act lrra to commercial property insurance and introduce other reforms in the law was introduced by representative dennis moore along with representatives deborah price john campbell and ron klein on april 15 2008 this bill hr 5792 was addressed in an april 16 hearing examining proposals on insurance regulatory reform held by the house financial services subcommittee on capital markets insurance and government sponsored enterprises risk retention and purchasing group structure and regulation risk retention groups are required by current federal law4 to be statechartered insurance companies they are allowed to insure commercial liability risks such as the risk that physician will be found liable for medial malpractice but not other propertycasualty risks such as the risk that physicians office might burn down these insurance companies also must be owned by the members of the group all policies issued by risk retention group must bear federally mandated warning that the policy is not regulated nor guaranteed in the same way as other insurance group members are required to be businesses including individual professionals such as physicians and attorneys or government entities such as public universities school districts and town or city administrations who are engaged in similar business or face similar risks the exact corporate structure of risk retention group can vary many are licensed as captive insurers5 which typically have lower capital requirements but some are licensed as regular mutual insurers risk purchasing groups are likewise groups of entities in similar business or facing similar risks instead of creating their own insurance company these groups join together to purchase commercial insurance from established insurance companies if risk retention groups must be licensed as an insurer under the existing laws of an individual state the obvious questions arise what advantages do they possess why go to the trouble and expense of creating such group the answers are in the different regulatory treatment of these groups as they operate outside of the state where they are chartered or domiciled under normal circumstances an insurer who wishes to operate outside of its domiciliary state must receive license and submit to regulation from every state in which it wishes to do business this means complying with 51 different sets of state or district laws and regulations in order to do business across the country the impact of this multiplicity of regulation is 4 15 usc 3901 et seq 5 captive insurer is an enterprise with all the authority to perform as an insurance company but is organized by parent company

s decom pa ge s gl s r y_f i l s cgl s ht m see also httpwwwcaptivecom captives are typically licensed as insurers either in an individual state or offshore often in bermuda or the cayman islands crs3 particularly high in insurance as compared with other businesses because both the prices and the content of insurance policies are highly regulated in most states this perceived burden of multiple state regulatory systems is also the primary argument cited currently by some in the insurance industry for creating federal charter to replace or supplement the current state system6 risk retention groups are exempted by federal law from the requirement to be licensed in all states in which they operate as well as from other state laws regulating the business of insurance they must register and file documentation with states insurance regulator but after this filing they are essentially free to do business in that state this exemption from state law extends to most laws on the business of insurance but laws such as those on fraudulent trade practices nondiscrimination and unfair claim settlement practices still apply they also must pay state premium taxes as regular insurers do in addition nondomiciliary states insurance regulator is empowered to monitor the financial solvency of group including requiring that group submit to financial condition examination if the chartering state regulator refuses to do such an exam and seeking an injunction to force it to cease doing business if the group is in hazardous financial condition this regulatory oversight is less than that accorded regular insurance companies however and some observers fear that this might lead to an increased danger of such groups becoming insolvent in the case of risk retention group insolvency the policyholders have recourse to state guaranty fund because membership in these funds is specifically prohibited by the federal statute risk purchasing groups are given similar but more limited exemption from state law many states have laws known as fictitious grouping laws that specifically prohibit or limit groups from purchasing insurance for the members of the group particularly if the group exists solely for the purchase of insurance state insurance regulators use these laws to protect consumers and ensure solvency risk purchasing groups are exempted from these laws and from countersignature laws which are laws requiring local brokers or agents signature on an insurance contract otherwise they are regulated by each state in which they operate the insurance that such groups purchase on behalf of their members must meet the laws and regulations of the state that is designated as the domicile of that group legislative history the 1981 product liability risk retention act the first product liability risk retention act was introduced in 1979 and an amended version became pl 9745 in 1981 its origin can be traced to an interagency task force created by the white house in 19757 to examine difficulties 6 for more information on the optional federal chartering issue see crs report rl32789 insurance regulation issues and background by baird webel 7 interagency task force on product liability its final report was published by the continued crs4 in the availability of product liability insurance among the proposals discussed by the task forces report was the possible creation of alternatives to the traditional insurance market the 1981 act was relatively narrow limiting risk retention groups and risk purchasing groups to insurance covering product liability8 as well as completed operations liability9 the 1981 act also limited members of these groups to product manufacturers wholesalers distributors and retailers10 risk retention groups had to be chartered and thus regulated as an insurer in one of the united states including the district of columbia or in bermuda or the cayman islands11 the act specifically exempted risk retention groups from most regulation by any state in which they operate aside from the chartering state this federal exemption however did not cover laws that were not specific to the business of insurance such as fraud or deceptive practice laws the act also preempted any state laws preventing risk purchasing groups from purchasing the same narrow range of insurance as that allowed to be offered by risk retention groups by the time the act became law in september 1981 the market difficulties that prompted so much attention had largely passed with regular commercial insurance available and relatively inexpensive there was little incentive for companies to undertake the expense of forming risk retention or purchasing groups and only three of the former and four of the latter were formed in the first four years of the acts operation despite the lack of market action congressional interest in the issue continued in 1983 clarification of the risk retention act s 1046 eventually pl 98193 was passed by voice votes of both the house and the senate this act was response to model state law suggested by the national association of insurance commissioners naic12 this suggested model law referenced the various state tort laws in its definition of product liability rather than following the definition passed 7 continued department of commerce in 1977 ntis pb273320 8 products liability refers to the liability of manufacturer or seller for injury caused by his product to the person or property of buyer or third party see crs report rl33423 products liability legal overview by henry cohen and vanessa k burrows for additional discussion 9 completed operations liability insurance generally covers claims arising after the completion of project for example if contractor finished

state insurance regulators which among other activities publishes model laws to encourage harmonization of state insurance regulation crs5 by congress in pl 9745 the state tort laws tended to have more narrow definition than that desired by congress pl 98193 specified clearly that the definitions in the federal statute would be the controlling definitions for purposes of the risk retention act13 the 1986 liability risk retention act in the mid1980s the insurance market began to harden again and congress again heard of many problems faced by businesses and individuals in finding and affording insurance one of the congressional responses was to reconsider the 1981 act numerous bills were introduced to expand the provisions so that more consumers might avail themselves of the additional insurance supply mechanism that congress had created congress ultimately passed s 2129 eventually pl 99563 which renamed the 1981 act the liability risk retention act and brought the law to its present form pl 99563 expanded the scope of the insurance to include most types of commercial liability insurance and expanded the organizations that could form such groups to include any business as well as state or local governments or governmental entities as long as all the members of single group were engaged in similar business activities or were exposed to similar risks this expansion however did not retroactively include the small number of foreignbased risk retention groups these groups formed under the temporary authority described above were allowed to continue in the area of product liability insurance but were not permitted to expand into other kinds of commercial liability insurance it also included changes designed to allow some increased oversight of risk retention and purchasing groups including the requirement to file documentation in nonchartering states and the right of non chartering commissioners to conduct examinations if the chartering state fails to do so and to seek injunctions against groups in hazardous financial situation in general however the clear intent of congress remained to allow these groups to operate throughout the country while being regulated largely if not solely by single state regulator rather than facing 51 jurisdictions with very different laws and regulatory styles rrgs and rpgs since 1986 growth in the risk retention market market reaction to the expansion of the law was relatively swift by 1988 54 risk retention groups had been created with more than 43000 insured and total premium amount of 250 million the number climbed to 79 by 1990 and then plateaued for the next 10 years actually declining to 69 by 2001 the number of insured and total premium amount however continued to increase reaching over 174000 insured and 944 million in 2001 purchasing group numbers followed 13 for more discussion see us congress senate committee on commerce science and technology clarification of the risk retention act report to accompany s 1046 98th cong 1st sess srept 98172 washington gpo 1983 crs6 more steady course growing from 358 in 1988 to 756 in 2001 with premium amount growing from 575 million in 1998 to an estimated 3 billion in 200114 within the aggregate statistics there has been significant churning as individual groups are formed and retired based on the business decisions made by those seeking insurance in the period from 1987 to 2001 total of 142 risk retention groups were formed and 73 retired reasons for group retirement vary greatly some became insolvent some changed status to become regular insurer or were absorbed by regular insurer and some simply ceased operation when insurance on the regular market became more affordable15 the relative calm in the marketplace that prevailed through the 1990s and into the new century ended quickly with the hardening of the insurance market in 2001 this hard market has been ascribed to the downturn in both interest rates and the stock market as well as to unexpected claims particularly the estimated 35 billion in insured losses due to the terrorist attacks on september 11 2001 making many of the price increases even more dramatic has been the fact that the soft market of the 1990s lasted for so many years leading to some complacency on the part of both insurers and insureds interest in risk retention groups increased along with the prices of insurance the number of rrgs increased to 90 in 2002 then 141 in 2003 and 177 in 2004 the total premium for rrgs increased to 12 billion in 2002 then 17 billion in 2003 and 22 billion in 2004 the number of rrg insureds however did not follow the same pattern as the number of groups and the amount of premiums the insureds number peaked in 2001 at 172713 then declined to 139837 in 2002 before growing to 145582 in 2003 and 155657 in 2004 risk purchasing groups also saw declines through this time period dropping to 718 in 2002 670 in 2003 and 654 in 2004 the total premium paid by rpgs however increased to an estimated 46 billion in 200416 the market generally has softened since 2004 and rrg premium growth reflects this softening although the number of rrgs is still growing substantially 219 rrgs were operating in 2005 245 in 2006 and 257 in 2007 total rrg premiums grew to 24 billion in 2005 26 billion in 2006 and 27 billion estimated in 200717

example 28 of the 41 new groups were insuring some form of health care liability in the 2007 study the comparable number was 34 of 52 new rrgs within healthcare nursing homes are show the largest growth going from zero nursing home rrgs in 2002 to 20 at the end of 200518 the growth in health care rrgs seems largely due to widely reported difficulties that health care providers are encountering in obtaining medical malpractice insurance in one interesting reported case pennsylvania department of public welfare grant provided the initial 5 million in capital for vermontdomiciled risk retention group with the purpose of insuring nursing homes solely in pennsylvania19 apparently this occurred because the chartering laws on the creation of smaller or captive insurers in vermont are more favorable than those in pennsylvania individual difficulties have come along with growth the growth of risk retention groups has not been without some problems as was noted above the number of insured declined from 2001 to 2004 this was largely due to the liquidation of three tennesseedomiciled groups20 that insured physicians lawyers and other professionals for professional liability the liquidation was forced by the insolvency of regular virginiabased insurer who had provided reinsurance for these risk retention groups individual policyholders of regular insurance are normally eligible for protection in the case of insolvency under the various states guaranty funds this however would typically apply only to those directly insured by the virginia company not to policyholders of companies that are reinsured by this company these policyholders are considered creditors of the company not insureds and thus have lower priority claim on the assets of the failed company further complicating the legal situation is the statutory prohibition on risk retention group participation in state guaranty funds class action lawsuits21 have been filed by insureds seeking guaranty fund protection for the insured along with damages for other malfeasance and are still ongoing22 18 premium generated by healthcare rrgs more than triples since 2001 risk retention reporter december 2002

national warranty insurance risk retention group hereafter national warranty although physically headquartered in lincoln nebraska national warranty was incorporated in the cayman islands it was one of the handful of companies that were incorporated outside of the united states before 1985 and was thus grandfathered out of regulation by any of the individual states prior to its being declared insolvent in august 2003 it acted as an insurer of the obligations taken on by its members mainly marketing companies and auto dealerships who sold vehicle service contracts although the actual group was made up of only approximately 580 members the potential effect of the insolvency is more widespread as these members sold contracts to or through more than 5000 auto dealerships in 49 states23 the text of the lrra requires insureds to be members and part owners of risk retention group however this line was apparently somewhat blurred in the national warranty case national warranty acted both as an administrator adjusting claims on behalf of its members and as the insurer of these members24 this dual role apparently gave the impression that the final consumers were purchasing service contracts directly from national warranty rather than from the individual group members the insolvency thus resulted in confusion about to whom the consumers should be making claims when they need repairs on their cars that should be covered under the terms of the contracts in 2003 accountants with kpmg acting as joint official liquidators in the cayman islands insolvency proceedings have indicated that any consumer claims should be directed at the individual group members and that national warranty is not directly obligated to the consumers25 while the national warranty liquidators did set up process to accept us claims in 2006 it is unclear that many claims will be accepted26 policy issues and considerations for several years interest groups have made concerted effort including the formation of council for expanding the risk retention act to advocate expanding the provisions of the risk retention act to include commercial property and casualty insurance except for workers compensation insurance in 2002 the national conference of insurance legislators approved resolution supporting such an 22 continued as the previously cited article in virginia lawyers weekly 23

insurance regulators for example thendistrict of columbia commissioner lawrence mirel and thenvermont director of captive insurance leonard crouse also previously expressed their support for expansion of the risk retention act28 doubts about such an expansion however have also been raised in naic meetings the most prominent doubter has been nebraskas insurance commissioner who has been at the forefront of dealing with the national warranty insolvency at the september 2003 meeting the naic was encouraged to adopt draft resolution that would put the group on record as opposing the expansion of risk retention groups29 among the reasons cited in the resolution was the danger to consumers from limitation on states regulatory authority the example of the national warranty failure and the absence of an availability problem in property insurance that has not been addressed by statebased solutions resolution has been adopted but risk retention working group to examine issues surrounding risk retention groups was created among other actions this group has proposed corporate governance standards for rrgs30 the us government accountability office also discussed problems in risk retention groups in 2005 report entitled risk retention groups common regulatory standards and greater member protections are needed31 the fundamental questions surrounding lrra expansion are essentially the same as those addressed by congress when the first act was passed in 1981 and when it was expanded in 1986 stripping away jargon this question can be phrased as an issue of availability vs reliability those who would support expansion often focus on failure of the current insurance market and the current regulatory system to make sufficient supply of insurance available so that consumers who need insurance can find it at reasonable price the question they pose is essentially what happens to community when business school or doctor cannot find or afford insurance those who would oppose expansion often focus on the dangers in allowing insurance to be sold that is not subject to same regulatory standards as normal insurance the question this group poses is essentially what happens to community if the insurer from which this business school or doctor purchases insurance ends up bankrupt or if the policy does not cover what needs to be covered the underlying basis for this question with regard to risk 27 see consumer federation of america creating insurance alternatives to bring down rates at httpwwwconsumerfedorgrisk_retention_actexpansionpdf

2005 available at httpwwwgaogovnewitemsd05536pdf crs10 retention groups seems to be the assumption that the single domiciliary state regulator will do an insufficient job in protecting the consumers who live in other states hr 5792 discussed below addresses some concerns raised in the past about the reliability of risk retention groups through the provisions addressing corporate governance structures and state consumer protection laws secondary arguments are of course also made proponents point out that because the insured are the owners of risk retention group they can see to it themselves that the insurance provided is reliable it is also argued that the rates of failure of regular insurers and risk retention groups are nearly the same and that the recent failure of national warranty is unique situation since it was an offshore group that was unaccountable to any state regulator doubters may counter by questioning what sort of impact risk retention groups might have when even with their recent growth they still occupy fraction of percent of the propertycasualty market in addition even if the failure rates are similar the impact of state regulated insurer failure is likely to be mitigated by its participation in state guaranty funds which are specifically unavailable to insurers operating under the liability risk retention act assessing the arguments on either side will be challenge for congress the broad question posed here as availability vs reliability is in some sense basic philosophical question about the degree of regulation needed by insurance markets and may not have an absolute empirical answer some see insurance philosophically as public good akin to basic utility and one that must be highly regulated in price and content to protect consumers others do not share this philosophy and feel insurance should be lightly regulated with the market dictating prices and content in general the states who have faced such basic insurance regulatory questions for many years have attempted to suit the amount of regulation to the perceived sophistication of the consumer thus the market for commercial insurance is usually left relatively less regulated on the theory that the businesses purchasing in the commercial market have the knowledge and experience to discern the intricacies of insurance policies and companies or at least hire professionals to make these reliability judgments for them individual consumers are presumed to be less able to accurately make these judgments thus the market for such insurance particularly homeowners and auto tends to be much more highly regulated internationally the insurance markets in general have tended to be less regulated particularly with regard to the direct price and content controls found in some of the united states32 the differential regulatory approach based on the sophistication of the consumer can be seen for example in the operation of state guaranty funds these funds are intended to step in and pay claims arising from insolvent insurers but they typically have relatively low cap on the amount that can be paid to each policyholder keeping this amount low implies that consumers with relatively low claims presumably most individuals will be nearly fully protected against loss while consumers with relatively high claims presumably larger businesses will be only partially protected this cap on guaranty fund claims also affects the direct 32 for more indepth discussion of insurance regulation see crs report rl32138 revising insurance regulation policy considerations by carolyn cobb crs11 arguments surrounding risk retention groups because most risk retention group members as businesses face potentially large claims the value of guaranty fund protection will be less to them than to individuals with presumably lower claims in assessing some of the more factual arguments it is certainly true that risk retention and purchasing groups occupy very small part of the insurance market for comparison with the risk retention group totals the total premium written in the propertycasualty market in 2006 was approximately 444 billion33 economic theory suggests however that it is not necessary for competitor to have large market share in order to have an impact on prices or availability anecdotal cases particularly ones such as the pennsylvania nursing home risk retention group mentioned above also suggest that the act is expanding the availability of insurance especially in local situations with severe supply difficulties the department of commerce came to the conclusion in 1989 that the 1986 act had been successful in addressing supply problems34 and the gao made similar findings in the previously mentioned 2005 report35 an assessment of risk retention and purchasing groups also may offer insight into wider questions involving the federal role in insurance regulation particularly since the passage of the grammleachbliley act some have advocated for an increased federal role in insurance regulation up to complete federalization of regulation for all interstate insurers others have suggested some lesser federal role to address specific problems they see caused by the multiplicity of state regulators such as slow approval times for products and overly burdensome rate or form regulation the two risk retention acts are an example of one way previous congresses have tried to solve supply problems arising from or exacerbated by the insurance regulatory system the answer provided by these acts was essentially system of enforced mutual state recognition without broad federal regulation of insurance as such an example these acts might provide some insight into how the current congress considers addressing problems in the insurance regulatory system today current legislation hr 5792 the increasing insurance coverage options for consumers act of 2008 was introduced by representative dennis
