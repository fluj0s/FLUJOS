dhabi 1422 abu dhabi 1724 classified by ambassador michele j sison reasons 14 b and d 1 s summary embassy abu dhabi looks forward to welcoming you to the uae on may 7 us and uae officials have had number of productive meetings on the topic of counterterrorism the most recent of which came on april 22 when fran townsend assistant to the president for homeland security and counterterrorism met over lunch with abu dhabi crown prince sheikh mohammed bin zayed mbz and his brother foreign minister sheikh abdullah bin zayed abz your visit builds on our ongoing dialogue and efforts to push the uae on several areas of interest to the usg counterterrorism counter terror finance iran hamas iraq and ideological extremism each is covered in the scenesetter we have requested separate meetings with foreign minister sheikh abdullah bin zayed abz whom you met in new york last september and state security director sheikh hazza bin zayed whom deputy coordinator urbancic met last october in your meetings you should commend the uae for its assistance and cooperation including its strong condemnation of the april 24 bomb attack in dahab the uae remains committed partner in the global war on terror but it continues to take an ad hoc approach to countering terrorism that solves the problem for the uae locally but fails to contribute on transnational basis in january the us and the uae held the first meeting of the joint terrorist finance coordinating committee jtfcc treasury us levey is currently in the uae to hold second meeting that will focus on cash couriers and charities 2 s although the uae regards iran as one of its most serious threats to national security uae officials are reluctant to take actions that could provoke their neighbor and compromise their extensive trading relationship at the same time we are seeing more of willingness on the part of the uae to support usg initiatives without the full approval of the gulf cooperation council gcc as tensions escalate between iran and the international community the uae is growing increasingly nervous the uae leadership which has told us they consider hamas terrorist organization plans to uphold its previous commitments of humanitarian assistance to the palestinian people the uae has taken an active role in encouraging sunni participation in the iraqi political process and continues to condemn the sectarian violence that is preventing stabilization of the country in the face of growing ideological extremism in the gulf the uae leadership is politically determined not to allow islamist extremists to gain foothold on uae soil end summary counterterrorism efforts 3 s the uae is concerned about the terrorist threat to the uae but lacks comprehensive implementation strategy for reducing its vulnerability ref the uae considers homeland security one of its top priorities but rather than prioritizing national security projects its efforts have focused on contracting risk assessments forming committees and procuring equipment in your meetings we recommend that you inquire about the governments plan announced by president khalifa in december 2005 to place all the security agencies under newly established national security council mbz asked by townsend if the uae was worried about its oil infrastructure responded emphatically absolutely he told townsend that there are three international companies currently conducting risk assessments of the uae oil infrastructure and maritime security for the uaeg townsend offered us assistance in helping the uae to reduce its vulnerability ref 4 s the uaeg reacts quickly when presented with evidence of terrorist presence inside the uae but does not approach the problem from transnational posture the uaes immediate response when terrorists pose risk is to deport them uae agencies do not investigate fully to see how far the problem goes or whether there is an international network involved although the usuae counterterrorism cooperation is strong with the uae working closely with the usg on specific cases emiratis do not consistently share lead information found in the possession of individuals in their custody with each other or with the us government these tactics limit law enforcement and intelligence services ability to use intelligence to disrupt extremist cells and planned attacks the uaes insistence on deportation as solution does not protect the country longterm or truly address the nature and scope of the problem townsend discussed this matter with mbz and urged the uae to instead to fully investigate terror suspects and share the results of those inquiries with the usg counterterrorism finance 5 s the uae has made significant strides in regulating the financial sector against money laundering and terrorist financing ref b although the uae now has strong legal framework in place it must turn its efforts to enforcement it is imperative that uae authorities investigate and prosecute violators of terror financeantimoney laundering cash courier and charity laws and regulations to date investigation and prosecution have been weak in an effort to increase us and uae cooperation on terrorist financing the first meeting of the usuae joint terrorist finance coordinating committee jtfcc was held in abu dhabi on january 24 2005 ref c the uae team had representatives from the central bank state security ministries of interior foreign affairs and justice however one participated from dubai in order for the jtfcc to be an effective committee dubais police state security customs and the department of islamic affairs and charities must participate the april 30 meeting will focus on cash couriers and charity regulations iran 6 snf uae leaders are very concerned about escalating tensions between iran and the international community abz publicly expressed his countrys concern and the entire regions vulnerability at press conference in kuwait april 25 while urging peaceful resolution ref m commercial ties between dubai and iran are significant dubai is irans largest nonoil trading partner and as result the uaeg walks fine line between maintaining and encouraging this trade and working to prevent suspected iranian proliferation activities although the uaeg is worried about irans nuclear ambitions its shortterm policy decisions regarding iran center on not provoking its neighbor the usg has approached the uaeg four times since january asking it to interdict and inspect cargo suspected of going to irans nuclear andor missile programs none of those instances has resulted in successful interdiction in the first two instances uae officials simply refused to take action refs f and g the director of dubais state security organization explained during the 11 february usuae counterproliferation task force meeting that the decision not to inspect the containers had been political decision based on the uaes concern that iran might retaliate ref h in the two later instances ref k ships that had been scheduled to arrive in dubai went directly to bandar abbas abz told us joseph during his april 8 visit to abu dhabi that the usg should approach the uae on interdiction requests only as last resort ref n two weeks later he assured townsend that the uaeg does not want iran to take advantage of the uaes open trading environment he said the uae was in the final stages of ratifying its export control law and that it would be announced soon in an encouraging development the uae on april 15 privately endorsed the proliferation security initiatives statement of interdiction principles ref l 7 s in recent meetings with senior usg officials abu dhabis ruling family has expressed clear support for us initiatives against iran the us and uae have common desire to succeed abz told us joseph noting that the combination of iran and terrorism is something that cannot be tolerated the threat from alqaida would be minor if iran has nukes abz said ref n mbz told townsend april 22 that the iranians think that the us will not do anything about their recent declaration that they have successfully enriched uranium he added that he thought the iranians were wrong mbz and uae vice president and prime minister sheikh mohammed bin rashid agreed with secretary rice february 23 about the need to counter irans growing influence in the region and its nuclear ambitions although they specified that any sanctions should target the key iranian leadership not the iranian people ref i mbz told as welch march 28 that he did not think it was necessary to wait for all gulf cooperation council gcc countries to agree before proceeding with any us plans against iran ref he told as welch that the uae would prepare paper responding to usg concerns about iran and mechanisms for addressing the challenge posed by iran in march 27 meeting with centcom commander general abizaid mbz spoke about the iranian threat with greater sense of urgency he was strongly in favor of taking action against iran and its president sooner rather than later i believe this guy is going to take us to war its matter of time mbz warned adding that action against iran and president ahmedinejad should be taken this year or next year 8 snf ssd director hazza told as welch march 29 that the ayatollah ali khameini had once issued fatwa prohibiting the use of nuclear weapons by iran but noted that this should not be considered guarantee hazza assessed that iran is also threat due to its ties to international terrorist organizations including alqaida as well as their financial support to hamas he added that the relationship between iran and syria and their links to hizballah was also of concern as was irans attempts to expand its influence in iraq and elsewhere in the world mbz also expressed to as welch march 28 the concern that hizballah was supporting hamas during your meetings you should explain the graduated approach to addressing iran in the united nations security council and encourage the uae to isolate iranregardless of potential economic backlash you should also explain the importance of the uae working closely with the usg on interdiction requests these meetings will be good followon to the discussion us joseph had with abz april 8 when joseph outlined the usgs policy priorities for iran note while abz like mbz expressed support for us initiatives against iran he stated that the usg should come to the uae as very last resort if you can solve something without involving the uae please do so end note palestinian territorieshamas 9 s uae leaders have told us that they consider hamas terrorist organization and that they would not fund hamas unless they denounce violence refs d and however after hamas political chief khaled meshaal visited abu dhabi on march 22 and met with uae minister of presidential affairs sheikh mansour bin zayed alnahyan and minister of state for foreign affairs mohammed alshaali meshaal publicly claimed that the uaeg had pledged to continue to provide financial assistance to the hamasled palestinian authority ref j mbz told as welch march 28 that the uaeg allowed meshaal to come but that officially we dont recognize khaled meshaal mbz said that once new palestinian prime minister is selected uaeg officials will travel to the palestinian territories to ascertain that uaeg assistance is going to the right people in his meeting with townsend mbz said that the uae felt the muslim brotherhood rally behind hamas after its electoral victory in the palestinian territories and that the hamas victory should be lesson to the west uae vice president and prime minister sheikh mohammed bin rashid sounded note of optimism when he told secretary rice february 23 that hamas with some pressure sipdis would understand the need to respect the will of the international community 10 s the uae has historically provided significant financial assistance to the palestinian people typically the uae sends aid to the palestinian territories through charity organizations or by projectized assistance but the uaeg has also provided financial assistance directly to the palestinian authority most recently 20 million in march 2006 to mahmoud abbas for salaries in the wake of the hamas electoral victory uae leaders told us they intend to honor their previous commitments of humanitarian assistance including the 100 million sheikh khalifa housing complex that was announced last year 11 snf in his meeting with as welch march 29 ssd director hazza assessed that there was both positive and negative side to the hamas election win on the negative side he cited hamas position with regard to israel and their violent agenda on the positive side hazza noted the fact that hamas was now in power and was accountable to the international community he spoke to as welch of the threat posed by the muslim brotherhood hazza also asked as welch how the usg would react to those countries that did support the hamas government and whether they would run afoul of us laws restricting support to terrorist organizations as welch replied that that would be problem emphasizing that money should go to the government unless hamas renounced violence and accepted israel as welch also told hazza that it was not the responsibility of the us or other arab countries to pay the salaries of the new hamas government underscoring the need for hamas to show accountability mbz told as welch that hamas benefited from official and private contributions from saudi arabia kuwait and qatar mbz said it was easy to take 1 million in suitcase to lebanon alluding to cash couriers iraq 12 snf partner in the war on terror the uae continues to provide us forces access overflight clearances and

publicly condemned acts of sectarian and terrorist violence in iraq most recently the february 22 bombing of the alaskariya shrine mbz told townsend that he had confidence in the new iraqi prime ministerdesignate jawad almaliki and he reiterated his concern about irans meddling in iraqs internal affairs he has pledged the uaes support to the fight against alqaida ideological extremism 13 s the abu dhabi ruling family continue to be outspoken on the issue of muslim extremists and the threat they pose to the region mbz told townsend that if there were an election in dubai tomorrow the muslim brotherhood would take over he said the challenge is to find way to remove the extremists in way that they never come back one way he and his brothers have been trying to accomplish this is by reforming the education system which they say was penetrated by the muslim brotherhood in the late 1960s note the uae has announced that half of the members of the federal national council would be elected while half would continue to be appointed by the rulers of the various emirates despite this announcement the uae still lags behind other gulf states in terms of democratization end note uae
