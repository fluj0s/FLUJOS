transport offic er in the surface transport section in new york received an email from emai l author 1 the title of the email was keel officer 1 and the body of the email written in broken english stated that the author had heard that officer 1 was being sent to iraq and warned that if this happened officer 1 would be killed the writer of the email alleged that officer 1 was womaniser and was not welcome in any arab country the author stated that that officer 1 lyke woman tuu muts he foking all womans later the same day officer 2 received the email again this time as an attachment 6 on 23 february 2005 officer 2 received furthe r email from the same source warning again in broken english that if officer 2 did not respond to the original email the author would write directly to mr kofi annan the threat to kill officer 1 was repeated 7 on 11 march 2005 the dss was informed of the mails and took over the case at their request the information technology servic division itsd determined that the emails had originated in pretoria south afric 8 the dss investigators interviewed officer 2 who stated that although he knew officer 1 he did not know anyone by the name of mail author 1 he was not able to provide any further information regarding the emai ls nor could he suggest reason why they had been sent to him 9 officer 1 was in new york on leave at the time was also interviewed by dss 3 he confirmed that he had applied for and had been offered the post of cto with unami he stated that he did not know anyone by the name of email author 1 but did suggest that one of his subordinates in unmil staf f member 1 might be behind the mails officer 1 informed the dss that he had been involved in an incident with staff member 1 over some telephone calls she had made to the father of the child of friend of officer 1 officer 1 stated that when confronted ab out the phone calls staff member 1 had admitted making them when told that the emai l author 1 emails had originated in south africa officer 1 informed the dss that st aff member 1 had relatives and contacts in that country 10 officer 1 also provided dss with an email whi ch had been sent to his wife at her private email address from email author 2 neither officer 1 nor his wife knew anyone by this name and officer 1 suggested that th email author 2 and email author 1 emails were connected since the email author 2 email also claimed that officer 1 was womaniser and gave details as to th women he was involved with in unmil 11 itsd was unable to determine the origin of the email author 2 email 12 the investigation was then passed over to idoi the idoios investigation the email author 1 emails 13 the email address from which these emails wer sent is yahoocom account since person creating such an account can give an name at the time the account is created and given that yahoo has means of verify ing the authenticity of the name the actual identity of the account user cannot be deter mined 14 review of the emails suggests that the perso n who wrote them spoke far better english than the language of the text would suggest in number of places it is evident that the author has made deliberate mistakes to try to persuade the recipient that he did not speak english for example in the sentence he lyke woman tuu muts he foking all womans it is unlikely that someone writing phonetically w ould spell like as lyke as the in lyke makes little sense phonetically similarly the fact that the writer has written tuu instead of too is revealing in that it demonstrates that he or she knew the difference between to and too and knew that in this sentence it was the latter that was applicable other examples can be seen throughout t he emails indeed the fact that almost every word including simple ones is mispel t is suggestive in itself of an attempt to disguise the authors knowledge of english the email author 2 email 15 like the email author 1 emails this email originated from yahoocom address and therefore reliance can be placed on the name email author 2 4 16 the contents of this email demonstrate that th author has considerable knowledge of officer 1 his wife and the situation in unmil for example in addition to knowing officer 1s wifes private email address the author knew that she had worked in unamsil knew the date of her birthday and knew t he telephone numbers of the three women officer 1 was allegedly associating wit h in unmil namely staff member 1 volunteer and staff member 2 the author even knew the name of the father of volunteers daughter although the author of the email mentions three women it is clear that staff member 1 is mentioned almost in pa ssing whilst both volunteer and staff member 2 are attacked personally officer 1 17 during his interview with idoios officer 1 co nfirmed that he had applied for and been offered the post at unami but added that in light of the threatening emails he had informed pmssdpko that he was declining the offer and would be remaining in unmil officer 1 said he was not overly worried by the threats but that his wife and children had been insistent that he not take up the new position he stated that he had announced he was leaving for unami to all the transp ort section staff before the emails were sent 18 officer 1 repeated what he had told the dss inv estigators namely that he suspected that staff member 1 was behind all the mails when asked why he suspected staff member 1 he relayed the incident when staff member 1 had telephoned the father of his friends child and turned him against the fr iend when pressed officer 1 identified the friend as volunteer who worked in the aviati on section and one of those mentioned in the email author 2 email he state d that he believed that staff member 1 saw volunteer as rival for his affections h mentioned to idoios that he was aware that the email author 1 emails had origin ated in south africa and added that he knew that staff member 1 had contacts in that count ry 19 officer 1 was asked about the women staff mem ber 1 volunteer and staff member 2 mentioned in the email author 2 emai l he admitted to idoios that the email was correct in that he had had or was having sexual relations with all three women 20 officer 1 stated that staff member 1 had previo usly worked for him in unamsil and that they had been sexually involved th ere he also admitted to having had sex with staff member 1 in unmil but stated th at they were not in relationship he felt that staff member 1 wanted to renew their r elationship which could have motivated both the email author 2 email which was aimed at getting officer 1s wife to leave him and the email author 1 emails wh ich were designed to stop officer 1 leaving unmil 21 when asked about his relationship with volun teer officer 1 stated that he had known her in unamsil although she had not worke d directly for him in that mission and that they had had sexual relationshi p there he stated that initially 5 volunteer had been earmarked for the unmil transpor t section and that he had been the one to write her evaluation officer 1 said he had given her positive assessment and unmil had accepted her however at some point unmi ls senior management had been informed of the relationship between officer 1 and volunteer in unamsil and when she had arrived in liberia volunteer had been assigned to the aviation section rather than the transport section officer 1 described volunteer to idoios as his girlfriend in unmil and said that their relat ionship was common knowledge within the mission since they were often seen out t ogether he confirmed that he was having sexual relationship with volunteer in u nmil 22 with respect to staff member 2 officer 1 inform ed idoios that she was transport section staff member with whom he had sex on casual basis volunteer 23 when idoios interviewed volunteer who is c urrently working as an officer with the unmil aviation section she denied that she was having or had ever had sex with officer 1 although she did admit tha t they were very close friends who spent lot of time together although she did not use the word impotent volunteer clearly suggested to idoios that officer 1 was inc apable of consummating the sexual act but acknowledged that people in the mission co uld with reason assume that they were having sexual relationship 24 volunteer was asked about the incident invol ving staff member 1 and the telephone calls to her childs father in sierra leo ne volunteer confirmed that the calls had occurred and had resulted in her daughter s father taking the child away from volunteers mothers house in freetown volun teer stated that through contacts she had been able to obtain the phone number from w hich the calls had been made and that this number had belonged to staff member 1 sh had confronted staff member 1 about the calls and staff member 1 had admitted tha t she had been the one to make them staff member 1 told volunteer that she had made t he calls as she suspected that volunteer had been spreading rumours about her and about her relationship with officer 1 volunteer denied having ever made such calls 25 volunteer informed idoios that she was awar of the rumours that officer 1 and staff member 1 had been romantically involved in unamsil and that officer 1 was sleeping with staff member 2 in unmil she stat ed that she did not know the truth behind the rumours although staff member 2 had on one occasion approached her and denied that she was sleeping with officer 1 26 volunteer confirmed that she had known that officer 1 was planning to leave unmil to go to unami and that it had not been sec ret she said that she thought it good move for him and that his leaving unmil did t bother her at all she claimed that if he left then all that would mean was that t heir relationship was over and that was not problem for her 6 staff member 2 27 staff member 2 who is currently working as an dministrative assistant in the transport section was interviewed by idoios and d enied ever having had sex with officer 1 she said that she and officer 1 were sim ply very good friends and qualified this by saying that officer 1 was friendly with eve ryone in the transport section she agreed that they had on occasion attended the sam parties in unmil and had danced together she also confirmed that officer 1 had inf ormed the whole of the transport section both of the fact that he was leaving unmil to go to unami and then later that he was longer leaving as he had received threats against him where he to go staff member 2 claimed that everyone in the transport sec tion was pleased to hear that officer 1 was staying staff member 1 28 staff member 1 who is working in the unmil tra nsport section was first questioned about her relationship with officer 1 s he agreed that they had been very good friends in unamsil where she had worked for him in the transport section but denied that there had been sexual component to th eir relationship although she acknowledged that that was probably the impression most people had after she had left unamisil to go and to work as unv with the mission des nations unies au république démocratique du congo monuc she had k ept in infrequent touch with officer 1 by telephone and email occasionally ask ing him for advice on transport related matters etc whilst with monuc staff mem ber 1 had applied to the in new york to be employed as an international staff m ember her application was accepted and she was offered post with unmil she told idoios that she had not asked for position with unmil in particular and w ould have gone wherever she was offered job she stated that she knew that by com ing to unmil she would be working for officer 1 again but did not believe this would be problem as she considered their relationship long over she denied having had sex w ith officer 1 in unmil but said that they remained friends she claimed not to know whet her officer 1 was romantically involved with anyone in unmil although she admitte d to having heard rumours that he was romantically involved with volunteer and sta ff member 2 29 when asked about the phone calls to the father of volunteers daughter staff member 1 admitted that she had made them although she claimed that she had done so simply in an attempt to have him tell volunteer to stop making anonymous phone calls to her staff member 1 informed idoios that she had been receiving phone calls from an anonymous female whom she believed to be volunteer as the woman spoke with the accent of the ethnic group both staf f member 1 and volunteer belonged to in sierra leone who would say such th ings as leave officer 1 alone he is mine this is unmil not unamsil after calling officer 1 to ask him to stop the calls staff member 1 decided to call volunteer s fiancé to see if he could do something 30 staff member 1 confirmed that she like everyon else in the unmil transport 7 section had been aware that officer 1 was going to transfer to unami but that the transfer had been cancelled after he had received d eath threats she told idoios that the prospect of officer 1 leaving unmil did not bother her at all 31 staff member 1 was then confronted with the mail author 1 emails but denied having anything to do with them when inform ed that the emails had originated in south africa and that it was known that she had connections to that country she admitted that her former boyfriend lived in south frica where he was lecturer at university near johannesburg staff member 1 stated that the two of them had broken up in november 2004 and that was the last time she had been to south africa she produced her passport as evidence of this staff member 1 so mentioned cousin who had previously lived in pretoria south africa but sta ted that he had moved first to ghana and then to tunisia several years previously potential conflict of interest 32 during the course of his interview officer 1 w as asked whether he considered it appropriate for him to be sleeping with two of his subordinates he told idoios that he could see nothing wrong with it he commented that he had an open management style and that most decisions were taken in consultation with others so he did not think that other members of the transport section should be co ncerned that staff member 1 or staff member 2 might be getting preferential treatment fr om him 33 with respect to the fact that he had been the ne to assess volunteers suitability to come to unmil despite the fact that he had been sleeping with her in unamsil officer 1 claimed that he did not see any conflict of interest he said that volunteer was well qualified for the post for which she was being considered and that had he rejected her application he might have cause d trouble for her he insisted that he had never spoken about volunteer to volunteer s superior nor had he asked for any special treatment for her 34 volunteers supervisor informed idoios that unmil official had contacted him about problem regarding unv schedu led to work in the transport section unmil official told him that the volunt eer was officer 1s girlfriend and that there would be conflict of interest if she w ere to work under officer 1 unmil official therefore asked volunteers supervisor to accept volunteer in the aviation section he agreed to do so he stated tha t he had had discussions with officer 1 about volunteer either before or afte r her arrival 35 when asked about volunteers performance volunteers supervisor stated that she was very good at her job and that h was pushing for her to be transferred from unv to an international staff member 36 both staff member 1 and staff member 2 informed idoios that they had not received any special treatment from officer 1 becau of any friendship they might have had with him 8 37 idoios examined the personnel files of all thr ee women references to officer 1 were found in volunteers file in sta ff member 1s file officer 1s name appears twice once in her p11 as her supervisor in unamsil and the second time when on 21 february 2005 he countersigned her performan ce appraisal report par as her section chief the actual par was prepared by staff member 1s supervisor officer 1s signature appears four times in staff member 2s fi on 29 october 2003 he sent memo to the ccpo unmil stating that staff member 2 h ad passed the qualification tests and requested that she be given ssa contrac t for three months on 25 february 2004 in memo to the ccpo officer 1 requested th at staff member 2s status be changed to that of national staff member and her contract extended another three months on 2 december 2004 officer 1 countersigned staff member 2s par as her section chief the par was prepared by staff member 2s supervisor finally officer 1s signature appears on memo to staff member 2 i nforming her that her driving licence was being temporarily withdrawn as result of her having been involved in an accident involving unmil vehicle vi findings and conclusions 38 the evidence disclosed by this investigation wo uld suggest that the threats to officer 1s life contained in the email author 1 emails were not genuine but they were designed to make him reconsider his transfer in this regard the emails were successful in that officer 1 withdrew his acceptanc of the unami offer idoios has not been able to determine with sufficient evidence the identity of the author of the mails 39 it has not proved possible for idoios to deter mine with sufficient evidence the identity of the author of the email author 2 em ail although the evidence would suggest that the author is someone with good know ledge of officer 1s circumstances and activities who wanted him to remain in unmil 40 during the course of the investigation idoios discovered that officer 1 has been closely involved with at least two of his subordina female staff staff member 1 and staff member 2 the exact nature of the two relatio nships is in dispute since although officer 1 claims he had sexual relationships with b oth women the women deny this regardless of the exact nature of the relationships the fact that both women acknowledge the closeness of the relationship that exists betwe them and officer 1 closeness which has fuelled rumours circulating within unmil s uggesting that officer 1 is romantically involved with them has created at the very least the appearance of conflict of interest although idoios has not been able to determine any action by officer 1 that has favoured these women over other members of the transport section the fact that he has by his own admission engaged in sexual relati onships with his subordinates demonstrates poor judgement on his part moreover such situations not only create the appearance of favoritism and social and administrat difficulties but also raise the possibility of sexual exploitation of subordinate s taff members it appears to oios that the situation created by officer 1 by his affairs l ed directly to the creation of the emails 9 vii recommendations 41 in view of the findings of this investigation idoios recommends recommendation 1 it is recommended that dpko take appropriate acti on with respect to officer 1 regarding his relationships with subor dinates in the unmil transport section iv05015401
