responses in the first year after september 11 summary the attacks of september 11 prompted th bush administration to improve law enforcement and other coordination be tween the united states and european governments dealing with international rrorism european governments have also taken measures to enhan ce cooperation among themselves most notable are european union efforts to enhance cross border sharing of intelligence and police information extend the reach of warrants and strengthen external border controls some european countries have long history of fighting terrorism and have refined existing practices as part of th eir counterterro r policy others with little experience in combating terrorism are developing measures for the first time efforts to fight terror include the disruption of rrorists financial networks the emerging eu regime for tracking asylum seekers and arrest and trial of suspected terrorists however some governments have been slow to accept the us position that qaeda poses significant new threat nd are correspondingly reluctant to approve enhanced law enforcement measures or are inattentive to their implementation these governments may believe that the ited states is under new threat but that the danger does not extend to their own societies or that more active role in the fight would increase the likelihood that they would be targete d some governments also have different evidentiary standard s from their neighbors and the united states these governments may set the evidentiary bar very high before undertaking an investigation or ma king an arrest domestic political factors are influencing the debate in some c ountries over terrorism and raising concer ns over religious and ethn ic tolerance several countries such as italy denmark au stria and the netherlands have popular currents increasingly wary of or hostile to immigration some political parties in these countries are using fear of terrori sm to brand moslems as extremists and attempting to restrict their immigration resources available to governments so play an important role in the counterterror effort absent major terrorist attack on their own soil some governments lack the political support in their parliaments and among their populations to divert resources from effort s to resolve social and economic problems and towards greater security against terrorism the events of september 11 led to immediate and unprecedented european efforts to cooperate with the united states in fighting terrorism however by early 2002 the emphasis placed by the bush administration on military action beyond afghanistan and on strong support for the shar on government in israel in its conflict with the palestinians began to raise doubt s among some europeans about the overall us approach to counterterrorism there are concerns in europe that the united states is using the war against terrorism to pursue broader and more controversial foreign policy

political will and diverse responses in the first year after september 11 overview the attacks of september 11 prompted th bush administration to improve law enforcement and other coordination be tween the united states and european governments dealing with international terrorism many governments after discussions with the administration or on their own quickly began to enact or consider legislation intende d to enhance their ability to investigate and suppress terrorist activity the attacks on the united states of september 11 shocked the political leadership in key european states leading to new dom estic measures to counter terrorism most notable are european union efforts to enhance crossborder cooperation in sharing intelligence and police information extend the reach of warrants and strengthen external border controls such measures had long been resisted given states concerns over surre ndering elements of their sovereignty to other countries or to the european union the events of september 11 led to immediate and unprecedented efforts to cooperate with the united states in figh ting terrorism however by early 2002 the emphasis placed by the bush administra tion on military action beyond afghanistan began to raise doubts among some europ eans about the overall us approach to counterterrorism there are c oncerns in europe that the united states is using the war against terrorism to pursue broader nd more controversial foreign policy goals doubts are evident in some european c ountries about aspects of the conflict against terrorism parts of the political sp ectrum in many european countries believe that longterm economic and diplomatic initiatives should have an important role to play in combating terrorism in some countries debates have sharpened over the balance between security and civil liberties there is also some criticism of the balance in the united states between security and civil liberties that has hindered cooperation european concerns about the possible use of military tribunals in this country treatment of detainees at guan tanamo bay and the death penalty are currently affecting working relationships with the united states several countries with significant moslem populations have governments that are concerned about new enforcement measures that could be c onstrued as targetin g minority populationshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31612crs2 coupled with concern over us foreign po licy in the middle east these views may be eroding administration efforts to pe rsuade several eur opean governments to follow elements of its counterterror policy wide range of response is evident in eu rope in the effort to subdue terrorism some countries such as france italy germany spain and turkey have long history of fighting terrorism in each th ere is an existing political sentiment about measures appropriate for disrupting terrori st networks and bringing terrorists to justice long traditions resting on accep ted practices affecting civil liberties securing public order and protecting their populations are influencing political debate over combating terrorism some governments have accelerated the pace of internal efforts to combat terrorism the disruption of terrorists fi nancial networks stre ngthening of border controls and arrest and trial of suspected terrorists steps sometimes taken in coordination with the united states or ot her countries are but several examples of such efforts other examples are the eus emerging regime for tracking asylum seekers frances commitment of increased police resources to combat terrorism and britains expanded number of i ndividuals on its terrorist list in part at us and urging there are also areas of concern some governments have been slow to accept the us position that qaeda poses significant new threat and are correspondingly reluctant to approve enha nced law enforcement measures or are inattentive to their implementation these governments may belie ve that the united states is under new threat but that the danger does not extend to their own societies or that more active role in the fight would increase the likelihood that they would be targeted such sentiment for example is evident in the baltic states where significant acts of terrorism are unco mmon but is also heard in countries such as germany where the effects of terrorism are wellknown the eu as an entity has relatively weak law enforcement capabilities there some national police services despite initial steps taken on paper by political leaders remain reluctant to share investigative and intelligence information and all governments face significant hurdles in combating moneylaundering whether tied to organized crime or to terrorist networks domestic political f actors are influencing the deba in some countries over terrorism and raising concerns over religious and ethnic tolerance several european societies such as italy denmark austri and the netherlands have popular currents increasingly wary of or hostile to immigra tion some political parties in these countries are using fear of terrorism to br and moslems as extremists and to restrict their immigration version of this sen timent is evident in bosniahercegovina already tense and unstable where some serbian orthodox political leaders are seeking to undermine the legitimacy of bo sniak moslem orga nizations involved in building civic institutions resources available to governments play an important role in the antiterrorism effort for example some government fficials interviewed by crs voice desire to strengthen airline security through improved technologies nd more personnel or to increase capabilities for inspection at ts to prevent the movement of weaponshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31612crs3 1see for example john lloyd rowing alone financial times section ii aug 34 2002of mass destruction in cont ainer vessels budget constraints are in many cases preventing them from doing so since early 2002 number of european g overnments while not reducing their domestic lawenforcement efforts have begun to distance themselves from us leadership in the international conflict against terrorism broader issues of foreign policy are at play many nato allies are uneasy with the bush administrations strong support for the sharon government in israel and its treatment of the palestinians they do not share the administrations view that prime minister sharons use of robust military force contribut to weakening terrorism or even that his policy has much in common with the war on terrorism they believe instead that the sharon governments policies may be fueling terrorism they bristle at suggestions from some journalists in the united states that their criticism of israel is evidence of antisemitism1 similarly some governments view president bushs reference to iran iraq and north korea as an axis of evil as an indication that the united states is using the issue of terrorism to garner support fo r preemptive military measures intended to eliminate threats that most european g overnments today regard as unproven the threat from the production of weapons of ma ss destruction in iraq for possible use against the united states or other countries falls into this category key allies believe that any nearterm conflict w ith iraq could greatly undermine the international coalition against terrorism and further inflame the arabisraeli conflict in general most european governments tinue to believe that iran and iraq for example should presently be dealt with through diplomatic political and economic measures the european union is pursuing an initiative to engage iran through policy of trade and investment while european governments may wish to implement stronger efforts at home to quell terrorism several do not wish to be seen as following an american plan for doing so above all if that plan is li nked to broader us policy for militarily confronting middle eastern countries or political entities that the administration believes to be supportin g terrorist networkshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31612crs4 2bin laden and the balkans

in 19942 at the same time the postcommunist leadership in albania nd albanians in gene ral have remained staunchly proamerican and not receptiv to radical isla mic fundamentalism following the september 11 2001 attacks the albanian government announced that it would put all of albania s assets and fac ilities including airspace ports and airports at the disposal of the united states and

one dozen suspected isla mic terrorists from egypt iraq jordan syria and elsewhere in the ddle east and africa since 19983 terrorist threats in the past have caused the temporary closure of the us

has st renuously denied that albanian territory has been used for training camps or bases for either ethnic albanian extremist forces or islamic terrorist groups it has sought to portray albania as staunch supporter of the united states and longer safe haven for islamic extremists in late 2001 albanian authorities launched four raids on islamicbased groups and deported seve ral of their principal officers at the same time ne ighboring states such as italy complain about the steady stream of illegal immigrants from albania many of whom are linked with organized crime and engaged in illegal activities in addition to expelling suspected islamic extremists major focus of albanias counterterrorism efforts has been to limit rrorists ability to use albania to launder money by blocking financia l and other assets of pe rsons and groups operating in albania with suspected links to terrorists the united states has reportedly provided albanias authorities with list of 300 comp anies in tirana that are suspected of money laundering for terrorists or otherw ise having links with terrorist groups albanias main action to date on this front has been to freeze the accounts and assets of

well as to the united states has had somewhat problematic record of coope ration with washington in the war on terrorism one us government official has characteriz ed belgiums political will to cooperate as fairly strong chiefly because it is linked to belgiums selfinterest the belgians do not want any terrorist activity to occur on their territory because the european union and nato are headquartered in thei r country he added the belgians are sensitized to the terrorist threat but they are anxious over whether they have sufficient resources to protect personnel at the two institutions immediately after the attacks on the united states belgium tightened security around eu nato and us facilities throughout the country in additi on the belgians ability to deliver on their promises is somewhat challenged any type of coordination is problematic in belgiums federated system of government in which policies must navigate the shoals of several leve ls of government and three official languages in addition belgiums domestic political dynamics act as something of constraint on their ability to cooperate the ethnic mistrust be tween the dutchspeaking flemings and the frenchspeaking walloons complicates matters finally th eir government tends to place great deal of emphasis on process and is slow and bureaucratic international cooperation belgium has shown some leadership in coordinating inte rnational counter terrorist activities on september 17 police and anti terrorist officials from germany the netherlands and france t with their belgian counterparts in brussels to discuss efforts to share in formation and coordina counterterrorist strategy in addition belgium which held the revolving eu presidency between july and december of 2001 pushed for acceptance of euwide fasttrack extradition procedures for serious crimes like other eu countries however belgium has refused to deport suspected terrorists to countries where they might face the death penalty in fact the law prohibits extraditi on of belgian nationals in june 2002 the us and belgian governments initialed an agreement that will permit us customs agents to be stationed in the seaport of antwerp where they will work with belgian officials to screen freight containers to be loaded on vessels bound for the united states the accord is part of the bush administrations container

reputation as moneylaunde ring haven and some bus inesses used bank accounts established on the island for what may be regarded as nefarious purposes largely because cyprus hopes to become member of the european union by 2004 it has been trying to improve its performance in this area35 it is considering raising the corporate tax rate cyprus also plans to improve enforcement of laws including its

was not acted on by hambur g police due to poor communication89 recent evidence suggests that the hamburg qaeda cell was planning the world trade center attack as early as the spring of 200090 some of the recent changes in law were designed to address the communications problems the evidentiary bar is set very high in germany as result german authorities have arrested interviewe d and searched the homes of number of suspects but released them for lack of ev idence for example the united states has been pressing for the arrest of syrian national mahmo ud darkazani who is re ported to have held power of attorney for terrorists involved in 911 while german authorities are keeping him under surveillance they have been unable to arrest him for lack of evidence91 other prime us suspects who have been detained but released for lack of evidence include abdulrahman s kouj and mohammed belfas who are believed to have been connected to the hamburg cell92 german authorities also detained seven suspects involved in ex tremist activities associated with the qud mosque in hamburg and who are likely to have d connections with the qaeda hijack plotters these included abdelghania mz oudi

that he had left the country until they received missing persons report from his family nd they did not know his whereabouts for several months significant bilateral information sharing issue has

germany arrested and extradited key suspect in the 1998 us embassy bombings in africa after us prosecutors agreed to waive the death penalty germany has interpreted its laws to forbid even provision of evidence relating to such case if that information might lead to the imposition of death sentence the united states has been seeking to obtain documents from germany related to the case of zacarias

used by germany and other european countries in their long campaigns to eradicate terrorism some question has been raised whether terrorist suspects would be extrad ited by germany and other eu countries if they were likely to face military tribunal97 as the war on terrorism has expanded beyond afghanistan german officials seem uncertain over the direction of us policy germans have become increasingly worried that the united states is taking unilateralist approach in the fight against terrorism and that german views and cerns might not be taken into account even though berlin has

middle eastern affairs foreign affairs defense and trade divi sion crs october 8 2002greece background number of factors have contributed to and complicated the greek approach to dealing with interna tional terrorism during the military junta 19671974 the police were responsible for serious human rights violations in reaction greeks perceived the police and government as greater threat to their safety than terrorists and postjunta democratic governments almost systematically weakened the police police were notoriously illpaid and chro nically understaffed and they lacked the technology and other advanced tools to do their job thus they were ineffective in countering terrorism moreover public sympat hies often seemed to reside more with perpetrators rather than with terror victims who were seen as mostly government or business elite rich or foreign strain of antiamericanism afflic ts public attitudes in greece and stems primarily from us support for the junta in recent years antipathy toward the united states has worsened due to the greeks sympathy for their coreligionists and historic allies the serbs during the u s campaign in kosovo and against yugoslav leader slobodan milosevic many greeks view us demands to counter terrorism as an infringement on greek sovereignty and interference in their internal affairs ie an effort to control the greek government or transform it once again into police state analysts argue that at times these attitudes have detracted from the governments willingness to cooperate with or accept assistance from the united states in countering terror us assist ance that was accepted often failed to achieve its objective for example greek police officers who received c ounterterrorism training in the united states were not ssigned counterterrorism duties on their return home100 this led the us to suspend the training in 1998 revolutionary organization 17 november until mid2002 the greek record in countering terrorism was

airplane shoe bomber and zacharias moussaoui the frenchmoroccan accused by the united states of being the 20th september 11 hijacker uk authorities estimate that hundreds of british muslims recruited throug h such mosques and youth organizations have received military training at terrorist camps in afghanistan at least seven uk citizens fighting with qaeda and the taliban were captured and transported by us authorities to guantánamo bay cuba even before september 11 other countri complained that britain was breeding ground and haven for radical islamic terrorist groups france charged that the algerian armed islamic group gia used london as an operational base from which to carry out bombings in paris in the mid1990s cairo has long argued that british complacency allowed members of th egyptian islamic ji had to operate on its territory with impunity230 us intelligence believes that both of these groups are closely linked to qaeda critics sa that like other european capitals london underestimated qaedas threat to the uk fo r far too long they point out that 11 of the 19 september 11 hijackers stayed in or transited britain at some point during the nine months prior to the attacks london counters that its antiterrorism legislation of february 2001 was intended to address ch growing concerns about the presence of qaeda nd other radical islamic groups in britain but admit that clearly it did not have much time to show resultshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31612crs101 231the uk connection the observer january 20 2002 232ibidlaw enforcement postseptember 11 since september 11 british authorities ve questioned and arrested dozens of individuals allegedly tied to qaeda or other militant islamic groups throughout the uk although most charges brought are not specifically related to the september 11 attacks several suspects have been accused of belonging to proscribed terrorist organizations others are being held for lesser offenses such as immigration violations many in the uk suspected of supporting or recruiting for qaeda remain under police investigation and surv eillance including two radical muslim leaderssyrianborn asylum seeker omar baki mohammed of muhajiroun and egyptianborn abu hamza masri w ho heads the finsbury park mosque us and uk officials say cooperation between th eir respective police security and intelligence services is close and continuing press reports indicate that uk law enforcement authorities continue to search for palestinianborn islamic cleric abu qatadawho was granted asylum in the uk but is suspected by us and other security services of being close bin den associateas well as omar bayoumi postgraduate student residing in the uk who us authorities believe may have helped fund some of the september 11 hijackers231 nevertheless some critics note that even though uk authorities have stepped up their law enforcement efforts against qaeda and members of other terrorist groups they have not yet been able to make any charges stick they point for example to the case of yasser sirri who has been sentenced to death by eygpt for his alleged role in failed assassination attempt of former prime minister sirri sought political asylum in the uk wh ere he has resided for about eight years in october 2001 sirri was arrested nd accused by uk authorities of involvement in the qaeda assassination of afghan guerrilla leader ahmed shah massoud but british courts dismissed these charges in may 2002 citing lack of evidence uk home secretary david blunkett gave the same reason for not pursuing us extradition request in july 2002 for sirri on charges that he had provided funding to qaeda in april 2002 british court also refused to extradite algerianborn pilot lofti raissi to the united states in connection with the september 11 attacks on the grounds of insufficient evidence us officials believe lofti helped train some of the hijackers british former antiterrorist officer admits that the evidentiary bar in the uk is set high which means that you cant get half the people you want232 legislative and political responses to september 11 most analysts feel that september 11 served to renew and further invigorate londons efforts to enhance its antite rrorist legislation improve uk law enforcement capabilities to better combat global terrorism and close loopholes in british asylum and immigration policies that some believe terrorists have already used to their advantage some of thes new counterterrorist proposals however have encountered stiff resi stance from british civil liberty and human rights groupshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31612crs102 233the two other originally detained suspects voluntarily left the united kingdom as permitted by the actwho worry that the new laws will compromise domestic legal protections and erode privacy rights improving counterterrorism legislation following september 11 the blair government committed itself to enhanc ing the uks antiterror legislation in december 2001 the british parliament pa ssed the antiterrorism crime and security act 2001 it sought to strengthen the terrorism act 2000 by improving informationsharing among uk law enforcement agencies preventing terrorists from abusing immigration and asylum laws and tightening security in relation to aviation civil nuclear sites and at laboratories holding stoc ks of potentially dangerous biological and chemical s ubstances key and contro versial provision of the new act relates to foreign nationals residing in the uk with suspected terrorist links british law prohibits the deportation of indi viduals to countries where they may face torture execution or other inhumane trea tment many middle eastern dissidents over the years had been granted asylum by the uk precisely because they faced the death penalty or other harsh sentences in their home countries post september 11 however the uk could longer ignore that some of these individuals were showing up on us and other terrorist lists to square this circle the 2001 act allows for the extended detention of suspected in ternational terrorists who are deemed threat to national security and for whom immediate prospect of removal exists implementing this new procedure required london to derogate from article 5 of the european convention on human rights echr which prohibits indefinite detention without trial british officials assert that article 15 of the convention permits this derogation in times of public emergency in order to retain the derogation beyond 2006 new legi slation will be required since december 2001 eleven suspected isla mic extremists have been detained under the new act nine remain in custody233 despite the governments success in pushing this measure through last fall civil liberty advocates have already challenged it in court on behalf of the nine suspects with some success in july 2002 the special immigration appeals court ruled that th new law breached antidiscrimination protections article 14 in the echr becau the ability to detain indefinitely only applied to nonbritish citizens the c ourt supported the governments right to derogate from article 5 howev er saying that it was jus tified and pr oportionate to the national security threat faced by the uk the detainees will remain in custody pending decision on the home offices counterappeal civil liberty concerns also forced the bl air government to walk back or abandon some key initiatives or iginally proposed in the 2001 act in order to secure its swift passage opposition came both from some members of blairs own labour party as well as from conservative and libe ral democrat political opponents home secretary david blunkett abandoned plans to make inciting religious hatred criminal offense because of concerns that it could

case in the uk takes about 18 months s hortly after septembe r 11 prime minister blair stated we cannot have situati on in which it takes years to extradite people236 some civil liberty groups have expressed concern that the provisions outlined in the draft bill could weaken existing protections preventing suspects from being extradited for politically motivated reasons or without sufficient evidence they have also criticized the bill for omitting mention of an individuals right to freedom from torture or inhumane treatment the government hopes to introduce the final version of the bill for parliamentary consideration this fall the draft extradition bill also includes provisions to implement the new european union eu arrest warrant which will eliminate the extradition proceedings

claim national id card would not stop terrorists from infiltrating britain noting that the september 11 hijackers had all been issued various us id cards enhancing intelligence and police resources critics contend that britains intelligence agencies have been focused traditionally on combating terrorism related to the conflic t in northern ireland as result they have failed to devote sufficient resources or personnel to countering the threat posed by organizations like qaeda british terrorism expert told the house of commonsbritains elected chamberthis past june that the uks domestic intelligence service mi5 had written off many of britains fiery islamic extremists as selfpromoters who did not pose serious threat others note that decade of budget cuts to mi6 britains foreign intelligence service following the end of the cold war has seriously impeded its ab ility to conduct eff ective antiterrorism operations press reports indicate that prior to september 11 only 30 of mi6s 1600 officers were assigned to counterterrori st duties as opposed to approximately 600 at the cia in july 2002 the british government proposed 7 percent real increase to the combined budget of

terrorism since the attacks last september some policy differences remain the uks own experience with northern ireland colors its perceptions many in the uk believe that londons attempts in the 1970s and 1980s to curb the threat posed by groups like the ira with harsh and repressive law enforcement measures were both counterproductive and costly in lives resources and basic freedoms rather than ending terrorist activities they argue uk actions exacerbated the problemgenerating international sympathy and financial support for those engaged in the violence similarly london worries that washington may be losing the public opinion battle both in the arab world and even among its european allies as result of its decision to keep qaeda prisoners at guantánamo bay they also criticiz the proposed use of military tribunals on grounds that they lack transparency and cu rtail civil rights pr otections unnecessarily as the focus of the us war on terrorism moves beyond qaeda and afghanistan some analysts predict that prime minister blair will face difficulties agreeing to us policies with regard to iraq of all the european allies only britain has voiced support for possible military action against iraq in order to remove the threat posed by saddam hussein and hi s quest to acquire weapons of mass destruction however blair faces opposition at homein particular within his own labor partyto the use of military force in iraq several members of blairs cabinet have threatened to resign if the uk joins with us forces to oust saddam in an attack not sanctioned by the united

that any plan for confrontation with iraq must address what comes after saddam and be accompanied by increased us engagement in the middle east peace process242 some observers suggest that the growing
