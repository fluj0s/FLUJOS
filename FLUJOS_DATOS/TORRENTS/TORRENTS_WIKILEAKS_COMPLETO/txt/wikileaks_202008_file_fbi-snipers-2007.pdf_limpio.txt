affect the home land in future terrorist aggressions this assessment does not differentiate between terroris t domestic or international and criminal intent rather it discusses th sniper ttps and their potent ial physical psychological and economic impacts against the affected communities ufouo this assessment does not address every po ssible sniper scenario its purpose is to analyze previous attacks and provide law enforcement personne l with an understanding of known sniper ttps it provides some historical references to illustrate points and examines potential investigative tools to counter the threat the information contained in this assessment was derived from fbi and bureau of alcohol tobacco firearms and explosives atf case files department of defense ssessments and open source information and is current as of 31 december 2006 ufouo this assessments definition of sniper or sniperstyle shootings encompasses long range highly accurate and disciplined shooti ng with specialized w eapons by professionally trained individuals as well as s hort and medium range shots with standard offtheshelf rifles and handguns by untrained personnel unclassifiedfor official use only unclassifiedfor official use only 3 u key judgments ufouo the fbi and atf currently have credible in telligence that terrorist organizations are using or plan to use sniper tactics against target s within the homeland ufouo observations of sniper ttps in the homeland the current iraqi insurgency and prior overseas conflicts illu strate the effectiveness of sniper activities and the effects and impact such actions have upon the general population ufouo sniper team of two or more pers onnel allows the indivi duals to concentrate on their respective responsibilities and not l aspects of an attack thus increasing the probability of success and the ability to depart the area undetected ufouo observed sniper weapons are not exclusively military or specialized for sniper use variety of offtheshelf rifles handguns and optics are sufficient to conduct effective sniper operations ufouo use of vehicles in support of snip er operations both within the homeland and abroad illustrates the ingenuity of the terro rists and provides firing platform that can rapidly depart the area of operations ufouo employment of sniper tactics can have debilitating ffects on the population if sustained operations occur over period of time continued actions will have negative psychological and economic effects on the surrounding communities this tactic can provide an individual or terrorist gr oup unprecedented media coverage ufouo showing keen interest in mark smanship obtaining sniperrelated books and other training materials sp ending time at shooting ranges modifying vehicles in nontraditional manner and purchasing rifles and associated optics may be indicators of potential terrorist planning effo rts however most of these indicators can be associated with legitimate purposes unclassifiedfor official use only unclassifiedfor official use only 4 u introduction ufouo the fbi and atf currently has credib intelligence that rrorist organizations are using or plan to conduct snip er operations against targets w ithin the homeland case reviews show that lone individuals or twoperson teams have conducted the majority of sniper related incidents rather than organizational efforts sn iping attacks have spread fear and apprehension across communities and required only minimal pers onnel training and expense this attack method can be attractive because the weapons ar easy to procure published training materials are readily available and past domestic sniper ttacks and insurgent sniper activities in iraq have been successful u sniper tactics techniques and procedures ufouo tactic use military snipers receive specialized training to deliver highly accurate longrange fire against enemy targets in an effort to inhibit enem movement and harass opposing forces law enforcement snipers halt the lifethreatening actions of the perpetrator terrorist or criminal use of effective snip er ttps enables them to attack unsuspecting individuals in an effort to accomplish their objec tives these actions can have severe negative psychological and economic impacts on affected communities ufouo the effects of sniper tactics on dom estic populations includ creating widespread fear initiating extensive media coverage and straining law enfo rcements limited resources number of sniper attacks have occurred within the homeland the last few years u one person was killed another wounded nd up to four vehicles were damaged in separate southern indiana sniper shootings in july 2006 17yearold suspect has been charged with firing 270 caliber hunting rifle into moving vehicles from highway overpasses1 u three deadly sniperstyle shootings terroriz ed the charleston area of west virginia in august 2003 each victim was killed late at night by single shot2 the investigation into these shootings continues u in the summer and fall of 2003 two dozen sniper shootings ccurred around several highways outside columbus ohio killing one individual piercing homes and school flattening tires and shattering windshields3 charles mccoy used 9mm pistol which is not normally associated with sniper activitie s in spite of this his activities were characterized as sniping by the media he was convicted and is rving 27year prison term u john muhammad and lee boyd malvo conduc ted 13 sniper shootings 10 fatal in the washington dc area for three weeks in october 2002 both have been convicted for their actions4 unclassifiedfor official use only unclassifiedfor official use only 5 ufouo marksmanship training is an essentia l component to military and law enforcement trained snipers in addition to these trained pr ofessionals are many lawab iding groups and clubs that conduct marksmanship trai ning for recreation and thousands of hunters whose firearms may be highly accurate up to few hundred yards or more tactically proficient sniper can engage target over long distances while remaining unseen by the target or the surrounding population but shooting in an urban area does not necessar ily require long distance with good concealment the shots fired in the washington dc sniper cases averaged only 6070 yards5 interest in shooting fundamentals and marksmanship training ar not necessarily pretexts for terrorist sniper operations but with additional indicators law enforcement personnel may be able to exploit training evolutions ufouo target selection target selection and ensuing patterns may help investigators potentially develop profile of the sniper team identify motive and possibly make rough estimations of future targets however multip attacks must occur to discern pattern sniper operation designed to inf lict terror across community may on the surface appear to pick targets at random but this may be by desi gn the snipers could possibly target many components of the civilian infrastructure such as schools churches pos t offices retail stores gas stations movie theaters and so forth although appearing random the engagement of range of these types of targets over time may gi ve the public the impression that nowhere is safe from potential attack ufouo the washington dc sniper targ ets although randomly selected by the snipers gave the impression that nowhere wa s safe from possible attacks tertiary effect is that significant law enforcement resources are expended when determining whether the victims are connected concerte d effort to purposely strike those types of targets coupled with maintaining strict opera tional security can have debilitating effects on the surrounding population ufouo sniper ttp proficiency sniperrelated actions within the homeland have involved wide variety of perpetrators with va rying levels of shootingsniping proficiency and associated methods employed the level of atte ntion to detail training and employed ttps will greatly influence attack success and dr ive the subsequent investigations ufouo skilled sniper or sniper team is not defined only by the ability to shoot accurately over extended ranges additiona l attributes include conducting prestrike surveillance of the target area to determine the feasibility of an attack identification of entry exit and emergency routes through the operating area properly estimating target range and ensuring adequate cover and concealment availability to minimize det ection when conducting the attack they may shoot only once use silencers and flash suppre ssors if available account for environmental conditions on the shot and utilize proper shot pl acement for the desired effect some of these individuals may have military or law enforcement backgrounds and training and understand the discipline and ingenuity required fo r the effective and efficient use of the tactic without detection over multiple strikes unclassifiedfor official use only unclassifiedfor official use only 6 unclassified u john muhammad ufouo analysis of iraqi insurgent inte rnetposted videos reveals the insurgent snipers various levels of expertise xperienced snipers use the terrain to their advantage have egress plans stay conceal ed after the shot unless their position is detected and their shot placement avoids area s protected by coalition troops body armor the less experienced snipers shoot multiple time s at the target shoot at areas protected by body armor break and run immediately after the attack and have minimal situational awareness of their surroundings6 ufouo less skilled or novice sniper or team may not conduct such comprehensive planning and surveillance efforts varying levels of consideration for entry and exit routes closer target range multiple shot s against the same target and adjustment for environmental conditions are examples that would indicate th perpetrators lack discipline training and experience with sniperlike operations and methods although this does not necessarily prevent successful attacks these shortcomi ngs can potentially be exploited to interdict subsequent sniper operations ufouo individual versus team the ttps for an individual c onducting sniper attack are different than those utilized by team team is traditionally composed of two peoplea spotter and shooterbut can involve more personne l such as driver spotter informs the shooter when the target is approaching the defi ned firing area ski lled sniper may have narrow firing window due to cover and concealmen t efforts provides security for the team may videorecord the strike as observed in iraq and may abor t the attack due to potential compromise this allows the shooter to centrate on the site picture and firing position u during testimony in the trial of john allen muhammad british armed forces expert in sniper methodology testifie d at length about the distinct responsibilities of each member of tw oman sniper unit he stated one member of the team is the longrange shooter occupying an obscured position with the opportunity to shoot particular victim because of the intensity and discipline required to take advantage of the narrow window of opportunity to take the sh ot the other team member informs the longrang shooter that the vict im is coming within the zone of potential fire and that other circumstances are ripe for the shot the spotter may ultimately give the order to shoot7 ufouo teams not professionally trained may di stribute responsibilitie s differently and any additional team members would likely be involv ed in surveillance and security operations u during the irish republican army ira cam paign in northern ireland in the 1990s most successful sniper attacks involved two or more people th other team members provided security aided in targ et identification and determin ed the best exit strategy as events unfolded these teams were highly efficient coordinated their actions and carried out their sniper operations successfully8 the british military eventually disrupted these teams and their operations unclassifiedfor official use only unclassifiedfor official use only 7 unclassifiedufouo an individual sniper must account for all these aspects while attempting to successfully execute an attack nd depart the area unnoticed th is can contribute to easier identification by law enforcement personnel and the general populace ufouo surveillance direct correlation exists between the proficiency of the sniper or team and the methods employed when conductin g the respective operations planning may include preoperational surveillanc of potential target area during this phase the terrorists may observe the area for potential target locations ideal shooting pos itions relative to the target ingress and egress possibilitie s to minimize mission compromise story development for plausible deniability and cover and concealment for the shooter online mapping tools and commercial gps receivers can be used in suppor t of the surveillance and planning phases indicators during this phase may be quite subtle such as simply driving slowly or walking through potential targ et area or can be more overt in the fo rm of perpetrators taking pictures or video of odd locations shopping malls schools and so forth should strike simply be against an emergent target of opportunity this preopera tional planning will not take place to this depth ufouo john muhammad and lee boyd malvo made extensive use of the microsoft streets and trips mapping package to plan th eir entry and exit rout through the target area they also possessed gps that had th capability to be c onnected to the laptop although investigators do not believe it was used9 ufouo clear line of sight is required between the shooter and target depending on the bullets caliber associated weapon and target ra nge tree branches or other minor obstructions can potentially deflect bu llet enough to miss the target when determining the shot line those other planning considerations are factored into the feasibility assessment by the perpetrators position with clear view most likely will not be utilized should there be insufficient cover and concealment and inadequate entryexit routes through the target area due to potential compromise u dr barnett slepian an abortion provider was shot to death by sniper in his western new york home on 23 october 199810 the sniper was later identified as james kopp who was apprehended in france on 29 march 2001 and later convicted in the united states kopp stated he targeted slepian largely because his home was vulnerable because it had rear window facing some woods kopp said he sc outed slepians neighborhood approximately six times over the course of year before the attack he also stated that on two occasions he had his gun and was ready to shoot if he saw slepian at the rear window11 ufouo based on their surveillan ce efforts terrorists may also use dry runs during the final stages of operational planning to identify flaws and unanticipated problems in their attack plans12 these surveillance and dry run operati ons provide law enforcement and homeland security personnel an opportunity to detect operational planning unclassifiedfor official use only unclassifiedfor official use only 8 ufouo weapons weapons used in past sniper ttacks were not exclusively military derived or specialized for sniper use variety of offtheshelf rifles and associated ammunition are sufficient to conduct effective sniper operations many relatively inexpensive rifles used for target shooting or hunting are accurate up to few hundred yards and can be incorporated into sniper operations the inclusion of new optic sighting technology can help an unskilled shooter quickly become proficient marksman the use of rare weapon systems or odd caliber ammunition may aid the investigative efforts the following pictures are just small sampling of rifles that could or have been used in sniper attacks u bureau of alcohol tobacco firearms u the 3006 hunting rifle that james and explosives firearms expert walter

advantages and limitations use of static position does not limit the sniper to areas where vehicle cannot be placed as hi ghlighted in the slepian attac k it allows the perpetrator to account for the surroundings and maximize the natu ral cover and concealment the sniper can shoot from within structures on rooftops in and around natural vegetation and so forth the method of stalking into and away from the target area depends on the surrounding environment u although james kopp was not seen the nigh t of his sniper attack his vehicle was spotted in dr slepians neighborhood in the weeks before the attack 17 ufouo analysis of static iraqi insurgen t snipers internet posted videos reveals many of these snipers are tactically proficient they are using the urban terrain to their advantage

vehicular platforms use of vehicle as sniper platform adds new dimension to sniper activities and ttps the ve hicle itself can provide some measure of cover and concealment depending on how snipers use the vehicle attributes to their advantage vehicle also allows them to enter or canvas an area carrying their weapon s and associated gear possibly within hidden compartmen ts without the raising suspici on from the general public u the ira modified the interior of car to support their sniper ope rations in the 1990s sixteen of the twentyfour sniper attacks that occurred in the south armagh area of northern ireland involved the use of vehicle as mobile firing platform19 u john allen muhammad and lee boyd mal vo shot from the trunk inside their vehicle during their sniper attacks in and around the wash ington dc area in october 2002 u sniperrelated killings in the charleston ar ea of west virginia are suspected to have originated from the cab of pickup truck due to the fact th at immediately after the shot the truck sped away with tires spinning20 u iraqi insurgents involved in sniper operati ons routinely modify their vehicles to allow shooting from inside and employ other

referenced in this section were crude if terrorists have machineshop or autobody expe rience modifications to vehicle can be so subtle and welldisguised as to escape initial notice from investigative personnel discovering moveable taillight license plate door handle or even bumper th at may be operated from inside the vehicle would require extensive examin ation coupled with welldesigned hidden compartments for the weapon and associated gear vehicle of this nature will be extremely difficult to differentiate from others that may travel through law enforcement check points the ability to search such vehicle to the extent required to discover thes modifications without probable cause is severely limited terrorist s using such configuration who employ sound preoperational surveillance planning opera tional security execution procedures and ingressegress tactics may be extremel difficult to identif and apprehend u effects of sniperrelated activities u psychological and economic impact as past sustained sniper operations have shown fear begins affecting the populations daily activities during the si ege of sarajevo of the balkans war sniper alley became internationally know n due to the effects on the general population the indiscriminate civilian killi ngs people running in fear when going from one place to another and residents altering their moveme nts and activities due to the cons tant threat of sniper fire similar reactions were prevalent during the washington dc area sniper attacks in 2002 and studies reveal the negative consequences on the affected communities u the washington dc attacks caused wi despread fear among people for their own safety and for the safety of their families fortyfive percent of residents reported going to public spaces such as parks and shoppi ng centers less than usual and 55 percent reported missing at least one day of work due to the sniper attacks24 unclassified unclassifiedfor official use only unclassifiedfor official use only 12 u the same studys results suggest the s ubstantial social and economic burden that events such as these sniper shootings can ve on communities in particular the results support the notion that member s of these communities were experiencing symptoms consistent with posttraumatic stress disord er ptsd above the prevalence levels25 u study examining hospital staff reactions concluded the sni per shootings were associated with substantial changes in percei ved safety and threat assessment as well as decreased activities outside the home among high ly educated hospital employees levels of acute stress disorder were similar to levels of ptsd in new york city after the 11 september 2001 terrorist attacks26 ufouo although the relative risk of being shot by the sniper were less than being killed in car accident or by an accidental fall27 the perceived risk became much greater than the actual risk many people altered their daily activities to mitigate that perceived risk thus the sniper attacks created psychological and economic imp act in and around the affected communities even if members of the affected communities unde rstand the actual risk it is assessed that many in these communities will modify their daily ac tivities to limit their re spective exposure to the threat as observed during the dc sniper case u media coverage the media coverage during the wa shington dc sniper attacks was broadcast aroundtheclock nationally and even repor ted internationally this intense coverage contributed to the publics increase d perceived risk from the sniper attacks media coverage of future attacks could possibly in crease the perception of not being safe beyond the geographic area directly affected terrori st or group can use this media c overage to voice their respective beliefs and make their demands known to policy makers and law enforcement personnel this may also encourage other individuals or groups to conduct similar sniper like attacks the media can become tool for both the attackers and investigators with an eagerness to continue the coverage the attackers may become less discip lined in their activities and more susceptible to law enforcement interdiction efforts u outlook ufouo the fbi is unaware of terrorists curr ently planning sniper operations within the homeland the continued postings of successful ira qi insurgent sniper activity and recognition of past sniper attack effects within the homeland may embolden motivated individuals and organizations to conduct similar operations in the united states using some of the tactics described in this assessment should group conduct near simultaneous attacks in various communities across the country th effects can become magnifie d and spread to areas not directly attacked in conjuncti on with the attacks use of the subsequent media coverage to propagate their message may encourage others of parallel ideology to duct similar attacks in support of their cause further sp reading the fear and apprehension that these types of attacks can generate the sniping tactic can also be used in conjunction with other operations the tactic could be used as diversion or in dir ect support of direct assault attacks unclassifiedfor official use only unclassifiedfor official use only 13 ufouo showing keen interest in marksm anship obtaining sniperrelated books and other training
