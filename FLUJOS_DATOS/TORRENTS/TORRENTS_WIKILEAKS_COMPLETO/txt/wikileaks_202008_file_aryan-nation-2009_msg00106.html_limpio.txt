imprisoned congressman comes home to warm welcome after spending seven years in federal jail by michael collins piper former congressman jim traficant came home to freedom on september 2 after serving seven years in prison for crimes he did not commit more than thousand of his friends and admirers bought tickets to banquet being held in his honor in boardman ohio in his former congressional district surrounding youngstown although the major media is still smearing traficant as crook those who know traficant know his prison sentence was railroad job from the beginning the fact is that although there are probably dozens of members of congress who could be indicted and convicted for major criminal offenses involving highstakes bribery and influence peddling that is often quite open and never prosecuted the justice department spent many years coming up with handful of dubious charges against traficantask anyone who knows how it works in official washington and theyll privately admit that the real reason traficant was indicted on criminal charges was simply the fact that the powers that be didnt like traficant he was just too honest and too outspoken right up front lets lay it out here were some of traficants real crimes in the eyes of the elite who railroaded him into federal prison in 2002 criticizing the internal revenue service and calling for expanded protection for the rights of taxpayers under fire from the irs taking hardline stand against nafta the world trade organization and socalled free trade and urging protectionist measures to preserve american jobs defend domestic industry from predatory global speculators and save the american economy tackling not only corruption inside the fbi and the justice department but also assailing the personal integrity of former attorney general janet reno attacking wall street wheeling and dealing and raising questions about the enrichment of highlevel financial interests through the lending practices of the world bank and the international monetary fund accusing thenvice president gore of trying to steal the election in the midst of the longanddrawnout postelection debacle in 2000 calling for the withdrawal of us troops from troublespots around the globe and questioning constant us meddling in the affairs of other nations charging american policymakers with treason for having given topsecret us defense and nuclear technology to the butchers in peking coming to the defense of ukraineborn cleveland autoworker john demjanjuk who was falsely charged by the antidefamation league adl and the justice departments office of special investigations of being nazi war criminalonly to be cleared ironically by an israeli court ultimately with traficant sidelined in his own federal trial they went after demjanjuk again on new charges and restarted the process of seeking to deport the beleaguered old man who is now in germany facing trial on 29000 counts of being an accessory to the alleged murder of european jews demanding that us troops be sent to guard the mexican border and prevent continuing hordes of illegal aliensand potential terroristsfrom entering into the united states andlast but very far from least challenging onesided us aid and support for israel saying that the biased policy was to the detriment of americas security and middle east interests traficant was the only member of congressthe day after the sept 11 tragedyto point out that us support for israel and open borders were root problems leading to the tragedywhile traficant enunciated these truths other members of congress squirmed uneasily sitting in silence as traficant spoke outeven in the face of his impending trialnever one to be cowedcongressman jim traficant was most assuredly lynched by the justice department just as if he had been taken by force and hanged from lamp post near the us capitol in washingtona method of justice that certainly should be applied to many of the corrupt individuals who continue to misrule america from their positions in congress and throughout official washingtonhowever what happened to traficant could happen to any american should he or she fall into the gunsights of the powerful forces that reign supreme in america the traficant case is the proverbial tip of the iceberg for the truth is that sitting alongside traficant in prisons todayfederal state and localthere are probably thousands of americans who were as much victims of an unjust system as traficantthese people too are political prisoners in the plainest and most very real sense of the words but we havent heard about these folks because they didnt have the high public profile of the outspoken jim traficant so the lesson to be learned is simple even someone in position of influencesuch as us congressmancan be railroaded into prison by the very people whose job it is to enforce the laws journalist specializing in media critique michael collins piper is the
