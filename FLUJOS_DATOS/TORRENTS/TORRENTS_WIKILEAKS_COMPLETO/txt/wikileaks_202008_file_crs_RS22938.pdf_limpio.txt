retailer by the attorney general under this section3 violators of either provision could be subject to civil penalties4 the supreme court decision in rowe v new hampshire motor transport association the supreme court held that the two maine provisions were preempted by the federal aviation administration authorization act of 1994 faaaa5 that law prohibited states from enacting or enforcing law related to price route or service of any motor carrier with respect to the transportation of property6 this language was similar to language previously enacted in the 1978 airline deregulation act which included preemption provision stating state shall enact or enforce any law relating to rates routes or services of any air carrier7 the supreme court had analyzed the air carrier preemption language in morales v trans world airlines inc8 and held that federal law preempts states from enforcing their consumerfraud statutes agai nst deceptive airlinefare advertisements9 in finding that maines mailorder tob acco product delivery laws were preempted the court relied on its interpretation of the preemption language at issue in morales the court indicated that passage of the faaaa motor carrier preemption language took into account its previous interpretation of the air carrier preemption language in morales 10 the morales court found that preemption could occu r even if the state law only had an indirect effect on carrier rates routes or rvices and that preemp tion did occur if state laws have significant impact related to congresss deregulatory and preemptionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22938crs3 11 id 12 id at 5 13 id 14 id at 6 15 id 16 id at 67 17 id at 7 18 id 19 id at 78 20 id at 8 the public health service act author izes the secretary to make

and known as the synar amendment the secr etary may make such grants only if the state continuedrelated objectives11 however the morales court effectively said that preemption may not occur if the state law affects carrier ra tes routes or servi ces in only tenuous remote or peri pheral manner12 the rowe court first held that maines reci pientverification provision had direct connection with motor carrier services because it focused on trucking and other motor carrier services and that the maine law had significant and adverse impact in respect to the federal acts ability to achieve its preemptionrelated objectives13 therefore the rowe court found that federal law preempted maines recipient verification provision14 the court reasoned that maines law had the effect of substituting government commands for competitive market forces in determining the services that motor carriers will provide15 the rowe court next held that maines d eemed to know provision applies yet more directly to motor carrier services because the provision would impose civil liability upon the carrier if the carrier did not check each tobacco shipment for certain markings and compare it against the main attorney generals list of proscribed shippers16 as result the court found that ma ines law would affect congress major legislative effort to leave decisions where federally unr egulated to the competitive marketplace because if the court allowed maines shipment checking system then other states could im pose their own shipment checking systems17 this would appear to result in significant impact on congresss deregulatory objectives thus the rowe court held that federal law preempts maines regulation of the essential details of motor carriers system for pickingup sortin g and carrying goods essential details of the carriage itself18 in making this determinati on the court rejected maines argument that federal law did not preempt states effo rts to protect its citizens pub lic health and its assertion that its laws should not be preempted becau they helped prevent underage smoking19 maine based its argument on the legisla tive history of the faaaa and the synar amendment20 the legislative history reference was to conference report containinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22938crs4 20 continued has in effect law providing that it is unlawfu l for any manufacturer

public health exception for preemption of state laws22 first the court stated that the legislative history did not indicate that congress made determination on or focused upon the delivery regulation issue23 second the court discounted maines reliance on the synar amendment which does not mention specific state enforcement methods24 the court further referenced the potentially broad nature of public health exception to federal preemption of state laws related to carriers ting the number of products th variety of potential adverse public health effects and the difficulty of finding legal criterion for separating permissible publichealthorien ted regulations and found th at congress did not likely intend to create public health exception that could potentially affect tobacco shipments25 however the rowe court stated that general state public health laws would not always be preempted by fe deral law and that federal w would not preempt state laws with tenuous remote or peri pheral connection to carrier rates routes or services26 maine had further argued that because it could legally ban tobacco shipments from entering into or moving within the state it had the power to regulate the manner of tobacco shipments27 the court also rejected this argument noting that such regulation would allow the state to regulate carrier rate s routes and services and that federal law preempts such state laws that have significant impact and more than tenuous remote or peripheral effect28 the court also found that maines laws would behttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22938crs5 29 id at

on the basis of which meaning can be shown to have been understood by larger handful of the members of congress but rather on the basis of which meaning is 1 most in accord with context and ordinary usage and thus most likely to have been understood by the whole congress which voted on the words of the statute not to mention the citizens subj ect to it and 2 most compatible with the surrounding body of law into which the provision must be integrated compatibility which by benign fiction we assume congress alwa ys has in mind i would not permit any of the historical and legislative material discussed by the court or all of it combined to lead to result different from the one that these factors suggest 33 552 us __ 2008 scalia j concurring in partpreempted for these reasons regardless of wh ether as maine alleged the overturning of maines laws would hurt its fforts to stop underage smoking29 justice ginsburgs concurrence justice ginsburg wrote separately to emphasize the large regulatory gap left by an application of the faaaa perhaps overlooke d by congress and the urgent need to fill that gap30 in particular she restated the c oncerns of maine and others that age verification methods for mail order sales of tobacco produc ts could be used as an enforcement strategy to prevent tobacco sales to minors but noted that the faaaa preemption provisions block states from enactin g such methods she stated that there is lack of federal tobacco laws aimed at preventing tobacco sales to minors her concurrence then stated that state tobacco c ontrol measures such as those that resulted from the synar amendment are increasingly thwarted by the ease with which tobacco products can be purchased through the internet31 legislation has been introduced in the 110th

wellknown for not fa voring the use of legislative history as method of interpreting c ongressional intent issued one sentence concurrence32 he joined the courts opinion except where it relied on congressional committee reports to demonstrate congressional intent with regard to propositions that are apparent from the text of the law unnecessary to th disposition of the case or both33
