environmental policy resources science and industry divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33552clean air act issues in the 109th congress summary the courts and the executive branch have faced major decisions on clean air issues in 2006 with congress playing limited role one focus has been the epa administrators september 21 2006 decision regarding air quality standards for fine particles according to epa and the consensus of the scientific community current concentrations of fine partic cause tens of thousands of premature deaths annually the administrators september 21 decision will strengthen the standards according to the agency it will reduce premature mortality by 1200 13000 persons annually however many are unhappy that the new st andard will not be more stringent for the first time ever it falls outside of range recommended by the clean air scientific advisory committee casac an independent body established by the clean air act to provide expert scientif ic advice on september 29 the seven members of casac stated that the administrators decision does not provide an adequate margin of sa fety requisite to protect the public health in 2005 congress acted on several clean ai r act caa issues in legislation that it passed and sent to the president th most significant of these issues dealing with ethanol and reformulated gasoline rfg were addressed in the energy policy act of 2005 hr 6 pl 10958 congress also amended the clean air act in hr 3 pl 10959 the transportation b ill that the president signed august 10 2005 hr 3 modified the requirement that state and local transportation planners demonstrate conformity between thei r transportation plans and the timely achievement of air quality standards other clean air act amendments have stalled bill that would have established capandtrade program fo r emissions of sulfur dioxide so2 nitrogen oxides nox and mercury from coalfire d electric power plan ts s 131 was among the first items on the agenda of the 109th congress entitled the clear skies act the bill was scheduled for markup by the nate environment and public works committee march 9 2005 but the committee faile d to approve it on 99 tie vote in large part because of complaints that the bill would weaken existing clean air act requirements another issue in the debate was whether to cap emissions of the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide co2 in addition to the other three pollutants with clear skies stalled epa finalized the clean air interstate rule cair which will cap emissions of so2 and nox from power plants in 28 eastern states and the district of columbia and establish capand trade system through regulation deadline for mercury regulations helped drive the clear skies debate epa faced judicial deadline of march 15 2005 to promulgate standards for power plant mercury emissions the agency met this deadline but the specific regulations have been widely criticized resolution to d isapprove overturn the regulations under the congressional review act sjres 20 was defeated on vote of 5147 september 13 2005 but the courts have yet to rule on cha llenges filed by 15 states and other groups whether to modify othe r requirements of the clean air act new source review deadlines for nonattainme nt areas and provisions dealing with interstate air pollution have also been contentious

despite steady improvements in air quality in many of the united states most polluted cities the goal of clean air continues to elude the nation the most widespread problems involve ozone and fine particles as of march 2006 158 million people lived in areas classified nonattainment for the ozone national ambient air quality standard1 88 million lived in areas th at were nonattainment for fine particles pm252 air quality has improved substantially since the passage of the clean air act in 1970 annual emissions of the six most widespread criteria air pollutants have declined 160 million tons 53 despite major increases in population motor vehicle miles traveled and economic activity3 meanwhile however scientif ic understanding of the health effects of air pollution has caused epa to tighten standard s for ozone and fine particles fine particles as defined by ep consist of particulate ma tter 25 micromete rs or less in diameter abbreviated as pm25 the agency attribut at least 33000 premature deaths and millions of lost work days annually to exceedances of the pm25 standard recent research has begun to tie ozone pollution to premature mortality as well thus there is continuing pressure to tighten air quality standards tightening of the standard for fine particle s was finalized september 21 2006 ozone standards are scheduled for review in 2007 with fi nal decision due by february 2008 and attention has focused on major sources of ozone and particulate pollution such as coalfired power plants and mobile sources with this background in mind the bulk of

which contain more information nd detailed sources the crs reports are referenced in the appropriate sections revision of the particulate standards on september 21 2006 epa administrator stephen johnson signed revisions to the national ambient air quality st andards naaqs for particulate matter the standards appeared in the federal register on october 174 epa reviewed 2000 scientific studies on pa rticulates in developi ng the revision and found associations between particulates nd numerous significant health problems including aggravated asthma chronic br onchitis reduced lung function irregular heart beat heart attacks and premature deat h in people with heart or lung disease the revisions would strengthen the pre existing standard for particulate matter 25 micrometers or less in diameter known as fine particles or pm25 but the standard will not be strengthened to the degree recommended by the agencys staff or scientific advisors as shown in table 1 the new standard will cut the allowable concentration of pm25 in the air averaged over 24hour periods from 65 micrograms per cubic meter µgm3 to 35 µgm3 the annual standard currently set at 15 µgm3 will not be changed table 1

2006epas professional staff and the clean air scientific advisory committee casac group established by the clean air act to provide i ndependent scientific advice to the administrator had recommended stronger standards casac endorsed 24hour standard in the range of 30 to 35 µgm3 and an annual standard in the range of 13 to 14 µgm3 twenty of the casac panel s 22 members concurred in the recommendation in the administrators judgment the science underlying this recommendation was not sufficient relying primarily on tw studies neither of which provides clear basis for selecting level lower than the current standard5 the administrator agrees with casac that the science shows relationship between higher levels of pm25 and an array of adverse health effects but he believes there is too much uncertainty in the analysis to justify lowering the annual standard6 he also noted that epa is undertaking substantial re search to clarify which aspects of pm related pollution are responsible for elev ated risks of mortality and morbidity including multimillion dollar research program whose timeline should permit the results to inform the agencys next periodic reevaluation of the pm25 standard required by statute within five years thus he concluded it would be wiser to consider modification of th annual standard with fuller body of information in hand than initiate change in th annual standard at this time7 the pm naaqs also addresses slightly rger but still inhala ble particles in the range of 10 to 25 micrometers these ar referred to as thoracic coarse particles or pm1025 in its last review of the pa rticulate standards in 1997 epa had regulated these as particles 10 microns or smaller pm10 category that overlapped the pm25 category challenged in the dc circuit court of appeals the pm10 standard was remanded to epa th court having concluded that pm10 is poorly matched indicator for thoracic coarse particles because it includes the smaller pm25 category as well as the larger particles in response earlier this year epa proposed 24hour standard for pm1025 the standard would have been set at level of 70 µgm3 compared to the current 24hour pm10 standard of 150 µgm3 the final standards signed by the administrator september 21 reversed course leaving in place the current form of the standard pm10 and the current level 150 µgm3 the only change to the pm10 standard was revocation of its annual component the agency argues that it has provided more thoroug h reasoning in support of the use of pm10 as its coarse particle indicator and believes that its explanation will satisfy the court casacs views the administrators decisions represent the first time in casacs nearly 30year history that the promulgated standards fall outside of the range of the scientific pa nels recommendations in letter dated september 29 the 7 members of casac objected to the admin istrators actions both as regards pm10 and pm25 with regard to pm25 the letter stated casac is concerned that epa did not accept our finding that the annual pm25 standard was not protective of humanhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33552crs4 8 letter of rogene henderson et to hon stephen l johnson

to the national ambient air quality standards for particle pollution particulate matter fact sheet p 2 at ibid the agency actually produced three sets of benef it numbers based on three different studies and different agency documents provide varying estimates the study on which the agency seems to have placed the greatest emphasis study done for the american cancer society was used to estimate that 2500 premature deat hs would be avoided the other two studies would have produced higher benefit numbers the harvard sixcity study for example was used to estimate reduction of 5700 pr emature deaths annually and an expert elicitation produced mean estimate of 7000 premature deaths reduced health and did not follow our recommenda tion for change in that standard8 the letter noted that there is clear and convincing sc ientific evidence that significant adverse humanhealth effects occur in res ponse to shortterm and chronic particulate matter exposures at and below 15 µgm3 and noted that 20 of the 22 particulate matter review panel members including all seven members of the statutory committee were in complete agreement regarding the recommended reduction it is the casacs consensus scientific opinion that the decision to retain without change th annual pm25 standard does not provide an adequate margin of safety requisite to protect the public health as required by the clean air act 9 with regard to pm10 the letter stated that casac was completely surprised at the decision to revert to the use of pm10 as the indicator for coarse particles noting that the option of retaining the existing daily pm10 standard was not discussed during the advisory process and that casac view s this decision as highly problematic the administrator is not required by statute to follow casacs recommendations the act in section 307d3 requires only that the administrator set forth any pertinent findings recomme ndations and comments by casac and the national academy of sciences and if his proposal differs in an important respect from any of their recommendations provide an explanation of the reasons for such differences courts in re viewing epa regulations also generally defer to the administrators judgment on scientific matters focusing more on issues of procedure jurisdiction and standing nevertheless casac s detailed objections to the administrators decisions and its desc ription of the process as having failed to meet statutory and procedural requirements could play role if the standards are challenged in court impacts of the new standard epa is prohibited from taking cost into account in setting naaqs but in order to comply with an executive order the agency has produced regulatory impact analysis ria analyzing in detail the costs and benefits of the new pm standards10 the agency estimates that compliance with the new pm25 standard will prevent 1200 to 13000 premature deaths annually as well as substantial numbers of hosp ital admissions and missed work or school days due to illness11 critics of the rule argue that as many as 30000 premature deaths could be avoided annua lly if the administrator had chosen the more

ra nge of benefit estimates from 8 billion to 76 billion annually depending on the num ber of avoided deaths the choice of discount rate and other fact ors more stringent lternative reducing the annual standard to 14 µgm3 would increase the cost by about 50 to 79 billion annually according to the agency but would nearly double the estimated benefits14 thus the benefitcost ratio would be more favorable according to the agencys analysis had the administrator chosen the more stringent standard using the most recent available monitoring data the agency identified 141 counties where air quality is worse than llowed under the new standards observed on map these areas can seem small comp ared to the approx imately 3000 counties in the united states but two factors make the impact of the standards far larger first the number of counties where emissions will need to be controlled may be 2 or 3 times the number of those exceeding the standard since nonattainment areas include both counties where pollutant concen trations exceed the standard and those that contribute to exceedance of the standard in adjoining counties entire metropolitan areas tend to be designated nonattainment even if only one county in the area has readings worse than the st andard second the nonattainment counties tend to have larger populations than those in attainment 88 million people about 30 of the us population live in the 208 counties designated nonattainment for thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33552crs6 15 epa office of research and development air quality criteria for particulate matter p 931 as

larger percentage of the population implementation of the naaqs naaqs does not directly limit emissions rather it represents the epa administrators formal judgment regarding the level of ambient pollution that will prot ect public health with an adequate margin of safety promulgation of naaqs sets in motion process under which the states and epa first identify nonattainment areas after these areas are formally designated process epa estimate s will take until april 2010 for the revised pm25 standard the states have three years to submit state implementation plans sips that identify specific regulations and emission control requirements that will bring the area into attainment attainme nt of the revised standard is to be achieved by 2015 according to epa with possible extension to 2020 issues number of issues were raised during consideration of the proposed standards and most remain in the wake of the administr ators decision those who would like to see stronger standards incl uding number of states and environment and health groups have focused on the agencys disregard of casacs recommendation that the annual pm25 standard be strengthened some industrial and agricultural interests on the other hand ar questioning the agencys strengthening of the standard for all fine particles wit hout distinguishing their source or chemical composition the agencys response to this is that studies suggest that many different chemical components of fine par ticles and variety of different types of source categories are all associated with and probably contribute to mortality either independently or in combinations15 these and other issues may be raised in court challenges or in congressional oversight the clean air subcommittee of the senate environment and public works committee held oversight hearings on the pm proposal july 13 and july 19 2006 for more detailed discussion of the new naaqs see crs report rl33254 air quality epas 2006 c hanges to the particulate matter pm standard by robert esworthy and james mccarthy clear skiesmultipollutant legislation major focus of congre ssional attention in the first session of the 109th congress was whether to take action on the clear skies act bill that would regulate multiple pollutants from coalfired electric power plants tie vote in the senate environment and public works committee blocked senate version of the bill s 131 from advancing to the sena floor march 9 2005 the committees 99 vote brought to an end probably for the re mainder of the congre ss further attempts to find compromise on clear skies amendm ents earlier mar kups of clear skies scheduled for february 16 march 2 and march 3 2005 had been postponed so that senators could undertake di scussions aimed at crafting compromise the billhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33552crs7 would have significantly amended the clean air act to establish capandtrade system for emissions from electric power pl ants and other sources of air pollution while eliminating or deferring numerous existing regulations affecting those sources coalfired power plants are among the largest sources of air pollution in the united states under the clean air act they are not necessarily subject to stringent requirements emissions nd the required control equipm ent can vary depending on the location of the plant when it was constructed whether it has undergone major modifications the specific type of coal it burns and to some extent the vagaries of epa enforcement policies more than half dozen separate clean air act programs could potentially be used to control emissions which makes compliance strategy complicated for utilities and difficult for regu lators and since the cost of the most stringent available controls for the entire industry could range into the tens of billions of dollars utilities have fought hard and rather successfully to limit or delay regulation as result emissions from power plants have not been reduced as much as those from some other sources many pl ants built in the 1950s or 1960s generally referred to as grandfathered plants have little emission control equipment collectively these plants are large s ources of pollution in 2003 power plants accounted for nearly 11 million tons of sulfur dioxide so2 emissions 69 of the us total about 45 tons of mercury emissions more than 40 of the us total and nearly 45 million tons of nitrogen oxides 22 of the us total power plants are also considered major sources of fine particles pm25 and account for about 40 of us anthropogenic emissions of the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide an example of their importance was seen in the august 2003 northeast blackout with about 100 power plants most of them coalfired shut down researchers found that ambient levels of so2 and ozone were 90 and 50 lower respectively in blackedout areas with new ambient air quality standards for ozone and fine particles taking effect emissions of nox which contri butes to the formation of ozone and so2 which is among the sources of fine particle s need to be reduced to meet standards mercury emissions have also been focus of concern 44 states have issued fish consumption advisories for mercury covering 13 million acres of lakes 765000 river miles and the coastal waters of 12 entire states the continuing controversy over the interpretation of ne w source review requirement s for existing power plants discussed at greater length in separate section below is also exerting pressure for more predictable regulatory structure thus many in industry nvironmental groups congress and the administration agree that the time is ripe for legislation that addresses power plant pollution in comprehensive multipollutant fashi on such legislation the administration version of wh ich is dubbed clear skies would address the major pollutants on coordinated sc hedule and would rely to large extent on system like that used in the acid rain program where national or re gional caps on emissions are implemented through system of trad eable allowances the key questions have been how stringent the caps should be and whether carbon dioxide co2 will be among the emissions subject to caphttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33552crs8 regarding the stringency issue clear skies and other bills introduced in this congress would require reduction of nox emissions to somewhere between 15 and 18 million tons per year 7080 re duction from 1998 levels and reduction of sulfur dioxide emissions to 2030 million tons per year also reduction of 70 80 versus 1998 regarding mercury the bills would either require epa to determine the level of re ductions or require reducti ons of 7090 from current levels of emissions from 45 to some where between 5 and 15 tons annually depending on the bill in the most stringent of the bills sen ator jeffords s 150 and representative waxmans hr 1451 these reductions would take place by 2009 or 2010 depending on the pollutant the jeffords and waxman bills would also set caps on co2 emissions for additional informa tion and detailed comparison of the legislative proposals see crs report rl32755 air quality multipollutant legislation in the 109th congress by larry parker and john blodgett the clear skies bill s 131 envisions less stringent standards than those in most other bills phased in over much longer period of time for nox the bill would reduce emissions to 179 million t ons per year but not until 2018 an intermediate limit of 219 million tons w ould be imposed in 2008 for sulfur dioxide the limit would be 30 million tons annually also in 2018 with an intermediate limit of 45 million tons in 2010 for mercury the limit would be 34 tons per year in 2010 declining to 15 t ons in 2018 in negotiations over s 131 senators voinovich and inhofe offered to change the phase 2 deadlines under clear skies to 2016 and to implement phase 3 so2 cap of 25 million tons in 2018 because the deadlines are far in the future the administrations analysis of clear skies shows that utilities would be likely to overcomply in the early years of the program the administration uses this as selling point for its approach arguing that it will achieve reductions sooner than would traditional regulatory approach with the same deadlines but overcompliance in the early years would lead to banked emission allowances these coul d be used in later years to delay achievement of required reductions in its analysis of the bill epa does not expect to see the full 70 emission reductions til 2026 or later point seized upon by its opponents to support more aggressive approach in return for establishing its new capa ndtrade program clear skies would also eliminate or restrict numerous existing clean air act requirements with respect to electric generating units including ne w source review new source performance standards prevention of significant deterioration lowest achievable emission rate standards best av ailable retrofit technology and maximum achievable control technology regulations for mercur it would allow sources in other industries to opt into the capandtrade pr ogram and escape existing clean air act controls it would remove deadlines for cal areas to achieve ozone and particulate standards under certain conditions and ma ke it more difficult for nonattainment areas to challenge interstate sources of air pollu tion the other bills generally would leave these existing controls in place for more thorough discussion of how clear skies would change the clean air act see crs report rl32782 clear skies and the clean air act whats the difference by larry parker and james mccarthyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33552crs9 16 the rule appeared in the federal register on may 12 2005 70 fr 25162 17 us epa office of air and

whereas most competing bills have ddressed four pollutants the three plus co2 the administration views controls on co2 as step toward implementing the kyoto protocol to th united nations framework convention on climate change which it opposes for vari ety of reasons principally the potential economic impacts on us industries the absence of co2 from the mix leads to different strategies for achieving compliance preserving more of market for coal and lessening the degree to which power producers might switch to natural ga s or renewable fuels as compliance strategy in its opposition to co2 controls the administration is supported by most in the utility and coal industries others mostly outside these industries but including some utilities view co2 controls as inevitable if not desirable and support simultaneous implementation of capandtrade programs for co2 and the other pollutants although stalled for the previous thr ee years clear skies was set for early consideration in the 109th congress by the senate nvironment and public works committee but the opposing sides were not ab to reach consensus and the bill failed on tie vote on march 9 2005 the h ouse has taken action other than an energy and commerce subcommittee hearing may 26 2005 in negotiations preceding the senate co mmittee vote there was some movement toward compromise on the republican side there were offers to move the deadlines for phase 2 caps forward two years from 2018 to 2016 and to add third phase for so2 mechanism for addressing rcury hot spots was added and adjustments to the provisions on interstate transport of pollution were offered the opponents of the bill who included all the committee democrats plus senators jeffords and chafee conceded that bill with stringent co2 caps would not pass and were willing to accept some less stringen t provisions on that score these compromises proved insufficient to bridge the gap whether they might serve as basis for further discussions and action later in the congress now appears doubtful immediately following the vote on march 10 2005 epa announced that it would promulgate final regulations for utility emissions of so2 and nox in 28 eastern states and the district of columbia through its clean air interstate rule cair16 the capandtrade provisions of cair mimic those of clear skies but cair does not allow epa to remove existing clean air act requirements as clear skies would under cair epa proj ects that nationwide emissions of so2 will decline 53 by 2015 and nox emissions will decline 48 the agency also projects that the rule will result in 85 100 billion in health benefits annually by 2015 incl uding the prevention of 17000 premature deaths annually17 cairs health and environmental bene fits are more than 25 times greater than its costs according to epa for additional informati on on the cair rule see crs report rl32927 clean air interstate rule review and analysis by larry

rule appeared in the federal register in two parts in the first part on march 29 2005 as explained further in the text below the agency revised its determination that mercury emissions from electric generating units should be regulated as hazardous air pollutants under section 112 of the clean air act 70 fr 15994 in the second part on may 18 2005 the agency promulgated capa ndtrade program under section 111 of the act 70 fr 28606finally one of the issues raised by opponents of clear skies has been epas reluctance to conduct costbenefit analysis of the competing bills on october 27 2005 the agency responded to this criticism by producing an analysis of the costs and benefits of clear skies nd two senate bills senator jeffords s 150 and senator carpers 108th congress bill18 the carper bill that was analyzed was s 843 from the 108th congress subsequent to ep as analysis on may 4 2006 senator carper introduced new bill s 2724 the epa analysis found significant benefits that exceed costs for all three bills but it started from baseline that did not include three recently promulgated regulations notably the cair rule whose requirements and benefits are similar to those of clear skies adjusting for the three regulations one finds that clear skies would have negligible incremental costs and added benefits of 6 billion in 2010 and 3 billion in 2020 for the same ears senator carpe rs bill would have annual net benefits 8 and 5 times as great as clear skies at annual costs of 42 billion in 2010 and 3 billion in 2020 and sena tor jeffords bill would have annual net benefits 10 and 16 times those of clear skies at annual costs of 236 billion in 2010 and 181 billion in 2020 the analys is contains number of assumptions that have substantial impacts on the results for more

2005 epa also finalized through regulation capandtrade program for mercury emissions from electric utilities19 the mercury regulations which like cair mimic the requirements of clear skies rely almost entirely on cobenefits of the cair rule the agencys analysis of the mercury rule finds that less than 1 of coalfired power plant capacity would install pollution control equipment specifically designed to control mercury within 10 years as result of the mercury rule by 2020 only 4 of cap acity would have such equipment epa reversed course severa l times before choosing its fi nal approach to mercury regulation the agency was required by the terms of the 1990 clean air act amendments and 1998 consent agreemen t to determine whether regulation of mercury from power plants under section 112 of the clean air act was appropriatehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33552crs11 20 us epa office of air quality planning and standards regulatory impact analysis of the clean air mercury rule march 2005

maximum achievable control tec hnology mact sta ndards for electric power plants by december 15 2003 nd finalize them by march 15 2005 the december 2003 pr oposal offered two alternatives the first met the agencys requirement under the consent agreement by proposing mact standards the standards would have applied on facilitybyfacility basis and would have resulted in emissions of 34 tons of mercury annually reduction of about 30 from the 1999 level the standard s would have taken effect in 2008 three years after promulgation with possible oneyear extensions the second mercury alternative va riant of which the agency chose to promulgate march 15 2005 uses section 111 d of the act to avoid having to promulgate mact standards the agen cy proposed reversing its december 2000 regulatory finding arguing that while mact standards were appropriate they were not necessary since the emissions could be controlle d under section 111d instead section 111d has ra rely been used before and never for hazardous air pollutants in the final rule the agency went step further concluding that mact regulations are neither appr opriate nor necessary and so revises its december 2000 regulatory finding the final regulations establish nationa l capandtrade system for power plant emissions of mercury as in clear skies the cap will be 15 tons of emissions nationwide in 2018 about 70 reduction from 1999 levels if achieved there will also be an intermediate cap of 38 tons in 2010 the caps will be implemented through an allowance system similar to that used in the acid rain program through which utilities can either control the pollutant directly or purchase excess allowances from other plants that have controlled more stringently or sooner than required as with clear skies early reductions could be banked for later use which the agency says would result in emissions of 313 tons in 2010 nearly 7 tons less than the cap if this happens it would allow utilities to delay compliance with the full 70 reduction until well beyond 2018 as they us up banked allowances rather than installing further controls the agencys analysis projects actual emissions to be 243 tons less than 50 reduction as late as 2020 full compliance with the 70 reduction would be layed until after 202520 besides the stretched out implementation schedule one of the main criticisms of the capandtrade proposal is that it w ould not address hot spots areas where mercury emissions and or concentrations in water bodi are greater than elsewhere it would allow facility to purchase allowances and avoid any emission controls if that compliance approach makes the most nse to the plants owners and operators if plants near hot spots do so the capa ndtrade system may not have an impact onhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33552crs12 mercury concentrations in the most contaminated areas by contrast mact standard would have requi red reductions at all plan ts and would therefore be expected to improve conditions at hot spots many argue that the mercury regulations should be more stringent or implemented more quickly to large extent these arguments and epas counterarguments rest on assumptions c oncerning the availability of control technologies controlling so2 nox and mercury simultaneously as the agency prefers would allow utilities to maximize cobenefits of emission controls controls such as scrubbers and fabric filters both of wh ich are widely used today to control so2 and particulates have the side ffect of reducing rcury emissions to some extent under epas capand trade regulations both the 2010 and 2018 mercury emission standards are set to maximize use of these cobenefits thus few controls would be required to specifically address mercury emissions before the 2020s the costs specific to controlling mercury would be minimal and emissions would decline to about 50 of the 1999 level in 2020 besides citing the cost advantage of relying on cobenefits epa has claimed that technology specifically designed to c ontrol mercury emissions such as activated carbon injection aci would not be ge nerally available until after 2010 this assertion is widely disputed aci and fabric filters have been in use on municipal waste and medical waste incinerators for decade and have been successfully demonstrated in at least 16 fullscale test s at coalfired power plants for periods as long as year manufacturers of pollution controls and many ot hers maintain that if the agency required the use of aci and fabric filters at power plants reductions in mercury emissions as great as 90 could be achieved at reasonable cost in the near future the agency can take cost into consid eration under the mact or capandtrade rules and cost to electric utilities appears to have been determining factor in epas analysis in its proposal however calcula tions of the overall societal costs and benefits seemed to support the imposition of more stringent standard the agency projected mact compliance costs at 945 million per year versus quantifiable annual benefits from longer lives and less illness of mo re than 15 billion 16 to 1 advantage the final rule completely changes this analysis it concludes that the benefits of mercury control are at most 43 milli on per year with annual costs as high as 896 million the new analysis did not include several peerreviewed studies that indicated stricter utility mercury rules would have yielded large benefits in addition to the arguments over technol ogy availability and cost it is unclear whether epa has legislative authority to establish capandtrade program for mercury many argue that the agency is required by the statute to impose mact standards on each individual plant once it s decided to control mercury emissions questions have also arisen regarding the ro of industry lobbyists in crafting portions of the epa proposal for many of these reasons 45 senators wrote epa administrator leavitt at the beginning of ap ril 2004 to request that he withdraw the mercury proposal and begin over in june 2004 178 house members wrote leavitt that they hoped further review will lead to stronger final rule on

the house by representative meehan if enacted into law these reso lutions would have di sapproved the rule epa promulgated on march 29 2005 in which the agency determined not to regulate mercury from fossilfueled electric utility units under section 112 the net effect of disapproval would have been that epa would be forced to issue mact standards for coal and oilfired electric power plants on ptember 13 however the senate rejected sjres 20 5147 thus allowing the epa rule to go forward the senate action has effect on judicial challenges which are still pending in addition to judicial challenges mo st of the same states and several environmental groups petitioned epa to reconsider the merc ury rules in part they said because portions of the final rules had not been included in the proposal and therefore the public had been denied the opportunity to comment epa agreed to reconsideration on october 21 2005 on may 31 2006 the agency announced that it had completed the reconsid eration making only minor changes to the rule the agencys action means that court proceedings which were held in abeyance while the agency reconsidered can now move forward for additional information

whether epa has adequately enforced existing regulations using process called new source review the new source review debate has occurred largely in the courts epa took more aggressive stance on new source review under the clinton administration filing laws uits against 13 utilities for violations at 51 plants in 13 states the bush ad ministration has taken action against an additional half dozen utilities but has made little headway in settling the originalhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33552crs14 23 united states v ohio edison co c2991181 sd ohiosuits or in bringing them to trial in the meantime it has proposed major changes in the nsr regulations that critics argue will gut new source review as it pertains to modifications of existing plants the controversy over the nsr process stems from epas application of new source performance standards to existing sta tionary sources of air pollution that have been modified the clean air act states that new sources subject to nsr and its requirement to install pollution controls include modifications of existing sources as well as plants that are totally new industry has generally avoided the nsr process however by claiming that changes to existing sources were routine maintenance rather than modifications in the 1990s epa began reviewing records of electric utilities petroleum refineries and other industries to determine whether the changes were in fact routine as result of these reviews since late 1999 epa and the department of jus tice have filed suit or administrative actions against numerous large sources of pollution alleging that they made major modifications to their plants extending plant life and in creasing output without undergoing required new source reviews and wit hout installing best available pollution controls of the utilities charged with nsr violations 11 have settled with epa generally without going to trial under th settlements they have agreed to spend about 5 billion over the next decade on polluti on controls or fuel switching in order to reduce emissions at their affected units combined these companies will reduce pollution by about 775000 tons annually since july 25 2000 the agency has also reached 17 agreements with petroleum refine rs representing threefourths of industry capacity the refiners agreed to settle potential charges of nsr violations by paying fines and installing equipment to eliminate 315000 tons of pollution about half the utilities charged with nsr violations have not settled with epa they and other critics of the agencys enforcement actions claim that epa reinvented the rules they also contend that strict interpretation of what constitutes routine maintenance will prevent them from making changes that would have previously been allowed without commitment of time and money for per mit reviews and the installation of expensive pollution control equipment this provides disincentives for power producers refiners and others to expand output at existing facilities they maintain the first case involving one of the nonse ttling utilities went to trial in february 2003 in an august 7 2003 decision the u s district court for the southern district of ohio found that ohio edison had violated the clean air act 11 times in modifying its w h sammis power plant the company subsequently settled the case agreeing to spend 11 billion

determining whether nsr appliesresult of the modifications even if annua l emissions did increase the company was not required to undergo nsr and insta ll more stringent pollution controls24 while pursuing these enforcement actions the bush administration has promulgated number of changes to the nsr regulations that would make future enforcement of nsr less likely in december 2002 and october 2003 the agency promulgated five sets of changes to the ns r rules the most c ontroversial were new regulations defining what c onstitutes routine maintenance25 the new regulations would have exempted industrial fac ilities from undergoing nsr and thus from installing new emission controls if they were replacing safety reliability and efficiencyrated components with new functionally equivalent equipm ent and if the cost of the replacement components was ss than 20 of the replacement value of the process unit using this benchmark few if any plant modifications would trigger new pollution controls these changes were highly controversia l the administration and its supporters characterized them as streamlining or improving the program others saw them as permanently grandfathering older more polluting facilities from ever having to meet the clean air standards required of newer plants fifteen states three municipalities and veral environmental groups filed suit to block the equipment replacement routine maintenance rule the rule was stayed by the us court of appeals for the dc circuit on december 24 2003 on march 17 2006 three judge panel of the court unanimously struck the rule down in its decision the court held that epas attempt to change the nsr regulations was contrary to the plain language of the clean air act26 epa proposed further changes to th nsr regulations october

between epas regulatory actions and its enforcement stance while the agency stated in promulgating the equipment replacement rule that we do not intend our actions today to create retroactive applicability for todays rule continued pursuit of the enforcement actions filed during the clinton administration would create double standard for utilities with one set of rules applicable to those utilities unlucky enoug h to have been cited for violations prior to promulgation of the ne w rule and different standard applicable afterward despite earlier agency denials that the rule would affect ongoing investigations in early november 2003 epa s enforcement chief j p suarez and another epa official were reported to have indicated that the agency would drop enforcement actions against 47 facilities that had already r eceived notices of violation and would drop investigations of possible violations at an additional 70 power companies agency staff who were involved in the enforcement

hr 6 the comprehensive energy bill that it passed and sent to the president july 29 2005 the most significant of these issues dealt with ethanol and reformulated gasoline rfg the final version of the bill stripped most provisions dealing with the related issue of mtbe gasoline additive that competes with ethanol and has been the subject of much controversy until recently mtbe and ethanol were used to meet clean air act requirements that reformulated gasoline rfg sold in the nations worst ozone nonattainment areas contain at least 2 ox ygen to improve combustion under the rfg program areas with severe or extreme ozone pollution 124 counties with combined population of 736 million must use reformulated gas areas with less severe ozone pollution may opt into the pr ogram as well and ma ny have in allhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33552crs18 portions of 17 states and the district of columbia use rfg and about 30 of the gasoline sold in the united states is rfg implemented in 1995 the law required until may of this year that rfg contain at least 2 oxygen by weight refiners could meet this requirement by adding number of ethers or alcohols any of whic h contains oxygen and other elements by far the most commonly used oxygenate has been mtbe in 1999 87 of rfg contained mtbe number reduced to 46 by 2004 mtbe has also been used since the late 1970s in nonreformulated gaso line as an octane enhancer at lower concentrations as result gasoline with mtbe has been used virtually everywhere in the united states whether or not an area has been subject to rfg requirements mtbe leaks generally from underground gasoline storage tanks have been implicated in numerous incidents of gr ound water contaminati on the substance creates taste and odor problems in water at very low concentrati ons and some animal studies indicate it may pose potential cancer risk to humans for these reasons 25 states have taken steps to ban or regulate its use the most significant of the bans in california new york and c onnecticut took effect at the end of 2003 leading many to suggest that congress revisit the issue to modify the oxygenate requirement and set more uniform national requirement s regarding mtbe and its potential replacements principally ethanol support for eliminating the oxygen requi rement on nationwide basis has been widespread among the petroleum industry environmental groups and states in general these groups have concluded that gasoline can meet the same low emission performance standards as rfg without the use of oxygenates but opposition to enacting legislation removing the ox ygen requirement came from number of agricultural interests nearly 13 of th nations corn crop was used to produce the competing oxygenate ethanol in 2004 if mtbe use were reduced or phased out but the oxygen requirement remained in effect ethanol use would soar increasing demand for corn ethanol use has already grown substantially as mtbe began to be phased out conversely if the oxygen re quirement were waived by epa or by legislation not only would mtbe use dec line but likely so would demand for ethanol thus members of congress and senators from corn states took keen interest in mtbe and rfg legislation as passed by the house on april 21 2005 hr 6 contained numerous mtbe and ethanol provisions with some poten tial exceptions it would have banned the use of mtbe as fuel additive except in states that specifically authorized its use after december 31 2014 the clean air act requirement to use mtbe or other oxygenates in rfg would have been rep ealed 270 days after enactment in most states immediately in california in place of this requirement the bill substituted major stimulus to the use of ethanol under renewable fuels standard rfs annual production of gasoline would have been requi red to contain at least 5 billion gallons of ethanol or other renewable fuel n increase from 34 billion gallons in 2004 by 2012 to prevent backsliding on air quality the bill required that the reductions in emissions of toxic substances achieved by rfg be maintained it authorized 2 billion in grants to assist merchant mt be production facilities in converting to the production of other fuel additives the bill also authorized funds for mtbe cleanup and perhaps most controve rsially would have provi ded safe harbor fromhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33552crs19 defective product liab ility lawsuits for producers of mtbe ethanol and other renewable fuels product liab ility lawsuits have been used to force petroleum and chemical companies to pay for cleanup of ground and surface water contaminated by releases of fuels containing mtbe the senate version of hr 6 passed june 28 2005 contained mtbe and ethanol provisions as well but they were different from the house bill in several respects the senate bill would have increased the renewable fuels standard to 8 billion gallons by 2012 it would have pha sed out the use of mtbe sooner within four years of enactment ra ther than at the end of 2014 and it omitted potential nationwide presidential exception to the mt be ban that the house version would have provided the senate version also omitted the safe harbor for mtbe producers in the 108th congress the safe harbor pr ovision had been among the most controversial provisions in similar b ill cited by numerous opponents in senate debate on the conference report the opponents prevailed on cloture motion and the bill died the 109th congress senate bill also differed in how much it would authorize for cleanup of mt be releases and for transition assistance to mtbe producers in the end unable to reach compromis addressing mtbe house and senate conferees stripped most of the mtbe pr ovisions from the conference report on hr 6 the final version approved by the h ouse july 28 2005 and the senate july 29 and signed into law pl 10958 by the president august 8 2005 neither bans mtbe use nor provides safe harbor for its producers nor does it provide transition assistance for mtbe producers it does however repeal the rfg programs oxygen requirement and in pl ace requires that motor fuels contain 75 billion gallons of ethanol or other renewable fuels by 2012

required to implement more stringent controls on emissions failure to reach attainment by the specified deadline was to result in reclassification of an area to higher category and the imposition of
