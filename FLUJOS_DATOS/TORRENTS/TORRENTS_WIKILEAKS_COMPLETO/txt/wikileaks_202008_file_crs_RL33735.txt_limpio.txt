of hr 5068 and s 3938 overview the exportimport bank eximbank is an independent us government agency that serves as the chief us government agency to help finance american exports of manufactured goods1 congress has direct oversight responsibility over the bank which it exercises through various methods including approving the banks charter extending its authority through reauthorizing legislation annual budget appropriations senate confirmation of presidential appointments to the banks board of directors and the banks president requests for testimony from the banks president and amendments to the banks governing statutes eximbank has three main programs it uses to finance us exports direct loans export credit guarantees and export credit insurance prior to 1980 the banks direct lending program was its chief financing vehicle which it used to finance such capitalintensive exports as commercial aircraft and nuclear power plants both the budget authority requested by the administration and the limitation approved by the congress for the banks direct lending were sharply curtailed during the 1980s and 1990s eximbanks direct lending program is used primarily to aid us exporters in instances where they face foreign competitor that is receiving officially subsidized financing by foreign government these loans carry fixed interest rates and generally are made at terms that are the most attractive allowed under the provisions of international agreements they are made primarily to counter attempts by foreign governments to sway purchases in favor of their exporters solely on the basis of subsidized financing rather than on market conditions price quality etc and to enforce internationally agreed upon terms and conditions for export financing the bank also has an intermediary credit program it uses to offer medium and longterm fixedrate financing to buyers of us exports but us exporters also must face officially subsidized foreign competition to qualify for this program as part of its direct lending program the bank has tied aid war chest it uses to counter specific projects that are receiving foreign officially subsidized export financing tied aid credits and mixed credits are two of the primary methods whereby governments provide their exporters with official assistance to promote exports tied aid credits include loans and grants which reduce financing costs 1 for additional information see crs report 98568 exportimport bank background and legislative issues by james k jackson and the banks internet address httpwwweximgov crs2 below market rates for exporters and which are tied to the procurement of goods and services from the donor country mixed credits combine concessional government financing funds at below market rates or terms with commercial or near commercial funds to produce an overall rate that is lower than marketbased interest rates and carries more lenient loan terms the united states does tie substantial amounts of its agricultural and military aid to us goods but it generally has avoided using such financing to promote american capital goods exports guarantees and insurance are the main programs the bank uses to assist american exporters both programs reduce some of the risks involved in exporting by insuring against commercial or political uncertainty there is an important distinction however between the two programs insurance coverage carries with it various conditions that must be met by the insured before the bank will pay off claim guarantee is an ironclad commitment made to commercial bank by the exportimport bank that promises full repayment with few if any conditions attached in addition eximbank has working capital guarantee program that it uses to aid small and mediumsized businesses businesses that qualify have exporting potential but need working capital funds to produce or market their goods or services for export guarantees are offered to qualified lenders primarily commercial banks in order to facilitate loans to small businesses in fy2005 the bank authorized 1394 billion in loans and guarantees to support an estimated 1786 billion in us exports according to the bank this represents 3128 transactions of which 80 percent directly benefitted small business overview of hr 5068 and s 3938 the 109th congress considered hr 5068 and s 3938 both identified as the exportimport bank reauthorization act of 2006 hr 5068 was introduced in the house on march 30 2006 by representative pryce and sent to the house financial services committee which has jurisdiction in the house of representatives over the bank the measure was approved with four amendments by the committee on june 14 2006 and passed the full house unanimously without amendment on july 26 2006 on september 21 2006 the senate committee on banking housing and urban affairs which has jurisdiction over the bank marked up the house bill and sent the measure to the full senate on september 26 2006 s 3938 was adopted with amendments by the full senate on september 30 2006 eximbanks appropriations are continuing under pl 109289 hr 5631 as amended by pl 109369 and pl 109383 on december 6 2006 the house approved s 3938 in lieu of hr 5068 to reauthorize the banks authority through september 30 2011 the measure was signed by bush on december 20 2006 and was designated pl 109438 both measures extend the banks charter which expired on september 30 2006 to september 30 2011 and amend the banks charter in various areas in some cases these areas overlap while in other areas the two measures reflect different approaches to issues by members of the house and the senate in broad terms the two measures extend the banks authority to september 30 2011 the measures also direct the bank to organize small business division within the bank to increase the banks efforts to assisting small business owners in addition both crs3 measures require the bank to establish small business committee within the bank to coordinate efforts to assist small business both measures extend the authority of the banks advisory committee on africa to september 30 2011 to assist us firms exporting to subsaharan africa the measures also extend to september 30 2011 the banks authority to provide financing for the export of nonlethal defense articles and services that are meant primarily for civilian purposes both measures increase the transparency of the banks programs by requiring the bank to publish notices of any intent to undertake an economic impact analysis of project seeking loan or guarantee from the bank the bank is also required to seek comments on the proposed project from the department of commerce the international trade commission the office of management and budget and the senate committee on banking housing and urban affairs and the house committee on financial services the bank is also required to publish any subsequent changes to the proposed project in the federal register and provide for comment period beyond these areas of common approaches the two measures provide number of different areas in which they amend the banks charter for instance hr 5068 would have authorized an office within the bank to increase the total amount of loans and guarantees that go to support exports by socially and economically disadvantaged small business concerns and small business concerns owned by women hr 5068 also would have attempted to make the banks operations more transparent by keeping applicants better informed of the status of their application for loan or guarantee and it would require the bank to provide broad set of reports to congress on the banks operations hr 5068 would have required the bank to report to congress annually on its efforts to improve the competitiveness of its programs relative to the programs of other official export credit agencies hr 5068 would have directed the bank to study how it might assist new or impoverished democracies and provide greater assistance to exports involving renewable energy s 3938 directs the bank to submit list of commercial sectors and products that would suffer adverse economic impact due to eximbank support for certain projects abroad both measures amend the banks current procedures for operating the banks tied aid facility hr 5068 would have reduced somewhat the role of the secretary of the treasury in the operation of the tied aid program while s 3938 expands the secretarys role by providing formal procedure that allows the secretary to oppose decisions made by the banks board of directors to match an offer of tied aid by foreign entity hr 5068 would have broadened the current scope of the tied aid program by authorizing the bank to use the program to support new measures on tied aid enforce existing arrangements and to bring into the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd arrangement on guidelines for officially supported export credits2 those countries that currently are not party to the 2 the oecd arrangement on guidelines for officially supported export credits is voluntary agreement among australia canada the european community japan korea new zealand norway switzerland and the united states that provides framework for the continued crs4 arrangement the house measure would have reduced the burden on the bank for information about foreign offers of tied aid often it is difficult for the bank to meet the burden of proof that it has credible information about an offer by foreign entity of tied aid if the foreign government is not party to an agreement such as the oecd arrangement and therefore is under requirement to provide information concerning its offers of tied aid instead the bank would have been required to have simply credible evidence based on history of such offers in order to meet the burden of proof sidebyside comparison of hr 5068 and s 3938 the following section provides more detailed comparison of the two bills extension of authority both measures would extend the banks authority to september 30 2011 hr 5068 s 3938 exportimport bank reauthorization exportimport bank reauthorization act of 2006 act of

business3 congress has emphasized this support by directing that not less than one of the five members of the banks board of directors should be selected from among the small business community and represent the interests of small businesses4 furthermore congress has directed the bank to disseminate information about the 2 continued use of officially supported export credits the arrangement became effective in 1978 and places limitations on the terms and conditions of officially supported export credits and the provision of tied aid it includes procedures for prior notification

hr 5068 also would have provided guidance from the congress to the secretary of the treasury regarding negotiations on the oecd arrangement in particular the secretary would have been required to

the arrangement 2 identify within the world trade organization the extent to which countries that are not party to the wto agreement on subsidies and countervailing measures are not in compliance with the terms of the oecd arrangement and 3 implement new disciplines on the use of untied aid market windows and other forms of exports finance that seek to exploit loopholes in the arrangement hr 5068 also would have expanded the current set of tied aid principles which requires the bank to have credible information that an offer of tied aid exists before the bank can use its tied aid facility to match the offer instead the bank would have needed only credible evidence of tied aid offer to utilize its tied aid program this change would have eased the burden of proof on the bank in those cases in which the foreign entity is not party to the oecd arrangement and therefore not required to inform other countries of its offers of tied aid the measure also would have required the president of the united states to notify congress in those cases in which the president in consultation with the secretary of the treasury and the president of the bank declined to match foreign offer of tied aid because he had determined that such an offer would materially impede the broader purposes of the tied aid program s 3938 charts different approach to tied aid the measure directs the bank to process applications for tied aid according to principles and standards that are developed in cooperation with the secretary of the treasury in addition the measure provides for direct role for the secretary of the treasury in approvals of tied aid by the bank twenty days prior to the scheduled meeting of the banks board of directors to approve application for tied aid the bank is directed to brief the secretary of the treasury on the proposed application the secretary can request up to 14day postponement of the banks consideration of the proposed tied aid application crs38 s 3938 amends the current process for approving use of the tied aid facility by providing that on casebycase basis the secretary of the treasury can appeal decision by the banks board of directors to approve the use of the
