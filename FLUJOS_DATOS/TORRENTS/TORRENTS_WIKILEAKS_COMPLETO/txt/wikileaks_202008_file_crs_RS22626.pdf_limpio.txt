security by kenneth katzman background iraq is home to approximately 150 tribes that are composed of about 2000 smaller clans with varying sizes and influence the largest tribe numbers more than one million people the smallest few thousand1 seventyfive percent of the total iraqi population are members of tribe or have kinship to one2 scholars believe that despite the countrys many political divides including religion ethnicity and region one of the least understood is the countrys tribalism iraq s thousands of tribal groups to which various people pledge their loyalty ranging from extended family clans that may number just several hundred people to broad confederations of clans that claim the loyalty of million or more some experts argue that concern for family and clan factionalism and intense individualism that does not easily tolerate interference from central authority are among the legacies of tribalism in iraq3httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22626crs2 3 continued

constitute presentday iraq others predate mohammed the prophet of islam who lived in arabia in the sixth and seventh centuries and was himself member of the quraysh tribe irrespective of their shared religion of islam and general feelin g of arabness iraqi tribes did not have sense of common identity the livelihood of the tribes came from herding animals trade raiding and collecting tribute because of such diverse tribal structures and origins it is common to see some of the major tribes in iraq having related branches in syria jordan saudi arabia yemen ku wait and other gulf states as well as turkey religious divisions were not always clea rcut and often seemed to be fusion between the different groups some tribes such as jiburi and shammar have both sunni and shiite members tribal structure the most basic unit of iraqi tribal structure is called the khams or extended family khams consist of all male children who share the same greatgreat grandfather of all the levels of tribal organization the khams remains the most vita l once the khams structure is broken tribal society is longer in place in family unit before woman gets married she is member of her fathers trib if mans daughter marries outside the clan or tribe he longer has the benefit of her or her sons who could one day increase the clans strength this explains why marriages between first cousins in traditional tribal society are common other levels of the tribal organi zation consists of the following biet or house is similar to khams it can resemble single vast extended family with hundreds of members numbe r of houses form clan or fakhdh group of clans form an ashira or tribal orga nization for example in falluja the tribe named for the town ie the alfallujiyyin has 16 clans according to iraqi

tribes did not follow sophisticated religious code however because of weak ottoman rule throughout the country iraqs loose trib confederations prev ailed with each tribe acting as sort of mobile ministate furthermore in the absence of strong central authority the tribal framework fulfilled the primary functions of conflict and resource management some of the most important tribal confederations in iraq include the shammar dulaym jiburi albu na sir anizah zubayd and ubayd around the mid19th century the ottoman empire increased its control over iraqi tribes through settlement policies and land reform measures5 the result was an erosion of the sheiks traditional source of power nd disintegration of the traditional tribal system following world war i and the collapse of the ottoman empire the british decided to unite the three ottoman provin ces of baghdad mosul and basra into one nationstate called iraq name borrowed from the medieval history of the region despite the significant religious linguistic et hnic and tribal divisions running through iraqi society britain took over in 1918 and re stored power to the tribal sheiks thereby helping to preserve and reinforce iraqs tribal structure at the same time the british colonial state gradually appropriated former tribal functions like control of land water distribution and law enforcemen t nomadic tribes settled in village communities based on extended families or subclans these communities often retained their tribal names but they were linked to the agricultural mark et rather than to the subsistence economy tribes continued to lose power under the modernizing monarchy and later under the republican regime tribal role during the baath period initially when the baath party came to power in 1968 with saddam hussein as the second highest leader of the regime the party viewed the tribal role as outdated and even banned the use of tribal names6 the regime enacted and began to implement agrarian reform measures at the same time massive migration from rural areas to major cities further diminished the remaining tribal units and ties that however changed in the 1980s when saddams regime needed soldiers to fight iran the tribes were tapped to contribute manpower to fight ir an saddam also rewarded th villages of loyal tribesmen by providing roads electricity and water systems he delegated more power and autonomy to tribes after the gulf war in 1991whe n he lost control of large sections of the country he reached out to tribal leaders allocating specific sectors of the country for them to supervise in exchange for more aut onomy over tribal affairs for instance sheikh talal who was one of the st rongest tribal leaders and cl aims to have about 100000 armed men all over iraq was allotted 116kilometer 72mile section of highway in southern iraq to protect at night7httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22626crs4 8 bruno roeber former insurgents join the u s effort but questions linger about

authorities as the ottoman turks and the british who ruled iraq did in the past us authorities continue to seek the cooperation of the trib with varying degrees of success for instance in 2004 iraq persuaded the us au thorities to accept the appointment of sheik ghazi ajil alyawar nephew of the paramount chief of the extensive shammar tribe as the countrys interim president the in terim iraqi governin g council igc named yawar as the countrys first president of the postsaddam hussein era the special envoy ibrahim brahimi later confirmed his appointment awakening councils as the iraq war enters its sixth year the role of the iraqi awakening councils which consists largely of sunni groups financed by the united states to fight alqaeda and other militants in the country has b ecome vital for the stability of anbar province the awakening councils started in anbar province more than year ago in late 2006 but became stronger after the surge in spring 2007and now scores of gr oups have effectively taken responsibility for law nd order in their neighborhoods8 the province was formerly one of the most restive areas within the sunni triangle experts argue that the troop surge and new tactics of holding areas after insurgents were expelled brought measure of calm to parts of baghdad and other areas of iraq they also believe that one reason for the d ecline in attacks is that many former sunni fighters have turned against alqaeda and are helping us forces maintain security in reference to the creation of the awakening councils and alqaeda mishaps they assert in recent interview with anthony cordesman an analyst with the center for strategic and international studies csis that we capitalized on spontaneous tribal uprising against alqaeda that allowed us to create the sons of iraq force that now has some 90000 men about three times the size of our surge alqaeda helped us immeasurably i think we have to give credit to our enemy they did so much damage to themselves in alienating tribal groups and sunnis in driving former in surgents to work with us troops that oddly enough one of our strongest allies in making this work was our enemy9 tribal groups
