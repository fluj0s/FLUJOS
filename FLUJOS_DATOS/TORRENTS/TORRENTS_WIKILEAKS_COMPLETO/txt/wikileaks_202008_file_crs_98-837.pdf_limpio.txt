toward beijing and taipei dates back at least to the 1970s before the normalization of us relations with the prc and the cut off of official us relations with taiwan the debate results from the executive bra nchs tendency to give priority to relations with beijing over relations with taiwan and the congress tendency to be more receptive to taiwan concerns regardless of prc sensitivities from often intense prctaiwan competition for international especially us support and from ambiguity in us policy which appears at times to tilt in favor of prcbacked positions but concurrently also strongly supports taiwan as congress considers whether and how to further adjust us policy in th wake of pres ident clintons statement of the three it can consider sets f questions in key areas of

affirmation on june 30 1998 of the socalled three regarding us policy toward taiwan represents the latest round in long series of arguments often between the administration and critics in the congress over appropriate us policy in the uspeoples republic of chin prc taiwan relationship during roundtable discussion in shanghai following his summit meeting with chinese leaders in beijing president clinton said that we dont support independence for taiwan or two chinas or one taiwanone china and we dont believe that taiwan should be member in any organization for which statehood is requirement1 this marked the first time us president had publicly affirmed the three though clinton administration offic ials have been saying them publicly and in private conversat ions with chinese leaders publicized by chinese media since at least 1996 earlier us statements including some made privately by senior administratio n officials to chinese counterparts going back as far as 1971 provide basis for th current three according to clinton administration officials in particular the administration maintains that the three are consistent with the one chin affirmations contained in the co mmuniques of 1972 1979 and 1982 that provide the framework for usprc relations those communiq ues reflect agreements between2 the us nd prc in which the us broke off us official ties with taiwan acknowledged

are consistent with us interests arguing notably that taiwan declaration of independence at this time would likely provoke prc military attack that in their view is not in the interests of the united states 3 critics in congress the media and elsewhere assert that the administratio n appears to be buckling in the face of prc pressure sacrificing taiwan interests and us interests in relations with taiwan for the sake of assuring smoother us relationship with beijing in particular the critics underline taiwan governmen t claims that the three appear to g beyond us commitments in the three us prc communiques in order to restrict taiwan government efforts to seek greater role in world affairs as government separate from the prc some charge tha t repeating the three aligns us policy closer to the one country two systems formula beijing has used to govern its takeover of hong kong and its propose d takeover of taiwan others are suspicious that the president made this statement as gesture to the chinese leadership to insure that his nine day trip to china wa s without acrimony and that the united states gained little in return in concrete terms for the statement some also are sympa thetic

strait from july 1995 to march 1996 after several months of prc military demonstrations in the strait the clinton administration with stron g congressional support deployed two aircraft carrier battle groups to the area the potentially dangerous face off of us and prc forces ended quietly but was widely seen to have added incentive to ongoing private clinton administration efforts t reassure chinese leaders of us intentions while building an administration polic of us constructive engagement with chi na statements by clinton administration officials affirming the three regarding us policy

for executivelegislative friction over us policy toward taiwan differing administrationcongr essional priorities the current controversy between congressional critics and the administration over the three mirror s past episodes of legislativeexecutive friction over policy toward taiwan as in the past the administrations priority appears currently focused on managing the us relationsh ip with taiwan in ways that would not unduly complicate or upset th important u s relationship with the prc on the mainland from the perspective of congressional critics this approach at times including the present has prompted the administration to go too far in accommodating the prc by cutting back restricting or otherwise defining us interaction with ta iwan in ways favored by beijing more receptive to the entreaties of taiwan representatives and their supporters in th united states and sensitive to t he many tangible us benefits derived from relations with taiwan congress has repeatedly taken steps at many junctures over the pas t decades to adjust u s policies in ways more supportive of taiwan interests and less favorable to beijing 8 many observers believe and scholars report that from the administration s perspective congress can afford to lean in this direction which complicates an d sometimes dangers the relationship with beijing because it does not bear primary responsibility for managing us foreign policy at times administration official s9 see congressional actions in support of taiwan as illadvised in turn man congressional observers for the ir part sometimes see administration officers as being so anxious to preserve smooth relationship with beijing that they are prepared to make unwarranted sacrifices of us interests in relations with taiwan prctaiwan rivalry an underly ing fact that defines the frequent legislative executive debate over us policy toward taiwan is the ongoing rivalry betwee n beijing and taipei although the rivalry waxes and wanes

agree that by far the most important arena for their competition for international support is washington dc for taiwan us support in arms sales statements of strategic concern political backing and

with taiwan on the one hand us governments in the process f establishing and improving relations with beijing have issued three comm uniques and other statements most recently the three that often appear supportive of the prc position on the taiwan issue the communiques reflect agreements between the two countries in which the u s broke off official ties with taiwan acknowledged the position that there is but one china and taiwan i s part of china recognized the prc as the government of china and agreed to limit us arms sale s to taiwan provided beijing pursues peaceful approach toward the island administration public statemen ts in recent years explicitly rule out us support for an independent taiwan or taiwans membership in the or other suc h international organiz ations where

they strongly supported the concept of one ch ina argued that their governmentthe republic of china based in taipeiwas the sole legitimate government of china strongly opposed taiwan independence and rgely eschewed taiwans participation in international organizations where beijing was member since democracy took hold in taiwan in the late 1980s the administration of lee tenghui has responded to popular pressure in taiwan by softpedaling past commitments to reunify on china it has asserted taiwans international legitimacy as one of two legitimat governments in china and sought greater international recognition throug h membership in i nternational organizations and highlevel contacts with governments that already have relations with beijing 10 against this background us leaders have repeatedly taken positions and policy actions designed to shore up important u s relationships with taiwan the taiwan11 relations act is repl ete with expressions of us concern with taiwans security and determination to continue to provide arms to the island government the reaga n administration endeavored to balance i ts signing of the 1982 communique restricting us arms to taiwan with
