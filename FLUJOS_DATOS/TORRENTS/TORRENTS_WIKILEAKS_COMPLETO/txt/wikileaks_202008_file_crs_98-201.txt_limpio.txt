agreement on the fy1999 omnibus appropriations bill pl 105 277hr 4328 was signed into law on october 21 1998 the measure contains 559 billion in regular fy1999 appropriations for the us department of agriculture and related agencies and 59 billion in emergency disaster and economic assistance for agriculture for total of 618 billion the house and senate earlier had approved separate conference agreement for fy1999 usda appropriations hr 4101 but the president vetoed the measure because its emergency provisions did not authorize an increase in the loan rates or farm price guarantees for growers of certain crops republican leadership strongly opposed any increases in the loan rates but instead agreed to increase the total level of direct farm assistance from the 42 billion provided in the vetoed version of hr 4101 to 59 billion in pl 105277 budget emergency was declared for this amount which by definition requires budgetary offsets for the new spending the 59 billion in emergency funding includes 3057 billion in market loss payments of which 2857 billion is for grain and cotton farmers and 200 million for dairy farmers 15 billion for 1998 crop loss payments 875 million for farmers affected by multiple years of disasters 200 million in livestock feed assistance and 31 million to cover the cost of making or guaranteeing 440 million in additional farm operating loans the 559 billion in regular usda and related agencies appropriations for fy1999 in pl 105277 is about equal to the housepassed level hr 4101 12 billion below the senatepassed level s 2159 and 21 billion below the administration request of this amount 4225 billion is for mandatory programs and 1369 billion for discretionary spending even excluding the additional emergency aid spending total budget authority is significantly higher than the 495 billion appropriated in fy1998 mainly because of change in the formula for determining how much is required to reimburse the commodity credit corporation ccc for its net realized losses in order to stay within the discretionary spending allocation for the bill pl 105277 either limits or eliminates fy1999 funding for several mandatory programs it prohibits the spending of any of the 60 million authorized for fy1999 for the fund for rural america and reduces spending for commodities in the emergency food assistance program efap by 10 million the law also concurs with house provision to prohibit the fy1999 spending 120 million for new mandatory agricultural research program restrict the amount of acreage that can be enrolled in the

for fy1999 us department of agriculture and related agencies most recent developments the omnibus consolidated and emergency supplemental appropriations act 1999 pl 105277 hr 4328 was signed into law on october 21 1998 contained within the measure was 559 billion in regular fy1999 appropriations for the us department of agriculture usda and related agencies and an additional 59 billion in emergency supplemental spending for farm economic and disaster assistance usda appropriations were folded into the omnibus bill after the president vetoed the conference agreement hr 4101 on fy1999 funding for usda and related agencies on october 7 because the emergency spending provisions in the bill did not include an increase in loan rates price guarantees for farmers pl 105277 does not provide for an increase in loan rates but the 59 in emergency assistance provided is 17 billion above the amount provided in the vetoed bill usda spending at glance the us department of agriculture usda carries out its widely varied responsibilities through approximately 30 separate internal agencies staffed by some 100000 employees usda is responsible for many activities outside of the agriculture budget function hence spending for usda is not synonymous with spending for farmers usda net outlays after adjustment for offsetting receipts for the most recently completed fiscal year fy1997 were 525 billion by far the largest outlay within the department 359 billion 67 of total outlays in fy1997 was for its food and nutrition programs primarily the food stamp program the costliest of all usda programs various child nutrition programs and the women infants and children wic program total fy1997 outlays also included 89 billion 17 for farm and foreign agricultural services within this mission area of usda are the programs funded through the commodity credit corporation eg commodity support payments the conservation reserve program and certain trade programs crop insurance farm loans and foreign food aid programs another 42 billion 8 was spent on an array of natural resource and environment programs nearly threefourths of which funds the forest service which is funded through the interior appropriations bill not the agriculture appropriations bill and the balance for number of conservation programs for farm producers usda programs for research and education 18 billion in outlays for fy1997 rural development 135 billion marketing and regulatory activities 708 million crs2 meat and poultry inspection 574 million and departmental activities 309 million accounted for the balance of usda spending mandatory vs discretionary spending approximately threefourths of total usda spending is classified as mandatory which by definition occurs outside the control of annual appropriations eligibility for mandatory programs is usually written into authorizing law and any individual or entity that meets the eligibility requirements is entitled to the benefits authorized by the law currently accounting for the vast majority of usda mandatory spending are the food stamp program and child nutrition programs the farm commodity price and income support programs the federal crop insurance program and the conservation reserve program crp table 1 us department of agriculture and related agencies appropriations fy1993 to fy1999 budget authority in

authority note includes funding for the food and drug administration and commodity futures trading commission excludes usda forest service emergency supplemental spending of 589 billion is not included in the fy1999 total sources congressional budget office and house appropriations committee although they have mandatory status the food and nutrition programs are funded by an annual appropriation based on projected spending needs supplemental appropriations generally are made if and when these estimates fall short of required spending an annual appropriation is also made to reimburse the commodity credit corporation for losses it incurs in financing the commodity support programs and the various other programs it finances historically the farm commodity support programs were larger portion of the usda budget than they are currently spending levels among these programs were erratic and unpredictable making total usda spending highly variable some of this unpredictability was lessened by the enactment of the 1996 farm bill which fixes the level of spending on direct payments to program crop producers and longer ties these payments to market conditions the other 25 of the usda budget is for discretionary programs which are determined by funding in annual appropriations acts among the major discretionary programs within usda that are funded by the annual agriculture appropriations act are its rural development programs research and education programs agricultural crs3 credit the supplemental nutrition program for women infants and children wic the public law pl 480 international food aid program meat and poultry inspection and food marketing and regulatory programs fy1998 funding levels for all usda discretionary programs except for the forest service were provided by the fy1998 agriculture rural development food and drug administration and related agencies appropriations act pl 10586 and by the fy1998 supplemental appropriations act

4101 was vetoed by the president on october 7 1998 fy1999 appropriations for usda and related agencies were ultimately included in the omnibus consolidated and emergency appropriations act 1999 pl 105277 hr 4328 which was approved by the house on 102098 by 33395 vote by the senate on 102198 by vote of 6529 and signed into law on october 21 1998 fy1999 agriculture appropriations action the conference agreement on the fy1999 omnibus appropriations bill pl 105 277hr 4328 was signed into law on october 21 1998 the measure contains 559 billion in regular fy1999 appropriations for usda and related agencies and 59 billion in emergency funding to help farmers recover from natural disasters and low crop prices the house and senate earlier had approved separate conference agreement for fy1999 usda appropriations hr 4101 on october 2 and october 6 1998 respectively however the president vetoed the measure on october 7 because the emergency spending provisions in the bill did not include senate democratic leadershipsupported increase in loan rates price guarantees for farmers the vetoed crs4 measure included 559 billion in new budget authority and 42 billion in emergency assistance republican leadership opposed any increase in loan rates but instead agreed to an increase in the amount of emergency farm assistance provided from 42 billion in the vetoed bill hr 4101 to 59 billion in pl 105277 budget emergency was declared for this amount which by definition requires budgetary offsets for the new spending see emergency supplemental farm assistance below for details the 559 billion in regular nonemergency fy1999 appropriations for usda and related agencies in pl 105277 is about equal to the housepassed level of hr 4101 13 billion below the senatepassed level s 2159 and nearly 3 billion below the administration request of this amount 4225 billion is for mandatory programs and 1369 billion for discretionary spending with only few exceptions the 559 billion provided to usda and related agencies in pl 105277 is nearly identical to amounts provided in the vetoed conference agreement on hr 4101 the major differences are that pl 105277 provides 233 million more for the presidents food safety initiative spread out among fda and several usda agencies and 15 million more for rural empowerment zones and enterprise communities programs within usdas rural development programs total nonemergency budget authority in pl 105277 for usda and related agencies is significantly higher than the 4955 billion appropriated in fy1998 which is mainly attributable to change in the formula for determining how much is required to reimburse the commodity credit corporation for its net realized losses see farm commodity programs below for details significant portion of the 11 billion difference between the total amounts provided in hr 4101 and s 2159 is in the amount provided for food stamps the house based its projections on more recent economic forecasts that show lower average participation and benefits than previously were projected the following is review of the major usda and related agencies provisions of pl 105277 the house and senatepassed bills hr 4101 and s 2159 and the administration request for fy1999 funding see table 3 at the end of this report for programbyprogram comparison of pl 105277 with the house and senate bills the fy1999 request and actual fy1998 appropriations emergency supplemental farm disaster and economic assistance several regions of the country have been experiencing low farm commodity prices primarily for wheat corn soybeans and cotton andor natural disasters this year particularly in the northern plains and the south this has had the effect of significantly reducing farm income pl 105277 provides 5893 billion in supplemental assistance primarily to mitigate the effects of low crop prices and natural disasters conferees included language which declares budget emergency for this expenditure which by definition means that budgetary offsets will be required for this new spending crs5 the amount provided for farm assistance in pl 105277 is similar to proposal announced by house republican leadership on september 17 except that it contains an additional 17 billion more than what was originally proposed included in the final total of 59 billion in emergency farm assistance provided by pl 105277 are 3057 billion in market loss payments to compensate grain cotton and dairy farmers for loss of 1998 income caused by regional economic dislocation unilateral trade sanctions and the failure of the government to pursue trade opportunities aggressively of this amount 2857 billion are for grain and cotton farmers who were eligible for 1998 production flexibility contract payment and 200 million is reserved for dairy farmers among contract holders the 2857 billion is expected to be distributed in approximately the following proportions corn contract holders 13 billion wheat 750 million upland cotton 332 million rice 242 million and other feed grains 212 million these additional payments are about 50 higher than the 56 billion in contract payments farmers are scheduled to receive in fy1999 the secretary of agriculture will have to determine how the 200 million in dairy payments will be distributed among dairy producers since milk is not contract commodity 15 billion in disaster payments to farmers who have incurred significant losses to any crop in 1998 due to natural disasters an additional 875 million in direct disaster payments to producers who have experienced multiple years of natural disasters and crop diseases particularly those in the northern plains and upper midwest 200 million in costshare assistance for livestock growers who lost to natural disaster significant amount of feed grown on the farm disaster payments will be made to producer regardless of whether the farmer had an active crop insurance policy however if farmer waived crop insurance coverage in 1998 he would be required to obtain crop insurance in the next two crop years as condition for receiving disaster payment because the federal government pays the entire premium for the farmer for the basic level of crop insurance coverage this mandatory requirement to obtain insurance is estimated to cost the government an additional 66 million which is factored into the 59 billion supplemental appropriation conditions of eligibility for the disaster payments were left to the discretion of the secretary of agriculture other emergency farm assistance provisions in pl 105277 include 50 million in disaster assistance to help western alaska fishermen recover from poor salmon returns 40 million in additional salaries and expenses for the farm service agency fsa the usda agency that administers farm commodity disaster and loan programs and 31 million in budget authority to support 540 million in additional direct and guaranteed fsa farm operating loans and 3 million in dairy disaster assistance provision not included in the conference agreement but strongly supported by the administration and senate democratic leadership during the debate was crs6 temporary increase in the loan rate price guarantees for certain farm commodities one attempt to raise the loan rates for grains and cotton was defeated during senate floor action on s 2159 another attempt was defeated when the senate tabled similar amendment to the interior appropriations bill s 2237 the president vetoed the conference agreement on fy1999 agriculture appropriations because its emergency provisions did not include an increase in the loan rates senate democrats supported an increase saying it was needed to adequately address farm financial problems republican leadership opposed proposed oneyear increase in loan rates because of its estimated cost 5 billion and because it believed that it would fundamentally undermine the policy changes made by the omnibus 1996 farm law for more details on the implementation of the emergency provisions see crs report 98952 the emergency agricultural provisions in the fy1999 omnibus appropriations act farm commodity programs outlays for the farm commodity programs and certain farm export programs and conservation programs are funded through usdas commodity credit corporation ccc the ccc is revolving financing mechanism within usda through which it supports more than dozen specified commodities including grains cotton milk sugar peanuts and tobacco the formulas that determine payments under these programs are made by longterm farm legislation and benefits have to be provided to any participating producer in past years outlays of the ccc have been highly variable and tended to fluctuate based on crop market conditions the federal agriculture improvement and reform act of 1996 pl 104127 the 1996 farm bill replaced the program of making direct payments to participating producers when market prices fall below target level with predetermined and declining market transition payments to eligible producers over 7year period consequently ccc outlays have been more predictable since 1996 than they were in previous years the administration estimated earlier this year that total ccc outlays for fy1999 would be 90 billion for all cccfunded programs of which 55 billion would be for direct market transition payments to farmers1 all estimates exclude the 56 billion in emergency fy1999 ccc spending provided by pl 105277 the 90 billion estimate is down from an estimated 93 billion in fy1998 outlays of which 58 billion was in market transition payments because these programs are funded through the ccc they do not require annual appropriations instead the ccc borrows funds from the treasury to fund its operations however because ccc outstanding borrowing cannot exceed 30 billion the annual appropriations bill 1 in addition to the farm commodity programs the ccc also serves as funding mechanism for several usda export subsidy programs including the export enhancement program export credit guarantees and the market assistance program and for an array of conservation programs including the conservation reserve program the wetlands reserve program and the environmental qualities incentive program see agricultural trade and food aid and conservation below for more details on these programs crs7 usually contains funding for reimbursement of ccc net realized losses so that the ccc can repay its debt to the treasury and not exhaust its borrowing authority this reimbursement is also categorized as mandatory expense and is not included toward the discretionary spending allocation given to the appropriations subcommittees the 8439 billion requested by the administration and provided as regular nonemergency appropriation in pl 105277 for the fy1999 reimbursement to the ccc is up significantly 77 billion from the 7835 million that was appropriated in fy1998 much of the difference can be explained by change in methodology used by usda for determining how much to request for net realized losses rather than change in farm policy in brief the methodology used before last year based the reimbursement request on an estimate of losses in the previous fiscal year while the new methodology bases the request on actual losses from the second previous fiscal year the 7835 million requested in fy1998 was unusually low because it was transition year for switching to the new methodology although the farm commodity programs do not require an annual appropriation per opponents of these programs have in the past offered floor amendments to agriculture appropriations bills in an attempt to effect changes in farm commodity policy separate amendments which would have affected the peanut and sugar price support programs and crop insurance for tobacco farmers were offered and defeated on the house floor when hr 4101 was debated in june an adopted senate amendment to s 2159 would have required tobacco growers to be assessed for the cost of usda to administer its tobacco price support programs and related activities but was deleted in conference civil rights provisions pl 105277 contains provisions somewhat similar to what was in the housepassed appropriations bill hr 4101 with respect to waiving the statute of limitations for certain allegations of discrimination against usda the department has been under close scrutiny in recent years for its treatment of minorities for both its personnel actions and in its administration of its farmer programs pl 105277 waives the statute of limitations on civil rights cases for eligible complaints made during the period january 1 1981 through december 31 1996 eligible complaints included in the conference agreement are those pertaining to cases involving potential discrimination within usdas farm commodity farm credit rural housing loan and disaster assistance programs only conferees on pl 105277 modified the civil rights provision in the vetoed bill hr 4101 to include housing loan programs and to extend the statute of limitation back to 1981 instead of 1983 as in the vetoed bill pl 105277 also requires the secretary of agriculture to conduct an investigation issue written determination and propose resolution within 180 days milk marketing order reform pl 105277 contains houseadopted provision that requires usda to issue its final rule for federal milk marketing order reform between february 1 and april 4 1999 and extend the deadline for implementation from april 4 1999 to october 1 1999 comparable provision was in the senatepassed bill federal milk marketing orders regulate the farm price of milk in much of the country usda is in the process of consolidating the number of marketing orders as required by the 1996 farm bill and reforming dairy pricing crs8 policy which has been the center of controversy among dairy production regions processors and consumers the conference provision to extend the deadline is supported by northeast and southeast dairy producer groups who support the current milk pricing system and are concerned that usda might implement reforms that reduce minimum farm milk prices while congress is in recess later this year opponents of the provision mainly upper midwest milk producers contend that the provision applies pressure on usda to recommend the status quo or else be faced with legislative action against decision in favor of any reforms that would reduce minimum milk prices the requirement that usda release its final rule between february 1 and april 4 1999 ensures that the rule will be released at time when congress is in session and can react to the ruling an obey amendment to hr 4101 would have removed this provision from the bill but was defeated on the house floor on june 23 by voice vote the extension of the implementation deadline to october 1 1999 effectively extends the life of the northeast dairy compact to october 1 as well the northeast compact establishes higher minimum price for the farm price of beverage milk in new england and under current law expires at the same time as implementation of order reform proposed petri amendment to hr 4101 would have kept the sunset date for the northeast dairy compact at april 4 1999 but the amendment was not allowed to be considered on the house floor the chairman of the rules committee raised point of order against the amendment on the floor stating that it was in violation of the rule h res 482 which prohibited the consideration of any amendments to hr 4101 that change existing law for more on federal dairy policy reform see crs issue brief 97011 dairy policy issues crop insurance the federal crop insurance program is administered by usdas risk management agency rma it offers basically free catastrophic insurance to producers who grow an insurable crop any producer who opts for this coverage has the opportunity to purchase additional insurance coverage at subsidized rate most policies are sold and completely serviced through approved private insurance companies that are reinsured by usda there are basically four sources of federal expenditures for the crop insurance program usda absorbs large percentage of the program losses compensates the reinsured companies for portion of their delivery expenses subsidizes the premium paid by participating producers and pays the salaries and expenses of its administering agency within usda the program losses and premium subsidy are mandatory expenditures funded through usdas federal crop insurance fund the salaries and expenses of the rma agency are discretionary expense subject to annual appropriations the funding source for the federal reimbursement to the private insurance companies has been the subject of controversy in recent years and was recently addressed by legislation pl 105185 s 1150 the agriculture research bill prior crs9 to enactment of pl 105185 onehalf of the reimbursement was funded as mandatory account and the other half was funded through discretionary funds beginning in fy1999 pl 105185 authorizes all of the reimbursement to be funded through the crop insurance fund as mandatory account thus precluding the need for specific annual appropriation crop insurance supporters had feared that if the expense had remained discretionary it would become target for cuts which they say would lessen private sector participation in the program since pl 105185 created new mandatory spending of 1 billion over 5 years for this reimbursement comparable offset had to be made as required by budget law to partially offset the cost of this new mandatory expenditure pl 105185 made statutory changes to the federal crop insurance program which achieve 530 million in savings over 5 years this includes increasing the fee charged farmers for catastrophic coverage 205 million in 5year savings and reducing the reimbursement rate to the private insurance companies from 27 of collected premiums to 245 188 million in savings the balance of 485 million comes out of administrative cost savings in the food stamp program provision in the fy1999 omnibus appropriations act pl 105277 overturns the increase in the fee charged farmers for catastrophic coverage so that farmers will pay more than 50 per crop per county for catastrophic coverage instead of 10 of the governmentpaid premium for coverage as is customary the administration requests such sums as may be necessary for the federal crop insurance fund which it estimates to be 1504 billion for fy1999 this estimate excludes any emergency supplemental benefits provided the emergency package described in the above section pl 105277 concurs with this estimate the administration also requested 66 million for the salaries and expenses of the rma for fy1999 pl 105277 freezes this account at the fy1998 level of 64 million for more on the mechanics of the crop insurance program see crs report 97 572 managing farm risk in new policy era agricultural credit usda serves as lender of last resort for family farmers unable to obtain credit from commercial lender through its farm service agency fsa usda provides direct farm loans and also guarantees qualified loans from commercial lenders which are used to finance the purchase of farm real estate help producers meet their operating expenses and financially recover from natural disasters under budget rules adopted in 1990 federal agencies are required to estimate the cost of making direct or guaranteed loan and record that cost as budget outlay for the loan the cost of making loan is directly related to any interest rate subsidy provided by the government as well as projection of anticipated loan losses caused by farmer nonrepayment of the loans the administration requested an appropriation of 1057 million to fund nearly 30 billion in total farm loans for fy1999 hr 4101 as passed by the house in june recommended somewhat smaller appropriation 914 million in loan subsidy crs10 to support 2299 billion total loans than s 2159 965 million in subsidy to support 2365 billion in loans the final amount provided in pl 105277 contains two part appropriation for farm loans regular fy1999 appropriation of 897 million to support 2285 billion in direct and guaranteed loans and an emergency supplemental appropriation of 314 million to provide 440 million in additional direct and guaranteed operating loans the supplemental appropriation was made to remedy the backlog of applications for operating loans which occurred because of shortage of fy1998 funds pl 105277 also adopted many of the credit provisions in the senate bill which modify farmer eligibility for future fsa farm loans when the farmer has been forgiven outstanding debt under current law farmer borrower cannot receive subsequent direct or guaranteed fsa farm loan if the borrower has been forgiven debt on delinquent loan one adopted provision would allow borrower to have up to three debt forgivenesses and still remain eligible for new guaranteed loan as long as the debt was forgiven before april 4 1996 borrower with up to one debt forgiveness that occurred before april 4 1996 would also remain eligible for an emergency disaster loan separate provision requires the secretary to use his discretion in determining whether producer is eligible for an emergency disaster loan and not to automatically disqualify the applicant if he lacks certain amount of collateral separate farm credit provision in pl 105277 changes the individual loan limits for fsa farm loans current law limits borrower to total outstanding indebtedness of more than 300000 for farm ownership loans and 400000 for farm operating loans to combined limit of 700000 per borrower the level of the loan limit will be allowed to rise by the annual change in the consumer price index beginning in fy2000 another provision reduces the statutory cashflow requirement on restructured delinquent farm loan from 110 of the amount needed by the borrower to meet expenses to 100 of that amount agricultural trade and food aid programs the omnibus fy1999 appropriations act pl 105277 provides program level of 58 billion which entails an appropriation of 12 billion for usdas international activities those activities include export credit guarantees export subsidies and market promotion programs and foreign food aid the final appropriation for agricultural export and food aid programs is very near the administrations budget request which called for program level of 57 billion for usdas agricultural trade and food aid programs the difference between program level and outlays is attributable to the large part played by export credit guarantees 46 billion proposed for fy1999 in the departments international activities for such credit programs only costs represented by administrative expenses and loan subsidies not the value of the guarantees require an appropriation the fy1999 appropriation is 11 billion lower than the fy1998 level proposed reductions in the value of ccc export credit guarantees and concessional food aid account for most of the decline in fy1999 requested program level and outlays pl 105277 also amend the arms export control act to allow pakistan to regain access to usdas agricultural export credit guarantees crs11 ccc export credit guarantees ccc export credit guarantees guarantee the repayment of commercial loans to finance the sale of us agricultural exports to developing and middleincome countries that would otherwise have difficulty securing credit the administrations budget request for fy1999 differs from previous budgets in that the estimate for ccc export credit guarantees 46 billion is intended to reflect the actual level of sales expected to be registered under the programs rather than the level authorized in the 1996 farm bill 55 billion pl 105277 reflects the administrations estimate for several years actual program levels under ccc export credit guarantees have been less than the authorized amounts for example for fy1997 the administration requested 55 billion for these programs but actual guarantees were 2876 billion guarantees were 44 billion in fy1998 the actual level of guarantees in fy1999 could differ from the budget request and will depend on the demand for guarantees market conditions and usda decisions about using the programs of the 46 billion proposed 43 billion will be allocated to the gsm102 program which provides shortterm commercial export credit guarantees up to 3 year repayment terms 100 million will be allocated to the gsm103 program which provides guarantees for intermediateterm credit 3 to 10 year repayment terms two other guarantee programs the supplier credit guarantee and the facilities financing guarantee receive 150 million and 50 million respectively in fy1999 under the supplier credit guarantee ccc guarantees payments due on financing extended directly by exporters to importers due in up to 180 days for the purchase of us agricultural products under the facilities financing guarantee ccc guarantees the financing of manufactured goods and services exported from the united states to improve or establish agricultural related facilities such as port improvements in emerging markets agricultural trade sanctions farm state members voiced concerns in june 1998 that the imposition of sanctions on pakistan and india following their nuclear weapons tests would result in lost agricultural sales particularly of wheat to pakistan this led to efforts to include amendments in the fy1999 agriculture appropriations measures reported out by both the house and senate appropriations committees to allow pakistan to regain access to usdas agricultural export credit guarantees pakistan the third largest market for us wheat has used this program extensively since the early 1990s to facilitate its sizable purchases of us wheat when pakistan announced that it would be purchasing large quantity of wheat on july 15 1998 congress approved and the president signed separate legislation pl 105194 s 2282 to exempt usda credits guarantees and financial assistance from the nonproliferation sanctions mandated under the arms control act this action helped facilitate the sale of over 600000 metric tons of white wheat to pakistan during the remainder of 1998 for more information see crs report 98770 us agricultural exports and the nuclear nonproliferation sanctions on india and pakistan growing recognition of the adverse impact that us trade sanctions have on us agricultural exports prompted considerable debate on this issue during floor consideration of the senate version of fy1999 agriculture appropriations s 2159 however conferees dropped language adopted during senate floor debate offered by dodd and amended by torricelli that would have exempted the sale of food crs12 fertilizer medicine and medical equipment from current and future us unilateral sanctions except for those imposed on countries that support terrorism or use food and medicine for coercion or punishment country of origin labeling for agricultural products pl 105277 does not contain separate senateadopted amendments to require country of origin labeling on fresh cuts of imported meats and for imported produce instead it requires further studies on these issues imported meat labeling issues by the secretary of agriculture and imported produce labeling by the general accounting office market access program the fy1999 agricultural appropriations act places funding limitations on the market access program the fy1999 budget estimate of 90 million is unchanged from fy1998 and is the maximum authorized under the 1996 farm bill map supports on costsharing basis foreign market development and promotion efforts of nonprofit agricultural trade organizations state and regional trade groups and private companies the 1996 farm bill prohibits providing direct assistance to foreign firms for the promotion of foreignproduced products and to any firm that is not recognized as small business under the small business act popular in the agricultural community the program is often targeted for elimination as corporate welfare by opponents in congress some consumer organizations and fiscally conservative groups map is mandatory program funded through the commodity credit corporation ccc and does not require annual appropriations amendments to eliminate map spending in fy1999 were defeated in both chambers pl 105277 does call for the secretary to carry out study of the economic costs and benefits of the map program export subsidies pl 105277 does not provide for any changes in the eep program and places limits on the fair act authorized levels for eep that means that the full amount authorized for eep for fy1999 550 million will be available the fy1999 estimated program level is 170 million above the fy1998 level which was capped at 150 in the fy1998 agricultural appropriations act like map usdas export subsidy programs are funded through the ccc and are not subject to direct annual appropriations two programsthe export enhancement program eep and the dairy export incentive program deipoffer bonuses to exporters of us agricultural commodities to make them price competitive in markets that are also targets of competitors countries subsidies only 5 million in eep bonuses were awarded in fy1996 and none were awarded in fy1997 in fy1998 the availability of eep bonuses for 20000 tons of poultry meat and 30000 tons of barley were announced action was taken on the presidents proposal to set eep spending at 12 billion over fy1999 through fy2003 with an allocation of up to 320 million as first installment of flexible multiyear program authorization for eep under the administration proposal any funding not used in one fiscal year would remain available for use in subsequent year but annual program levels would remain subject to export subsidy reduction commitments made in the uruguay round agreement on agriculture savings from the proposed multiyear eep program were estimated at approximately 14 billion the difference between the proposed program levels and crs13 the amounts authorized in the 1996 farm bill authorizing this multiyear program would have required new authorizing legislation for deip the presidents budget anticipated lower level of program activity in fy1999 because of tighter domestic market for dairy products the 82 million proposed is 17 million less than the estimated 99 million for fy1998 actual levels of deip will be determined by market conditions subject to reduction commitments in the uruguay round agricultural agreement public law 480 or food for peace the fy1999 appropriations act essentially maintains spending for pl 480 at the level of last years appropriation approximately 11 billion pl 480 is the us governments primary means of providing food assistance to foreign countries title i of pl 480 funds longterm concessional sales of us agricultural products primarily to develop markets in low income countries title ii is program of humanitarian food donations for both emergencies and nonemergency feeding programs title iii provides grant food aid for development projects in lowincome developing countries usda administers title i the agency for international development aid administers titles ii and iii for fy1999 the administration proposed total budget authority of 967 million for pl 480 estimated to provide 28 million metric tons of commodities the fy1998 appropriation was 1063 billion which will provide 32 million metric tons of commodity assistance the new budget request thus represents reduction of 96 million in budget authority and 700000 metric tons of commodities all of it coming from title i agricultural appropriators rejected efforts by the administration in fy1997 and fy1998 to cut title i spending similarly previous administration efforts to reduce or eliminate title iii were rebuffed commodity groups whose products figure prominently in the title i program wheat wheat flour vegetable oil rice among others have opposed any reductions in title i supporters in congress of using food for development assistance oppose reducing further or eliminating title iii food for progress ffp provides commodities to governments private voluntary organizations cooperatives or intergovernmental organizations for use in developing countries and emerging democracies committed to free enterprise in their agricultural economies ffp can use title i funds to procure commodities and pay transport costs it can use commodities if any in ccc inventories under section 416b of the agricultural act of 1949 or it can use ccc funds to procure and ship commodities when section 416b commodities are unavailable annual programming is limited to not more than 500000 metric tons and not more that 30 million for noncommodity costs of the program the administration budget assumes that 109 million of ccc funds will be used to support ffp in fy199979 million for the purchase of commodities by ccc and 30 million for transportation and other noncommodity costs pl 105277 provides an emergency appropriation to allow an additional 25 million in spending for ffp foreign agricultural service fas administers the agricultural export and food aid programs it is also responsible for other market development and export promotion efforts formulating agricultural trade policy conducting agricultural trade negotiations gathering foreign market information and carrying out programs of crs14 international cooperation the fy1999 budget requested 141 million in appropriated funds for fas but pl 105277 provides for an appropriation of 1362 million which includes funds 44 million for international cooperative administrative support to cover costs of fas overseas operations included in fass appropriated funding is around 60 million for market development which includes funding to support the foreign market development or cooperator program fmdp for more information on agricultural trade and food aid programs see crs issue brief 98006 agricultural export and food aid programs conservation pl 105277 provides 7931 million for conservation programs in fy1999 slightly more than the fy1998 appropriation of 7865 million conservation programs are administered by both usdas natural resources conservation service nrcs and its farm service agency fsa however all of the appropriated funds go to the nrcs the administration had requested 8263 million an increase of 40 million from the preceding year the senatepassed appropriation bill s 2159 would have provided 792 million while the housepassed bill hr 4101 would have provided 7844 million the balance of funding for conservation programs was made mandatory in the 1996 farm act and is funded through the commodity credit corporation ccc pl 105277 allows just under 2 billion in funding for those programs in fy1999 savings of more than 100 million from the administration proposal and more than 300 million from fy1998 natural resources conservation service within nrcs the core conservation program and the primary source of technical assistance to producers and landowners is conservation operations co pl 105277 provides 641 million for co 99 million less than the administration request of 742 million this request included transfer of 50 million from the watershed and flood prevention operations program the portion that pays for the technical assistance under this program into the co account other major requested increases included 23 million for activities associated with the clean water and watershed restoration initiative and 20 million to be used as incentive payments to encourage state and local conservation efforts these increases would have been partially offset by 10 million from user fees to be charged for the first time in conservation and elimination of 69 million in prior congressional earmarks that do not have federal or national impact both chambers rejected these requests the housepassed bill had recommended funding at 641 million for co while the senatepassed bill provided 6386 million in the reports accompanying the legislation both chambers included numerous recommendations for specific activities or projects mostly of 1 million or less and some involve policy changes the house report expressed concern about accountability for how these funds are spent and identified several administration initiatives on which they cannot be spent without prior approval by the house appropriations committee it also called on nrcs to submit report justifying the creation of regional offices with its fy2000 budget submission the act is silent on most items in the report language that either chamber had adopted where one crs15 chamber had earmarked funds the earmark was accepted but some of the funding levels were changed beyond co pl 105277 rejects most of the administration proposals and makes changes in other programs it adopts language on the watershed and flood prevention program inserted by the house that limits technical assistance under that program to maximum of 47 million and provides 63 million for the forestry incentives program as passed by the senate the house and administration had both recommended funding the house and senate had small disagreements on two other programs the senate provided level funding for two nrcs programs that are line items watershed surveys and planning and resource conservation and development while the house provided decrease of 16 million for watershed surveys and planning and an increase of less than 1 million for the resource conservation and development program five conservation programs administered by nrcs are funded as mandatory spending not subject to annual appropriations through the ccc as result of provisions in the 1996 farm act pl 105277 makes changes to three of these mandatory programs and claimed nearly 100 million in budget savings which was then applied towards meeting the allocation for all discretionary programs it limits the environmental quality incentives program eqip which supports structural and land management practices under multiyear agreements to 174 million for savings of 26 million concurs with the senate in limiting wetland reserve program wrp enrollment to 120000 acres for savings of 47 million and includes language passed by the senate supporting greater flexibility for enrolling land into the wrp it concurs with both chambers in prohibiting any funding for the conservation farm option cfo which provides payments to producers receiving market transition payments for savings of 25 million but pl 105277 rejected the housepassed prohibition on funding the wildlife habitat incentives program whip which provides payments to farmers who implement approved plans the administration had proposed adding 100 million to the eqip and increasing the cfo by 10 million proposed reduction in the wrp by 95 million to 124 million would have allowed usda to enroll an additional 164000 acres under permanent easements temporary easements and longterm agreements also in the administration request the whip would have declined from 30 to 20 million and the farmland protection program fpp would not have been funded these changes reflect the approaching of the enrollment cap for the wrp and the allocation of all authorized funds for the fpp in fy1998 and for the cfo and whip in fy1999 the senate bill had limited wrp enrollment to 120000 acres for 47 million in savings changed how land can be enrolled and when payment limits would not apply for the wrp and prohibited any funding for the cfo 25 million in savings the house bill had prohibited funding for the whip 20 million in savings limited wrp enrollment to 130000 acres 37 million savings and limited funding for the eqip to 174 million 26 million savings it also had prohibited funding for the cfo 25 million savings crs16 farm service agency conservation programs fsa operates the largest conservation program the conservation reserve program crp under the crp landowners can enter into contracts usually 10 years in duration to retire environmentally sensitive lands from production in return for annual payments and technical assistance crp is mandatory program funded through the ccc as result of provisions enacted in the 1996 farm act estimated funds needed for the crp decline from 1798 billion in fy1998 to 1694 billion in fy1999 according to the administration funds were requested for two other programs both responding to natural disasters the emergency conservation program ecp and the flood risk reduction program conferees rejected senate provision to add pilot program for haying and grazing on crp acreage in 7 states in more than 1 in 4 years in return for reduced payments the housepassed bill provides some directions for administering the conservation reserve enhancement program subset of the crp the forest service with requested outlays of 3378 billion in fy1999 is another agency in usda with natural resource protection responsibilities appropriations for the forest service are within the jurisdiction of the interior subcommittees of the house and senate appropriations committees forest service funding issues are addressed with the other major federal land management agencies in the crs report on the interior appropriations bill see crs report 98206 for more information on usda conservation issues see crs issue brief ib96030 soil and water conservation implementing the 1996 farm bill agricultural research education and economics the fy1999 omnibus appropriations act pl 105277 contains 1930 billion in spending to support the programs of usdas research education and economics ree agencies in fy1999 the housepassed version of hr 4101 contained 1838 billion and the senate bill s 2159 contained 1843 billion for the ree agencies the vetoed conference agreement on hr 4101 would have provided 1923 billion its research provisions are virtually identical to those in pl 105277 except that pl 105277 provides 7 million more to the research agencies for the presidents food safety initiative the level in pl 105277 is almost 7 higher than the administrations request of 1808 billion and 3 above the fy1998 funding level of 1870 billion the conference agreements allocation of funds among the various research and education programs differs significantly from the administrations as did the earlier house and senate measures four agencies carry out usdas ree function the departments inhouse research agency is the agricultural research service ars which provides scientific support to usdas action and regulatory agencies and conducts long term high risk basic and applied research on subjects of national and regional importance the national agricultural library merged with ars in the 1994 usda reorganization the cooperative state research education and extension service csrees is usdas liaison with statelevel research education and extension programs at the land grant colleges of agriculture the economic research service ers provides economic analysis of agriculture issues using its databases as well as data collected crs17 by the national agricultural statistics service nass ars csrees ers and nass are under the under secretary for research education and economics agricultural research service ars pl 105277 provides 842 million for ars in fy1999 of that amount 786 million would be allocated to ars research programs 42 million increase from the fy1998 level of 744 million and 564 million would be allocated to the construction and repair of ars buildings and facilities compared to 806 million in fy1998 pl 105277 provides more for ars than either the senate measure s 2159 809 million the housepassed version hr 4101 8172 million or the conference agreement on hr 4101 8384 million the senatepassed version of s 2159 contained 135 million reduction in the ars buildings and facilities funds that the senate used to partly offset 66 million increase in support for the presidents food safety initiative over the amount contained in the bill as originally reported by the senate appropriations committee of the 66 million the senate designated 9 million for ars food safety research the administration requested 14 million pl 105277 provides total of 593 million for the initiative for research and increases the ars allocation by 36 million to 126 million but the offset is longer coming from arss construction funds the final appropriation of 564 million for ars buildings and facilities exceeds the senatepassed level by 245 million and is only 5 million less than the housepassed level of 614 million two other titles of pl 105277 not related to agriculture also provide funds to ars for specific research under title iii the office of national drug control policy is to transfer 45 million to ars for antidrug research under title viii the western hemisphere drug elimination act of 1998 23 million is appropriated for ars to do research on drug crop eradication technologies narcotics plant biochemistry alternative crops and development of herbicides for aerial spraying programs to eradicate narcotic plants cooperative state research education and extension service csrees pl 105277 provides 9192 million for cooperative research education and extension programs in the states an amount that is 713 million higher than the housepassed version of hr 4101 44 million higher than s 2159 88 million above the administration request and 39 million more than the vetoed conference agreement on hr 4101 the administration requested 235 million decrease in csrees funding for fy1999 which included controversial reductions in hatch act funds for research at the state agricultural experiment stations smithlever act formula funds for extension programs and mcintirestennis funds for cooperative forestry research pl 105277 reverses all of these proposals and actually provides more than contained in either s 2159 or the housepassed version of hr 4101 with the exception of formula funds for extension programs where the conferees agreed with what the senate had provided in s 2159 pl 105277 contains 1805 million for hatch act formula funds 7 increase over fy1998 2765 million for smith lever formula funds 3 increase and 219 million for forestry research 7 increase pl 105277 also increases funding for research at the 1890 historically crs18 black land grant colleges by 7 to 297 million and for 1890s extension programs by 3 to 258 million pl 105277 provides 1193 million for the national research initiative nri competitive grants program this amount is higher than either the house or senate bills and higher than the fy1998 level of 1125 million but less than the administrations 130 million request of the six research categories under the nri food safety receives an 8 million increase over the fy1998 level for total of 16 million as part of the food safety initiative conference report language directs usda to consult with the food and drug administration fda regarding its research needs and to use 5 million of the 8 million increase to meet those needs pl 105277 also provides an additional 41 million to csrees for other research programs addressing food safety for total increase of 121 million in cooperative food safety research pl 105277 provides 23 increase to 631 million over the fy1998 level of 515 million s 2159 would have reduced funding for special grants to 514 million and the housepassed version of hr 4101 to 493 million pl 105277 also provides an additional 633000 in funding for extension special projects over the fy1998 level of 111 million extensions expanded food and nutrition education program will receive level funding of 587 million congress directed in the fy1996 agricultural appropriations report that new funds should be appropriated for constructing research facilities at land grant colleges of agriculture after fy1997 such funds were appropriated for fy1998 the administration did not request any funds for facilities construction in fy1999 and pl 105277 likewise contains none it is expected that such funding may resume once congress and department officials have examined congressionally mandated 10year strategic plan for agricultural research facilities that is due to be completed shortly csrees administers competitive grants program under the fund for rural america program focused on research and development projects of benefit to farm and rural communities that was authorized and given mandatory funding in the 1996 farm act pl 104127 in fy1998 csrees had 361 million available in funds to award to research projects related to rural needs the recently enacted agricultural research extension and education reform act pl 105185 s 1150 extended the authority for the fund for rural america through fy2003 and allocated an additional 100 million in mandatory funds to it over 5 years this would make total of 60 million available annually to usda for all the activities of the fund with somewhat less than half of that amount being available for research grants pl 105 277 reflects provisions in both the house and senatepassed fy1999 funding measures that prohibit the use of any funds to pay the salaries and expenses of personnel to carry out fund for rural america activities this effectively puts the program on hold until fy2000 similarly pl 105277 adopts provision in the housepassed version of hr 4101 that prohibits outlays of the first years allocation of 120 million for the initiative for future agriculture and food systems the initiative was authorized by the new research reauthorization act pl 105185 and would provide 600 million crs19 in mandatory funds over 5 years to support research on the genetics of food crops and livestock food safety human nutrition alternative uses for agricultural commodities biotechnology and sitespecific farming using satellite technology precision agriculture the withholding of the first years funds puts the program on hold until fy2000 economic research service ers and national agricultural statistics service nass pl 105277 provides 658 million in funding for ers this is slightly below the housepassed level of 673 million and significantly higher than the senate level of 540 million the fy1998 appropriation of 716 million reflected decision to give ers the responsibility for all usda research and analysis of food programs and food policy issues pl 105277 adopts the house provision to keep those responsibilities in ers rather than to transfer them to the food and nutrition service as the administration requested and the senate proposed pl 105 277 stipulates that 122 million will be used for studies and evaluations of the food stamp child nutrition and women infants and children wic programs and also includes language that directs that 2 million of the 122 million be transferred to the food program administration account of the food and nutrition service for conducting program evaluations also as part of erss total funding the conferees directed 453000 to be spent on studies to estimate the benefits of food safety s 2159 had provided 900000 for that purpose and the housepassed bill contained 704000 the conferees also reiterated senate report language directing ers not to reduce the frequency of its commodity situation and outlook reports pl 105277 adopts the senate provision to provide 104 million for nass reflecting the administrations position that the agency will not require as much funding in fy1999 to continue its work on the 1997 census of agriculture the fy1998 appropriation was 118 million and the administrations budget request for fy1999 was 1072 million the house measure would have provided 1051 million pl 105277 provides that 236 million be spent for nasss continuing work on the census and reiterates senate report language requiring usda to streamline the census application by reducing redundant questions for more information on agricultural research issues see crs issue brief 97032 agricultural research education and extension issues in the 105th congress food safety and inspection improved food safety is among the three goals that secretary glickman has set forth for usda under the government performance and results act in order to elevate the departments role in this mission area the administration in 1995 established an office of the under secretary for food safety the food safety and inspection service fsis is the only agency in usdas food safety mission area fsis is responsible for the mandatory inspection of meat poultry and processed egg products to ensure their safety wholesomeness and proper labeling fsis and the industry are now implementing comprehensive new system to reduce pathogens in meat and poultry products through preventive approach known as hazard analysis critical control point or haccp this system is to supplement not replace existing inspection procedures one budget issue related to haccp implementation is fsiss ability to properly implement and enforce the new crs20 procedures while still meeting its traditional inspection obligations some observers maintain that the agency could be hard pressed to keep both systems operating optimally with the annual appropriation it receives from congress food safety and inspection service for several years the administration has proposed requiring the meat packing industry cover greater portion of the full cost of federal meat poultry and egg inspection by paying increasing amounts of user fees congress rejected the administrations user fee proposal last year as it has rejected previous and more modest ones and both the senate and house appropriations measures reject the administrations user fee proposal for fy1999 for fy1999 pl 105277 provides 6170 million appropriation for fsis this level is 8 million higher than the vetoed conference agreement on hr 4101 it is estimated that the amount of user fees collected for overtime inspection services will remain at about the fy1998 level 86 million bringing the total program level to 704 million about 4 increase from the 1998 fiscal year the fy1998 appropriation for fsis was 589 million with total program level of 675 million the 8 million increase is designated entirely to fsis activities related to the food safety initiative bringing the agencys total allocation for the initiative to 16 million in fy1999 conferees adopted senate provision to provide separate funding of 446000 for the office of the under secretary for food safety rather than house proposal to fund the office from the fsis appropriation congress provided separate funding for the office in fy1998 conferees adopted language directing the secretary to report to the committees on appropriations by march 1 1999 with recommendations on lifting the ban on interstate shipment of state inspected meat the committee also rejected senate provision to require countryoforigin labeling on imports of beef and lamb but requires comprehensive study on its potential effects and several other related issues the explanatory statement attached to pl 105277 also directs fsis to redo report on the potential merits and effectiveness of mandatory inspection program for meat from ratites eg ostrich emu rhea and to include in the revision the cost benefit analysis and health risk assessment that congress had originally asked for for more information see crs issue brief 95062 meat and poultry inspection issues marketing and regulatory programs the mission of usdas marketing and regulatory programs administered by three agencies the agricultural marketing service ams the animal and plant health inspection service aphis and the grain inspection packers and stockyards administration gipsa is to facilitate the domestic and international marketing of us agricultural products and to ensure the health and care of animals and plants while improving market competitiveness and the economy for the overall benefit of both consumers and american agriculture according to usda aphis spending accounts for most of the marketing and regulatory program budget pl 105277 contains 5213 million for these agencies programs with an additional 1953 million authorized to be collected through user fees for total program level of 7166 million 27 user fee supported the total program level in fy1998 was 7086 million of which approximately 195 million or about 27 came from user fees the administrations fy1999 budget proposal would have set crs21 program level of 7127 million for these agencies programs of which 207 million about 29 would have come from user fees agricultural marketing service pl 105277 provides 610 million in appropriations to ams 30 million more than fy1998 and authorizes the collection of 647 million in user fees 12 million more than the current year for total fy1999 program level of 1247 million the senate measure s 2159 would have provided 578 million in budget authority to ams and authorized the collection of 635 million in user fees the housepassed bill allocated virtually level funding for fy1999 and adopted the administrations request to allow 647 million to be collected in user fees the administration had requested 707 million for ams and would have allocated most of the increase to broadening the scope of the pesticide data program pdp which collects and analyzes data on pesticide residues in fruits vegetables and other foods pl 105277 adopts senate provision that amends the agricultural marketing act of 1946 to make it illegal to grade and repack eggs in usdastamped cartons if they have already been in commerce without having gone through the usda voluntary egg grading program conference language also requires usda and fda to submit status report to congress on the agencies efforts to improve the safety of shell eggs animal and plant health inspection service pl 105277 provides 4258 million in budget authority for aphis programs 05 million less than fy1998 and authorizes the expenditure of 88 million same as fy1998 in collected user fees for total program level of 5138 million for fy1999 s 2159 would have provided program level of 5145 million and the house version of hr 4101 would have provided 5125 million pl 105277 also provides 77 million for aphis building projects an amount that is 25 million higher than the budget request and the house passed bill and 35 million higher than s 2159 conferees also adopted language directing usda to publish rules regarding the compensation of arizona wheat producers and others for their economic losses on the 19971998 crop due to karnal bunt disease the budget request which called for an 81 million decrease for aphis programs in fy1999 assumed less demand for some aphis programs and increased costsharing for predator control and boll weevil eradication programs in addition the administrations fy1999 budget proposed new user fees to recover some of the costs for administering animal welfare biotechnology veterinary biologic pink bollworm and swine health protection act programs pl 105277 reflects the fact that neither the senate nor the house bill adopted this proposal floor amendment bass to the house version of hr 4101 that would have reduced funding by 10 million for aphiss livestock predator control operations through its wildlife services program was adopted on june 23 and then voted down on june 24 after the amendment was adopted many members were concerned that the wording of the amendment would actually reduce wildlife services spending by 21 million instead of the intended 10 million and require reductions in wildlife services research spending as well as operations when the amendment was revised the next day it was defeated thus maintaining the funding level at 287 million for crs22 operations and 103 million for research as originally reported by the house appropriations committee pl 105277 provides 288 million for predator control operations and 104 million for research conferees also adopted provisions that would provide 400000 to be used to prevent the inadvertent introduction of brown tree snakes in hawaii 300000 to establish wildlife services office in hawaii 450000 for trap testing to meet us obligations under international standards and an additional 175000 for coyote and wolf control in the rocky mountain region grain inspection packers and stockyards administration pl 105277 provides 268 million for gipsa and authorizes the collection of 426 million in user fees for total program level of 693 million s 2159 would have appropriated 264 million and the housepassed measure 275 million for gipsa the amount provided in pl 105277 is slightly higher than the current appropriation 254 million and substantially higher than the administration request of 118 million the budget request assumed enactment of authority for 215 million in additional user fees which the house and senate did not adopt for grain inspection activities and to administer the packers and stockyards act provision added in conference on pl 105277 requires the secretary of agriculture to conduct 12month pilot investigation to require certain large buyers sellers or marketers of domestic or imported cattle for fresh beef or sheep for frozen lamb to report to the secretary the prices they paid similar pilot investigation is also required for the

billion in loan authority pl 105277 includes total of 657 million in grants and 15 billion in loan subsidies salaries and expenses the presidents fy1999 budget proposal included request for an appropriation of 2220 billion for rural development programs much of which would have supported 5797 billion in loan authority for rural development initiatives crs23 rural community advancement program in addition to grants loans and loan guarantees awarded under one of the three service divisions of the rural development administration rural development assistance may also be available through the rural community advancement program rcap which was authorized by the federal agriculture improvement and reform act of 1996 rcap consolidated twelve programs into three distinct funding streams dedicated to rural community facilities rural utilities and rural business and cooperative development state development officers may transfer up to 25 of the programs total budget authority

state administered block grant the fy1999 omnibus appropriations act includes 7227 million in budget authority to support rcap loan and grant activities this is 225 million less than recommended by the house 201 million more than approved by the senate 75 million more than requested by the administration and 705 million more than appropriated for fy1998 major portion 68 million of the 705 million increase in appropriations will be allocated to support water and waste disposal grants and loans the increase in grants and loans for water and waste disposal projects is consistent with the presidents water 2000 initiative to provide all rural households with clean running water by the year 2000 pl 105277 includes provision originally included in the senate bill that would permit the usda to transfer up to 26 million in discretionary funds not otherwise appropriated for specific purpose or location for activities in the lower mississippi delta region it also includes proviso that would count any funds made available from ongoing programs of the department for use in the lower mississippi delta as part of the 26 million targeted to the region pl 105277 directs the undersecretary for rural development to give particular consideration to specific projects or activities in various locations but the report stops short of earmarking rcap funds for these projects instead report language states that the department is to apply established review procedures when considering applications such language contrasts with the recent practice of allocating funds for the department of housing and urban developments economic development initiative edi where funds are routinely earmarked for specific projects identified in reports accompanying bills appropriating funds for hud programs for additional discussion of the increasing use of setasides under the edi program see crs issue brief 98026 community development block grants funding and other issues in the 105th

section 504 housing repair program 25 million in loan level supported by 88 million in subsidies section 514 farm labor housing program 20 million loan level supported by 104 million subsidy multifamily credit sales program 23 million in subsidy in support of 5 million loan level and credit sales of acquired property program 35 million in loan subsidy in support of 169 million in loan authority provisions of pl 105277 reflect house and senate compromises on assistance for section 515 rental housing loans and section 538 multifamily housing guarantees the act provides loan subsidy of 552 million to support 1143 million of section 515 activities it also provides 100 million for section 538 multifamily housing loan guarantees significant increase from the 20 million program level in fy1998 in addition pl 105277 includes senate provision that earmarks 104 million in rhs assistance to existing empowerment zones and enterprise communities ezec authorized under pl 10366 the administration had sought to provide 100 million in grants over 5 years for five newly designated empowerment zones pl 105277 also includes general provision which was in neither the house nor the senate bill which appropriates an additional 15 million in assistance to previously designated empowerment zones 10 million and 20 additional rural enterprise communities 5 million the fy1999 appropriations act also includes senate provision that earmarks 1 million in mutual and self help housing grants for use in ezec communities with the proviso that such assistance must be obligated by june 30 1999 it includes provision that appropriates 41 million for the rural housing assistance grant program this is 47 million less than appropriated in fy1998 it includes language that reauthorizes number of rural housing programs through the year 2000 senate provision would have reauthorized these programs through fy1999 but was deleted in conference provision reauthorizing such programs was included in separate legislation rural businesscooperative service total funding of 564 million for rbcs programs in fy1999 includes 33 million in grants 257 million in salaries and expenses and 239 million in loan subsidies pl 105277 provides an appropriation of 564 million to fund salaries and expenses of rbcs and to support loan level of 48 million total funding for fy1999 is 57 million below fy1998 106 crs25 million below the administration request 5 million below the senate level but 25 million above the proposed house level within these amounts are 166 million in rural development loan fund subsidies in support of loan level of 33 million which is consistent with the amount proposed by the senate 38 million in rural economic development loan subsidies in support of 15 million loan level as proposed by the house and 33 million in rural cooperative development grants with 13 million earmarked for technology transfer to rural areas program as proposed by the house and 250000 earmarked for cooperative development program as proposed by the senate pl 105277 also includes language that directs the secretary to give special consideration to several projects requesting rural cooperative development grant assistance these projects are located in missouri pennsylvania and iowa further the fy1999 act appropriates 35 million for the alternative agricultural research and commercialization revolving loan fund this is 35 million less than approved by the senate or appropriated in fy1998 and 65 million less than requested by the administration the house version of the bill provided funding for the program rural utilities service pl 105277 provides total appropriation of 1262 million to the rural utilities service to support 187 billion in fy1999 lending authority it includes 300 million in authority for treasuryrate telecommunications loans and 158 million for the rural telephone bank program the act allocates 127 million in distance learning and telemedicine grants and 180000 in loan subsidies in support of 150 million loan level for distance learning and telemedicine loans fund for rural america the act prohibits any funds from being used to administer the fund for rural america for fy1999 the fund which was created in 1996 provides grants assistance in support of rural economic development projects an annual appropriation is not required for the fund since it receives its funding directly from the us treasury the act in effect prohibits the spending of the 60 million that is authorized for the program in fy1999 food and nutrition programs food and nutrition programs are administered by the us department of agriculture usda they include the food stamp program child nutrition programs the special supplemental nutrition program for women infants and children wic and several commodity donation programs serving lowincome mothers and children indians the elderly and needy families and individuals total spending approved for these programs for fy1999 is 3607 billion or about twothirds of total spending for the usda the administration requested total of 384 billion 12 billion from the fy1998 enacted level in spending for food and nutrition programs in fy1999 crs26 the final omnibus fy1999 appropriations act pl 105277 contains identical provisions for food and nutrition programs to those in the earlier vetoed conference agreement on hr 4101 as finally enacted pl 105277 provides total of 1 226 billion for the food stamp program 2 3924 billion for the wic program the same as fy1998 funding 3 538 billion for the school lunch program 4 16 billion for the child and adult care food program and 5 just under 14 billion for the school breakfast program funding and responsibility for nutrition program studies and evaluations is maintained within the economic research service ers instead of the food and nutrition service fns as proposed by the administration food stamps pl 105277 essentially adopted the houseproposed spending levels for food stamps 2258 billion in total funding and 90 million for efap commodities the administration food stamp request for fy1999 was 247 billion decrease of 439 million from fy1998 projected spending the request included funding for nutrition assistance to puerto rico and for the food distribution program on indian reservations 100 million to buy commodities for food banks and soup kitchens participating in the emergency food assistance program efap and 1 billion contingency reserve fund senate appropriations provided total of 238 billion for food stamp and related programs for fy1999 or 920 million less than the administration request this allowed for contingency reserve of 100 million instead of the 1 billion requested by the administration and called for reduction of 20 million from the 100 million in food stamp funds required to be used to buy commodities for the efap as passed by the house hr 4101 recommended 226 billion for food stamps in fy1999 the difference is due largely to the fact that the house used more recent estimates of food stamp spending needs than either the administration or senate these showed lower than previously projected participation and benefit costs and thus the need for less spending the finally enacted measure cut the administrations 1 billion contingency fund request down to 100 million the same as last year it also provided 10 million less to buy commodities for the efap than the 100 million of food stamp funds that are supposed to be used to buy commodities for this program the administration requested the full 100 million the senate proposed 80 million child nutrition programs these programs include school lunch and breakfast summer food child and adult care and special milk programs and related support activities pl 105277 provides total of 9177 billion which is less than both the house and senatepassed measures this is because of acceptance of senate provision that will lessen mandatory fy1999 spending by about 40 million for commodity procurement for the school lunch program this provision originally added as floor amendment to provide room for an increase for the wic program see below requires that the usda use bonus commodities to help meet the requirement that not less than 12 of federal support for the school lunch program be in the form of commodity assistance2 the administration proposed total funding 2 the national school lunch act mandates legislatively specified level of commodity assistance currently valued at 1475 cents for every lunch served under the school lunch child and adult care and summer food programs section 6g of this law also requires that not continued crs27 of 92186 billion for child nutrition programs in fy1999 the senate appropriation for fy1999 would have funded these programs at total of 92199 billion slightly less 13 million than the administration request the house bill recommended 92186 billion for child nutrition programs the final law provided 10 million for the school meals initiative the amount proposed by the senate and 2 million more than the house proposal committee report language in both chambers initiallyapproved bills recommended that 4 million of the funds appropriated for the school meals initiative be used to fund food service training grants to states with the remainder used for technical assistance materials 16 million print and electronic resource systems 400000 and other unspecified activities 32 million funding for the nutrition education and training net program as proposed by the senate was contained in the final law this program was funded at 375 million in fy1998 the level requested by the house for fy1999 the administration requested 10 million for the net wic the final amount provided in pl 105277 for wic is the same as the houserecommended level 3 924 billion pl 105277 did not approve funding for wic contingency reserve proposed by the administration 20 million it did approve the 15 million recommended by the administration and senate for the wic farmers market nutrition program but did not accept the administration proposal that this be funded with commodity assistance program cap funds instead of wic funds of the 15 million in wic appropriations for the farmers market program the conferees directed that usda obligate 10 million within 45 days of enactment and allow an additional 5 million from any funds not needed to maintain the wic caseload level the administration budget proposed wic program funding of 416 billion in fy1999 157 million more than fy1998 appropriations this reflected 20 million contingency reserve and the assumption that wic funds will be used to fund the wic farmers market coupon fmc program which would be funded elsewhere see section on commodity donation programs according to administration estimates its fy1999 wic funding proposal was necessary to maintain the fy1998 monthly average participation level of 75 million persons legislators agreed to maintain fy1999 wic funding at the fy1998 level because of lower projected participation than that assumed by the administration and the assumption of program efficiencies growing out of child nutrition reauthorization legislation hr 3874 passed at the end of the session the senatepassed bill recommended 3948 billion for wic in fy1999 or 24 million more than fy1998 funding the additional 24 million was added by floor amendment that also reduced federal funding for commodity procurement for the school lunch program to pay for the wic increase 2 continued less than 12 of the federal assistance provided to the school lunch program be in the form of commodities in recent years the per lunch rate of commodity assistance has not provided sufficient values of commodities to meet the 12 school lunch commodity requirement and appropriations have been needed to meet the 12 minimum the senate amendment lessens the amount of funds that must be appropriated for this purpose by requiring the secretary to use bonus commodities to meet the fy1999 shortfall bonus commodities are those acquired for farm support or surplus removal reasons rather than for domestic food programs and commonly are donated to domestic food programs crs28 commodity donation programs the final amount in pl 105277 provides 2721 million in fy1999 for commodity donation programs the emergency food assistance program efap the commodity supplemental food program csfp the elderly nutrition commodities program and the needy family program of this total 45 million is for grants to states to help with the cost of distributing commodities for the efap3 86 million is for the csfp 140 million is for elderly commodities and 11 million is for commodities for the needy family program the 86 million provided for the csfp is 10 million less than the amount provided last year unspent carryover funds from fy1998 are expected to be available to the program in fy1999 to maintain the caseload for this program which provides monthly food packages to lowincome mothers young children and elderly the administration budget proposed total of 3171 million for all of these programs of this amount 96 million was for the commodity supplemental food program csfp and 45 million for efap state administrative grants for total of 141 million the administration also proposed 15 million for the wic farmers market coupon fmc program normally funded with wic appropriations and 20 million for new gleaningfood recovery initiative under this category of programs food donation programs were to receive 1411 million for more information see crs report 98582 food and nutrition programs fy1999 budget and appropriations food and drug administration the food and drug administration fda is funded through both congressional appropriations and user fees whose total level of collections is set each year by the appropriations committees the most contentious provisions are in the funding levels for salaries and expenses and in one user fee program the omnibus fy1999 appropriations act pl 105277 increases fdas program level to 9709 million 13 increase over fy1998 and allows 1323 million for prescription drug user fee act pdufa collections also 13 increase over fy1998 the total program level plus user fees for fy1999 is 1117 billion included for the first time in the account is 83 million for rental payments to be paid to the general services administration gsa the act includes provision that will allow 5428 million of pdufa funds to be transferred and merged in the account and used for payment of gsa rentals thus total of 88 million will be made available for rental payments in the account separately pl 105277 provides 1135 million for fda buildings and facilities pl 105277 maintains the fy1998 appropriation level of 34 million to fund tobacco outreach and enforcement activities and also continues support for the presidents food safety initiative fsi the president had requested an additional 50 million in direct appropriations for fda for fsi activities the act appropriates 3 this does not reflect the 90 million in food stamp funds appropriated to buy commodities for the efap crs29 25 million increase the conferees expect fda to use 245 million of this total amount for increased food inspections and 500000 for research by the national center for toxicological research the fy1999 appropriations act also includes 250000 for the office of seafood inspection within this amount 200000 is to be used to continue the grant to the interstate shellfish sanitation committee it also directs fda to use 500000 to develop the system and regulations necessary to implement new food packaging materials notification program by may 1999 the conferees strongly urge fda to finalize rule within one year after receiving citizens petition on the use of andor in the labeling of types of fish contained in surimi conferees increased the appropriation by 25 million for the cosmetic and color regulatory program conferees also expect fda to publish by june 1 1999 proposed rule concerning the use of foreign marketing data in the review of new sunscreen active ingredients in the overthecounter drug monograph on sunscreen products also included in the bill is 3 million in construction funds for the third phase of construction of fda arkansas regional laboratory arl in jefferson arkansas the project will need approximately 133 million to be completed pl 105277 prohibits fda from closing or relocating its division of drug analysis in st louis mo appropriates 1 million for the office of generic drugs and appropriates 700000 for competitive grants under the clinical pharmacology program pl 105277 urges fda to issue new regulations and guidance for the generic drug industry manufacturers who file an abbreviated new drug application anda which relies on the fdas previous determination that the drug is safe and effective thus avoiding submitting new safety and effectiveness studies the act also refines the definition of antibacterial ingredients to exempt certain class in animal drugs not included in pl 105277 is senate bill language on metereddose inhalers mdis which are used to treat asthma and other chronic lung diseases under the montreal protocol the fda is required to phase out the use of chlorofluorocarbons cfcs in mdis and approve new devices that use less environmentally damaging propellent compound the senate directed fda to gather information on safe and effective noncfc mdis which meet patients needs before phasing out cfc devices another senate provision that was not included in the final act is requirement for country of origin labeling for fresh produce instead the bill directs the general accounting office gao to study the potential effects of mandatory country of origin labeling of fresh produce and submit report to congress later than 6 months after enactment of this act commodity futures trading commission regulatory jurisdiction over derivative financial contracts contracts whose value depends on changes in the price of some underlying commodity or financial crs30 instrument has been contentious issue for several years the commodity futures trading commission cftc has jurisdiction over derivative contracts futures contracts and some options traded on the futures exchanges however several other forms of derivatives eg certain contracts based on foreign currencies or us treasury securities are exempted by law from cftc regulation currently attention focuses on swap contracts which are the basis of booming international market in offexchange or overthecounter derivatives swaps resemble futures in their economic function but the major dealers banks and affiliates of securities firms are not institutions that have traditionally been regulated by the cftc agency has overall regulatory jurisdiction and there is some concern that the present fragmented regulatory structure might have difficulty responding to crisis in the swaps market which might have wide repercussions throughout the international financial system in may 1998 the cftc published concept release announcing its intention to evaluate current regulation of swaps and to consider whether they should be subject to some or all of the requirements of the commodity exchange act which governs exchangetraded futures the securities and exchange commission and the banking regulators objected to this cftc initiative stating that 1 existing regulation of over thecounter derivatives was adequate and 2 that if new regulation was necessary it should be formulated by the various financial regulators as group rather than by unilateral action of single agency the swaps industry argued that even raising the possibility of cftc regulation might cast doubt over the legal enforceability of swaps contracts and drive the business offshore in response to these concerns the fy1999 omnibus appropriations act pl 105 277 imposes restraint period on the cftc directing it not to issue or propose any new rule or regulation affecting swaps or hybrid financial
