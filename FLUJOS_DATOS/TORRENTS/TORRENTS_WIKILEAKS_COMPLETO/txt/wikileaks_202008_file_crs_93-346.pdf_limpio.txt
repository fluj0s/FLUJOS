crs report for congressreceived through the crs web93346 the endangered species act and private property legal primer robert meltz legislative attorney american law division march 7 1993the endangered species act and private property legal primer summary if the 103rd congress embarks upon an effort to reauthorize the endangered species act it will run into an old acquaintance the property rights issue as now written the has at least the potential to curtail property rights whatever its actual impact as implemented may be this report explores the legal repercussions of those impacts especially whether they constitute takings of property under the fifth amendment of the us constitution the first type of possible impact occurs when the directly bars an activity on private land because it might adversely affect an endangered or threatened species section 9 bans the taking of listed species term that includes significant habitat modification even on private land on the other hand the act seeks to accommodate economic pressure by allowing takes of listed species that are merely incidental to proposed activity section 7 orders federal agencies to insure that their actions including permitting are unlikely to jeopardize the continued existence of listed species like section 9 section 7 allows incidental takes and can be bypassed entirely by action of an endangered species committee while the possibility of direct landuse prohibitions under the sparks most of the congressional debate there appears to be not single constitutional taking decision from the courts based on such restrictions the second type of theoretical impact occurs when the limits ones ability to protect property from the depredations of listed species section 9 contains defense for protection of private property though importantly special rules allow government agents to deal with nuisance animals one case has been decided in this category finding constitutional taking and most nonesa depredation cases have yielded the same result instances where the protected species exists on private land through government relocation however may offer better prospects for the taking plaintiff the third type of possible impact occurs when the limits commercial dealings in members of species that were acquired before the species was listed section 9 contains the pertinent language supreme court taking decisions suggest that constitutional relief in these circumstances is particularly unlikely key reason why courts are not finding constitutional takings is because until now they have deemed the restrictions in wildlife statutes to be landuse controls rather than to effect permanent physical occupations by the protected animals the former type of government interference with property is more rarely held to be taking than the latter for this and other reasons but stressing the difficulty of prediction in this area it seems that few impacts on private property are likely to

act and private property legal primer if the 103rd congress embarks upon an effort to reauthorize the endangered species act1 it will run into an old acquaintance the property rights issue as now written the has at least the potential to curtail private property rights in various ways whatever its actual impact as implemented may be the acts detractors brand it absolutist in commanding the protection of every endangered species regardless of private property impacts or the species ecological role2 while its partisans find in it ample accommodation of landowners concerns3 at times the emotions generated by the debate have been extreme one can see why to ones surprise the hundreds of species protected by the are sometimes found on private property where they are the may pit private economic activity against national concern for aesthetic ecological scientific and recreational values the landowner in theory may suffer economic loss immediate concrete and quantifiable while the benefits he reaps from the act as member of the public are delayed uncertain and noneconomic moreover if the land is not formally purchased by government the public shares in the claimed benefits without cost of course the is but one face of the tension between government regulation and private property rights in recent decades federal programs like state and local ones have increasingly sought to curtail uses of private property deemed inconsistent with environmental and other public goals along with wildlife protection wetlands and surface mining regulation are the salient federal examples the reaction has been burgeoning grassroots propertyrights movement and more supreme court attention to clarifying and occasionally strengthening the safeguards of private property in the fifthamendment taking clause4 both the reagan and bush administrations made protection of property rights an explicit agenda item the former issuing an executive order instructin g federal agencies to set up procedures for considering and minimizing the property impacts of their proposed actions5 even looking solely at government protection of wildlife the government versusproperty rights issue has taken many forms analyzing the property impacts of such protections in terms ofcrs2 6 4b1a 16 usc 1533b1a 7 4b2 16 usc 1533b2 see 50 cfr 42419 8 explains the pertinent committee report whether species has declined sufficiently to justify listing is biological not an economic question for this reason the house committee on merchant marine and fisheries eliminated all economic considerations from the species listing process desirous to restrict the secretarys decision on species listing to biology alone the committee nonetheless recognized that the critical habitat designation with its attendant economic analysis offers some counterpoint to the listing of species without due consideration for the effects on land use and other development interests for this reasonwhether there exists constitutional taking is merely todays fashion such conflicts have also been challenged as due process violations government torts or exceedances of the police power and the is not the only source of government wildlife protection affecting property other federal wildlife statutes that have spawned propertyrelated challenges are the migratory bird treaty act eagle protection act and wild freeroaming horses and burros act this report sketches the provisions most likely to fix the acts impact on private property rights it then reviews three ways in which the act may in theory at least constrain the use of private property noting under each pertinent provisions and b the case law particularly on the constitutional taking issue fourth category federal purchase of private property is briefly noted finally the report surveys past congressional legislation and future options because propertyrelated case law under the is so sparce we cast our net broadly to include cases under other wildlife statutes as well i propertyrights walk through the though congress first adopted endangeredspecies legislation in 1966 the propertyrights issue did not emerge until 1973 when it enacted the the considerably broadened federal management authority over endangered and threatened species including those on private land under the modern act the possibility of propertyrights conflicts begins when the secretary of the interior through the fish and wildlife service fws formally lists species as endangered or threatened the secretary of commerce through the national marine fisheries service nmfs administers the act for marine species any species or subspecies of fish wildlife or plants may be listed and separate populations of vertebrate species as well significant here listing is to be done solely on the basis of the best scientific and commercial data6 ie without reference to property rights impacts along with the listing determination the appropriate secretary is required when possible to designate the critical habitat of the species areas essential to the conservation of the species that may require special management or protection in sharp contrast with listings critical habitat designation is to be based both on scientific data and economic impact and any other relevant impact7 presumably allowing impacts on property rights to be weighed indeed the secretary may even exclude an area from critical habitat if the benefits of exclusion outweigh those of inclusion unless exclusion for this reason will cause species extinction this distinction between listing and habitat designation allowing propertyimpacts analysis only with the latter was made by congress quite deliberately8crs3 the committee elected to leave critical habitat as an integral part of the listing process but to prevent its designation from influencing the decision on the listing of species house rep 567 97th cong 2d sess 12 1982 see also house conf rep 835 97th cong 2d sess 19 1982 9

but not completedof course species listing and habitat designation by themselves occasion direct interference with private property rather it is the provisions triggered by these events that may do so one such provision section 9 lays out prohibited acts in connection with endangered animals and plants9 section 9s prohibitions apply to private as well as public property and apply regardless of whether critical habitat is involved for endangered animals prohibited acts include the taking of any such species b possessing selling or transporting any such animal obtained by unlawful take c transporting an animal interstate in the course of commercial activity and d selling an animal interstate or importingexporting same for endangered plants the list is narrower deleting the general taking prohibition the term take key concept not to be confused with fifthamendment takings is generously defined to include almost any act adversely affecting species including to harass harm pursue hunt capture or collect listed animal exceptions from section9 prohibitions aimed at accommodation of economic pressures may be authorized chiefly for takings incidental to otherwise lawful activities and undue economic hardship due to contracts made prior to federal consideration of species as possibly endangered by general rule the fws has extended almost all the above prohibitions to threa tened animals and plants as well10 special rules have been promulgated for those threatened species having atypical management needs and for experimental populations the other provision with propertyrights implications section 7 sets out federal agency obligations 11 its sweeping mandate is that each federal agency insure that its actions are not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of any endangered species or threatened species or harm designated critical habitat the only exemption to accommodate development is by action of the endangered species committee popularly dubbed the god squad timeconsuming and easily politicized process used to completion only three times since it was established in 197712 stepping back one can readily see that the is neither absolutist in the protections afforded covered species nor at the other extreme sensitive to every property impact of those protections for example the incidental take exception was added to the in 1982 precisely to soften the privateproperty impacts of the act yet on the other hand its availability is far from universal by definition the taking can be excused only if it is incidental to and not the purpose of the landowners proposed activity and an incidentaltake permit may be issued only when the landowner has submitted habitat conservation plan an expensive proposition for some smallcrs4 13 see eg

are discussed in more detail below note to avoid confusion the taking of listed species under the is indicated by quotation marks the taking of private property under the fifth amendment of the constitution is shown by absence of quotation marks ii possible types of propertyrights impacts following are the principal ways in which the might conflict with private property rights the focus again is on the acts legal potential the extent of its impacts as actually implemented is only touched upon 1 direct limits on property uses that might adversely affect listed species when the relation to property rights arises in congress and when propertyrights advocates level their criticisms the debate typically centers on this type of impact13 provisions section 9 together with implementing rules bars any person or federal agency from taking endangered or threatened wildlife the term take is defined by the act to include harming listed species harm in turn is defined by fws to include indirect harm by means of certain habitat alterations harm in the definition of take in the act means an act which actually kills or injures wildlife such act may include significant habitat modification or degradation where it actually kills or injures wildlife by significantly impairin g essential behavioral patterns including breeding feeding or sheltering14 in bringing habitat modification within the definition of harm the fws hardly lacked mandate loss of habitat is recognized in the as principal threat to endangered species and counteracting this trend is key purpose of the act15 nonetheless the interpretation of section 9 as including habitat alterations is also key reason why the intersects with property rightscrs5 16 see eg sierra club v lyng 694 f supp 1260 ed

1539a1b 18 states one commentator only handful of hcps have been approved since 1982 several others have failed outright or have floundered in seemingly endless attempt to reach consensus among disparate interest groupos there is growing environmental opposition to hcps which sanction the loss of habitat and calls for instituting net loss policy for endangered species planning efforts the development community is growing increasingly frustrated with the length of time required to resolve endangered species conflicts through the hcp process and the inability of hcps to remove legal

1973 21 envl law 605 1991 recommendations for changing hcps are contained in bean et reconciling conflicts under the endangered species act the habitat conservation planning experience world wildlife fund 1991 prime factor contributing to the time taken by the fws to approve hcps is doubtless the preparation of an environmental impact statement eis which reportedly has accompanied every hcp approval to date except one eis preparation is required by the national environmental policy act of course not by the esaplainly the habitat of listed species may overlap with private land and in the case of listed aquatic species with private water rights with 749 domestic species listed as endangered or threatened under the act and thousands more awaiting consideration the spectre has been raised by some that the presents ubiquitous threat to the institution of private property note also that habitat modification may constitute prohibited take under section 9 regardless of whether the land is designated critical habitat16 the key section9 safety valve for development pressures is the incidental take provision17 added in 1982 permits for incidental takes ie takes of listed species that are incidental to and not the purpose of proposed activity may be issued by the secretary after the landowner submits habitat conservation plan hcp on the impacts from the taking along with proposed mitigation measures why alternatives were rejected and so on if the secretary finds that the taking will in fact be incidental satisfactorily mitigated and will not appreciably reduce the species chances for survival and recovery he must issue the permit however hcps without which permit cannot be issued have been controversial their cost may be prohibitive for small landowners not covered by regional or project hcps funded by big developers or state and local governments and they allegedly impose delays on development18 fws reports that as of december 1992 it has approved only 14 hcps in the programs decadelong history section 7 by contrast with section 9 operates directly on federal agencies only instructing them to avoid harm to listed species or critical habitat each federal agency shall in consultation with the secretary insure that any action authorized funded or carried out by such agency is not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of any endangered species or threatened species or result in the destruction or adverse modification of habitat of such species which is determined by the secretary to be critical crs6 19 provision for incidental taking permits exempting landowners from section 9 was added to the in order to give landowners not requiring federal permits the same opportunity to develop their property as those proceeding under section 7 house conf rep 304 97th cong 2d sess reprinted in 1982 us code cong ad news 2860 2870 20 issuance of federal permit notwithstanding failure of the proposed development to satisfy section 7 could also be viewed as violation by the agency of section 9 federal agencies fall within the definition of person under section 9 and the issuance of the permit could be viewed as bringing about adverse habitat modification thus taking the species see sierra club v lyng 694 f supp 1260 ed tex 1988 forest services management practices resulted in precipitous decline of redcockaded woodpecker on forest service lands and hence violated both sections 7 and 9 21 7o2 16 usc 1536o2 22 indeed at this writing there are taking cases under the pending in the us court of federal claims the forum where esataking claims against the united states must be filed when the amount in controversy exceeds 10000 28 usc 1346 1491once consulted under this provision the secretary must if listed species might be affected by the proposed action do biological assessment to determine the actual impact if he finds the proposed action not likely to jeopardize per the above language he must specify the impact of any incidental taking on the species necessary mitigating measures conditions that should be imposed on the action etc the incidentaltaking analysis under section 7 is the same as for incidentaltaking permits under section 919 section 7s impact on the private landowner comes about most tangibly when an agency finds that it cannot consistently with section 7 issue permit needed for land development20 probably the most common example is denial of wetlands fill permit under the clean water act which may substantially curtail landowners development plans as practical matter pursuit of an endangered species committee exemption from section 7 is an option only for the largest projects section 7 approvals trump section 9s prohibitions that is when the secretary has issued section7 incidental take statement takings that occur in compliance with that statement are not actionable under section 921 case law while the possibility of direct landuse prohibitions under the sparks most of the congressional debate there has been curiously little activity in the courts we find taking decisions in this category22 environmentalists infer from the lack of cases that the esaproperty rights conflict has been vastly overstated that the act and its enforcing agencies are flexible enough propertyrights advocates argue that the high costs of taking litigation for the small landowner may be what is discouraging resort to the courts not any lack of impacts the environmentalist argument has some force given that other federal environmental programs caught up in the property rights debate especially the wetlands protection effort of the corps of engineers have spawned hefty number of taking claims but one cannot infer from the absence of taking suits alone that the act is having universally insignificant impact on property since the daunting demands of taking law discourage suit in all but extreme instances of property value loss moreover property value loss is gauged by reference to the property as whole total deprivation of economic use on only portion of private tract is not taking ifcrs7 23 this doctrine known as the rule against segmentation was firmly endorsed by the supreme court in 1978 penn central transp co v new york city 438 us 104 127 since then however fourjustice dissent in keystone bituminous coal assn v debenedictis 480 us 470 1987 appeared to be

f2d 317 324 4th cir 1942 the court discerned taking in application of migratory bird treaty act hunting ban to private land near wildlife refuge allegedly rendering the land practically worthless the court explained rather simplistically that any injury thus caused results from an exercise by the government of its police power and not of its power of eminent domain 28 private citizen suit recently filed in oregon seeks to force lumber company to obtain an incidental take permit under the before cutting timber on its own land based on potential disruption of spotted owls on nearby federal land forest conservation council v rosboro lumber co 921114ho d ore filed sept 9 1992 if such permit is judicially required and then applied for and denied ripe constitutional taking claim would seem to existeconomic use of the unaffected portion remains feasible23 thus as with property impacts from other government programs the large majority of any impacts on private property that may be occurring are likely to fall short of the constitutional taking threshhold for another thing even meritorious suits must meet the supreme courts exacting ripeness requirements generally taking claim is not ripe until regulation has resulted in landuse prohibitions applied directly to plaintiffs specific parcel24 beyond that any potential exceptions from landuse prohibition must have been applied for and denied25 and unless it would be futile the landowner must make further attempts to gain approval of scaleddown but still profitable proposals26 for purposes of the these ripeness precepts mean that the mere listing of species cannot support taking claim nor can the fws giving landowner notice that his proposed activity would be regarded by the agency as taking under section 9 and prosecuted rather it would seem that to clear the ripeness hurdle the landown er must apply for and be denied an incidental take permit for the proposed activity and then perhaps do similarly for scaleddown versions thereof under section 7 there is an issue whether denials of federal permits can give rise to ripe taking claim before the endangered species committee exemption process has been exhausted

governmentcompulsion prerequisite for compensability articulated in supreme court physicaltaking cases this prerequisite states rather unremarkably that only those physical invasions to which the property owner does not assent can be takings the second circuit saw government compulsion here in that the developer had voluntarily proposed the vacation home development but of course it is the voluntariness of the landowners accepting the deer on his property not that of his development proposal that is the crux 36 writing only for himself the chief judge opined that if the merits had been reached he would find regulatory taking for one thing it appeared that the developers proposal could be fit into the nondeeryard portion of the tractoperation of irrigationdistrict diversion

with vermonts denial of permit for vacation home development that would overlap deeryard area protected by state law33 the court saw physical taking explaining that the developer had not met us supreme court criteria for compensable permanent physical occupation34 first the developer had not lost the right to possess the deeryard area nor to exclude the deer second it had not lost the right to control the deeryards use for example the developer to the exclusion of others could still walk camp ski or even hunt deer on the land irrespective of whether these activities cause the deer to abandon the deeryard third the availability of these uses to the deeryard owner meant that the right to sell the deeryard area was far from worthless of course it may have helped the court hold against the developer that the physical invasion here was only seasonal involving more than 20 deer35 finally southview held that any regulatory taking claim was unripe due to the landowners failure to seek state approval of scaleddown development plans for the site that did not intrude upon deeryard and its failure to seek compensation in the state courts36 though southview does not involve the

almost impossible for landowners to demonstrate as background on when habitat alteration amounts to prohibited take under section 9 one can do better than read palila v hawaii dept of land and natural resources the leading case palila i announced the simple proposition that habitat modification without more may constitute take37 after the fws promulgated new regulations clarifying that harm means actual harm38 palila ii blessed the agency view that not all modification of listedspecies habitat is taking rather section 9 bans only those activities that modify habitat to an extent that essential behavioral patterns are disrupted or which cause significant decline in species population39 thus as is true under section 7 protection of habitat under section 9 is limited the district court in palila ii however held expansively that habitat modification merely preventing the recovery of species also constitutes harm40 the concept of habitat modification as prohibited take in and of itself has been favorite topic of commentators according to one the palila decisions have stimulated vigorous and indeed creative administration of section 9 by certain fws offices in california the fws has convinced number of city and county officials that they will violate the and be subject to civil and criminal penalties if the city or county approves development within the listed species habitat41 another commentator argues that since congress left the relevant sections unchanged through several amendments to the act since palila it must not disapprove of the definition of harm set out in that litigation42 2 limits on defensive measures aimed at protecting property from harm caused by listed species of older vintage than typeone impacts are instances when person is legally barred from using

another situation arising under the involves protected predators wolves grizzly bears that on occasion kill private livestock provisions section 9 and associated regulations against taking listed species appear to admit of defense based on protection of private property the act creates defense based on goodfaith belief that one was protecting persons from bodily harm but mention is made of protecting property 43 on the other hand two fws special rules allow government agents but not private individuals to take members of threatened species and experimental populations that have actually done harm to property44 one special rule speaks to grizzly bears threatened species grizzlies committing significant depredations to lawfully present livestock crops or beehives may be humanely taken by such agents when it has not been possible to end the depredation by relocating the animals to remote area45 the other special rule quite similar deals with experimental populations of red wolves46 if other threatened species and experimental populations come to harm property there will presumably be more special rules however the cannot easily be read to allow the fws similar freedom to abate property injuries in connection with species designated as endangered direct action by the property owner against nuisance animal could not qualify for an incidental take permit since the resultant taking plainly would be the very aim of the property owners response and not merely incidental thereto case law to date most taking litigation over federal wildlife laws falls into the defenselimitation category and almost all of it has been resolved against the property owner47 prominent in the federalcourt decisions is endorsement of the commonlaw doctrine of ferae naturae the rule that one is liable for injuries wrought by animals existing in state of nature until they have been reduced to possession by skillful capture the doctrine has been consistently endorsed despite

are longer in ferae naturae status but rather have become the property or agents of the relocating governmentfederalstate court doctrinal differences their precedent value for the esataking issue seems limited54 the one federal case that did find taking involved unusual facts in fallini v hodel 55 plaintiffs had stategranted stockwatering right at federal site and federal range improvement permit to build well there after the costly well was completed however the united states forbade plaintiffs from building guardrails around it out of concern for the safety of wild horses protected under the wfhba as result wild horses consumed practically all of the well water the district court found taking because the burden on plaintiff was seen to be greater than in the foregoing cases and because of the frustration of investmentbacked expectations resulting from the well construction pursuant to government permit at first blush fallini has limited relevance to esaprotected species since by historical practice range improvement permits for federal water sources include requirement that wildlife access be assured56 moreover the taking ruling in the case was dictum and not reached on appeal57 still fallini does show that under certain circumstances as here where valuable improvements were rendered worthless federal curtailment of private defenses against wildlife may be deemed taking another scenario with potential for takings one likely to be heard from increasingly is when protected animals are introduced into an area by the government recall above some reallife instances the introduction of red wolves into north carolina and the proposal to introduce gray wolves into the yellowstone ecosystem whether introduced animals thereby become instrumentalities of the government for taking purposes was an issue expressly left open in christy 58 in this regard might it matter also whether the animal is being reintroduced into its historic range as opposed to completely new area and even in the absence of government introduction could it be argued that government intervention merely increasing the population ofcrs13 59 under section 7 it has been held that

substantive due process 490 us at 1115 as noted certain state courts have construed state constitutions to confer right to protect property from protected wildlife supra note 54a listed species undercuts the christy rationale59 or that an animal that is heavily managed within its critical habitat immunized fed tagged etc is controlled by the federal government and hence not under christy the government introduced issue left dangling in christy has received scant judicial attention in the past60 quite recently however it has been raised in suit contending that state took plaintiffs ranch through its relocation nearby of band of tule elk which now allegedly occupy the ranch almost continuously eat crops raised for the ranchers livestock cause stream bank erosion and damage fences while the rancher is prevented from taking adequate protective measures plaintiff asserts both regulatory and physical taking61 undeniably taking actions have become the landowners weapon of choice in the depredations category still other legal swords have been drawn the christy court also found due process violation discerning fundamental right in the us constitution to protect livestock from protected predators that would subject the taking ban to strict scrutiny though relying chiefly on the supreme courts reluctance to enlarge the list of fundamental rights under due process the court also noted that nothing in the prevents the rancher from fencing out grizzlies or driving them away by nonharmful means and that as last resort the fws special rule allows government agents to take nuisance bears62 suit based on another alternative the federal tort claims act ftca met the same fate plaintiffs theory was that by assuming the protection of migratory waterfowl under the migratory

dealings in species acquired prior to listing if an animal or plant or item made therefrom is acquired prior to listing under the the fact of listing may well frustrate commercial expectations based on projected sale of those species or items exotic animals imported prelisting for commercial resale are an obvious example provisions section 9 includes among its prohibitions many that bar commercial dealings in endangered species for example it is made unlawful to import or export or transport interstate in the course of commercial activity any listed animal or plant the rub from the property owners point of view is that the contains explicit authority for general grandfathering from its section9 prohibitions on species or items acquired before listing moreover the insertion of several narrowly defined grandfather provisions in the act supports the view that congress intended broader authority be granted the absence of general grandfathering authority creates the potential for property impacts when species acquired prelisting lose most of their commercial value of the limited grandfathers in the the one most likely to prove useful to the commercial dealer is the hardship exemption64 person may apply for this exemption following government publication of notice that species is being considered for listing as endangered if he has previously entered into contract regarding such species and listing will cause him undue economic hardship granting of the exemption by the secretary is discretionary however and limited to one year from the aforementioned publication other grandfathering authorities are provided for animals held on the date of listing not in the course of commercial activity65 and for sperm whale oil and scrimshaw lawfully held as of the 1973 enactment of the esa66 case lawcrs15 67 by contrast state cases appear to deal solely with state efforts to limit before the fact the property rights acquired when wildlife is reduced to capture cases upholding such efforts against taking challenge are of relevance here however since in such circumstances there is interference with investmentbacked expectations see eg smith v state

v allard by the majority opinion in lucas is that the latter was written by justice scalia just five years earlier the very same justice asserted that by branding as taking federal law abolishing descent and devise of certain indian property the court had effectively limited allard to its facts hodel v irving supra note 70only two federalcourt decisions have dealt with limits on commercial dealings in previously acquired animals each finding taking67 as noted below it is likely that future taking challenges under this rubric will fare better in the only case united states v kepler 68 taking was found in the ban on interstate transport of listed species as applied to animals allegedly held lawfully as of the enactment the court reasoned that the barred sales of the animals in question only in interstate and foreign commerce allowing sales in intra state commerce and when approved by the secretary for scientific and speciespropagation purposes thus listing did not completely destroy the value of the animals and taking was effected more important this category includes the only supreme court taking decision in the wildlife protection area andrus v allard69 hinged on federal ban on commercial transactions in bird parts covered under the eagle protection act and migratory bird treaty act as applied to bird parts lawfully acquired by the plaintiffs before the bans effective date the court found the ban to work taking explaining that while it foreclosed the most profitable use of the bird parts other uses of them possession transport donation or exhibition for an admissions charge remained to plaintiffs andrus is one of the supreme courts most government friendly taking decisions so its precedent value in conservative court has been questioned indeed the justices themselves once debated its vitality70 nonetheless the court gave andrus ringing endorsement in its most recent foray into the regulatory taking area in lucas v south carolina coastal council 71 lucas asserted in dictum that by virtue of governments traditionally high degree of control over commercial dealings the owner of personal property in contrast with land must be aware of the possibility that new regulation might even render such property worthless the clear suggestion is that regulation of commercial dealings in personal property is rarely taking most important the case cited as illustrative was andrus in light of andrus and lucas it is arguable that restraints on commercial trading in animals acquired before listing can never effect taking 4

livestockforage owners or commercialcrs16 72 first there is the term otherwise should this term be viewed as limited to other noncoercive measures there remains the argument that under the general condemnation act 40 usc 257 federal agencys power to condemn has been held as broad as its power to purchase see eg swan lake hunting club v united states 381 f2d 238 240 6th cir 1967 73 692 f supp

drain wetlands contrary to terms of easement acquired by us may not be applied traders we now turn to the very different and far less contentious approach of preserving species on private property through land acquisition provisions section 5 directs the secretary of interior and secretary of agriculture as to the national forests to set up program for conserving wildlife and plants including those listed as endangered or threatened to carry out the program each secretary is directed to use land acquisition authorities in existing statutes and beyond that is given broad landacquisition authority to acquire by purchase donation or otherwise lands waters or interest therein while this phrase explicitly embraces only noncoercive modes of property acquisition sound argument points to its inclusion of condemnation authority as well72 case law section 5 has received judicial attention only as regards whether states and their political subdivisions may condition federal acquisition of land under that provision in sierra club v marsh the court said at least where the conditions would prevent the federal acquisition or if allowing it to occur would render it meaningless73 similar holdings have been rendered by the us supreme court as to federal land acquisition authorities under the migratory bird conservation act74 and migratory bird hunting stamp act75 iii further analysis few issues reach beyond the bounds of any one category above and are discussed here like the case law already discussed these issues have been resolved in ways that by and large cut against the being found to effect takings physical taking or landuse regulation taking plaintiffs often argue that the should be viewed as causing permanent physical occupation of land by members of the listed species or as causing an appropriation of consumed livestock and forage were courts to agree it would plainly be gain to property owners constitutional taking law has long been intolerant of government occupations and appropriations of property allowing little room for factors such as thecrs17 76 see eg loretto v teleprompter manhattan catv corp 458 us 419 1982 permanent physical occupation of land

regulation taking law raises the daunting hurdle for the landowner of proving neartotal reduction in the value of his tract viewed as whole77 moreover dictum in recent supreme court taking decision asserts that even with total value loss government measures perhaps cannot be taking where they destroy the value of land without being aimed at land as contrasted with regulation specifically directed to land use78 if so limitations on private defensive measures not being aimed at land may be constitutionally noncompensable as matter of law so far courts wrestling with taking challenges to the and other federal wildlife statutes have spurned the physical taking approach opting to use the more governmentfriendly test for land use regulation courts have differed however on precisely why physical taking theory is inappropriate the defenselimitation cases one involving the target the extent of government management or protection over the injurycausing animals finding it insufficient on the facts presented to impute the animals conduct to the united states79 in sharp contrast the directcontrol case bypassed entirely the extent of species management analyzing whether physical taking existed solely on the basis of the spectrum of property rights left to the plaintiff in the face of the invading animals80 query whether the divergent approaches of these cases can be explained entirely by the different nature of the challenged government actions requirements for affirmative action for purposes of taking analysis it should make little difference whether the impact is prohibitory or mandatory that is whether it takes the form of prohibition against harmful activity by the property owner or mandate that the property owner take action aimed at lessening the harm caused by his otherwise lawful activity each scenario asks the property owner only to avoid harm that his own activity would create arguably satisfying the fairness element of taking jurisprudence

1981 87 see eg in re stewart transportation co 495 f supp 38 40 ed va 1980 under the public trust doctrine the united states has the right and the duty to protect and preserve the publics interest in natural wildlife resources importantly this decision came after the demise of the state ownership doctrine in hughes excluder devices in their nets to protect endangered and threatened sea turtles provoked taking lawsuit dismissed on jurisdictional grounds81 whether government owns wildlife courts as noted have declared that the united states does not own the wildlife on federal lands82 and more generally that wildlife is never the private property of those whose lands it occupies83 rather the ownership language employed by the supreme court until recently has been called legal fiction expressive of the importance to its people that state have broad power to regulate wildlife in the public interest84 these two facets nonownership and special relationship are discussed in turn as to nonownership we have seen in the federal wildlifetaking cases that the absence of traditional government ownership has facilitated the judicial embrace of ferae naturae nonresponsibility for acts of wildlife nonownership however may not excuse all governmental sins as we have noted in connection with government relocation of protected species supreme court taking decisions dealing with physical invasions have never insisted that the invading agent be government property85 it is only the existence of sufficient causational nexus between government act and property impact that the taking clause requires the rule that land ownership does not extend to the wildlife thereon has further consequence the marauding grizzly bear does not become the property of the rancher when it runs onto his land thus the rancher cannot argue that the brings about taking by denying the rancher free use of his property interest in the bear86 the second facet of the governmentwildlife relation governments special duty to manage wildlife for the public good has ancient roots in english common law notwithstanding this factor has played only diffuse role in the federal taking cases the special relationship with wildlife has been given express treatment however in federal cases in which governments have sought to recover monetary damages for the loss of wildlife from pollution87 some have argued for recognition ofcrs19 88 see hoobler taking the endangered species act and the fifth amendment 48 student paper 1991 available from r meltz 89 cappaert v united states 426 us 128 1976 90 tva

supreme court endorsement of wildlife protec tion generally in construing federal wildlifeprotection statutes the high court in recent decades has consistently embraced the more wildlifeprotective of the arguments advanced before it in addition to andrus v allard noted earlier the court held that creation of national monument reserved sufficient water to preserve unique desert fish89 found the jeopardy ban of section 7 as then worded so absolute as to halt an almost complete dam that might endanger listed species90 and upheld the wfhba protecting feral horses and burros on both public and private lands91 at minimum these cases indicate that the court accepts wildlife protection as legitimate governmental objective that can support reasonable interference with private rights iv legislative options though this report deals with law rather than policy we note in broadest of broad outline what seem to be major congressional options for addressing the property rights issue of course this threshhold is reached only if congress finds during reauthorization that the realworld collision between the and landowner aspirations is significant if so the major options are fairly plain option one is to do nothing impliedly embracing the fifthamendment standard of compensation as adequate under this option the landowner remains in the same position under the as under other federal statutes that have figured prominently in the propertyrights debate none of which now provides for extraconstitutional compensation of landowners option two is to leave the substantive species protections unchange d but lower the compensation threshold that is provide monetary relief to offset propertyvalue losses occasioned by the act even where not constitutionally compelled option three is to tinker with how existing mechanisms are administered as by mandating formal evaluations of the privateproper ty implications of agency actions92 or encouraging more aggressive use of the developmental safety valves already in the and option four the most substantively major is to adjust the acts listing or protection standards so as to strike balance more favorable to private property

comprehensively and three were narrowly focussed as follows s 3159 comprehensive bill was introduced by nowretired senator symms mentions of property rights pervade its opening provisions stating for example the policy of congress that federal speciesprotection efforts minimize adverse effects on private property more concretely the bill proposed that regulations not become effective until the issuing agency is certified by the attorney general to be in compliance with the federal taking executive order93 this provision was pareddown version of senator symms s 50 which imposed the same prerequisite on all new federal regulations of potentially seismic impact is the bills declaration that once the judgment fund pays taking judgment against the united states based on agency action under the that agency must reimburse the fund out of agency appropriations partisans of judgment fund reimbursement an idea first floated in 1991 by the bush administration94 typically speak in terms of promoting the fiscal accountability of agencies and greater sensitivity to property rights opponents not surprisingly point to the potential for chilling agency program efforts the other comprehensive bill hr 6134 tauzin offered an array of provisions to ensure that procedures and standards for private landowners are not more burdensome than those applicab to federal agencies most notably the bill sought to aid property owners denied permits under the for economically viable use of their property affording them the right to either have the property bought by the united states at market value or to receive compensation in the amount of the value loss plainly this approach would often mandate compensation even when it was not compelled under the fifth amendment other bills of the 102nd congress were much narrower targetting solely the ratio of costs and benefits resulting from actions hr 3092 hansen would have barred any action the economic benefits of which did not outweigh the economic costs hr 4058 dannemeyer and hr 6123 thomas cal similarly blocked actions whose benefits did not outweigh costs but went further to make explicit that determination of realproperty value losses was to be part of that analysis these bills also demanded federal compensation for economic loss resulting from species being listed as endangered or threatened including any diminishment in the value of tangible or intangible property none of these bills was acted on beyond committee referrals v summary and conclusion it has been said that while property rights are well analyzed in our legal and moral tradition our duties to endangered species both legal and ethical are novel and not universally accepted95crs21 96 id at 283foregoing development of private land that might harm public drinkingwater source is sacrifice most landowners might accept having ones livelihood disrupted in order to preserve an endangered bird is tougher call the endangered species act is visionary and implementing it is forcing seminal rethinking in both law and ethics96 given this ongoing debate and the paltry number of esataking cases prediction of how the act may fare in any future taking litigation might seem premature adding to the difficulty one might well argue is the casebycase nature of taking adjudication and quite pivotal the flexibility with which the fws and nmfs execute their charge despite these question marks one can expect that as with government impacts on property generally the large majority of esacaused impacts are likely to be constitutionally noncompensable to recap why for direct limits on land use under the the property owner has the daunting hurdles of proving ripeness and almost total elimination of economic use on the entire parcel neartotal loss of economic use when considering tract of land as whole may rarely occur under restrictions again assuming agency flexibility for limitations on defending property against animal depredations christy v hodel finds taking and most cases under other federal wildlife statutes hold similarly persuading court to see per taking owing to permanent physical occupation by the harmful animals seems unpromising the only solid prospects for propertyowner compensation may be in narrow special circumstances as when property damage would not have occurred but for government introduction of the species into the area and finally for transactional restraints on species members obtained prior to listing the decisions in andrus and lucas suggest an almost absolute rule against compensation to be sure imponderables could alter this governmentfriendly picture for one thing the supreme courts recent hint that it might qualify its current rule that parcels be viewed as whole could significantly enhance property owners prospects taking might then result from regulatory elimination of use on only portion of ones land but so far recent supreme court decisions favorable to the property owner notwithstanding the court of federal claims has continued to resolve the large majority of taking claims for the united states whether to supplement this constitutional balance between esaprotected wildlife and the property owner through legislation giving added protection to the latter is the question to which the 103rd congress may have to turn
