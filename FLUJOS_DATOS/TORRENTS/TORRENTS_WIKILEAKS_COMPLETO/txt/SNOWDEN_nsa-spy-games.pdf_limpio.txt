of games virtual environments tssi issue we know that terrorists use many featurerich internet communications media for operational purposes such as email voip chat proxies and web forums and it is highly likely they will be making wide use of the many communications features offered by games and virtual environments gve by 2010 the sigint enterprise needs to begin taking action now to plan for collection processing presentation and analysis of these communications with few exceptions nsa cant even recognize the traffic and therefore it is impossible to even say what percentage of the environment is gve let alone determine how targets are using the communications features of gves however gves offer siginthumint opportunity space and more research is needed to figure out effective exploitation ssi gves today allow individuals to gather with likeminded others online many gves offer communications such as private chat p2p group chat chat to an alias and broadcast chat both text and voice also many gves allow convergent technologies to intermingle such as xboxlive which can be run via an xbox360 gaming console andor connect via pc to normal msn chat second life offers the ability to anonymously text to gsm phone sms and soon they will offer anonymous voice calls so that phone numbers do not have to be known by either party and wont show up in collection some gves allow third party interfaces which allow limited functionality from web browser this overcomes obstacles such as highbandwidth requirement and or not being allowed to download software think internet caf√© usage in addition many gves are able to be used via mobile devices connected wirelessly phones handhelds laptops connected to the gves specialized forums and other social networking sites have sprung up to provide an additional place to interact connect or share these sites and any others can be advertised in the gves so that if terrorist web forum has to move locations it can be found by its members again areasgroups can be accessrestricted memberonly they are essentially private meeting places and can be used for planning comms and training etc gves are used for collaboration forterras 3d world is coming to jwics to do this icwide ufouo gves have been made that reinforce prejudices and cultural stereotypes while imparting targeted message or lesson both from the western point of view and in the middle east americas army is us army produced game that is free download from its recruitment page and is acknowledged to be so good at this the army longer needs to use it for recruitment they use it for training the lebanese hizballah has taken this concept and the same basic game design and made its own version of the game called special forces 2 sf2 which its press section acknowledges is used for recruitment and training in order to prepare their youth to fight the enemy radicalizing medium the ultimate goal is to become suicide martyr one cannot discount the fun factor involvedit is important to hold your target audiences attention and makes ingesting the message not even noticeable sf2 features multiplayer online text and voice chat for up to 60 players simultaneously effectively acting like vpn or private chat forum sf2 is offered at 10 copy and so also goes to fund terrorist operations ssi these games offer realistic weapons training what weapon to use against what target what ranges can be achieved even aiming and firing military operations and tactics photorealistic land navigation and terrain familiarization and leadership skills while complete military training is best achieved in person perfection is not always required to accomplish the mission some of the 911 pilots had never flown real plane they had only trained using top secretcomintrel to usa aus can gbr nzl20320108 top secretcomintrel to usa aus can gbr nzl20320108 microsofts flight simulator when the mission is expensive risky or dangerous it is often wiser idea to exercise virtually rather than really blow an operative up assembling bomb or exposing sleeper agent to law enforcement scrutiny militaries around the world use virtual simulators with great success and the hizballah has even hooked up playstation controller to laptop in order to guide some of its real missiles kuma wars is us owned company that offers realistic battle simulation of real battles in iraq usually one month after they actually happened the player can redo maneuvers in lessons learned way for training or you can switch sides and see how it works from the opposite side it also provides real terrain features such as real road signs from real roads in iraq and simulated nightvision goggles environment tssi qaida terrorist target selectors and gve executables have been found associated with xboxlive second life world of warcraft and other gves in pinwale network traffic tao databases and in forensic data other targets include chinese hackers an iranian nuclear scientist hizballah and hamas members gchq has vigorous effort to exploit gves and has produced exploitation modules in xboxlive and world of warcraft after beta testing they expect reporting to begin in april 2008 the fbi cia and the defense humint service all have humint operations in second life and other gves and are very interested in forming deconfliction and tipping group that would be able to collaborate on operations tssi gves are an opportunity we can use games for cne exploits social network analysis humint targeting id tracking photos doc ids shaping activities geolocation of target and collection of comms it has been well documented that terrorists are opsec and tech saavy and are only getting more so over time these applications and their servers however are trusted by their users and makes an connection to another computer on the internet which can then be exploited through target buddylists and interaction found in the gaming and on gaming web sites social networks can be diagramed and previously unknown sigint leads and connections and terrorists cells discovered gves can contain online presence indicators geolocation and id tracking can be gleaned and used in apprehension operations tssi recommendation the amount of gves in the world is growing but the specific ones that ct needs to be methodically discovered and validated only then can we find evidence that gves are being used for operational uses protocol exploitation sfl and tao should begin profiling their databases and the gves for collection and exploitation possibilities open source apstars produced gve lists and selectors should be used to run against utt and other databases to check for cross matches to develop target selectors ct sigdev along with ct topis will study the collected traffic to find and track targets of interest there should be concentrated effort to conduct research into target use of gves and signatures for survey collection should be developed targets and specific apps should be chosen to exploit to ensure that terrorists gvesocial site usage is covered by sigint and the system is not left behind the times all avenues should be taken to develop pes and cne exploits as gves are found on target computers we need to develop viewerdb that allows linguistanalysts to viewexperience voicetextvideo traffic together and archivee the gve data associated with reporting which will also be essential for yahoo skype webcam vtcs and biometrics ssi ct sigdevssg should establish process to deconflict icwide ops in gves and to develop strategy for collaboration members from at least cia fbi dia nsa and gchq should participate to make the coordination significant members should have ability to check tasking traffic and status of current operations
