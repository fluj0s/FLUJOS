federal scheme for the re gulation of employee pension and welfare benefit plans offered by employers1 while erisa does not require an employer to offer pension and welfare benefits it does mandate compliance with its provisions if such benefits are offered congress enacted erisa to eliminate the conflicting and inconsistent regulation of pe nsion and employee welfare be nefit plans by state laws the provisions at issue in the preemption debate are sections 502a and 514a of erisa2 section 514a expressly preempts any and all state laws insofar as they may now or hereafter relate to an employee benefit plan 3 section 502a creates civil enforcement scheme that allows participant or beneficiary of plan to bring civil action for the following reasons to recover benefits due to him

the use of case management and utilization re view case mana gement typically involves third party evaluation of information presen ted by the participant and his doctor8 this evaluation is used to determine the need fo r and type of medical care to be provided utilization review encompasses various techniques including precertification and concurrent review pre certification requires plan par

may recover only the benefits he would have been entitled to under the terms of the plan reasonabl attorneys fees and court costs us supreme court interpretation of erisa preemption the scope and application of eris as preemption provisions have been addressed by the us supreme court in general the court recognizes presumption against preemption unless congress has explicitly or implicitly shown an intent to preempt state laws10 erisa contains an ex plicit preemption clause at section 514a the language of secti on 514a shows that congress intended to preempt any state law that relates to any employee benefit plan11 the court has interpreted this language as applying to any state law that has connection with or reference to such plan12 the court has stated that under this broad common sense meaning state law may relate to benefit plan and thereby be preempted even if the law is not specifically designed to affect such plans or the effect is only indirect13 while the courts early decisions suggested that the application of erisas explicit preemption clause was limitless its decision in new york state conference of blue cross blue shield plans v travelers ins co signaled change in the courts inte rpretation of section 514a in travelers several commercial insurers challenged state law that required them but not blue cross and bl ue shield to pay surcharges14 the commercial insurers argued that the law was preempted by erisa because it related to employersponsored health insurance plans in addressing the issue of erisas preemption clause the court first noted that there is presumption that congress does not intend to supplant state law15 the court then turned to whether congress intended to preempt state law by looking to the structure and purpose of the act16 the court concluded that nothing in the language of the act or the context of its passage indicates that congress chose to displace general health care regulation which historically has been matter of local concern17 in other recent cases thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98286crs4 17 continued travelers 514 us at 656 citations omitted 18 buono v nysailsa medica l and clinical services fund 520

erisa are similar to the preemption provisions of 301 of the labor management and relations act lmra which the court held fell within the excepti on to the wellpleaded complaint rule the court reached its conclusion after reviewing the legislative history and finding express language that erisas provisions should be interpreted in the same manner as 301 taylor 481 us at 6566 23 taylor 481 us at 58court has similarly recognized the states ability to regulate matters of health and safety and has concl uded that state laws of genera l applicability are not necessarily preempted by erisa18 while section 514a provide s federal defense of erisa preemption section 502a implicates the jurisdictional doctrin of complete preemption section 502a identifies how participant or beneficiary ma recover benefits or enforce or clarify rights under the terms of plan the court has reasoned that congress may so completely preempt particular area that any civil complaint raising select group of claims is necessarily federal in character19 under the doctrine of complete preemption state claim that conflicts with federal stat utory scheme may be removed to federal court in the context of erisa complete preemption refers to state claims that duplicate causes of action provided under section 502a in pilot life insurance co v dedeaux the court found that erisa preempted the respondents state common law causes of actions asserting improper processing of claim for benefits unde r an employee benefit plan20 i n metropolitan life insurance co v taylor case decided on the same day as dedeaux the court considered whether the respondents st ate claims were not only preempted by erisa but also displaced by erisas civil enforcement provision to the extent that complaints filed in state courts purporting to plead such state common law causes of action are remova ble to federal court21 after reviewing the language of erisa and its legislative history22 the court in taylor held that state law claims concerni ng benefit plans governed by erisa arise under the laws of the united states and are removable to federal court by the defendants23 consequently the respondents remedies were limited to those provided under erisa rather than the more generous remedies available under state lawhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98286crs5 24 28 usc 1441a 25 taylor 481 us at 63 26 965 f2d 1321 5th cir 1992 cert denied 506 us 1033 1992the procedure for determining whether case will be moved from state court to federal court is governed by secti on 1441a of the federal rules of civil procedure frcp under frcp 1441a any civil action brought in state court may be removed to federal district court if the defendants can s how that the federal district court has original jurisdiction24 courts follow the wellpleaded complaint rule which allows the plaintiff to determine whether an action is heard in state or federal court the plaintiff is able to choose hi s forum because it is long settled law that cause of action arises under federal w only when the plai ntiffs wellpleaded complaint raises issues of federal law25 the fact that the defendants defense arises under federal law is not enoug h to move the case to fede ral court however under the doctrine of complete preemption stat claim may be remove d to federal court if congress has completely preempted particular area the question of removal is important in liability cases against hmos governed by erisa in typical liability case against an hmo the plaintiff files tort claim ie negligence medical malpractice wrongful death personal injury vicarious liability etc in state court the defendant will usually remove the case to federal court and seek dismissal of the state law claims on the ground that such claims are preempted by erisa which provides the only cause of action for the plaintiffs claim as threshold issue the federal district court must determine whether it has jurisdiction over the claim if it does not have jurisdiction it must remand the claim back to state court without considering the defendants motion to dismiss if the court does have jurisd iction over the claim then it will consider the defendants motion to dismiss the plaintiffs state liab ility claims in determining whether the court has jurisdiction over an erisa claim the court will examine whether the plan in question is an erisa plan and if so whether the state w claims are preempted by erisa erisa preemption and managed care plans medical malpractice claims against managed care plans based on utilization review decision in corcoran v united healthcare inc one of the first cases to address the intersection between erisa and state tort claims patient sued her employee disability plan for wrongful death and emotional distress after the death of her unborn child26 the patient belonged to medical assistance plan which contracted with the defendant to conduct cost containment measures united used several cost containment meas ures such as precertifica tion concurrent review and case management the patient was pregnant and her doctor recommended complete bed rest and hospitalization so he could monitor the fetus the patients doctor sought pre certification from united for the hospital stay united denied the request and authorized only ten hours per day for the rvices of home health nurse although the patient entered

on duty the corcorans brought suit in state c ourt and the defendants removed the case to federal court arguing that the corcorans claim was preempted by erisa the defendants also moved to dismiss the corcor ans state tort claims by arguing that their claim concerned the administration of benefits under benefit plan governed by erisa the federal district court agreed to dismiss concluding that the erisa plan was the source of the relationship between the corcorans and the defendants and the corcorans attempt to distinguish uniteds role in paying claims from its role as source of professiona l medical advice was unconvincing27 upon appeal the us court of appeals fo r the fifth circuit considered whether the state law giving parents cause of action for the wrongful death of their child permits negligence suit against third party provider of utilization review services 28 the court reasoned that such suit is possible but could still be preempted by erisa in determining whether fede ral statute preempts state law the court looked initially to the intent of congress in performing this analysis we begin with any statutory language that expresses an in tent to preempt but we look also to the purpose and structure of the statute as whole29 the court found that the express language in erisa as well as the legisl ative history showed congress intent to preempt state laws re lating to erisa plans the next question the court addresse d involved the extent of erisas preemption of state laws that relate to erisa plans the corcorans argued that they were suing under generally applicable state negligence causes of action united maintained that they had not made dical decision but rather decision about what benefits were covered under the health plan the c ourt concluded that united gives medical advice but it does so in th context of making determination about the availability of benefits under the plan30 as such the court found that the corcorans claim was preempted by erisa31 further the court reasoned that the lack of remedy for medical malpracti ce under erisa does not alter the conclusion that erisa preempts state tort claims for administration of benefits under an erisa plan32 with respect to damages the corcoran s argued that under section 502a3 of erisa they were entitled to more than just benefits due under the plan the corcorans contended that they were entitled to extracontractual damages particularlyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98286crs7 33 29 usc 1132a3 34 dukes v us healthcare inc 57 f3d 350 3rd cir 1995 cert denied 516 us 1009 1995 35 tolton v

argument by concluding that benefit plans are guided by principles of trust and contract law because there was trust relationship or contract between united third party in the corcorans benefit plan then extr acontractual damages were recoverable since corcoran several similar lawsuits alleging malpractice have been filed against hmos or other managed care plan s and their physicians some federal circuit courts have found erisa preemption34 while others have found preemption35 medical malpractice claims against hmo and hmo physician based on vicarious liability of hmo in dukes v us healthcare inc the us court of appeals for the third circuit held that erisa does not completely preempt state tort claims for negligence36 the dukes case presented two separate plaintiffs whose claims were consolidated on appeal the first plaintiff cecilia dukes alleged that her husbands death resulted from the failure of the husbands hmo physicians to conduct timely blood test that would have detected an extremely high blood sugar level the second plaintiffs ronald and linda visconti alleged that their daughter was born stillborn because their hmo physi cian ignored mrs viscontis symptoms which indicated serious but treatable dical condition both plaintiffs sued for negligence and medical malpractice in state court against both the hmo and its doctors all of whom were designated pa rticipating physicians under their hmo plan both plaintiffs alleged that the hmo should be held liable under theories of ostensible and actual agency the ostensible and actual agency theory is based on the patients reasonable belief that he or sh is being treated by an employee of the hmo37 both plaintiffs also sued under dir ect negligence claim asserting that the hmo was negligent in selecting training and monitoring the physicians in question the defendants removed both cases to federal court on the grounds that the federal court had jurisdiction over erisa claims the court stated initially that although erisas preemption provisions are extensive they preempt only state laws that fall within the civil enforcement pr ovisions of section 502a1b or claimshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98286crs8 38 dukes 57 f3d at 356 39 dukes 57 f3d at 35657 see also pacificare of oklahoma inc v burrage 59 f3d 151 10th cir 1995 vicarious liability claim against hmo not preempted by erisa 40 the court stated in these cases the defendant hmos play two roles not just one in addition to the utilizationreview role played by united in corcoran the hmos in dukes also arrange for the actual medical treat ment for plan participants only this second role is relevant for this appeal however on the faces of these complaints there is allegation that the hmos somehow should be held liable for any decisions they might have made while acting in their utilizationreview roles stated another way unlike corcoran th ere is allegation here that the hmos denied anyone any benefits that they were due under the plan instead the plaintiffs here are attempting to hold the hmos liable for their role as the arrangers of their decedents medical treatment dukes 57 f3d at 361 41 dukes 57 f3d at 360to recover benefits due under the terms of the plan to enforce rights under the terms of the plan or to clarify righ ts to future benefits under the terms of the plan38 the plaintiffs argued that their claims fell outside of erisas civil enforcement provisions and thus were not preempted they contended that the sole benefit they received was membership in the hmo and they were not contesting their membership us healthcare count ered that the benefit is more than membership in the hmo that the benefit also includes the medical care received by participants the court agreed with us healthcare and found that the benefit to plan participants includes medical care as well as membership in the hmo nonetheless the court concluded that the plaintiffs claims were not preempted by erisa the court stated nothing in the complaints indicates that the plaintiffs are complaining about their erisa welfare plans failure to provide benefits due under the plan instead of claiming that the welfare plans in any way withheld some quantum of plan benefits due the plaintiffs in both cases complain about the low quality of the medical treatment that they actually recei ved and argue that the us healthcare hmo should be held liable under agency and negligence principles we are confident that claim about the quality of benefit received is not claim under 502a1b to recover benefits due under the terms of the plan39 the dukes court distinguished its decision from corcoran by noting that the doctors in dukes were not third party consultants as in corcoran but doctors employed by the hmo to provide dical care to plan participants40 the court was careful to note that the defendant in corcoran had not provided arranged for or supervised the doctors who provide d the actual medical treatment for plan participants but only provided the administrative function of utilization review41 the dukes court went on to hold that claims based on administra tion of benefits plan would be preempted by erisa whereas claims based on the quality of care or actual medical treatment provided w ould not be preempted under section 502a1bhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98286crs9 42 1 fsupp2d 420 dnj 1998 affd in part revd in part sub nom in re us healthcare inc 193 f 3d 151 3rd cir 1999 43 us healthcare 193 f3d at 15556 44 us healthcare 193 f3d at 15657 45 us healthcare 193 f3d at 161 we rejected us healthcares complete preemption arguments in both cases analyzing the gravamen of the complaints we observed that neither one pled state claims falling within the scope of erisas civil enforcement scheme because there was nothing raised regarding failure to provide benefits due under the plan the plaintiffs did not allege that the failure to perform the tests arose in any way from denial of benefits under the erisa plan invo lved rather both complaints asserted claims regarding the quality of the care receivedthe third circuit followed this line of reasoning in bauman v us healthcare 42 in bauman the plaintiffs brought their claim in state court against their doctor hospital and health plan after th death of their daughter the baumans were covered under managed care plan provided by us healthcare the plan pre certified twentyfour hours in the hospita l after birth and mrs bauman was discharged after that time lapsed the next day the baumans daughter fell ill the baumans contacted the doctor for advice nd requested home visit from the plan the doctor did not instruct them to return to the hospital and the plan did not send nurse the baumans daughter died the same day from bacterial infection that developed into meningitis four of the six counts brought by the baumans were against us healthcare count one alleged that the plan was dir ectly liable because its policy directly or indirectly required the twentyfour hour di scharge the baumans also alleged that the plan was vicariously liable for the negligence of its agents in carrying out the policy43 count two alleged that the plan m anifested reckless indifference to the consequence of its policy44 in count five the baumans alleged that the plan negligently adopted the policy to discour age physician from readmitting infants count six alleged that medi cally appropriate care require d an inhome visit which the baumans requested and which was available under their plan but was not received the defendants removed the case to fede ral court asserting erisa preemption the district court remanded counts one tw and five to state court and retained jurisdiction over count six as claim pr operly heard under erisa on appeal the third circuit held that the four counts dealt with the quality of care provided not with quantity and that they should all be remanded to state court as in dukes the court found that section 502 provides only partial preemption to those state law claims that seek to recover benefits due under the term s of the plan to enforce rights under the terms of the plan or to clarify rights to future benefits under the terms of the plan45 the court maintained that the baumans claims were distinguishable because they dealt with the quality of care once it was provided the court found it significant that none of these three counts counts one two and five as pled alleged failure to provide or authorize benefits under the planhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98286crs10 46 us healthcare 193 f3d at 162 47 us healthcare 193 f3d at 164 48 59 f3d 151 10th cir 1996 49 pacificare 59 f3d at 153 50 pacificare 59 f3d at 154 51 danca v

chose to view the claim as state cause of action for violating tort duty to provide the bauman family adequate medical care rather than violation of contractual promise made to them in their erisa plan47 courts that have followed the dukes line of reasoning include the court of appeals for the tenth circuit in pacificare of oklahoma inc v burrage 48 the tenth circuit considered whether erisa preempts claim that an hmo is vicariously liable for alleged malpractice of one of its physicians based on quality of care49 the court held that erisa does not preempt such claim because the claim does not involve the delivery of benefits under the pl an and adjudication of the claim does not require reference to the plan in considering whether the claim related to the employee benefit plan the court stated that as long as state law does not affect th structure the administration or the type of benefits provided by an erisa plan the mere fact that the law has some economic impact on the plan does not re quire that the law be invalidated50 other federal courts have reached the opposite conclusion finding that state claims alleging direct or vicarious liability of hmos are preempted by erisa the first circuit recently held that erisa preempts state action for negligent medical decisionmaking in the course of precertification requirement mandated by an erisa plan51 in seventh circuit case jass v prudential health care plan inc the court concluded that the plaintiffs vicarious liability claims against the hmo based on the negligence of the plain tiffs doctor were preempted by erisa52 the decision in jass may be distinguished from burrage because in burrage the issue of the doctors negligence can be re solved without reference to the benefit plan53 different outcome was reached in jass once the court determined that the doctors negligence is intertwined with the benefits determination because the alleged negligence concerned failure to treat where the plan denied

herdrichs abdomen despite the noti ceable inflammation dr pegram did not order an ultrasound diagnostic procedure at local hospital instead she decided that herdri ch would have to wait eight days for an ultrasound to be performed at facility st affed by the hmo more than fifty miles away during these eight days herdri chs appendix ruptured and she suffered peritonitis erisa requires fiduciaries to discharg their duties with respect to plan solely in the interest of the participants and beneficiaries57 erisa further provides that any person who is fiduciary with respect to plan who breaches any of the responsibilities obligations or duties imposed upon fiduciaries shall be personally liable to make good to such plan any losses to the plan resulting from each such breach and to restore to such plan any profits of such fiduciary which have been made through use of assets of the plan 58 the district court dismisse d herdrichs claim after finding that the hmo did not act as an erisa fiduciary59 the court of appeals for the seventh circuit disagreed it determined that the hmo di d act as an erisa fiduciary and reversed the decision further the seventh circu it maintained that although an incentive program does not automatically give rise to breach of fiduciary duty such program may constitute breach when physicians delay providing necessary treatment or withhold adminis tering proper care to plan participant for the sole purpose of increasing their bonuses60 the supreme court concluded that an hmo does not act as fiduciary when its physicians make mixed eligibility and treatment decisions that is treating physician determines that procedure or condition is either c overed or not covered based on patients diagnosis at comm on law the court reasoned trustees and other fiduciaries make decisions about ssets and property distribution in the sole interest of the beneficiary while hmos that act through their physicians make similar decisions for the provision of healthcare for their participants the court contended that because the physicians bene fit from their decisions to refrain from ordering or providing care they bear only limited resemblance to traditional fiduciaries based on this distinction th court believed that it was unlikely thathttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98286crs12 61 pegram 530 us at 231 62 pegram 530 us at 233 63 pegram 530 us at 235

interest but for good medi cal reasons consequently the court believed that the fi duciary standard would be nothing but the malpractice standard applied in state actions against physicians63 the court concluded that erisa was not enacted to provide federa l fiduciary claim that applied the same standard available under state malpractice law state action numerous states have enacted statutes that provide cause of action to participants in managed care plans who have been harmed by the failure to adhere to duty of care64 rather than attempt to make general state negligence laws applicable to managed care entities these laws create new state causes of action imposing duty of care on these entities65 in general managed care entities and other health insurance carriers in these states are bound by sp ecified duty of care when this duty is breached participants have cause of action against the managed care entities and carriers the cause of action appears to be type of tort action alleging negligence and the breach of the specified duty in any tort action the plaintiff must prove his case by prepondera nce of the evidence to be successful that is plaintiff will prevail if the evidence shows that the fact sought to be proved is more likely than not corporate health insurance v texas department of insurance the texas health care liability act thc which was enacted on may 22

standard when making healthcare treatment decisions s econd it establishes an independent review procedure to determine whether treatment is appropriate and medically necessary third it protects physicians from hmoimposed indemnity clauses and from retaliation by hmos for advocating medically necessary care for their patients aetna challenged the act on the grounds that it was preempted by section 514 of erisa but the us court of appeals for the fifth circuit determined that various provisions of the act are not preempted by erisa67 the fifth circuit concluded that the liability antiindemn ification and anti retaliation provisions of the act are not pr eempted by erisa however the court determined that the inde pendent review provisions are preempted the fifth circuits opinion is disc ussed in detail below the fifth circuit found that the liability provisions impose liability for only limited universe of events68 the provisions do not permit claims based on managed care entitys denial of coverage claims involving coverage decisions in the administration of plan would be preempted by erisa in this case the provisions allow claims based on the neg ligent delivery of medical services and impose vicarious liability on managed care entities for that negligence the fifth circuit maintained that vicarious liability does not relate to providers role as an erisa plan administrator or affect the structure of the plans so as to require preemption69 further the fifth circuit stated that it was not persuaded that congress intended for erisa to supplant the states regulation of the quality of medical practice70 the acts antiindemnification provision prohibits managed care entity from including an indemnification clause in its contracts with doctors and other healthcare providers that would hold it harmless for its own acts71 the antiretaliation provision prohibits managed care entity from refusing to renew doctor or healthcare provider because he advocat ed medically necessary treatment72 aetna argued that these provisions impermissibly mandate the structure and administration of erisa plan benefitshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98286crs14 73 id 74 corporate

not preempted by erisa because they address the qua lity of care provided by the managed care entities and do not compel the entities to provide any substantive level of coverage as health care insurers73 further the fifth circuit contended that the provisions preserve physicians independent judgment in the face of managed care entitys incentiv for cost containment citing pegram the fifth circuit reasoned that the effect of th provisions is consistent with the courts finding that states are currently allowed to impose malpractice liability on hmos for providing incentives74 the fifth circuit found that b ecause the independent review provisions attempt to impose state administrative regime on coverage determinations they are preempted by erisa75 in responding to texas argument that the independent review provisions may be saved by erisa s saving clause for laws that regulate insurance the fifth circuit maintained that the clause does not operate if the state law at issue creates an alternative reme dy for obtaining benefits under an erisa plan76 in this case the independent revi ew provisions establish an alternate mechanism for obtaining benefits under the terms of plan because plan would be bound by the decision of the independent review organization participant could obtain benefit even if he doesnt follo w erisas civil enforcement procedures rush prudential hmo v moran in moran v rush prudential hmo the seventh circuit concluded that an illinois external review stat ute did not conflict with erisas civil enforcement scheme and was saved from preemption by erisa like the fifth circuit the court determined that the statute related to an employee benefit plan the court also found that the statute regula ted insurance and thus was protected by erisas saving clause furt her the court maintained that erisas deemer clause was not applicable because the plan at issue was an insured plan that is offered by an hmo and not selffunded by an employer77 the court relied on the supreme courts interpretation of the deemer clause in fmc corp v holliday 78 in that case the court found that the deemer clause makes clear that if plan is insured state may regulate it indirectly through regulation of its insurer and its insurers insurance contracts79 in this case the plan was offered by rush prudential hmohttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98286crs15 80 moran 230 f3d at 971 81 id 82 536 us 355 2002 in its opinion the s upreme court acknowledged that it granted certiorari to resolve the conflict between the fi fth and seventh circuits while this opinion does not directly address the fifth circuit s opinion regarding preemption of the texas statute it is likely that the independent re view provisions of the texas statute will be recognized as permissible in light of this opinion 83 the mccarranferguson act requires that the business of insurance be subject to state regulation the statute provides with certain exceptions that act of congress shall be construed to invalidate any law enacted by any state for the purpose of regulating the business of insurance 15 usc 1012b 84 see metropolitan life ins v massachusetts 471 us 724 1985 unlike the fifth circuit the seventh circuit found that the illinois external review statute does not create an alternative remedy scheme that conflicts with section 502a of erisa80 although the statute requires an hmo to provide covered service if an indepe ndent reviewing physician determines that the service is medically necessary the court found that the procedure created by the statute is not tantamount to the relief ffered under section 502a81 the court explained that because the provisions of the statute were incorporated into the plaintiffs insurance contract they did not operate as an alte rnative remedy for recovering benefits rather the provisions established an additional internal mechanism for making decisions about when service is medica lly necessary the court appears to have distinguished external review that becomes part of plan because of state statute from external review that is simply mandated by state law on appeal the supreme court affirmed the judgement of the seventh circuit82 the court determined that section 410 of the illinois statute was regulation of the business of insurance and thus saved fro m preemption pursuant to erisas savings clause and the mccarranferguson act83 the court reviewed section 410 against multifactor test used to determine whether state law regulates the business of insurance84 under the multifactor test the court first asked whether with commonsense view the law was specifically directed toward the insurance industry with regard to the illinois statute th court found that despite rushs contrary assertions the statute was di rected at the insurance indus try and did not apply to any other industry the court then consider ed three factors blished under mccarran ferguson to determine whether the illinoi s statute should be saved from preemption state law would not be subj ect to preemption if it 1 has the effect of transferring or spreading risk 2 if it is an integral part of the policy relationship between the insurer and the insured or 3 if it is limited to entities within the insurance industry the court noted that the factors were guide posts and that state law is not required to satisfy all three to survive preemption applying the three factors to the illinois statute the court determined that the sec ond and third factors we re clearly satisfied recognizing that the statute could likely be saved from preemption under mccarranferguson rush also argued that preemption was appropriate b ecausehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98286crs16 85 see pilot life ins co v dedeaux 481 us 41 1987 86 id at 57

ound to be preempted in pilot life ins co v dedeaux 85 in pilot life the court found that erisa preem pted participants claim for damages because the claim constituted an alternative remedy outside the limited scope of remedies congre ss provided for in erisa86 the court distinguished the illinois statute from the remedy sought in pilot life and other cases finding that the illinois statute merely prescribes state regulatory scheme that provides new cause of action under state law and authoriz new form of ultimate relief the court also rejected rushs argument that independent review was an alternative scheme of arbitral adjudicati on and thus in conf lict with congress intent to confine dispute resolution under erisa to the courts in dismissing rushs argument the court noted that the state scheme was si gnificantly different from arbitration and was actually closer to mandate for second opinion rather than arbitration aetna health inc v davila in aetna health inc v davila participant and beneficiary of erisaregulated employee benefit plans suffered injuries allegedly arising from plan administrators decisions not to provide coverage for medication and an extended hospital stay recommended by the re spondents treating physicians87 rather than appealing the deci sion asking court for preliminary injunction or purchasing tr eatment and seeking reimbur sement one respondent took an alternative medication fro m which he allegedly suffere d severe reaction and the other respondent experienced postsurgery complications after being discharged the respondents sued their plan administr ators for failure to exercise ordinary care in the handling of coverage decisions in violation of duty imposed by the thcla the petitioners removed the cases to federal district court arguing that the respondents causes of action were comp letely preempted by section 502a of erisa the district court agreed and th respondents appealed the fifth circuit consolidated their cases along with seve ral others and found that the respondents claims under the thcla were not preempt ed by erisa the supreme court granted certiorari and held that the respondents claims under the thcla were completely preempted by section 502a1 b and should be removed to federal court the court determined that if an indivi dual brings suit complaining of denial of coverage for medical care where the individual is entitled to such coverage only because of the terms of an erisaregulated employee benefit plan and where legal duty state or federal independent of erisa is violated the suit falls within the scope of section 502a1b in davila the court found that the duty imposed by the thcla on managed care entities to exercise ordinary care when making health care treatment decisions did not arise independent of erisa or the plan terms in thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98286crs17 88 see texas civ prac rem code 88002respondents cases88 the respondents brought suit to rectify wrongful denial of benefits promised under erisa regulated plans not to reme dy violation of legal duty independent of erisa thus the court found that the causes of action fell within the scope of section 502a1b were therefore completely preempted and were removable to federal court
