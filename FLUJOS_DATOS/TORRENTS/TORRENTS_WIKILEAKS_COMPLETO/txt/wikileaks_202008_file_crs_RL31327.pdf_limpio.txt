despite the surge in customers singing up for internet banking in the aftermath of the 911 attacks on new york and washington and the anthrax scare that followed internet banking is not growing as fast as expected before or after the attacks main reason is consumer confidence in and familiarity with the paperbased payment methods of cash and checks many smaller banking institutions viewed the prospect of internet banking as providing opportunities to expand their services beyond their brick and mortar establishments and compete with larger banks but the fixed cost of establishing transaction internet sites is having greater impact on the bottom lines of smaller banks to overcome this problem internet bankers might be waiting until they have critical mass of users before imposing or raising the user fees on this channel to banking services as they did with automated teller machines atms congress and regulators have been moving rapidly to set up regulations and oversight to protect consumers from the new risks internet banking has introduced the grammleachbliley act of 1999 pl 106102 and the electronic signatures in global and national commerce act of 2000 pl 106229 both address regulatory issues pertaining to electronic banking since the 911 attacks congress passed the usa patriot act 10756 that makes it easier for law enforcement to monitor internet

term internet banking refers to conducting banking business over the internet depository institutions use this channel to offer their customers range of services that very widely among institutions the services offered include examining balances transferring funds between accounts applying for credit making electronic bill payments and bill presentations where payees send their bills via the internet to payers bank which pays them some also offer insurance and brokerage services in addition business internet banking enables businesses to apply for loans initiate wire transfers and use cash management and payroll services over the internet most depository institutions conducting internet banking are depository institutions with physical offices but some internet bankers are webbased internet only banks1 internetonly banks are also called virtual banks at the heart of these virtual banks are computer servers that may or may not be located at the legal address of the virtual bank virtual banks take deposits and make payments primarily through automatic teller machines and through the mail in the mid1990s internet banking supplanted but did not eliminate personal computer pc banking where the banks proprietar software resides on each customers pc and business is conducted over private networks pc banking provides basic banking and billpaying services but relies heavily on the us postal service for the delivery of many payment checks in contrast internet banking relies heavily on epay which electronically transfers money directly into the accounts of the payees in other depository institutions through electronic networks internet banking however also uses the mail to deliver payments when an institution uses checks instead of paying electronically pc banking is more costly than internet banking for the depository institutions and their customers because it requires maintaining costly proprietary network infrastructure of hardware and software by contrast some of the internet banking infrastructure is in the freely accessible public domain which accounts for its lower costs relative to pc bankinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31327crs2 2 jeremy quittner internetonly

the internet however internet banking has made some depository institutions especially smaller ones less profitable and half of the internet bankingonly banks have gone out of business2 september 2000 study conducted by the office of comptroller of the currency occ concluded that five banks account for about 36 of internet bank users most banks that offer internet banking are currently serving relatively small share of their customer base in late 1999 about 5 million households used online banking these customers had been expected to grow to about 32 million by the end of 2002 onethird of the 93 million households with banking relationship these predictions have been revised downward in 2000 just 6 of banking transactions were done online bankers now expect the same rate for 2001 having earlier projected 9 for 20013 in the aftermath of the 911 attacks it is estimated and the anthrax scare it was estimated that there were about 75 million internet banking customers whether people are anxious about cross contaminated mail or about delays that could result in late mortgage and creditcard payments more customers are turning to online banks4 however most banking transactions continue to be conducted at branches through the mail by telephone or over the automated teller machine atm networks bank costs banking via world wide web sites offers deposito ry institutions and their customers advantages over traditional banking to customers the convenience of accessing their financial information 24 hours day has strong appeal the institutions benefit from cost savings that occur when customers perform the transactions without tellers or telephone representatives driven on by the reported low variable cost many smaller banking institutions saw internet banking as an opportunity to expand services beyond brick and mortar establishments to compete with larger banks according to one variable cost estimate branch banking cost about 107 per transactions telephone cost about 055 per transaction atm banking cost about 027 per transaction and internet banking cost about 01 per transaction5 however there are also disadvantages for the depository institutions there are the fixed costs of building infrastructures of hardware software and personnel designing an internet banking web site costs on average around 25000 but

slower than expected for the customers internet banking offers fewer opportunities for personal interaction with banking personnel and places more responsibilities on the customer which some customers clearly do not want customers are responsible for the physical security of computers personal identification numbers and the accuracy of transaction entry7 consumers are increasingly concerned about identity theft and depository institutions privacy policy8 most consumers are concerned that hackers may break into computers servers and get their personal information and account numbers according to consumer reports once hackers have your social security number and date of birth both of which may be attached to your bank account they can open credit cards in your name run up bills and wreak havoc with your financial life fortunately security breaches have been rare9 even so the concern has prevented bank customers from banking online internet banking costs may discourage potential customers the monthly fees for basic internet banking services run from free to 1000 in the consumer reports sample of 15 internet banking providers10 basic service enables the customer to check account balances and transfer funds between accounts in addition minimum required account balances vary from none to 3000 and the monthly costs can be higher for additional services such as billpaying services in the case of bank of america there is monthly fee of 500 for the basic service and an additional 595 fee for billpaying services for other internet bank customers the price of some services are on per transaction basis there are other reasons for consumer resistance to using internet banking the number one reason for customers who signed up for online banking but stop using it is that it was too complicated27 the second reason was that they were dissatisfied with services25 of those discontinued users in the surveyed 52 gave these two reasons for having stopped using online banking

those who have stopped using this channel of banking services the paperbased are still preferred dominant reason for the slow growth of internet banking is the satisfaction of the public with the paperba sed methods of payments in 2000 approximately 70 of total consumer transactions used paperbased methods of payments of cash and checks payments by check are first in terms of value and second only to cash in terms of the number of transactions and almost half of all consumer expenditure payments were made by checks in 200012 according to federal reserve study nearly 50 billion transactions in 2000 involved checks with value totaling 47 trillion13 some analysts argue that banking customers prefer checks because the float enables the payer to earn interest income while the check is being cleared and settled but there are other important reasons for the popularity of checks checks offer the users greater flexibility and control of payment initiation legal standing user familiarity and an automatic receipt in the form of canceled check together these characteristics probably explain the dominance of checks over more efficient methods of payment like credit cards and internet banking cash is preferred and more efficient particularly for small purchases for small payments cash is the only method that requires promises to pay or confirmation of payment internet payments involve costs of confirming payments even though they are small in most cases sometimes they are quite high in terms of time and bank fees for these reasons internet banking is not expected to replace significant part of paperbased payments system in the near future internet banking profitability is below expectations bankers are discovering that developing and maintaining transaction internet web site is more costly than expected in light of slower than expected customer acceptance14 these costs have had severe impact on some smaller banks offering internet banking smaller brick and mortar

unprofitable15 however some smaller banks offering internet banking have been able to generate sufficient revenues from fee income on other banking business lines to overcome their high expenses the lower than expected profitability is the direct result of greater than expected expenses to install online banking applications in addition internet banking customers are not as selfsufficient as anticipated the result is that while the infrastructure expenses are higher than expected the variable costs exceed expectations as well internet banking customers still want contact with human beings while conducting banking over the internet installing internet banking was expected to cut back bank operating personnel hours and to produce significant savings instead internet banking has extended banking hours around the clock always on and increased expenses such as hiring ebanking specialists whose duties include visiting customers who might need instructions in paying bills online16 internetonly banks are in difficulty virtual or internetonly banks have been racking up losses for so many years that some owners have had to close their doors many industry analysts and observers predict continuation of the consolidation wave and do not expect the bulk of the estimated 50 internetonly banks in the united states to survive the next three to five years17 analysts believe that internet bank customers need branches where customers can speak to representatives about complicated transactions such as mortgages without offices internetonly banks for example have to pay for the use of other banks atms similarly on the other side of the balance sheet because internetonly banks offer better interest rates on deposits than the competition they attract less reliable and less profitable customers who are shopping only for the best rates and are uninterested in longterm banking relationship under strangling costs many internetonly banks have consolidated with brick and mortar banks that offer online services for example wingspancom was folded into bank one after tremendous losses and citigroup ultimately terminated citi fi as an internetonly bank because of losses the surviving internetonly banks like etrade bank have found niche for themsel ves etrade bank offers brokerage customers financial products that complement its parent company etrade groups an

oct 1996 pp 673 99large banks internet banking profitability is unclear for the larger banks the correlation between profitability and internet banking is not clear the unprofitability of new smaller internetonly banks is linked to the cost of providing internet banking large banking institutions have not released information on their different banking activities nor can the information be easily derived from the consolidated data they release some analysts believe that internet banking has also had negative impact on some large commercial banks profits however revenues from other profit centers overwhelm their losses on internet banking the critical mass problem both the benefits and the costs of using internet banking depend on the number of users because internet banking is conducted over the world wide web network it is subject to network externalities network externalities arise when the benefit consumer expects to receive from good or service depends on the number of consumers using the good or service the fax machine is the classic example if only one business owned fax the machine would have practical value the existence of second machine would increase the benefits to the first machines owner by activating the potential for sending and receiving faxes each additional fax installation in different location would increase the benefits to existing users the benefits to new fax machine purchaser would depend on the number of machines already installed this interdependency of demand means that the market for network goods such as internet banking services must meet minimum size before the network can break even or achieve sustainable equilibrium this minimum size of the network is called critical mass18 the problem this concept poses for internet banking providers and all networks is that it is not very helpful in determining the size of the market after the beforehand unknown critical mass is reached market dynamics usually change considerably the market for internet banking might grow slowly until reaching critical mass and then suddenly begin expanding at very rapid rate an example to illustrate this market behavior is the credit card market in the 1960s and 1970s the growth rate of the credit card market was slow but began growing very rapidly in the 1980s and 1990s another example is electronic funds transfer at pointofsale terminals which are currently at almost every major supermarket checkout counter this method of payment grew very slowly up to the 1990s when it took off without knowing the size of the market internet banking providers are unable to determine their share of the market and thus unable to determine the optimal internet banking capacity needed bankers dont believe internet banking has reached its critical mass with only roughly 6 of bank customers using internet banking however they are not able to forecast the size of the internet banking market at critical mass or after critical mass is reached banking analysts believe that once critical mass is reached the upfront fixedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31327crs7 19 when atms were first introduced there were fees for using other banks atms to encourage widespread usage it was in the mid1990s when atms became very popular that banks began imposing fees for using foreign atms other banks atms consumer advocates accused the banking industry of exploiting consumers with these feescosts including infrastructure security and regulatory compliance costs will be distributed over larger number of customers and the variable costs per internet banking transaction will be negligible these analysts argue that banks are planning to recoup their losses in the long term when they are expected to raise the price of providing internet banking services this strategy is the same as what the industry used with their automated teller machines depository institutions first offered atm services free or below cost to build customer use to critical level and then imposed fees19 customers accustomed to using atms continued to use them despite the greater cost the same strategy is expected eventually to make internet banking major profit center regulatory policy congress and federal regulatory agencies congress has left it to the federal regulatory agencies to make sure that electronic financial transactions are in compliance with regulations governing traditional paperbased transactions however as illustrated by number of congressional hearings concerning the internet and internet banking congress has relied on its oversight responsibilities to monitor developments congress has passed only two laws that are significantly related to internet banking the grammleachbliley act of 1999 pl 106102 requires federal regulators to issue guidelines to ensure that electronic banking activities are conducted in keeping with safety and soundness regulations the regulatory agencies were able to issue these guidelines by january 2001 the electronic signatures in global and national commerce act of 2000 pl 106229 provides that contract signature or record may be denied legally binding status only because it is in electronic form it also placed similar disclosure requirements on electronic banking as there are on paperbased payments congress is expected to continue to monitor regulatory developments under its oversight responsibilities the regulatory agencies stance in certain respects the federal regulatory stance toward electronic financial transactions meets the expectations of neither consumers nor the banking industry on one hand the regulatory stance is not to interfere with the introduction of new technologi because electronic banking regulations could stifle such innovations by locking the banking industry into fewer beneficial technologies on the other hand federal and state regulatory agencies have developed procedures and examinations for internet banking that are costly for internet bankers to comply with as fed chairman alan greenspan stated if we wish to foster financial innovation we must be careful not impose rules that inhibit it i am especially concerned that we not attempt to impede unduly our newest innovation electronic money or more generally our increasingly broad electronic payments system tohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31327crs8 20 remarks at the us treasury conference

to establishing uniform requirements procedures and capabilities when introducing new technologies for internet banking an example of standard would be the number and type of identifications required to enter an internet banking account and the kinds of transactions that customer is allowed conduct within that account 22 paul allan schott the new basle risk principles for electronic banking electronic banking law and commerce report july aug 2001 p 9develop new forms of payment the private sector will need the flexibility to experiment without broad interference by government20 however some analysts interpret this stance as waitandsee policy allowing the industry to do what it wants regulators they argue should be more proactive in helping consumers make choices among new technologies through which banking services are being offered neither individual consumers nor consumer advocacy organizations have the resources to participate in all the standardsetting projects now underway21 without input on behalf of consumers in standardsetting projects genuine consumer preferences may not be taken into account consumers look to the regulators to intervene on their behalf before new forms of electronic banking are introduced some argue that regulators sensitivity to consumers could lessen consumer resistance to changes in the us electronic payments infrastructure risk management regulators are concerned about the new risks that accompany internet banking the bank for international settlements bis has published special risk management guidelines for banks and the regulators who supervise providers of internet banking22 the overarching concern for banks offering internet banking is security control which begins with authentication and access to privileged financial data security breach can lead to significant losses in short period of time because of the dynamic environment in which internet banking activities take place internet banking providers have greater risk exposure than traditional banking because internet banking providers are more reliant on third party services for many banks third parties supply the expertise and technologies that run the daytoday internet banking operations operational risks of fraud exist and technical problems can lead to costly bottlenecks and result in significant losses and inconvenience for customers consequently the central theme of the bis guidelines is that the boards and senior management of depository institutions should not permit an institution to engage in electronic banking activities unless it has the necessary expertise to provide competent risk management oversight httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31327crs9 23 sullivan p 12regulatory examination of internet banking operations federal and state regulatory agencies have developed examination procedures to protect internet banking consumers against these risks but these procedures tend to increase compliance costs the aim of these examination procedures is to determine whether the depository institutions have taken steps to control risk in internet banking and whether the institutions are in compliance with relevant laws and regulations because higherskilled employees are necessary to keep an institution in regulatory compliance regulatory compliance in internet banking is often more financially burdensome than traditional banking internet banking examinations are conducted by bank examiners and information technology specialists who evaluate institutions safety and soundness within risk assessment framework this framework includes determination whether the compliance management program in the depository institutions has been updated to control the compliance risks of internet banking to illustrate internet banking if newly implemented or significantly changed since the last examination is reviewed in the following subject areas23 broad oversight and strategic planning appropriate policies and procedures adequate internal controls including internal and external audits attention to the unique security issues on electronic banking due diligence and oversight of vendors and outsourcing arrangements reporting systems that allow monitoring of electronic banking activity and personnel with acceptable knowledge and technical skills in addition consumer compliance specialists examine depository institutions web site for compliance with regulations for example the advertisement terminology must be consistent with truth in savings and truth in lending requirements while the costs of regulatory compliance are not the major costs driving depository institutions losses from their internet banking activities they are factor moreover the expense to institutions is not enough to prevent regulators from making sure that internet banking providers are in compliance with appropriate laws and regulations in the past the banking industry has asked congress for regulatory relief for traditional banking activities because the cost of compliance is high according to some bankers the cost of compliance for internet banking is several times higher than traditional banking despite the regulatory compliance and other costs analysts believe that the internet bankers strategy is focused on increasing internet banking customers to develop critical mass according to that interpret ation the full costs of internet banking would then be capitalized after this critical mass was reached even if it required charging those customers additional fees
