ligations under the vienna convention on consular relations vccr4 which provides certain privileges and immunities to foreign consular missions this report provides background and summary of the provisions of the vccr relevant to the issuance of consular ids by foreign missions the report briefly analyzes possible conflicts between th obligations of the united states under the vccr and some of the potential means of addressing the security issues associated with the matricula consular and similar ids the vienna convention on consular relations the institution of consuls began centuries ago as product of international commerce in modern times stat countries establish consul ates in major foreign cities to represent their interests to the local authorities in certain matters including issues concerning trade and navigation and to perfo rm services for nationals of the sending state the vccr was completed in 1963 as multilateral treaty to codify consular practices that developed through customar international law nd numerous bilateral treaties most states including the united states and mexico5 have ratified the vccr and the united states has re lied increasingly on it as the pr incipal basis for the conduct of its consular activities6 the vccr enumerates basic legal rights and duties of signatory states including inter alia 1 the establishment and conduct of cons ular relations by mutual consent and 2 the privileges and immunities of consular officers and offices from the laws of the receiving state the country where the foreign consular office has been established if the receiving state fails to honor the priv ileges and immunities afforded to the sending state the state that has established cons ular office in the recei ving state under the vccr the sending

passport for us citizens abroad and at times occasionally issues similar identity cards or travel documents see hearings supra note 2 statement of roberta s jacobson acting deputy assistant secretary of state for the bureau of western hemisphere affairs it is unclear how reciprocity would operate where the receivi ng states foreign missions do not perform the consular function abroad that it seeks to restri ct at home if reciprocity is limited to actions affecting the same consular function the united states would be subject to retaliation only in states where us missions issue consular ids to us nationals however it may be that an aggrieved state could restrict some other c onsular function to proportionate degree for example in the event the that secretary of stat suspended the issuance of visas to nationals of sending state as penalty for its issuance of c onsular ids to persons who have not been legally admitted into the united states that state could reciprocate by suspending visas to us nationals 8 vccr art 431 consular officers are immune from judicial or administrative procedure with respect to any activity they carry out as part of their official consular du ties but not for private conduct consular official may be immune fro m suit for conduct that violates law as long as the act qualifies as discretionary consular function see risk v halvorsen 936 f2d 393 9th

usissued bordercrossing cards see 2 c gordon et immigration law procedure 12044 2002 14 see mexican consulate for houston supra note 13 15 when foreign national is arrested in the receiv ing state it is obligated to notify the nationals foreign consulate upon the nationals request vccr art 36 according to the us department of state because foreign consular identifica tion card is means to identify an individual as foreign national bearers possession of this card can alert responsible law enforcement authorities to the need to provide consular notification see hearings supra note 2 at 114 statement of roberta jacobson 16 vccr art 551convention lists among legitima consular functions 1 issuing passports and travel documents to nationals of the sending stat and visas or appropriate documents to persons wishing to travel to the sending state 2 protecting in the receiving state the interests of the sending state within the limits permitted by international law and 3 helping and assisting nationa ls of the sending state11 while the vccr explic itly provides that certain other consular functions may be limited by the laws and regulations of the receiving state it does not provi for any limitation on these key functions12 although consular id is not passport some states may recognize it as travel document that makes it easier for nationals to travel back to the sending state for example the mexican consul ate for houston texas include s on its web page message from the mexican ministry of foreign affairs stating if you are mexican citizen and wishes sic to travel to mexico mexican pass port is not necessary you may apply for consular id matricula13 additionally it may be argued that consular ids serve legitimate consular function of the sending state in assisting its nationals the mexican consulate for example argues that the matricula consular will enable mexican nationals to obtain banking accounts in the us so as to provide more secure way to handlemoney and f acilitate its transf er to mexico14 consular ids may also assist the sending states foreign consulate in identifyi ng monitoring and coming to the aid of its nationals within the receiving state15 accordingly states might object that us efforts to regulate the issuance of consular ids interfere with legitimate consular functions and may view such regulations as infringing on their sovereignty on the other hand the vccr obligates consul ar officers not to interfere in the internal affairs of the receiving state16 and requires that cons ular premises not behttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21627crs5 17 id art 552 18 see b sen diplomat s handbook of international law and practice 287 3d ed 1988 noting that some conventions contain excep tions for police to enter the consular premises in an emergency or pursuant to court order 19 see id at 28889 noting the inviolability of consular archives is one of the few that is universally recognized consular archives include all the papers documents correspondence books films tapes and registers of the consular post together with the ciphers and codes the cardindexes and any article of furniture intended for their protection or safekeeping vccr art 11kused in any manner incompatible with the exercise of consular functions17 it may be argued that the issuance of consular ids to persons residing in the united states knowing they may be used in part for purposes othe r than consular notification and provision of consular benefits potentially impacts the recei ving state beyond the scope of customary consular functions constituting an internal interference pponents of consular ids argue that providing assistance in manner known to facilitate the stay of unlawful aliens is not consular function intended to be protected by the vccr however the vccr does not distinguish among foreign nationals based on their immigration status and does not impose on consulates duty to take action to prevent or report their nationals entering or remaining in the receiving state unlawfully inviolability of consular premises and documents the principle of inviolability of consular premises is recognized in many treaties regarding consular relations although some provi for certain exceptions18 article 31 of the vccr states that any part of the consular premises which is used exclusively for consular work shall be inviolable to the authorities of the r eceiving state absent authorization from the sending states representatives under this provision us inspectors would not be able to enter consular premises to conduct inspections without the consent of the sending state the principle of inviolability of consular archives is even more firmly established as part of customary international law19 the vccr codifies this rule at article 33 which states that all consular archives and documents shall be inviolable at all times and wherever they may be foreign consuls would appear to be within their rights to refuse access to their premises and archives to llow the inspection and auditing of records related to the issuance of consular ids on the other hand sending state could choose to enter into an agreement with the united states to make these documents available or to otherwise satisfy the secretary of state that the identification cards do not pose threat to the united states obligation to honor consular identification cards while the vccr may obligate receiving state to allow foreign c onsular offices to exercise their legitimate consular functions the c onvention does not place limitations upon states ability to adopt domestic laws limiting the effects that consular functions might have upon the states internal affairs thus although the vccr provides that consular offices are privileged to issue passports and travel documents to nationals intending to travel to other states there is concomitant obligation upon other states to allow foreign nationals with these documents to enter their countries or to live or remain there contrary to law accordingly legislation limitin g the acceptance of consular ids by us entities is lesshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21627crs6 20 though not an issue under the vccr domestic legal concern might arise as to how broadly congress can regulate the acceptance of consul ar ids by state local and private entities 21 vccr art 722b 22 pl 10913 division blikely to raise concerns regarding the vccr than legislation limiting foreign consular offices ability to issue ids to nationals residing within the united states20 the vccr does not prohibit the united states from enacting laws that impose different standards for the domestic acceptance of identification cards issued by different states article 72 of the vccr requires only that states do not discriminate in their treatment of other states in the application of the provisi ons of theconvention the vccr would not seem to require the united states to recognize or afford equal benefits to all holders of consular ids regardless of the state that issued them the vccr permits states to grant additional rights to certain countries above and beyond convention provisions without violating the conve ntions nondiscrimin ation requirements21 thus legislation restricting the accep tance of certain consular id s by us entities would likely raise fewer concerns regarding vccr obligations than legislation directly regulating the issuance of cards by foreign missions howe ver states that desire to improve the usefulness of such documents to their nationals may be willing to satisfy us security concerns by mutual arrangement which w ould not contravene any provisions of the vccr recent legislative action number of legislative proposals have been introduced in the 109th congress that would restrict the acceptance but not the issuance of consular ids by us institutions section 2023b the real id act22 enacted may 11 2005 prohibits us states when issuing drivers licenses or state id cards from accepting for purposes of personal identification foreign documents other than valid passports if such state drivers licenses or id cards are to be accepted for federal purposes other recent legislative proposals aimed at restricting the acceptance of consul ar ids include 503 of hr 688 the safer act which was introduced by representa tive j gresham barrett on february 9 2005 and generally limits federal acceptance of foreign identification documents for identification purposes hr 815 the financial customer identification verification improvement act which was introduced by representative scott garrett on february 15 2005 and prohibits us fi nancial institutions from accep ting foreign identification documents other than valid passports for purpos of verifying an applicants identity and hr 925 the identification integr ity act of 2005 which was introduced by representative elton gallegly on february 17 2005 and generally prohibits federal acceptance of foreign identification documents other than valid passports for any official purpose
