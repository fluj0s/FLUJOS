services and longterm care for certain lowincome populations including nearly 63 million individuals in fy2008 combined federal and state spending currently exceeds 300 billion each year it is the largest or secondlargest item in state budgets and is second only to medicare in terms of federal spending on health care during 2007 and 2008 the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms the federal agency that administers medicaid issued number of regulations for this program seven regulations were the subject of considerable controversy in the 110th congress each of these regulations to differing degrees would limit payments for certain services andor affect payments to providers as per the supplemental appropriations act 2008 pl 110252 section 7001 six of these seven rules are currently under congressional moratorium preventing further administrative action until april 1 2009 see table 1 the seventh rule affecting outpatient hospital services was published as final rule in the federal register on november 7 2008 and will become effective absent any congressional action on december 8 2008

doctors in teaching hospitals and other teaching programs historically medicare and most medicaid programs have recognized two components of gme costs 1 direct graduate medical education or dgme eg resident salaries teaching supervision and 2 indirect graduate medical education or ime eg higher patient care costs because of additional tests ordered by residents cms argued that gme payments are not authorized in medicaid statute are not included in the list of services considered to be medical assistance and are not recognized in the medicaid statute as component of the costs of hospital care the proposed rule would eliminate federal reimbursement for both dgme and ime under medicai d the rule would also change the way in which the medicaid upper payment limit for hospital services is calculated which would further reduce the federal share of medicaid costs for hospitals opponents argued that the rule represents reversal of longstanding medicaid policy that there are references to gme payments in both medicaid statute and regulations that gme payments have previously been explicitly recognized by cms and that the statute is broadly drafted and even accompanying regulations do not itemize every element of reimbursable costs for more details see crs report rs22842 medicaid and graduate medical education by elicia j herz and sibyl tilson

finance the nonfederal share of medicaid costs certain igts are specifically allowed for funding the state share of program costs eg local units of governments such as counties may contribute to the state share of medicaid costs current federal law protects the ability of states to use funds derived from state or local taxes and transferred or certified by units of government within state some states have instituted programs where all or portions of the medicaid state share is paid by hospitals or nursing homes that 1 are public providers but not units of government or 2 are units of government but the state share is returned to the provider sometimes through inflated medicaid payments the purpose of such financing arrangements is generally to draw down additional federal matching funds for which state share may not otherwise be available m httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34764g15g142g141g146g140g138g146g141g561g20g142g144g158g149g138g157 g152g155g162g561g11g156g156g158g142g156g561

for financing portion of medicaid costs imposes limit on medicaid reimbursements for governmentowned hospitals and other institutional providers and requires certain providers to retain all of their medicaid reimbursements the rule also establishes documentation requirements to substantiate that governmental entity is making certified public expenditure cpe when contributing to the state share of medicaid costs opponents of the rule argued that cms overstepped its authority to limit igts when congress explicitly allows such transfers governors expressed fear that the rule would inappropriately shift costs to states at time when some states were facing difficult fiscal situations in addition to the moratorium on further administrative action on this rule federal court held in may 2008 that the rule had been improperly promulgated and remanded the rule back to cms for further action alameda county medicaid center v leavitt 559 f3d 1 ddc 2008 however the moratorium prohibits cm s from taking any action through the promulgation of regulation issuance of regulatory guidance or other administrative action with regard to the proposed and final rules prior to april 1 2009 for more

states over the last two decades to help pay for the costs of the medicaid program under these funding methods states collect funds through taxes or other means from providers and pay the money back to those providers as medicaid payments and claim the federal matching share of those payments states are essentially borrowing their required state matching amounts from the providers once the state share has been netted out the federal matching funds claimed may be used to raise provider payment rates to fund other portions of the medicaid program or for other nonmedicaid purposes such taxes are required to meet number of federal laws and regulations some of which have been in flux recently cms issued final rule that would 1 revise the threshold for determining if tax program is required to undergo test to determine whether provider is being held harmless for the tax payment and clarify use of the term revenues 2 clarify standards for determining the existence of hold harmless arrangement 3 codify one class of health care services permissible for establishing health care provider taxes and 4 remove obsolete language opponents of this rule expressed concern that it reduces consistency and clarity that its changes exceed the secretarys authority and that it would impede states ability to condition medicaid reimbursements on payment of required taxes for more details see

range of treatments designed to reduce physical or mental disability or restore eligible beneficiaries to their best possible functional levels both the executive and legislative branches have addressed this benefit for example in recent annual budget submissions the bush administration proposed administrative changes to reduce medicaid rehabilitation expenditures congressional and executive branch oversight organizations have documented inconsistent policy guidance and states practices for claiming federal matching funds that failed to comply with medicaid rules the current proposed rule was intended to more clearly define the scope of the rehabilitation benefit and identify services that could be claimed as rehabilitation under medicaid opponents of this rule are concerned that it creates new administrative barriers and restricts access by tightening the definition of rehabilitation others argue this rule could reduce key funding stream for communitybased

refers to case management for specific beneficiary groups or for individuals who reside in statedesignated geographic areas the bush administration proposed legislative changes to reduce medicaid tcm expenditures in recent annual budget submissions in the deficit reduction act of 2005 dra pl 109171 congress added new statutory language to both clarify and narrow the definition of case management and directed the secretary of hhs to issue regulations to guide states claims for federal matching dollars for tcm proposed rule was issued which became final in march 2008 all medicaid authorities related to all case management services including tcm and services delivered through waivers are subject to this rule it also directly addresses case management issues that previously might have been considered open to interpretation opponents of this rule argue that it is more restrictive than congress intended in dra and would result in cuts to tcm services since alternatives to medicaid funding are scare in addition the new administrative requirements and complexities of the rule may increase state costs while decreasing provider participation and beneficiaries access to quality medical care

of accepting funds under the indivi duals with disabilities education act idea public schools must provide special education and related services necessary for children with disabilities to benefit from public education generally states can finance only portion of these costs with federal idea funds medicaid can cover idea required healthrelated services for enrolled children as well as related administrative activities according to federal investigations and congressional hearings medicaid payments to schools have sometimes been improper to address these problems cms issued final rule that restricts federal medicaid payments for schoolbased administrative activities eg outreach service coordination referrals performed by school employees or contractors nd for certain transportation services eg from home to school and back for certain schoolage children opponents of this rule argue that it will reduce the availability of and access to needed health care for children is inconsistent with decades of approved state plan amendments allowing federal funding of these administrative and transportation services and falsely assumes that health care administrative activities performed by school personnel are inconsistent with the proper and efficient administration of the state medicaid plan because such activities improve childrens health reduce inappropriate medical care utilization and thus ultimately save money for more details see crs report rs22397 medicaid and schools by elicia j herz

in satellite facilities states use number of different reimbursement methods for different types of services provided in oph departments and clinics the proposed and final rules issued by the bush administration would limit the definition and scope of medicaid outpatient services in hospital facility hospital clinic or rural health clinic to include only those facility services 1 that medicare pays for under its outpatient prospective payment system opps or is recognized by medicare as an oph service under an alternate payment methodology 2 provided by an outpatient hospital facility including only those entities that meet standards for providerbased status as department of an outpatient hospital as defined in medicare rules and 3 not covered under the scope of any other medicaid benefit category opponents of this provision of the rule argue that it would exclude many of the costs that states now consider in calculating certain supplemental payments to qualifying hospitals called disproportionate share or dsh payments which would in turn limit such dsh payments to these hospitals in addition this provision would exclude federal matching funds for oph programs that provide required diagnostic and treatment services for persons under age 21 that may not be covered under medicare others argued that because the oph rule incorporates the new definition of hospital categories adopted in the final rule regarding cost limits on government providers described above this rule violated the moratorium on implementing any provision of the rule on cost limits for government providers on the other hand given this moratorium cms elected to exclude from its final oph services rule the proposed regulatory language delineating methods for demonstrating compliance with the upper payment limit for medicaid oph and clinic services provided in privately operated facilities currently there is congressional moratorium on this final rule without other legislative action this rule will become effective on december 8 2008 for more details see crs report rs22852 medicaid and outpatient hospital services by elicia j herz and sibyl tilson

the next administration may wish to change some or all of these medicaid regulations for final rules that have already been published in the federal register the only avenue for changing or rescinding such rules is through the rulemaking process the administrative procedure act apa defines rulemaking to include the process for amending or repealing rule1 section 553 of the apa establishes the general procedures that an agency must follow when promulgating and thus when amending or repealing rule2 agencies must publish notice of proposed rulemaking provide an opportunity for the public to submit comments and publish final rule and general statement of basis and purpose in the federal register not less than 30 days before its effective date 3 the apa permits agencies to forego notice and comment and to make rule effective immediately under the good cause exception in 5 usc 553 however an agencys use of the good cause exception is subject to judicial review for the six regulations currently under the congressional moratorium either before or after april 1 2009 when the existing moratorium ends and both the final rules and the interim final rule would become effective the agency could decide to use the noticeandcomment rulemaking 1 5 usc 5515 2 homemakers north shore inc v bowen 832 f2d 408 413 7th cir 1987 3 5 usc 553

the noticeandcomment process to amend or repeal the outpatient hospital services rule not subject to this moratorium that will become effective on december 8 2008 agencies possess inherent authority to amend or repeal their rules4 an interested party may also petition for the amendment or repeal of rule pursuant to 5 usc 553e5 an agency may decide to amend or repeal an existing regulation for wide variety of reasons ranging from change in administration to change in the statutory or regulatory environment to determination on the part of the agency that different standard is preferable6 rule modifications are subject to substantive review by the courts in motor vehicle mfrs assn v state farm mutual ins co which addressed the rescission of rule put in place by the carter administration the supreme court established that heightened scrutiny is required in instances where an agency has abruptly changed settled course of agency action depending on the scope and impact of the modification of the rule an agency changing its course by rescinding rule is obligated to supply reasoned analysis for the change 7 however change in an agencys settled course of action is not fatal to the rule if reasoned analysis is provided as the supreme court said in natl cable telecomms assn v brand x internet servs unexplained inconsistency is at most reason for holding an interpretation to be an arbitrary and capricious change from agency practice under the apa8 the court went on to cite both changed factual circumstances and change in administrations as events that could lead an agency to reverse its previous policy where the agencys policy change may still receive deference from reviewing court9 additionally the next administration could issue memorandum or other document directing the agency to not enforce the rules or to temporarily suspend the rules as incoming presidential administrations have done soon after they assumed office however rules suspension itself constitutes rulemaking under the apa therefore it is axiomatic that suspending agency is required to comply with the apas notice and comment procedures in implementing stay 10

enforcement of the rules or take other measures through the appropriations process11 if the next administration were to change final or interim final rule through administrative action eg issue new modified rule it would not be legally required to come up with an offset in the fy2010 budget however the recent historical practice is that both the clinton and bush administrations required agencies to propose administrative actions and pay for such actions in their hhs budget proposals eg corresponding savings appeared elsewhere in the budget this was also required outside the process of developing budget the congressional review act cra permits the us of expedited procedures in the senate to disapprove agencies final rules the cra requires that agencies submit all final rules to congress before they take effect if congress adjourns its annual session sine die less than 60 legislative days in the house of representatives or 60 session days in the senate after rule is submitted to it then the rule is carried over to the next session of congress and is subject to possible disapproval during that session final rules published after may 2008 may be able to be addressed by the 111 th congress via the cra among the seven medicaid rules described in this report the cra would apply only to the final rule on outpatient hospital services congress could also enact legislation
