from the library for the family to watch over the weekends these movies were varieg ated in emiles own words anything from toshiro mifune humphrey bogart bruce lee charlie chaplin to some swashbuckling sinbadesque figure over the years emiles interest in east asia had caused him to gravitate towards asiandirected films these films were to cover the spectru m from tsai mingliang art house fare on one hand to wong jings wonderful comm ercial garbage on the other to all other interesting stuff in between but after discovering cinematheque robarts librar ys film collection discount

particular those that reflect its history and socio political culture remain for this festival coordinator personal touchstone something whic h emile considers point of reference as well as constant point of return
