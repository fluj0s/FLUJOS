characteristics or development challenges operational plans would design countryspecific aid programs to meet those challenges the fy2008 budget request has been developed by joint state department and usaid teams to provide better coordination and coherence while the current restructuring requires legislative action it raises number of questions with regard to the management of foreign aid programs funding levels and reform options that will confront the 110 th congress supporters argue that it is long overdue reform of fragmented and uncoordinated assistance programs that will focus aid on strategic objectives and make programs more accountable some critics contend that its piecemeal approach will not result in comprehensive reform others fear that it will politicize aid programs

transformational development initiative that seeks to use foreign assistance to transform recipient countries economic development paths with the goal of graduating countries from us assistance 2004 usaid white paper defined transformational development as going beyond traditional focus on raising living standards and reducing poverty it would transform countries through far reaching fundamental changes in institutions of governance human capacity and economic structure that enable country to sustain further economic and social progress without depending on foreign aid 2 in addition to promoting transformational development the same paper identified four further challenges to which us assistance programs are designed to respond strengthening fragile states providing humanitarian relief supporting us geostrategic interests and mitigating global and transnational ills the concept of transformational development already has been applied by the millennium challenge corporation mcc which manages another bush administration foreign aid initiative that rewards best performing countries through competitive process measuring achievements in the areas of governance economic policies and social programs also announced at about the same time was related transformational diplomacy initiative that will reposition diplomats to critical emerging areas enhance language and regional skills and emphasize outreach to foreign populations in this new environment of seeking transformational change in recipient countries through both development and diplomacy secretary rice has argued for better coordination and policy coherence of us assistance programs with an emphasis on both shortterm and longterm strategic goals at the country and global level secretary rice contends that the dfa position will accomplish those goals both initiatives signal more prominent role for foreign aid after the terrorist attacks of september 11 2001 and the beginning of the gl obal

undemocratic governments are considered permissive environments for terrorism and criminal activities under such doctrine foreign aid has come to be seen as tool to promote national security in

missions to develop coordinated us foreign assistance strategy and to direct transformation of foreign assistance to achieve the presidents transformational development goals 4 as both the usaid administrator and the dfa tobias serves at the level equivalent to deputy secretary reporting directly to the secretary of state usaid is and remains an independent agency under the restructuring while it is considered independent the administrator reports to and serves under the foreign policy guidance of the secretary of state in testimony before the house foreign operations appropriations subcommittee on april 26 2006 administrator tobias identified number of challenges that he has begun to address among those challenges are planning and budgeting process that is fragmented among numerous departments and agencies duplication of programs poor accountability and the lack of linkage between strategic objectives and implementation the dfa has authority over foreign assistance programs managed by usaid and the state department in addition the dfa will provide guidance for foreign assistance delivered through other government agencies some like the millennium challenge corporation mcc the peace corps and treasury departmentmanaged international financial institutions and debt policy activities are funded through foreign policy budget accounts others are managed and funded through defense department nd domestic agency appropriations with the increasing number of domestic policy agencies involved in foreign aid programs as well as the department of defenses growing role in reconstruction and stabilization work the actual percentage may be lower when looking at calendar year 2005 disbursements of just the state department and usaid their percentage of the total us foreign aid budget is about 53 or 13 billion in the same year the defense department disbursed roughly 24 mainly for reconstruction work in iraq and afghanistan that was funded in the fy2004 supplemental other departments and agencies disbursed about 56 billion or 22 of total official development assistance 5 as the size of foreign aid budgets and the number of operational agencies have

other foreign policyrelated agencies providing foreign assistance whose funds are not managed by the state department including the millennium challenge corporation the peace corps the department of treasury and the trade and development agency at his usaid confirmation hearing on march 7 2006 before the senate foreign relations committee ambassador tobias said that the dfa would have responsibility for all foreign aid funding accounts over which secretary rice mainta ins authority and that the secretary would delegate her authority to the dfa 6 nevertheless it appears from statements made by other administration officials that the state department s office of the global aids coordinator will not be under the dfas control it is also unclear as to the relationship between the dfa and states office of the coordinator for reconstruction and stabilization7 table 1 lists the programs over which the dfa will have responsibility as well as those that may at least initially remain outside of his portfolio programs under his direction total about 15 billion in fy2006 and requested 156 billion in fy2007 an additional 4 billion in fy2006 and 65 billion in fy2007 for state

dfa will be able to guide and coordinate the programs of entities falling outside the state department and us aid has not been fully articulated and is likely to be one of the most difficult challenges faced by the new director ambassador tobias said at his confirmation hearing that he hoped to put in place formal process for achieving the dfas mandate of coordinating across the

administrator tobias has taken two steps to accomplish his mission of providing better coordination of programs and to develop an overall strategy for us foreign assistance the first involves organizational measures to address fragmented planning and budgeting process the second involves potential changes in programs and implementation to achieve transformational development while the second could very well involve number of other departments and agencies that provide foreign assistance recent tobias statements indicate that his initial focus will be on coordinating usaid and state department programs g17g155g144g138g151g146g163g138g157g146g152g151g138g149g561g20g142g143g152g155g150g561 prior to the creation of the dfa office separate offices within state and usaid maintained independent budgeting and planning activities resulting in possible duplication and lack of coordination the dfa office has drawn strategic budget and program planning staff from both state and usaid the size of the office will range from 80 to 100 staff with approximately 25 from the state departments bureau of resource and management and the office of special initiatives the remaining staff will come from usaid the centralized planning and budgeting operation is designed to provide coherence and coordination and to reduce duplication among programs it is also proposed as better way to ensure easier tracking of foreign assistance problem that congress has urged usaid to solve the new office is overseeing the development by usaid missions of fy2007 operational plans for each country this initial focus will be on usaid programs but the plan envisions that 67 countries will have fy2007 operational plans that include all us foreign assistance resources operational plans are to indicate the funding levels for various activities as well as performance measures plans are to be reviewed in washingt on for consistency with us foreign policy goals before funds are allocated the timetable is to have operational plans for every country with usaid mission by january 2007 g18g155g152g144g155g138g150g150g138g157g146g140g561g20g142g143g152g155g150g561 the second of tobias proposed reforms includes the recently unveiled strategic framework that establishes objectives for us foreign assistance and goals and performance indicators for recipient countries the framework links transformational development goals with funding sources and activities tobias describes the framework as roadmap to establish goals and performance measurements and to guide country teams in defining activities that will achieve those goals the framework is being used as the basis for integrated budget planning for state and usaid beginning with the fy2008 budget request

firstrebuilding countries would include postconflict states such as afghanistan haiti sudan iraq and somalia transforming counties would include low and wermiddle income countries that meet mcc performance criteria the category of sustaining partnership countries would include higher income countries with which the united states maintains economic trade and security relationships beyond foreign aid restrictive countries would include authoritarian governments most of which are ineligible for us aid programs in these countries operate through non governmental organizations or through entities outside the country the fifth category developing countrieswould include low and wermiddle income countries that are not yet meeting mcc performance criteria sixth category encompasses global or regional programs that transcend any one countrys borders or are addressed outside of country strategy each category represents common challenges around which aid programs would be designed and coordinated while the list of countries in each category has not been released it is conceivable that some recipient countries might object to their categorization particularly if they face more than one challenge to development for example some could argue that colombia is post conflict state while others would make the case that it is either transforming or strategic partner the framework includes five aid objectives around which programs are to be designed peace and security governing justly and democratically investing in people economic growth and humanitarian assistance country teams would make recommendations on countryspecific aid programs critics of the framework have expressed concern that categorizing countries will result in unidimensional programs when development problems are often multidimensional others fear that the framework is focused on strategic objectives to the neglect of poverty alleviation which they contend is the underlying cause for instability still others believe that the restructuring advantages shortterm strategic approach over longterm development perspective the administration counters that the framework is fl exible enough to deal with any number of development issues country may have further poverty reduction was recently incorporated as one of the end goals of aid in response to criticism about its initial omission they also contend that reaching shortterm strategic goals will assist in longterm development g22g145g142g561g8g27g344g342g342g350g561g4g158g141g144g142g157g561 the dfa is overseeing the process of developing

late 1993 the administration submitted to congress the peace prosperity and democracy act ppda bill that included many ideas that arose during the wharton review congress raised concerns over proposals to increase presidential flexibility in managing foreign aid programs and to consolidate funds into more narrow set of appropriation accounts focused on strategic objectives as articulated by the executive branch while the house passed modified version of the ppda the bill stalled in the senate and was not resubmitted by the administration in the 104 th congress

agency usia the arms control and disarmament agency acda and usaid and consolidate their operations within th state department after three years of debate congress enacted legislation in 1998 division g of pl 105277 transferring usia and acda into state but retaining usaid as an independent agency the legislation however further required that the usaid administrator report to and serve under the

restructuring initiative has been applauded by many as marking the beginning of what they perceive as long overdue effort to reform cumbersome and fragmented us foreign assistance program some supporters of the plan however believe it does not go far enough and that the administration is missing an opportunity for launching much bolder and necessary reform effort some critics have expressed strong concern that the new initiative may lead to greater degree of aid politicization and that usaid will be further marginalized as key maker of us development policy as currently envisioned congress will not have direct role in the restructuring although key congressional committees are likely to maintain close oversight as the plan moves forward the first formal opportunity for the 110 th congress to review the restructuring plan will be in february 2007 when the fy2008 budget is submitted to congress it is likely that request to reprogram fy2007 funds to reflect the new strategic

secretary rice has argued that more coordination and coherence is needed in foreign assistance programs in order to meet transformational development goals with some 18 foreign aid accounts in both the state department and us aid appropriations and numerous other programs scattered throughout other government agencies secretary rice has not been the first to observe that the us foreign aid apparatus is cumbersome and lends itself to inefficiency and redundancy number of programs have similar or identical purposes but management is split between usaid and state it is unclear at this point how much authority the dfa will have to coordinate activities and what effect better coordination will have on funding levels for example counternarcotics and democracy programs are shared between usaid nd state questions have been raised as to whether better coordination will produce efficiencies reduce redundancy and result in more effective programs it is also unclear how much authority the dfa will have over state department offices that are not formally part of his portfolio for example the presidents emergency plan for aids relief pepfar admini stered by the global aids coordinator is httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33491g20g142g156g157g155g158g140g157g158g155g146g151g144g561g23g495g21g495g561g8g152g155g142g146g144g151 g561g3g146g141 g561 g561

also reports directly to the secretary of state while the director of foreign assistance has been granted authority over state department and usaid aid programs number of other foreign aid agencies remain outside the scope of the directors responsibility as mentioned earlier the largest is the millennium challenge corporation but several others like the peace corps the overseas private investment corporation and the trade and development agency maintain smaller but important aid activities in addition the treasury department is responsible for us participation in the world bank and number of other international financial institutions it is unclear how the dfa will provide guidance to these types of programs in light of his mission to develop coordinated us foreign assistance strategy governmentwide there is also concern that if truly coordinated foreign assistance strategy is achieved countries that are not considered prime candidates for transformational development but who nonetheless are in need will see their assistance reduced in favor of those countries that are moving in the right direction

some critics of the restructuring fear that longterm development and poverty reduction goals the traditional concern of usaid will be overwhelmed by the demands of shorterterm strategic considerations often of high priority for the state department the need to balance these often competing objectives will be challenging some observers have argued that usaid has lost considerable influence in past years due to the separation of policy and implementation in which the state department as the stronger agency has gained significant authority over policy examples include creating coordinators at state to oversee aid programs in eastern europe and the former soviet union shifting primary responsibility over international hivaids programs from usaid to the global aids coordinator at the department and dividing democracy promotion activities between the two agencies ot hers fear that the role of usaid missions is being diminished in favor of washingtonbased planning process the future of usaid is unclear at this juncture those who believe in usaids traditional mission of promoting longterm development fear that the agency will be relegated to position of solely implementing programs rather than shaping development policy secretary rice and other senior administration officials however co ntend that the reconfiguration will strengthen usaids role and status since the dfa will also serve as usaid administrator they argue usaid will more likely participate in the policy and budget decisionmaking process to greater extent than at present at his confirmation hearing ambassador tobias noted that difficulty faced by his predecessor at usaid andrew nats ios was the time consumed negotiating with state department officials over whom the admini strator had authority this would longer be the case he argued since the dfa would have such authority 12

deputy secretary of state or undersecretary for foreign aid also planned but eventually dropped was proposal to restructure the current appropriation accounts this option would have required extensive review and ultimate approval by congress administration officials have said that the current restructuring effort is only the first step in more expansive reform of foreign aid suggesting that issues considered but dropped may be part of subsequent initiative perhaps in the 110th congress but number of observers note that piecemeal approach to comprehensively reorienting us foreign aid is particularly difficult especially in the final two years of an administration they argue that the state department should have aimed for much broader plan consulted with congress throughout the review process and presented complete legislative package for congressional approval this year g5g152g151g144g155g142g156g156g146g152g151g138g149g561g18g155g146g152g155g146g157g146g142g156g561 even previous to the current aid restructuring some observers have asserted that congressional earmarks hamper the administrations flexibility to respond to changing world events and to prioritize aid objectives congress regularly exercises its prerogative to direct funds to certain countries and for certain objectives in the annual foreign operations appropriation bills that in many cases differ from the administrations budget request because the initial framework is being implemented within existing appropriation accounts and without legislation that would restructure foreign ai d in general it is possible that congressional priorities may not completely correspond to the strategic framework as developed by the dfa for example the fy2007 foreign operations bill reported by the senate appropriations committee srept 109277 contains numerous direct ives with regard to the level of funding for programs and activities as well as recipient countries the senate bill restructures some accounts consolidating several programs into 1 billion democracy fund and putting all health related programs into the child survival and health account the housepassed bill hr 5522hrept 109486 creates trade capacity enhancement fund that totals 522 million how congressional priorities will be reflected in th framework and in the fy2008 appropriations bills is challenge congress and
