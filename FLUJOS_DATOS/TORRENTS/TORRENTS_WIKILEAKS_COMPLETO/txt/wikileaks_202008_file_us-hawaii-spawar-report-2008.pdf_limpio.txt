infrastructure site survey report of the pacific missile range facility for the office on naval research presented by space and naval warfare sy stems center san diego pacific cr4isr department code 5223 pearl city hawaii 8 august 2008 2 executive summary the space and naval warfare systems center san diego pacific c4isr department in pearl harbor spawar hawaii conducted the s ite survey at the pacific missile range facility pmrf in june 2008 to identify infrastructure improvements which could support data collection during the upcoming phase ii of the base protection laboratory bpl project three areas were identified th at would benefit the bpl dditional infrastructure to support phase ii sensors along majors bay ad ditional equipment in the pmrf dispatch office to accommodate sensors at majors bay and to exchange data with the bpl and additional equipment at port allen to achieve 100 coverage and to leverage off of existing cameras implementing these recommendations will have the following benefits the phase ii contractor will be able to install new sensors quickly and easily realistic security data will be collected during phase ii existing phase i sensors can be used operationally permitting continuous data collection cooperation between the onr bpl and pmrf base security personnel will improve security on the base transition of bpl systems to pmrf upon completion of the project will be simplified since they will be properl integrated into pmrf operations high value use of fy08 funds the strategy to execute this work with fy08 funds involves pmrf navfac using the existing pmrf bos contract for the constructio n of the outside plant infrastructure such as sensor poles ac power and buried fiber optics spawar hawaii will design the equipment integration and will utilize existing contracts for procurement and installation the ability for pmrf navfac to obligate fy08 funds and to execu the construction with these funds is the key to the success of this effort the ability for spawar to obligate fy08 funds and to execute procurement and installation with those funds is also key to this effort the criteria for success of this project are that the infrastructu re will be in place so that the phase ii contractor will be able to qui ckly and easily field additional sensors along majors bay phase i sensors will be avai lable for pmrf operational use and existing port allen sensors will be avai lable for the phase ii contractor 3introduction this report presents the findings of site survey conducted on the pacific missile range facility pmrf and port allen for additiona l infrastructure to support phase ii of the base protection laboratory bpl project on kauai hawaii see fig 1a and 1b it provides recommendations for bu ilding that infrastructure an d an acquisition strategy for using fy08 funds responsibilities co sts and schedule are also provided figure 1a pmrf main base and port allen figure 1b pmrf majors bay main gate 4background phase i of the bpl project tablished the bpl in building 282 on pmrf the project installed various sensors s ee fig 2 at numerous sites on the base using wireless networks for communications and solar panels for power and developed behavior analysis software such as the blackboar d while the existing sensor sites were strategically sited they lack the ability to collect real life data in actual security situations also since the data is only fed to the bpl it is only collected during periods of active research furthermore the bandwidth of the wireless communications limits video transmissions and the solar power panels are vulnerable to hurricanes which is recognized condition on pmrf figure 2 typical bpl sensors on pmrf recent discussions with pmrf personnel have raised an opportunity for the bpl to partner with base security policy changes have increased public access to majors bay popular fishing and surfing beach on the base while this improves relations with the offbase community it also complicates th control of restricted access to nearby operational areas traditional security measures such as fences and lighting cannot be used due to environmental concerns for the cal wildlife and for the pristine beaches if the bpl project were to inst all security cameras or other sensors along majors bay the base security department could monitor the area and record data 24 hours day seven days week that data repr esenting reallife behavioral patterns in real security situation would be available to the bpl the bases security cameras and intrusion tection systems ids are monitored at the pmrf security dispatch office in building 358 see fig 3a the office hosts systems such as digital video recorders video motion detection processors dispatch radios video switches and video displays see fig 3b in addition to mo nitoring the new sensors at majors bay the dispatch office could also monitor the existing bpl sensors to track visitors route from the main gate to the parking lot at the bay this would allow for continuous collection from ot her bpl sensors as well 5 figure 3a dispatch office figure 3b typical cctv cameras lastly the dispatch office already monitors alarms and video from port allen state owned small boat harbor 20 miles from pmrf see fig 4 port allen operates several recovery boats to retrieve dr ones and targets from the open ocean for the live firing range to the north and west of kauai the ids and video systems at port allen monitor the pier for intruders and re port alarms and video to the dispat ch office over leased t1 line figure 4 port allen and image of pier site survey spawar hawaii conducted the site survey at pmrf from 3 through 6 june 2008 with representatives from onr midpac pmrf ops pmrf base communications pmrf base security and pmrf navfac areas surveyed include majors bay and the surrounding parking lot and cottage areas th pmrf security dispatch office in building 358 and the port allen pier summary of findings majors bay there are two restricted areas of concer n the boresight tower near the parking lot and the runway at the north end of th bay the parking lot picnic area and beach cottages lay between the boresight tower and the runway see fig 5a b and c port allen 6 the areas that require surveillance are the parking lot and the beach from the parking lot to the runway the beach at majors bay is partially viewed from the existing sensors in the parking lot three additional sensor locations would provide continuous c overage from the beach and parking lot to the runway existing power and signal in frastructure is nearby pmrf navfac has indicated that archeological and environmental native birds concerns are manageable figure 5a map of pmrf bpl points of interest figure 5b majors bay figure 5c majors bay parking lot dispatch office the dispatch office hosts video proce ssing distribution recording and display subsystems the equipment is located in the operations room which is near parking lot cottages runway bird sanctuar ymajors bay bore site tower 7capacity the systems are sized to suppor t the current array of ids alarms and video cameras video from existing pmrf cameras are r ecorded digitally and routed via the video switching matrix to the display s ubsystem the video distribution system will need to be altered so that th signals are available to the bpl additional channels for video distribution recording and detection are required to support the bpl video display system is at maximum capacity see fig 6 the bpl video will need to be integrated into th existing display subsystem additional space for equipment has been identified in storage room adjacent to the operations room power and air c onditioning are adequate see fig 7 in order to avoid network cer tifications and additional firewalls to isolate the bpl network from the pmrf networks all vi deo signals will be passed in video format this configuration will ensure th highest quality video available to the bpl for processing other security sensors in pmrf are associ ated with local alarm panels and do not terminate directly in the dispatch offi ce these alarm panels report to the ids server and are forwarded to the dispatchers client workstation figure 6 asbuilt video distribution diagram 8 figure 7 dispatch office and storage room floor plan 9port allen the ids for port allen uses object vide processors with four existing fixed cctv cameras all processing and storage are done at the pier only the alarm signals and composite view of the four cameras are passed back to the dispatch office on pmrf the recorded video can be viewed from the dispatch office via remote workstation walktest of the pier demonstrated that the existing cameras cover approximately 98 of the pier see fig 8 the areas just outside the vehicle and pe destrian gates are not covered the bpl requires one additional camera to cover these areas the ids composite video and viewing wo rkstation between port allen and the dispatch office are connected via network link on leased t1 circuit the circuit is fully loaded see fig 9 sending video from port allen to the bp l will require minor equipment upgrades and additional leased bandwidth space power and air conditioning are adequate state of hawaii approval for historical preservation is required to add one camera to view the pier gates spawar hawaii has experience with this approval for the four existing cameras figure 8 port allen harbor walk test 10 figure 9 port allen asbuilt block diagram existing bpl phase i the existing sites have variety of sens ors including license plate cameras rfid sensors cctv day and night camer as and seismic sensors the communication paths from each sensor site are primarily 24ghz wireless links with 49 ghz wireless links for the backbone to the bpl the existing sensor sites are powered by batteries char ged by solar cells see fig 10 pmrf navfac has indicated that the exis ting sensor sites listed below are too far from the existing infrastructure to c onsider for connection under this task see fig 11 the sites which were considered were existing site main housing gate existing site b majors bay entrance road existing site c majors bay parking lot entrance existing site d kinikini ditch the bpl is not connected to dispatch office see fig 12 11 figure 10 existing phase i sensors figure 11 existi ng sites b c d figure 12 current infra structure configuration 12recommendations majors bay bpl surveillance along majors bay would provi reallife data along navy beach with the added benefit of improving pmrf base s ecurity the video would be recorded and processed in the dispatch office and forwar ded to the bpl this would allow for continuous data collection and would transi tion to pmrf easily upon completion of the research project build the infrastructure for the phase ii contractor at three sensor sites for complete surveillance of the beac h and parking lot to the runway each site includes permanent pole with ac power and fiber optic connection the phase ii contractor will install cameras or other sensors 1 build infrastructure for at three sites along majors bay see appendices and b for the scope of work for the construc tion and communications infrastructure locations are see fig 13 new site 1 majors bay pa rking lot south corner new site 2 officers cabin new site 3 beach cabins b provide pole approximately 20 feet hi gh to mount the future sensors ie cctv cameras see fig 10 c provide 120vac power to each pole with di sconnect at the base of the pole the anticipated current draw should not exceed 7 amps at each pole d coordinate and acquire environmenta l approvalsmonitoring as required 2 build communications infrastructure for th three additional sensor sites the next bpl contractor will be able to quickly and easily install sensors at these locations along majors bay 3 extend fiber optics from the existing pmrf fiber optic cable plant to the three new sites 13 figure 13 majors bay new sites 1 2 3 figure 14 new 20ft pole new site 1 new site 2 new site 3 14 dispatch office the pmrf security dispatch office is th hub for pmrfs base security and atfp video these reallife video feeds from st rategically placed cameras are continuously available and may be useful to the bpl examples of camera views include the main gate north beach boundary south beach boundary the air traffic control tower and port allen cooperation between pmrf base security and the bpl will enhance base security and make more video available to the bpl see fig 15 it will also allow continuous data collection by the bpl if sens ors are monitored by base security the dispatch office should be outfitted to receiv additional video signals from majors bay from port allen and from existing phase i cameras via video distribution subsystem at the bpl see fig 16 the dispatch office should also be outfitted to forward video signals to the bpl see fig 17 all of this can be accomplished with the addition of video recording distribution an d processing equipment see fig 18 the proposed enhancement at the dispatch center consider s the capacities of th existing extron video switching matrix crestron controller vide display bank kvm switch dvr channels existing base fiber plant and the bandwidth limitation to port allen 1 add fiber optic modems dvrs and vide processors to accommodate video signals from majors bay and from port allen 2 add fiber optic modems to pass vide signals to and from the bpl 3 integrate new video signals into the video display subsystem 4 utilize space identified in the adjacent storage room as required figure 15proposed infrastructure configuration 15 figure 16 block diagram majors baydispatch office integration figure 17 equipment require d for proposed configuration 16port allen bpl surveillance at port allen would provide the capability to collect reallife data on operating navy pier leverage off of exis ting cctv cameras which provide excellent coverage of the pier and add one fixed cam era to view the gates see fig 19a 19b and 19c improve video distribution and networ k connections to send good quality video to the dispatch office where the bpl can access the data the video is already recorded for security operations and would be available to the bpl for conti nuous data collection 1 add one fixed cctv camera to view the vehicle gate and pedestrian gate see fig 19a 2 acquire state of hawaii historical pr eservation approval to mount the camera 3 add video distribution and increase netw ork capacity to pass video to pmrf dispatch office 4 add two leased t1 circuits between po rt allen and the pmrf dispatch office figure 18a new camera on port allen pier 17 figure 18b block diagra m proposed port allen figure 18c port allen equipment list 18 existing bpl phase i bpl phase i sensors can be routed to the dispatch office via the bpl in building 282 for example video signals can be transmitted via existing fiber optics between the two buildings the blackboard terminal can also be duplicated in the dispatch office over existing fiber optics the distances from th bpl existing sensor sites to the existing infrastructure are too great to connect permanent power and fiber optics within the given timeframe for fy08 funds for now the bp l will need to work with the bandwidth limitations and susceptibility to high winds figure 19 block diagram bpl phase 1 integration 19special considerations memorandum of agreement between onr and pmrf will establish mutual sharing of security sensor data and base infrastructure it w ill establish majors bay and port allen as additional data acquis ition sites it will also address om training and spares for the additions to the dispatch office and to port allen environmental considerations along majors bay include shearwater nesting areas and ancient burial sites historical preservation approval at port allen uninterrupted security operations when the bpl is deactivated data passed between the bpl and the secu rity dispatch offi ce will be in video format to maintain separation of th bpl and pmrf security networks security operations will take preceden ce over bpl research when resources are shared 20acquisition strategy the strategy to accomplish the objectives is dr iven by the availability of funds and the need to obligate those funds in fy08 add itional funds in fy09 will be required for pmrf navfac and for spawar to tinue contract oversight in fy09 construction pmrf navfac will plan and design the facilities infrastructure and will execute with the existing pmrf bos contract with inhouse environmental support the effort will be designbuild contract an optional approach for construc tion contracting is for pmrf navfac to use an existing multiple award contract mac to obligate funds in fy08 then execute in fy09 the construction co sts are to be determined along with the schedule for funding obligation nd execution at later time electronics spawar hawaii will plan and design the electr onics infrastructure inhouse and will execute with support from existing it c ontracts for equipment procurement and installation the electronics costs for engi neering equipment and installation on majors bay and the dispatch office is 215000 the ectronics costs for port allen is 110k the total is 325000 with the schedules shown below for funding obligation and execution dispatch office majors bay schedule money
