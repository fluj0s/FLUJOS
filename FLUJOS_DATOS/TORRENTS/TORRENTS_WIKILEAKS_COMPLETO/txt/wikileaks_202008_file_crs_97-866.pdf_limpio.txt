1 dissatisfied with the sc ope of the first report the senate now proposes s econd report tr report 2 further background several high ranking military officers have warned congre ss about serious readiness challenges since 1992 some in congress have likened the current situation to that of the postvietnam era of the late seventies when nearterm readiness for somewhat different reasons dropped dangerously low 10 since 1992 greater shares of declining defense budgets have been used to meet these readiness challenges ov er the past five years dod has reduced procurement spending by about twothirds which has made room in the budget for robust funding for training mainte nance quality of life and other components of nearterm readiness 11 this has prompted additiona l concerns however that force modernization is being undermin ed and that future force r eadiness could be in jeopardy senator john mccain has conc luded that savings within the readiness accounts should be explored and has proposed the tiering system of current readiness force structure to pay for additional modernization12 dod has asserted howev er that estimated annual savings of only about 100 million would creat force that could not meet major theater war deployment timelines and that such tiering would significantly increase risk at the gain of only modest savings while limiting the flexibility required to execute current war plans13 the flexibility to respond to wide range of deterrence conflict prevention and peacetime activitie s as well as major theater war are all missions tasks and strategic

operational activities as team effort units are tasked according to their capability form of tiering occurs through these very specific taskingsthe house and senate versions of the fy1998 defense authorization act approach tiered readiness differently the house p rohibits implementati on and requires the secretary of defense to justify to cong ress why dod would move to such system 15 the senate on the other nd requires dod to followup on the onetime report required in the fy1997 law noting that the first repor t left number of issues unresolved16 although there was further specific criti of tr report 1 the senate is now recommending more expansive exploration in tr report 217 according to the senates language second re port must focus on qdr force structure the implied logic is that the first report predated and therefore neglected to consider the breadth of changes within the qdr s 936 would also require second report to look 1 at lower operational levels eg brigad battalion and squadron 2 at rotational scheme that matches and subsequen tly tiers army and marine corps divisions as well as air force navy and marine corps air wings and 3 at all operations and ma intenance activity that would be affected by tiering tiered readiness issues tiering methods already in place dod maintains that the services are already doing some form of tiering and the house agrees 18 the navy and marine corps rotate their forces on cyclical scheme that naturally differentiates units that are afloat and thus operational from those forces that are in homeport either in refit or preparing to go operational the army keeps units most likely to deploy first at their highest readiness while other units have lowe r priority on personnel and equi pment concept that tiers

tasking 20 these differences in the operational patterns of each of the services complicate the question of tiering readiness naval forces rotate on cyclical system tantamount to rotating their readiness so th at operational forces are most ready and inport forces are least ready the cyclical deployment schedule of the navy and marine corps rotate operational forces and at any time some units are more ready than others the army puts an emphasis on f irsttogo units and gives them fulluphttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97866crs5 21see qdr report 3536 22see hr 119 section 314 23see qdr report

services h rpt 105132 asserts the committee strongly believes that the military services have over time developed readiness systems that are particulary tailore d to their individual requirements these existing systems already represent form of tiering in that resources are allocated on priority basis to military units that ar expected to enter into combat first 22 analysis of potential co stsavings om analysis in its first report dod estimated only about 100 million in savings 23 the sasc points out that om accounts for over 33 of the dod budget with 94 billion projected for fy1998 according to the gao since 1987 the om accounts have been the largest appropriation group in dods budget and are ex pected to remain the largest through fiscal year 2001 24 in the second report the senate wants to know just what parts of om could be saved by tiere d readiness when dod studied this question before the qdr it concluded that large porti ons of om were not affected by tiering of forces and thus the potential for savings would be limited anticipated costsavings arguments are critical in this overall debate25 peacetime engagement readiness questions focus almost exclusively on warfighting abilities but there is clearly an argument that the current strategy has demands in excess of any war scenario26 describing units only by their wartime requirement neglects their potential
