preventing federal government shutdowns proposals for an automatic continuing resolution summary over the past several decades the tardy enactment of regular appropriations bills has been persistent problem in the annual appropriations process when action on such bills is delayed congress turns to one or more continuing resolutions crs to provide interim funding the interval during the fiscal year when agency appropriations are not enacted into law either in the form of regular appropriations act or cr is referred to as funding gap when funding gap occurs the federal government begins shutdown of the affected agencies as required by the antideficiency act which entails the furlough of nonemergency employees during the 24 fiscal years from fy1977 through fy2000 there were 17 funding gaps in order to avoid the occurrence of funding gaps and government shutdowns proposals have been made to establish an automatic continuing resolution acr that would provide fallback source of funding for activities at restricted level in the event the timely enactment of appropriations is disrupted the funding would become available automatically and remain available as long as needed so that funding gap would not occur and the furlough of federal employees would be avoided or at least severely limited during the 105th congress an acr proposal was included in supplemental appropriations bill hr 1469 but the bill was vetoed by president clinton on june 9 1997 in part because he objected to the inclusion of the acr provision the proposal would have provided automatic continuing appropriations for activities during fy1998 only at 100 of the fy1997 level so far during the 106th congress acr proposals have been reported in both the house and senate but only the house has considered one on the floor house bill hr 853 the leading proposal in the house was reported by the house appropriations budget and rules committees hrept 106198 part 1 june 24 1999 and parts 2 and 3 august 5 1999 respectively the house appropriations committee filed an adverse report and recommended that the acr proposal be dropped from the bill on may 16 2000 the house considered and

enacting regular appropriations acts and continuing resolutions in timely manner periodically have resulted in funding gaps in 1980 and 1981 revised interpretations of the law governing agency behavior during funding gaps led to more aggressive enforcement of the law causing the federal government to shut down affected agencies during funding gaps in an effort to ameliorate the consequences of the tardy enactment of appropriations some members have proposed that an automatic continuing resolution be set in place so that funding gaps would not occur and federal government shutdowns would be prevented congressional interest in automatic continuing proposals was spurred by two especially troublesome funding gaps that occurred in late 1995 and early 1996 this report examines the concept of the automatic continuing resolution outlines legislative action on such proposals in the 105th and 106th congresses and provides background information on the incidence of continuing resolutions and funding gaps background the annual appropriations process the routine activities of most federal agencies are funded by means of annual appropriations provided in one or more of the 13 regular appropriations acts when action on the regular appropriations acts is delayed congress turns to continuing resolution cr to provide stopgap funding1 the cr is so named because it provides continuing appropriations in the form of joint resolution occasionally however continuing appropriations are provided in bill form crs usually fund activities under formulatype approach that provides spending at restricted level such as the lesser of the amount passed by the house or the senate in appropriations bills not ready for transmittal to the president in many instances the amount of funding available for particular activities is increased when the regular appropriations act is subsequently enacted congress is not bound by these conventions in determining funding levels however and there have been many variations in practice in recent crs further crs usually do not allow new activities to be initiated funding is available only for activities conducted during the past year and existing conditions and limitations on program activity are retained 1 for general information see crs report rl30343 continuing appropriations acts brief overview of recent practices by sandy streeter washington december 14 1999 10 p crs2 over the past several decades the timing patterns for congressional action on regular appropriations acts have varied considerably but tardy enactment has been persistent problem congress and the president were not able to enact all of the regular appropriations acts on time in any year during the 25year period running from fy1952 through fy1976 as result one or more crs were enacted each year during this period except for fy19532 in an effort to reduce the reliance on crs the congressional budget act of 1974 lengthened the time available for congress to act on annual appropriations measures by moving the start of the fiscal year back three months from july 1 to october 13 notwithstanding this change there have been only four instances beginning with fy1977 when procedures under the 1974 congressional budget act first were implemented fully in which all of the regular appropriations acts were enacted on time fy1977 1989 1995 and 1997 consequently one or more crs were needed each year during this period except for fy1989 1995 and 19974 in most years more than one cr was needed as congress worked to complete action on the regular appropriations acts the number of crs enacted during the period ranged from zero to seven except for fy1996 when 14 separate measures providing continuing appropriations were enacted5 in some years especially during the 1980s the final cr provided funding for one or more of the regular appropriations acts for the remainder of the fiscal year the legal underpinning for funding gaps and shutdowns the antideficiency act 31 usc 13411342 15111519 generally bars agencies from continued operation in the absence of appropriations6 exceptions are made under the act for certain activities primarily those involving the safety of human life or the protection of property the interval during the fiscal year when agency appropriations are not enacted into law either in the form of regular appropriations act or cr is referred to as funding gap although funding gaps may occur on 2 although regular appropriations measures for fy1953 were enacted into law after the start of the fiscal year on july 1 1952 continuing appropriations were provided section 1414 of pl 82547 july 15 1952 supplemental appropriations measure for fy1953 resolved technical legalities arising from the tardy enactment of appropriations for that year 3 section 501 88 stat 321 of pl 93344 july 12 1974 this section later was replaced by the federal credit reform act of 1990 but the start of the fiscal year remains october 1 4 although all of the regular appropriations acts were enacted on time for fy1977 two continuing resolutions were needed to fund certain unauthorized programs that had been omitted from one of the regular appropriations acts 5 see the following two reports 1 crs report 9578 gov continuing appropriations acts summary data for fiscal years 19771995 by edward davis and robert keith

the fiscal year they may occur any time cr expires and another cr or the regular appropriations act is not enacted immediately thereafter also multiple funding gaps may occur for fiscal year in 1980 and 1981 attorney general benjamin civiletti issued opinions regarding the antideficiency act clarifying the need for federal agencies to begin terminating regular activities immediately upon the occurrence of funding gap7 the narrowness of the exceptions allowed under the act was reaffirmed by the budget enforcement act of 1990 which in part stated that the exceptions do not include ongoing regular functions of government the suspension of which would not imminently threaten the safety of human life or the protection of property8 accordingly when funding gap occurs the federal government begins shutdown of the affected agencies shutdown entails the prompt furlough of non emergency personnel9 and curtailment of agency activities including the provision of most services to the public10 the general practice of the federal government over the years has been to pay furloughed employees after the shutdown has ended for time missed even when work was performed when funding gap is expected to occur the affected agencies are given guidance on the preparation for shutdown by the office of management and budget usually in the form of bulletin and the office of personnel management history of recent funding gaps as shown in table 1 there were 17 funding gaps during the 24 fiscal years covering fy1977 through fy2000 one or more funding gaps occurred in 12 of these years but there were funding gaps in the remaining 12 years in three instances for fy1983 fy1985 and fy1996 there were two funding gaps for one fiscal year and in one instance for fy1978 there were three funding gaps the gaps ranged in duration from one to 21 full days six of the seven lengthiest funding gaps lasting from 8 to 17 days occurred between fy1977 and fy1980 before the civiletti opinions were issued in general the duration of funding gaps shortened considerably after the issuance of these opinions ranging from one to three days with the longer gaps occurring over weekend however fiveday and 21day funding gap for fy1996 occurred between midnovember of 1995 and early january of 1996 7 see in particular 43 op atty gen 293 january 16 1981 8 see section 13213 of pl 101508 104 stat 1388621 the

six cases two occurring after the civiletti opinion the funding gaps were due to the failure to enact the initial continuing resolution by the start of the fiscal year on october 1 in the remaining 11 cases nine occurring after the civiletti opinion the funding gaps occurred between continuing resolutions as the fiscal year already was underway although nine funding gaps occurred at the start of the fiscal year or during october another eight occurred as late as november or december in some instances funding gaps resulted in the widespread furlough of federal employees and the shutdown of federal agencies the disruption was minimized most of the time because the funding gap occurred during weekend one of the most dramatic of the earlier shutdowns occurred in november 198111 funding gap began at midnight on friday november 20 when continuing resolution expired president reagan vetoed further continuing resolution on the morning of monday november 23 prompting shutdown the budgetary confrontation between the president and congress was resolved later that day and further continuing resolution was signed into law that evening ending the shutdown another notable shutdown occurred during the columbus day weekend in october of 199012 perhaps the most dramatic of all shutdowns involved fiveday and 21day shutdown for fy1996 occurring between late 1995 and early 1996 the shutdowns were due to unusually difficult and protracted negotiations between president clinton and congress over appropriations and other budgetary issues13 during the first of the two shutdowns about 800000 federal employees were furloughed automatic continuing resolution extensive reliance on crs and the occurrence of funding gaps and federal government shutdowns have been persistent features of the annual appropriations process proposals have been made from time to time over the years to alleviate 11 the circumstances surrounding the shutdown are discussed in detail in the congressional

congressional quarterly almanac government shuts down twice due to lack of funding pages 113 through 116 also lengthier and more colorful discussion of the political circumstances surrounding the funding gaps may be found in mirage why neither democrats nor republicans can balance the budget end the deficit and satisfy the public by george hager and eric pianin random house new york 1997 see especially pages 258303 crs6 these problems by establishing an automatic continuing resolution acr14 the common feature of these proposals is the establishment of mechanism to ensure fallback source of funding for activities at restricted level in the event the timely enactment of appropriations is disrupted the funding would become available automatically and remain available as needed so that funding gap would not occur and the furlough of federal employees would be avoided or at least severely limited features of acrs the two major variables in the design of an automatic continuing resolution are funding level and duration with regard to funding level most acr proposals would set funding for the new fiscal year at level consistent with the rate of operations for the prior fiscal year or some percentage of that rate this would allow agencies to continue operating at close to the status quo without prejudging which programs should be increased or scaled back on the issue of duration acr proposals range from providing continuing appropriations for short interval like month to the full fiscal year or even indefinitely so that continuing appropriations would become available automatically year after year as needed some proposals stop short of providing comprehensive automatic continuing appropriations and instead focus on continuing only basic civilian and military pay and benefits arguments for proponents of acr proposals identify several categories of problems that could they assert be avoided if funding gaps and the ensuing federal government shutdowns were not allowed to occur first shutdowns may incur significant costs to the federal government for various reasons including program inefficiencies that arise from the disruption and from making payments to federal employees after the shutdown has ended for period when work was not performed if the shutdown is fairly large in scale as occurred in late 1995 and early 1996 the cost to the federal government runs into hundreds of millions of dollars in addition federal employees themselves may have to contend with delayed or reduced paychecks the interruption of official travel and similar problems second shutdowns may incur significant costs to private sector entities that have business arrangements with the federal government or otherwise are closely aligned with federal activities lengthy shutdown may impede the timely payment of federal contractors for example less directly businesses dependent on federally sponsored activities such as hotels and restaurants that service visitors to national parks and monuments may suffer economic losses when these facilities shut down third shutdowns may disrupt the provision of services to program beneficiaries and the general public certain benefit payments involving such programs as veterans assistance and medicare payments to health maintenance organizations may not be paid when shutdown lasts for any significant period citizens intending 14 see for example the report of the general accounting office funding gaps jeopardize federal government operations pad8131 march 3 1981 the print of the house government operations committee reform of the federal budget process an analysis of major proposals june 1987 pages 47 and the print of the senate governmental affairs committee proposed budget reforms critical analysis april 1988 pages 3235 crs7 to travel overseas may not be able to obtain passport services tourists making long planned vacations may be barred from entry at many public sites fourth many acr proponents believe that shutdowns create strong negative perception regarding the ability of elected officials to govern effectively and that the onus falls principally on congress rather than the president finally an acr in the view of some may promote an atmosphere at the end of the session more conducive to the constructive resolution of negotiations over legislation too often they assert the crisis atmosphere surrounding funding gaps late in the year pressures members into accepting lessthandesirable solutions to break legislative impasses arguments against the major concern of opponents of acr proposals is that they could serve as disincentive to enact the regular appropriations bills in timely manner or even at all by knowing that failsafe funding mechanism in the form of an acr exists which would prevent the disruption from government shutdown negotiations over annual appropriations could slow down considerably as different sides see an advantage in taking more time to pursue their goals if negotiations extended weeks past the beginning of the fiscal year without clear signs of impending agreement an acceptance of the status quo or something near to it and adjournment might be the most appealing option to many at that time in this view an acr therefore could offer congress convenient escape hatch from difficult situation when time has run out further acr critics maintain that supporters of reduced funding levels for annual appropriations might very well see thwarting action on the regular appropriations bills at least those that would increase spending as an important means of achieving their goal funding formula set much lower than 100 percent of the prior years level probably would encourage congressional majority to seek enactment of the regular bills but the 98percent or 100percent formula may be seen by many as an adequate funding level given the interest in constraining spending growth reliance upon an acr could allow congress to achieve this goal without actually taking any tough votes to cut discretionary spending significantly finally the chief drawback to formulabased approach opponents of an acr assert is that it may engender inequities and undermine accountability many would argue that the notions of congressional accountability and responsibility in exercising the power of the purse entail the exercise of deliberate choice the development of annual appropriations bills through the regular legislative process entails making thousands of separate decisions the effects of increasing funding or decreasing funding for each account and the programs projects and activities within those accounts are carefully weighed according to various criteria all members have an opportunity to take part in this process at some level resort to formulabased approach however treats all items the same programs in need of significant increases are treated in the same manner as programs that can be cut significantly if not eliminated altogether from this perspective when members are denied the opportunity to influence outcomes for particular programs they may not be held as clearly accountable for them crs8 recent congressional action on acr proposals action in the 105th congress during the 105th congress the house and senate acted on an acr proposal included in legislation providing supplemental appropriations for fy1997 the legislation was vetoed by president clinton on june 9 1997 subsequent supplemental appropriations measure which did not contain an acr provision was enacted into law pl 10518 the senate initiated consideration of the supplemental appropriations bill s 672 an acr provision pegged at 98percent of the prior years funding level and effective for the duration of fy1998 was included in the bill as developed in the senate appropriations committee15 the provision was sponsored by senators john mccain and kay bailey hutchison and was based upon freestanding acr proposal they had introduced earlier s 547 pursuant to the provision the 98 percent funding level could remain in effect for as long as the entire fiscal year but would have effect beyond fy1998 several provisions dealing with such matters as the terms and conditions coverage and charging of expenditures under continuing appropriations also were included in the proposal these provisions essentially were boilerplate from recent continuing resolutions according to senators mccain and hutchison the funding formula 98 percent of the prior years level was consistent with past budget resolution policy aimed at balancing the budget by fy2002 accordingly if circumstances dictated that the funding formula remain in effect for all programs during the entire fiscal year that action would not undermine balancedbudget efforts an unsuccessful motion to strike the provision was made in committee by senator robert byrd on may 5 1997 during senate consideration of s 672 senator byrd again offered an amendment 59 to strike the provision from the bill during discussion of the proposal senator mccain obtained unanimous consent to modify the provision raising the funding formula from 98 percent to 100 percent he explained that the recent budget summit agreement which provided for modest increases in discretionary spending made the adjustment reasonable the byrd amendment was tabled the next day by vote of 5545 and the modified provision was retained in the bill the house considered its version of the supplemental appropriations measure hr 1469 on may 15 representative george gekas offered an amendment 7 proposing an acr that was identical to the senate provision the gekas amendment was adopted by the house by vote of 227197 the acr proposal as passed by both the house and senate was included in the final version of hr 1469 as title ix which passed both chambers on june 516 president clinton vetoed the measure on june 9 1997 the president cited several objections to the measure the first being the inclusion of the acr proposal he 15 see title vii the government shutdown prevention act on pages 8185 of s 672 as reported on april 30 1997 srept 10516 16 see the conference report on hr 1469 hrept 105119 june 4 1997 pages 6769 legislative text and 125 brief explanation crs9 indicated that the acr if it funded all appropriations for the entire fiscal year would have resulted in funding levels 18 billion below the levels contained in the budget agreement he had reached earlier with congress17 in the house other measures dealing with acrs and related issues included hr 342 stearns hr 638 and hr 1916 gekas hr 987 j peterson hr 1326 bunning hr 1372 cox hr 1537 meek hr 1785 kleczka and hr 1912 t davis similar proposals in the senate included s 228 and s 547 mccain and s 396 mikulski acr proposals in the 106th congress so far during the 106th congress acr proposals have been reported in both the house and senate but only the house has considered one on the floor two of the leading proposals hr 853 and s 558 are discussed separately below hr 853 in the house hr 853 the comprehensive budget process act of 1999 was introduced on february 25 1999 by representatives jim nussle and benjamin cardin18 the measure was cosponsored by bipartisan coalition of members that includes among others representative john kasich chairman of the house budget committee representative david dreier chairman of the house rules committee and representative porter goss chairman of the legislative and budget process subcommittee of the house rules committee it represented the culmination of efforts begun in the 105th congress by the task force on the budget process the socalled nusslecardin task force of the house budget committee and concurrent efforts by the house rules committee the budget and rules committees marked up hr 853 on june 17 and june 23 respectively and reported it on august 5 hrept 106198 parts 2 and 3 in addition hr 853 also was referred to the house appropriations committee for consideration of that portion of the bill setting forth an automatic continuing resolution the appropriations committee filed an adverse report on june 24 hrept 106198 part 1 recommending that the acr provision be dropped from the bill as reported by the budget and rules committees section 641 of hr 853 would have permanently established an automatic continuing resolution as part of title 31 money and finance of the united states code the acr would have providee funding at the prior years level ie the amount provided in annual appropriations acts enacted for the preceding fiscal year19 the proposals of the two committees essentially were the same except that the rules committees proposal 17 for the text of the presidents veto message see the congressional record of june 10 1997 at pages h363334 18 for detailed summary of hr 853 see crs report rl3023 hr 853 the comprehensive budget process reform act summary of provisions by james v saturno 6 washington may 4 2000 17 pages 19 the acr proposal is discussed in detail in the reports of the budget and rules committees hrept 106198on pages 7479 in part 2 and on pages 101103 in part 3 respectively crs10 would have excluded designated emergency spending from the calculation of the prioryear level on may 16 2000 the house considered and failed to pass hr 853 by vote of 166250 under the terms of consideration set by special rule hres 499 the acr proposal was stripped from the base text but was made in order as an amendment representative george gekas offered the acr amendment but it was defeated by vote of 173236 s 558 on march 16 1999 the senate governmental affairs committee reported s 558 the government shutdown prevention act srept 10615 as in the case of the house bill discussed above s 558 built upon acr proposals considered in the preceding several years in particular senator pete domenici the chairman of the senate budget committee had introduced comprehensive budget process reform measure s 93 the budget enforcement act of 1999 on january 19 1999 on january 27 the budget and governmental affairs committees held joint hearing on s 93 and s 92 senator domenicis biennial budgeting proposal subsequently the governmental affairs committee decided to report the acr proposal in title iv of s 93 as freestanding measure s 558 senate bill 558 like hr 853 establishes an automatic continuing resolution as part of title 31 of the united states code however s 558 differs from hr 853 in two fundamental ways first while hr 853 proposed permanent acr s 558 limits the application of the acr to fy2000 and fy2001 only although in this session the fy2000 funding is now moot the senate governmental affairs committee indicated that its duration should be limited because the procedure is untried second s 558 would fund activities at the lower of the prioryear level or the amount proposed in the presidents budget unlike hr 853 which would have funded activities only at the prioryear level implication of cbo scoring of hr 853 and s 558 in addition to issues pertaining to the advantages or disadvantages of particular approaches to framing an acr cost estimates for the two proposals developed by the congressional budget office cbo raise important implications under traditional scoring practices cbo regarded both bills as providing direct spending in the form of permanent appropriations accordingly cbo estimated fy2000 budget authority for hr 853 and s 558 at 566 billion and 550 billion with fy2000 outlays of 338 billion and 330 billion respectively20 under current budget enforcement procedures21 the enactment of measure containing significant direct spending would require significant sequester of spending for such programs at the end of the session in which enactment occurred 20 the cbo cost estimates are included in the committee reports on hr 853 and s 558 see hrept 106198 part 2 pages 142143 and srept 10615 pages 79 respectively 21 current budget enforcement procedures are described in crs report 98720 manual on the federal budget process by robert keith and allen schick washington august 24 1998 184 p crs11 unless the costs were not
