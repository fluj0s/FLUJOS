regulatory cooperation possible role for congress summary the united states and the european union eu share comprehensive dynamic and mutually beneficial economic relationship transatlantic markets are among the most open in the world and are deeply integrated however the existence of regulatory barriers limits an even more integrated market from materializing the united states and the eu have engaged in number of attempts to reduce remaining nontariff and regulatory barriers to trade in the most recent effort president bush and german chancellor merkel serving as president of the eu at the april 2007 us eu summit agreed to establish the transatlantic economic council tec the tec was directed to advance the work of reducing or eliminating nontariff barriers to transatlantic commerce and trade the leaders also created an advisory group to provide guidance and direction to the tec and invited the us congress along with the european parliament to accept new more substantive role in transatlantic regulatory cooperation by becoming part of the advisory group the transatlantic legislators dialogue tld was appointed to represent the legislatures in the tec advisory group since it began nearly two decades ago transatlantic regulatory cooperation has been mostly limited to the executive branches and regulatory bodies on both sides of the atlantic however the idea of legislators assuming more proactive role in transatlantic economic and regulatory cooperation is not new issue at the 1995 launch of the new transatlantic agenda the leaders of the us and eu acknowledged that they attached great importance to enhanced parliamentary links and agreed to consult with parliamentary leaders on both sides of the atlantic regarding consultation mechanisms including building on existing institutions to discuss matters related to our transatlantic partnership advocates of the effort to achieve more barrierfree transatlantic marketplace believe that ultimate success cannot be achieved without the strong commitment and active engagement of the us congress and the european parliament although the transatlantic legislators dialogue has been in existence since 1999 there appears to be lack of familiarity with its structure membership and function with respect to its role in the tec process several questions have been raised including the make up of the tld the role of the standing committees in both the congress and the parliament the staff and the role of the us senate number of options for reform have been proposed this report will provide background and analysis

states and europe have experienced period of accelerated integration interlinked by growing ties in trade investment and related employment1 today the united states and the current 27 member european union eu share comprehensive dynamic and mutually beneficial economic partnership not only is the euus commercial relationship what advocates refer to as the transatlantic economy the largest in the world for many practitioners in the transatlantic community it is also arguably the most important2 the transatlantic economy dominates the world economy by its sheer size and prosperity the combined population of the united states and eu now approaches 800 million people who generate combined gross domestic product gdp of 268 trillion 136 trillion in the eu and 132 trillion in the us 3 transatlantic markets are among the most open in the world and are deeply integrated through investment flows affiliate sales and relatedparty trade4 the transatlantic economy generates an estimated 4 trillion in commercial activity per year and accounts for close to 60 of global gross domestic product gdp and roughly 40 of world trade5 the united states and eu are each others largest overall markets for host of goods and services ranging from agricultural products to high tech goods and services large values of similar goods such as chemicals transportation equipment computers and processed food as well as transportation and financial services are traded in record amounts more significant as the pillars of transatlantic commercial activity and the driving forces behind

fdi results in direct participation in each others domestic economies7 the fact that each side has major ownership stake in the others market may be the most distinctive aspect of the transatlantic economy at the end of 2006 the total stock of twoway direct investment reached 22 trillion composed of 11 trillion of us direct investment in eu countries and 11 trillion of eu direct investments in the us making us and european companies the largest investors in each others market roughly 47 of all us foreign direct investment is located in europe while eu member states supply 42 of global fdi in the united states european affiliate income in the us reached 89 billion in 2006 while us affiliate income in europe increased to 147 billion during that same period8 this massive amount of ownership of companies in each others markets translates into billions of dollars of sales profits production and expenditures on research and development in addition an estimated six to seven million americans are employed by european affiliates operating in the united states and almost an equal number of eu citizens work for american companies in europe9 the combined weight of these two economic superpowers means that how the us and eu manage their relationship and the difficult issues involving domestic regulations competition policy and foreign investment could well help determine how the rest of the world deals with similar issues as the figures might suggest both the us and eu implement policies that are receptive to expanding the commercial relationship in theory both sides appear to acknowledge that there is nothing to gain from protectionist investment policies the success of economic integration achieved thus far however does not guarantee that the transatlantic economies will continue to deepen differences do exist in terms of regulatory irritants and barriers to greater commercial ties on both sides of the atlantic that remain to be adequately addressed nevertheless economic integration continues to grow this report is intended to serve as companion piece to crs report rl34717 transatlantic regulatory cooperation background and analysis which provides an

transatlantic economy 2008 executive summary by daniel s hamilton and joseph p quinlan available at httptransatlanticsaisjhuedu 10 see crs report rl34717 transatlantic regulatory cooperation background and continued crs3 focus of this report is on 1 the creation of the transatlantic economic council 2 the role of legislatures in the regulatory process and 3 the transatlantic legislators dialogue and its new role as an advisor to transatlantic regulatory efforts transatlantic regulatory barriers because many us and european industries are already deeply integrated with each other and most tariffs are low nontariff and regulatory barriers are increasingly recognized as the most significant trade and investment impediments to the creation of more integrated transatlantic market however some observers believe that while regulatory divergence does present an obstacle to trade it does not automatically mean that the alignment of regulations in all sectors is possible or even desirable in addition to domestic regulations nontariff barriers consist of elements such as safety norms differences in health environmental or engineering standards rules of origin or labeling requirements11 such measures are due in part to different societal preferences and priorities but also to significant degree lack of coordination or adequate information exchange between regulators and legislators on each side of the atlantic who are subject to different legal mandates or engaged in different oversight procedures12 one problem in addressing these different perspectives is the fact that in both the united states and europe there are very different regulatory processes and structures that make attempts at regulatory convergence difficult13 there have been number of previous attempts to reduce existing nontariff and regulatory barriers to trade the aim of such efforts has been to reduce costs to businesses on both sides of the atlantic improve consumer welfare and facilitate higher levels of economic growth in june 2005 report issued by the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd estimated that certain structural reforms in both the us and eu that included the reduction of competitionrelated regulations tariff barriers and restrictions on foreign direct investment could lead to permanent gains in gdp per capita on both sides of the atlantic of up to 3 to 35 percent14 attempts to seek meaningful regulatory cooperation began in 1995 when us and european leaders launched the new transatlantic agenda nta this initiative was designed to raise the useu relationship to new level of dialogue and decisionmaking in four areas including economic cooperation since then the us and the eu have launched several additional initiatives such as mutual recognition agreements 1997 10 continued analysis by raymond j ahearn 11 see crs report rl34717 transatlantic regulatory cooperation background and analysis pp 24 12 daniel s hamilton

economic agenda 2002 the transatlantic economic partnership 2004 and the transatlantic economic agenda 2005 each of these projects has contributed in some way to achieving limited progress towards reducing regulatory burdens however both european and us companies heavily engaged in the transatlantic marketplace argue that the results have not proved materially significant for instance there seems to have been some improvements in areas such as competition policy and financial services but progress in other areas such as chemicals has not been accomplished15 creation of the transatlantic economic council in january 2007 germanys chancellor angela merkel upon assuming the rotating sixmonth presidency of the eu proposed further liberalization of transatlantic trade and investment barriers by elevating the existing cooperation among us and eu regulatory agencies building on the merkel initiative the april 2007 useu summit adopted framework for advancing transatlantic economic integration the framework affirmed the importance of further deepening transatlantic economic integration particularly through efforts to reduce or harmonize regulatory barriers to international trade and investment new institutional structure transatlantic economic council tec was established to advance the process of regulatory cooperation and barrier reduction by encouraging both us and eu regulators to move forward on issues outlined in the framework the creation of the tec was predicated on the premise that past efforts to achieve regulatory cooperation or convergence had been inadequate due to the technical nature of the work the casebycase ad hoc approach often assumed by regulatory agencies and lack of political leadership committed to having the regulators cooperate the tec is headed on both sides by ministeriallevel appointees with cabinet rank16 given that the two tec leaders are cabinetlevel appointees the tec was expected to have the high level political support that previous efforts at economic integration may have lacked many observers believe the tec with its requirement to report annually to the useu summit would receive that support such clout it is argued is needed to persuade domestic regulators to yield some of their authorities or to better cooperate with their counterparts across the atlantic in harmonizing regulatory approaches17 the tec in theory is designed to enable us and european regulators to anticipate and discuss potential differences in thinking about new regulations before they become actual obstacles to transatlantic commerce these efforts include wide range of alternatives including dialogues and information exchanges among regulators mutual recognition 15 crs report rl34717 op cit pp1419 16 to chair the tec the us side initially named alan hubbard assistant to the president for economic policy and director of the national economic council and the eu appointed gunter verheugen vice president of the european commission and commissioner for enterprise and industry since then david price assistant to the president for international economic affairs has replaced alan hubbard as us tec chair 17 for more information on the tec see section iv in the useu framework for advancing transatlantic economic integration april 2007 available at httpwwwwhitehousegovnewsreleases200704200704304html and crs report rl34717 op cit p20 crs5 agreements costbenefit analysis recommendations for voluntary principles and proposals for binding agreements the mandate of the tec is to accelerate ongoing efforts to reduce or harmonize regulatory barriers the tec was directed to accomplish this mandate in part by including broader participation of stakeholders including for the first time legislators in the discussions and meetings in particular the framework document instructed the tec to establish an advisory group that draws upon the heads of the existing transatlantic dialogues to provide input and guidance on priorities for pursuing transatlantic economic integration the existing transatlantic dialogues include the transatlantic legislators dialogue tld the us congresseuropean parliament exchange the transatlantic business dialogue tabd and the transatlantic consumers dialogue tacd the tec meets twice annually and reports to the annual us eu summit on both achievements and areas where more progress is needed to date the advisory group has met with the tec at each of the two tec meetings held as of october 2008 the 2007 framework presented the tec with two priorities the first was to build upon the established sectoral dialogues which had been taking place between us and european commission regulatory experts these dialogues have included issues involving pharmaceuticals automobile safety cosmetics consumer product safety food safety energy efficiency and medical devices the second priority was identified as the lighthouse priority projects these included review of policies on intellectual property rights and piracy secure ports and trade financial markets innovation and technology and investment the first meeting of the tec took place on november 9 2007 in washington dc second meeting was held on may 13 2008 in brussels for some observers the results of these first two meetings have been mixed at the first meeting the tec agreed that in the field of financial accounting standards both sides should pursue an agreement to accept the mutual recognition of each others accounting methods at the second meeting the tec issued joint statement affirming the commitment of both the us and eu to promote open investment policies and to refrain from protectionist policies the difficulty of harmonizing regulatory activities or resolving disputes embedded in regulatory differences however was also underscored at both tec meetings by the failure to resolve longstanding dispute involving us exports of poultry to the eu the outcomes of the two meetings have at least demonstrated that both sides remain committed to greater economic integration and regulatory cooperation for those advocates of the concept of the transatlantic marketplace free of artificial barriers and impediments to increased commercial and investment activity the creation of the tec was seen as necessary measure the goals and responsibilities established for the tec as outlined by the us and eu leadership seemed designed to achieve that objective according to some the tec promises to break new ground by enabling regular communication and exchange of information at higher level on variety of issues18 the dilemma for the tec however may be the uncertainty over its role is the tec to be dispute settlement body putting out fires in transatlantic trade or is it primarily 18 daniel s hamilton op cit p4 crs6 designed to promote regulatory convergence the tec also seems limited in its structure to deal with national interests or to overcome domestic political opposition to items on its agenda whether the tec will prove more successful entity for actually accomplishing reduction in remaining transatlantic regulatory and nontariff barriers to trade remains uncertain19 this also raises the question of why this should be done just in the context of transatlantic relations some advocates point out that many of these regulatory issues are global in nature and apply to regions such as asia and latin america as well as europe for many this is legitimate question and is answered by some who point out that as highly developed economic systems both the us and the eu could set the global standards for future regulation in broad economic categories the role of the legislatures since it began nearly two decades ago transatlantic regulatory cooperation has been mostly limited to the executive branches and regulatory bodies on both sides of the atlantic however the idea of legislators assuming more proactive role in transatlantic economic and regulatory cooperation is not new issue at the 1995 launch of the new transatlantic agenda the leaders of the us and eu acknowledged that they attached great importance to enhanced parliamentary links and agreed to consult with parliamentary leaders on both sides of the atlantic regarding consultation mechanisms including building on existing institutions to discuss matters related to our transatlantic partnership20 for those interested in the transatlantic economic relationship this broad mandate to include the legislators has resulted in an increased interest in the role the us congress and the european parliament can or should play in regulatory cooperation and convergence representatives of congress and european parliament have long argued for greater legislative participation at least in the annual summit process numerous pieces of legislation have been introduced and even passed in both congress and the parliament over the past seven years calling for enhanced dialogue and coordination between the congress and the european parliament in matters related to the transatlantic economic relationship in 2004 and 2005 the european parliament passed resolutions supporting the completion of the transatlantic market by 2015 in 2006 the us senate passed similar resolution in sres 632 rationale for including the legislatures despite the nta declaration regarding participation of legislators and past legislative initiatives approved by congress and the parliament incorporating the legislatures into the regulatory process has been met with questions and mixed views advocates of the effort to achieve more barrierfree transatlantic marketplace believe 19 crs report rl34717 op cit pp2022 20 declaration of the new transatlantic agenda at the us eu summit december 13 1995 crs7 that ultimate success cannot be achieved without the strong commitment and active engagement of the us congress and the european parliament some of these advocates have decried the low level of engagement by congress and the parliament thus far in the overall economic integration and regulatory cooperation process and believe congressional committees need to be more active in the oversight process these groups believe that through more active oversight congress can articulate its support for or concerns about particular regulatory direction before the regulators proceed too far down the negotiation path they believe more enhanced oversight could serve to help congress and the parliament develop as stronger partners by understanding at an earlier stage the rationale for traveling or not traveling down certain regulatory path these advocates also believe congress through its authorization and appropriation roles can prod the regulators to move the cooperative efforts forward and can provide the funds necessary to carry out that mandate some within this group have even suggested going further and inviting legislators to actively participate in highlevel regulatory dialogues in addition to their role in the tec advisory group21 those in this general camp point to the open skies agreement laboriously negotiated between the us and eu which was intended to make airline travel to and from and within both europe and the united states more competitive one key provision that would have allowed 49 foreign ownership of us airlines was drastically scaled back at the eleventh hour by congressional action supporters of this agreement felt this outcome might have been avoided had congress been included in the process at an earlier stage on the other hand there are many in the business and regulatory communities who are concerned about the autonomy of the us regulatory process even though that process is sometimes influenced by legislative direction others worry that the tec process will undermine the sovereignty of both the us and european regulatory processes these groups accept the congressional and parliament responsibility to conduct oversight however some in this group seem reluctant to encourage more active engagement of legislators in the regulatory reform process beyond oversight hearings this group does not believe congress or the parliament is at the point politically where they can discuss proposed regulatory changes in the context of the impact on the transatlantic relationship some believe that involving the legislators as advisors alongside the business and consumer communities is not an appropriate role for legislators who will frequently need to be called upon to make changes to legislation such as the 100 percent cargo screening requirement in order to accomplish the tec agenda22 these skeptics also point to the recent expressions of concern over free trade and globalization buy america provisions in us legislation and the recent negative reaction to european participation in the air force air refueling acquisition program as indications that further transatlantic economic integration may not yet be concept that is fully accepted by majority of the congress this group also raises concerns of what happens when the legislatures decide to take what for some would be regulatory matters into their own hands without close consultation with transatlantic regulatory bodies or the outside stakeholders that may be 21 see the american chamber of commerce to the euamchameu position paper advancing transatlantic economic integration october 2007 22 comments presented by the us chamber of commerce and business europe to the tec october 1 2008 crs8 impacted this group has referred to the sarbanesoxley legislation passed by congress or the registration evaluation and authorization of chemicals reach directive adopted by the european parliament as examples of well intentioned initiatives that have ultimately caused some regulatory problems that affected the transatlantic relationship many doubt however that the tec process could have prevented such legislative actions matter how engaged the regulators were with the legislatures at the time these issues arose concerns with the legislatures not every regulatory proposal on the useu agenda would need legislative action by congress but the ability of congress or the parliament to disapprove of reverse through legislation or prohibit the expenditure of funds to implement regulatory change is power that has been recognized and which must be considered the debate between the two competing groups seems to have shifted recently to matter of how and when to engage the legislators not if they should be included one problem that has arisen since 1995 regarding the dialogue with the legislators at least in the united states has been that successive administrations have had difficulty deciding who it is to consult with how to do it and when single congressional committee exercises jurisdiction over the broad array of issues on the regulatory agenda and the committees that have the primary authority to oversee the transatlantic political relationship the house foreign affairs committee under house rule x and the senate foreign relations committee under senate rule xxv have authority on the specific regulatory issues under consideration another concern that is raised is the question of whether the legislators themselves are prepared to take on more substantive partnership in the transatlantic regulatory process given the nature of regulatory cooperation the multiple layers of agencies involved the sometimes slow pace of reform and normal legislative demands some observers feel the congress may not be adequately prepared to apply transatlantic dimension to this process in the house the decision taken in 2000 to create subcommittee in the then international relations committee solely dedicated to europe along with the formation of members caucus on the eu in 2005 have provided important new venues for more focused discussion of transatlantic relations beginning with the launch of the new transatlantic agenda organizations such as the transatlantic policy network the german marshall fund and other thinktanks and public policy groups have become more involved in developing the transatlantic knowledge base of the congress publications such as the annual transatlantic economic report issued by the center for transatlantic relations have served to bring the economic message to the forefront ongoing efforts by groups such as the transatlantic business dialogue the us chamber of commerce and the europeanamerican business council have injected more specificity to the debate whether the attempt from these outside organizations to increase the level of awareness and interest among at least portion of the congress including within congressional committees that have jurisdiction over the issues involved will have significant impact on both regulatory cooperation or transatlantic relations is unclear most observers understand that the transatlantic impact of legislation is not often central consideration during the legislative process nor do many believe congress would submit crs9 its own legislative initiatives to any form of transatlantic impact statement or cede its authority to react to national crisis such as terrorist attack banking or corporate failure without first consulting the eu some in congress are not sure what their role in the transatlantic regulatory process should be even those members of congress initially contacted and asked to participate in the tec advisory group expressed uncertainty over their role and continue to seek more clarity on exactly what they are expected to provide to the tec23 nevertheless some observers believe the efforts to elevate congressional awareness of the expanding us eu partnership the magnitude of the transatlantic economic relationship and the increasing dialogue involving transatlantic economic integration and regulatory cooperation over the past several years has given rise to growing desire by some in congress to become more engaged in that process the tec was created by those who supported the importance of structured institutionalized dialogue between the transatlantic business and consumer communities the european parliament and the us congress supporters anticipate that under this structure legislators can become more aware of the potential impact on transatlantic trade and investment stemming from their legislative work and may be more sensitive to initiatives that might strengthen or undermine further transatlantic economic integration efforts24 the transatlantic legislators dialogue history according to the transatlantic legislators dialogue tld website25 found only on the european parliaments website formal exchanges between the us house of representatives and the european parliament can be traced back to 1972 when the first group of members of the house traveled to brussels for the express purpose of meeting and exchanging views with the parliament this parliamentary exchange which only involved the house became known as the useu community interparliamentary group since 1972 with few exceptions the parliamentary exchange has met twice annually once in the united states and once in europe given the transatlantic nature of the exchange the us eu group came under the jurisdiction of the house foreign affairs committee its annual meetings initially focused more on foreign policy agenda dedicated to the issues involving the cold war and the evolving nature of the european union in response to the launch of the new transatlantic agenda in 1995 the delegations of the us house and the european parliament at their 50th meeting in january 1999 agreed to change the groups name to the transatlantic legislators dialogue in announcing the formation of the tld the two delegations stated that the dialogue will constitute the formal response of the european 23 crs interviews with congressional staff 24 transatlantic economic council report to the euus summit april 2008 25 information on the tld can be found at httpwwweuroparleuropaeuintercooptld crs10 parliament and the us congress to the commitment in the new transatlantic agenda to enhance parliamentary ties between the european union and the united states26 in response to the decision to change the groups name to the transatlantic legislators dialogue the us house in november 1999 during consideration of the consolidated appropriations act for fiscal year 2000 hr 3194pl 106113 amended section 109c of the department of state authorization act for fiscal years 19841985 22usc 276 to officially change the name of the group since then the tlds agenda for each meeting has included broader discussion of economic and trade issues although formal engagement between the us house and the european parliament has occurred regularly for some 36 years some observers believe the tld remains little known both within and outside the house this has been disappointing to some because over the past years many delegations have traveled to europe and several senior members of the house have participated in exchange activities or knew of the exchange sessions for instance in 1987 thenspeaker jim wright attended the exchange meetings in madrid between 1994 and 2000 the chairman of the house international relations committee also served as the us chairman of the tld in 2007 the visiting eu tld delegation was received by house speaker pelosi and senate majority leader reid27 the lack of knowledge of the tld seemed to contribute to the surprise of many in the transatlantic community when the tec leadership invited the tld to be key member of its advisory group in fact there has been little evidence that anyone at the white house at the time of the 2007 useu summit thought to inform the house leadership that the administration was about to unilaterally assign new role to the legislative branch nor did it appear prior to the announcement in the summer of 2007 that anyone had informed the ustld chair that the group was to be handed new rather farreaching responsibility that of formally representing the views of congress in the transatlantic economic integration and regulatory cooperation process28 according to some the lack of familiarity with the tld its membership its function and its understanding of the tec process may be due to the fact that unlike several other parliamentary exchanges that operate in the congress such as the nato parliamentary assembly and the britishamerican parliamentary group the tld has never been statutorily authorized apparently this circumstance has caused some concern within the transatlantic community with respect to the tlds ability to carry out its new role as advisor to the tec the tld structure one question which has risen is the issue of what members actually belong to the tld in the european parliament there is formal group of thirtytwo members that constitute the delegation for relations with the united states participants to the tld meetings are drawn from this delegation in the us congress other than the appointment 26 joint statement of the delegations of the us congress and the european parliament january 16 1999 27 see the tld website for additional information 28 crs interviews with congressional staff crs11 of the chair and vice chair by the chairman and ranking member of the house foreign affairs committee there is formal nomination of any other ustld member while many members have participated in past meetings participation in the ustld often seems to be on an ad hoc basis involving little continuity of participants and in some instances largely dependent on the ability of the chairman to convince members to attend the annual meetings29 observers believe this has led to an inability on the part of the tld to attract and maintain broad group of members willing to participate on permanent basis this is an important issue for many because frank and open exchanges of views often come more easily through longterm relationships that rely on personal interactions developed between legislators over time and through familiarity often it seems that regular communication only takes place between the us and eu chairs or their staff some eu participants have observed that if they had particular issue that was of interest to them they might not know any other member of the us delegation that they could contact for discussion for the transatlantic business and consumer community this also presents problem in that there is permanently established group of tld members with whom these outside interest groups can meet to discuss issues on the regulatory agenda on regular basis30 second question that has been raised involves the capacity of the tld as currently structured to dedicate more time and effort to addressing those economic and regulatory issues that will appear on the tec agenda and how the tld will interface with standing committees of jurisdiction while the tld at its past annual meetings has engaged in broad discussion of issues foreign policy matters often seemed to dominate the agenda however the current us and eu chairs of the tld at the october 2007 and may 2008 meetings did include the more specific tec process as regular agenda item some observers fear however that as the regulatory dialogue proceeds on issues such as the mutual recognition of accounting standards supply chain security copyright and patent protection preferred traveler programs cosmetics testing and medical device certification an unstructured tld may find itself further down the learning curve than its transatlantic business and consumer partners in the tec and may be reluctant to become more specialized in economic and regulatory matters at the expense of other broader transatlantic policy issues especially because the regulatory process moves slowly and the tec meets only twice per year role of the committees31 with respect to the committees of jurisdiction the current ustld chair and vice chair sit on the trade subcommittees of the house committee on ways and means and the committee on energy and commerce respectively positions from which they both can speak on trade and regulatory issues however it is unclear whether other committees such as the house committee on financial services the committee on the judiciary or the committee on homeland security that have jurisdiction over issues such 29 crs interviews with congressional staff 30 crs interviews with representatives of the business community 31 for listing of congressional committees involved see crs report rl34717 transatlantic regulatory cooperation background and analysis pp 2627 crs12 as financial services technology innovation intellectual property and homeland security will defer to the tld to provide advice and guidance to the tec on behalf of those committees or how an information sharing process between the tld and the committees would be accomplished when the tec meets and issues its recommendations on how the us and eu might deal with issues such as the mutual recognition of accounting standards poultry consumer product safety or port security functions they will likely do so with what they believe will have been the best guidance not from two or three individual members of congress or eu parliament who happen to be the tld chairs and vicechairs but from the house of representatives and the parliament as whole the challenge then for the tld is how to develop relationship with the appropriate house and senate standing committees and the house and senate leadership for that matter that would provide for useful exchange of views on what the committees are thinking on the issues under consideration by the tec and how the tld can present those views formally to the us executive branch and european commission with some degree of authority without at the same time diminishing the traditional and rightful authority of the committees staffing the tld third question for those actively engaged in the transatlantic regulatory process seems to involve the issue of who the business and consumer communities should deal with at the congressional staff level on an everyday basis for issues related to the tec process there are two principal staff assigned to the tld these staff are part of the house foreign affairs committee structure and have their own portfolio of responsibilities beyond the tld observers note that while the foreign affairs committee staff are highly professional for what they do for the committee and knowledgeable of transatlantic relations none of the top issues listed in the us eu framework or those likely to be addressed by the tec over the next few years are issues that fall under rule x of the foreign affairs committee for some observers it may be real stretch to expect that foreign affairs staff who are responsible for following issues and events in places like georgia kosovo ukraine and elsewhere throughout europe can somehow also find the time to become proficient on automobile crash testing container scanning toy safety or hedge fund transparency realistically it would seem that neither the foreign affairs committee nor the tld cochairs could hire whole cadre of staff with the kind of expertise needed to be responsive to the tec process for the transatlantic business and consumer community it is unclear how they are to work with the staff of the committees of jurisdiction on the specific technicalities of tec agenda while at the same time working with the foreign affairs committee staff assigned to the tld way may have to be found that would allow the members and staff of the tld to tap into the expertise of the professional staff of the committees that exercise jurisdiction over these issues this may be difficult currently as it appears many committee staff outside of the foreign affairs committee are unfamiliar with the tld the tec or the new congressional responsibility as an advisor to the transatlantic regulatory process and may be less inclined to share the work they are doing for their committees with the staff of the tld32 32 crs staff discussions and interviews with congressional staff crs13 role of the senate finally some observers have raised the question of what role the senate will play in this process the fact that the senate has coequal role in regulatory oversight but is not included as part of the tld seems to have been missed by the decisionmakers who agreed to include the tld in the tec advisory group as of october 1 2008 the tec has met for two sessions with the advisory group yet there does not seem to be formal mechanism within the tld to include the senate in its activities nor within the tec advisory group to solicit senate opinion thus while the tld over time could develop some level of authority to represent the views of the house on issues addressed in the advisory groups meetings with the tec the tld as currently structured could not claim to speak on behalf of the senate this oversight will have to be addressed if the tec intends to receive the advice of the whole congress structural options most observers of the tec process thus far maintain that the transatlantic business dialogue tabd and the transatlantic consumer dialogue tacd can and will support the tec process even as both organizations have been critical of certain aspects of transatlantic regulatory cooperation there is however uncertainty about the role of congress and its representative the tld the tld is an interparliamentary entity and as such does not have at this point mandate to formally represent congress as whole or even the house separately until the tld and congress itself have better understanding of what is expected of it and how it will carry out its mandate as an advisor to the tec doubts will remain some engaged in the transatlantic regulatory process have suggested that the tld as whole and the ustld specifically be restructured in order to make it more effective partner in the tec advisory role at the very least this group believes the tld should be formally authorized and given status slightly different than the other parliamentary groups in the congress33 there are several options which the tld itself could explore in an attempt to make it more responsive one option may be for the us and eu tld cochairs to announce the creation of their own tld tec working group the cochairs could appoint one us and one eu member who have regularly attended the tld meetings to cochair the group the co chairs would recruit other regular tld participants or members of the appropriate committees of jurisdiction for the working group in the case of the ustld recruitment could also come from groups such as the eu caucus other than the cochairs the members of this group would not have to agree to join the tld on regular basis but would work closely with other standing committee members the tec and the two other advisory partners the tabd and the tacd the working group would brief the tld co chairs prior to any formal meeting of the tec the us working group cochair could also attempt to reach out to colleagues in the senate to help provide senate input into this process the downside of this option may be the fact that recommendations to the tec would still come from an interparliamentary group that while reflective of the views of 33 some in the business community have discussed the option of promoting legislation that would formalize the tlds role in the tec process crs14 their wider legislative bodies would still not have mandate to speak on behalf of those bodies second option might involve the tld reaching out to the members of groups with similar interests such as the transatlantic policy network tpn which includes members of both the house and senate the tpn which is mix of legislators and private sector representatives already has task force on the bilateral economic partnership the tld could invite that tpn task force to serve as an informal advisor to the tld the cochairs of the tpn task force are members of congress and the european parliament and several of the tpn members have participated in past tld meetings much of the work of the bilateral economic task force mirrors the work of the tec with respect to regulatory reform the tpn task force would continue with its own independent work which could be shared with the tec but periodically the co chairs andor their staff could meet with the tld cochairs andor their staff to share ideas information and recommendations briefing for the tld cochairs by the tpn task force could be arranged in advance of each tec meeting the tpn task force could also be invited to make formal presentation to the regular tld meetings downsides of this option would again be the issue of parliamentary group speaking for congress whether the tpn would be willing to share its work with the tld and the fact that the tpn task force may not include key committee chairmen who would be omitted from the process third option could involve the chair and vicechair of the ustld requesting that the house and senate leadership appoint special bipartisan bicameral regulatory cooperation advisory group to the tld this group would consist of the tld leadership plus representatives of the appropriate house and senate standing committees including committee or subcommittee chairmen with jurisdiction over the issues identified as being of interest to the tec this advisory group and their committee staff would follow the work of the tec through the agencies these committees oversee periodic meetings between the tec staff and committee staff could take place to update the tec process once an agenda is clarified for an upcoming tec meeting the tld chair and vicechair could convene only those advisory group members whose issues were identified on the tec agenda such leadership appointed advisory group would elevate the tec process and the tld role to higher level to one that would now include the house and senate leadership as stakeholder in the process the downsides to this option could include the potential conflict between the legislatures and the regulators over agenda setting the potential for partisan conflict due to the make up of the advisory group to the tld and disagreements over jurisdiction among the committees conclusion as the tec process attempts to move regulatory cooperation toward the ultimate goal of well functioning unencumbered transatlantic marketplace the role the congress will or should actually play has raised several questions among those participating in that process these issues have led many observers to believe that the tld although never intended to be anything more than mechanism for exchanging views among parliamentarians currently welds little influence or authority as transatlantic policy resource and in not representative of congress views on economic integration crs15 nevertheless the decision to include an advisory group with representation from the transatlantic legislative communities through the transatlantic legislators dialogue has been viewed by some as real opportunity for the congress and parliament to assume more direct role as stakeholder in the longterm development and completion of the transatlantic marketplace despite some shortcomings in the current structure of the ustld all indications are that the current chair and vice chair along with their counterpart eu chair are fully committed to making the tld more active partner in the tec process34 if the identified concerns with the tld along with its responsibilities as member of the tec advisory group are more fully addressed the tld might become an organization capable of taking on more substantive role in regulatory cooperation for many observers this could lead the tld to become over time more important stakeholder in regulatory cooperation and voice for transatlantic relations in the congress in the near term however these observers believe the tlds role as force for the promotion of greater transatlantic economic integration and regulatory cooperation on behalf of the us congress will remain its greatest challenge 34 crs interviews with congressional staff for other
