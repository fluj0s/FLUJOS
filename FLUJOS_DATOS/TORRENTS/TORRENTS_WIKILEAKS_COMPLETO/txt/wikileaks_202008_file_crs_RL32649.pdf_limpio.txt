prospec ts and policy options summary japan and the united states are the two largest economic powers together they account for over 40 of world domestic product for significant portion of international trade in goods and services and for major portion of international investment this economic clout make s the united states and japan potentially powerful actors in the world economy econo mic conditions in the united states and japan have significant impact on the rest of the world furthermore the usjapan bilateral economic relationship can influen ce economic conditions in other countries the usjapan economic relationshi p is very strong and mutually advantageous the two economies are highly integrated via trade in goods and services they are large markets for each others exports and important sources of imports more importantly japan and the united states are closely connected via capital flows japan is the largest foreig n source of financing of the us national debt and will likely remain so for the fore seeable future as the mounting us debt needs to be financed and the stock of u s domestic savings remains insufficient to meet the demand japan is also signifi cant source of foreign private portfolio and direct investment in the united states and the united states is the origin of much of the foreign investment in japan the relative significance of japan and the united states as each others economic partner has diminishe d somewhat with the rise of china as an economic power and with us economic ties with ca and mexico deepening as result of the north american free trade agreemen t nafta nevertheless analyses of trade and other economic data suggest that the bilateral relationship remains important and policy leaders of both countries face the ch allenge of how to manage it during the last decade policy leaders seem to have made deliberate effort to drastically reduce the friction that prevailed in the economic relationship on the one hand this calmer environment has stabilized the bilatera l relationship and permitted the two countries to focus their attention on other issues of mutual interest such as national security on the other hand as so have argued the friendlier environment masks serious problems that require more attention such as continuing japanese failure to resolve longstanding market access barriers to us exports of autos and auto parts and flat glass and the failure of the two countries to reduce bilateral trade imbalances failure to resolve any of these outstanding issues could cause heightened friction between the two countries issues regarding usjapan economic relations may emerge on the agenda of the 110th congress us and japanese l eaders have several options on how to manage their relationship including

economic relationship itself can influence economic conditions in other countries the shape and tone of the usjapan bilateral relations hip have changed recently with relations very tense during some periods and calm during others the means and manner by which the united st ates and japan have managed their economic relationship has also changed over time yet the two countries remain very important economic partners accounting for significant shares of each others foreign trade and investment even though their relative significance has declined the usjapan economic relationship is important to us national interests and to the us congress it has been the subject of oversight hearings and trade legislation and the congress plays critical role in shaping us economic policy toward japan to assist the congress in fulfilling its res ponsibilities this report explores 1 the significance and state of usjapan economic ties 2 how the ties have changed over time and 3 what the possible options for managing the relationship might be an overview of usjapan economic trends the us and japanese ec onomies remain closely intertwined through trade and capital flows us and japanese political leaders have not always given the us japan relationship the priority commensurate with its economic importance nevertheless the data and other indicators suggest that the relationship bears attention the japanese and us economies the us and japanese economies are in some respects very similar they are large industrialized economies th at have provided their resi dents with high standard of living however as table 1 points out they are very different in some critical ways the us economy is roughly 2½ time s larger than japans both on nominalhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32649crs2 1 purchasing power parity ppp measurements are the value of foreign currencies in us dollars based on the actual purchasing power of such currency the ppp exchange rate is then used to convert foreign economic data in national currencies into us dollarsand purchasing power parity ppp basis1 the japanese standard of living is slightly lower than the us standard of living measured on nominal per capitagdp basis and even lower when measured on ppp per capitagdp basis the latter measurement reflects the high cost in japan for food fuel and other basic necessities compared to the united states japan s also endured slow economic growth or even recessions during the past decade while us economic growth has been generally robust the us average annual gdp growth rate during the last ten years has been almost 3 times that of japans exports are more important to the japanese economy than are imports as measured as ratios to gdp while the opposite is the case for the us economy the united stat continually incurs current account deficits while japan earns current account surpluses furthermore japan has continually exceeded the united states in terms of savings the gross national savings rate in japan is more than 2 ½ times that of the united states 280 vs 102 many ec onomists consider the strong propensity to save in japan relative to the united states as the primary reason why the united states has incurred current acc ount trade deficits with japan for many years and why japan continues to be major net creditor while the united states is net debtor at the same time japan has built up huge volum of public debt nd its debt burden as ratio of gdp is more than twice that of the united states japans public debt has soared in the last decade as it has ttempted to stimulate

for example us fdi in 2006 totaled 2157 billion in the netherlands and 3641 billion in the united kingdom4 the japanese economy has been relatively closed to foreign investment and the level of foreign direct inve stment in japan consistently ranks among the lowest of industrialized countries over the years japanese investors have established strong presence in the united states japanese fdi

beach golf course these investments followed surges in japanese investments in the united states by japanese consumer electronics firms and auto producers many of these acquisitions were not profitable for japane investors the rapid increase of the investments and their high visibility generated concerns in the united states of japan buying up the united states by 2000 the level of ja panese fdi in the united states rose to 1597 billion but declined to 14740 billion by 2002 the level of japans fdi in the united states has increased since reaching 2110 billion in 2006 in

billion in us corporate stocks and 2435 billion in us corporate bonds7 japanese investors are by far the lead ing foreign holders of us treasury securities that finance the us national debt and their importance has soared over the last few years by the end of 2006 japanese residents held 63340 billion in us securities more than the amount held by residents of mainland china 4391 billion and the united kingdom 365 b illion8 japanese holdings of us treasury securities are especially important and underscore the debtorcreditor link between the united states and japan as th us government continues to incur budget deficits and maintain s low national savings rate the united states has had to rely increasingly on foreign creditors to finance the rising national debt this has some potentially problematic implications for us interest rates for example if japanese investors decided to switch their foreign investment from us treasury securities to eurodenominated securities or if japans saving s rate should decline as older japanese citizens spend down their savings and capital begins to flow back to japan us interest rates would likely rise all other factor s remaining unchanged the bilateral economic relationship and shifting us and japanese policy priorities by necessity the united states and ja pan had long given their bilateral economic relationship high pr iority for japan the importance of the relationship has been rooted in the emergence of the united states as the worlds largest economic power japans dependence on the united states for national security especially during the cold war the depende nce of japanese ma nufacturing industries autos consumer electronics and othe rs on exports to the united states and the reliance of reformminded japanese political leaders on us pressure gaiatsu httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32649crs8 9 for example clyde v prestowitz trading places how we allowed japan to take the lead new york basic books 1988 10 crs calculations based on oecd data fo r review and analysis of the factors contributing to japanese economic problems see crs report rl30176 japans economic miracle what happened by william h cooperto press for economic reforms in political system that strongly protects the status quo for the united states the importance of the economic relationship with japan has been grounded in its reliance on japan as critical ally the emergence of japan in the postworld war ii period as an econo mic power in east asia and the second largest economy in the world the advancing compe tition from japanese manufacturers in industries for exampl autos and steel which employ large numbers of us workers the rising trade deficits with japan japans emergence as major source of investment in the unite d states and japanese government policies that have protected vulnerabl sectors and assisted exporters often at the expense of us competitors for many years the bilateral economic relationship was the centerpiece of us and japanese foreign economic agendas and japan trade strongly influenced the making of overall us trade policy for example persistent and growing us trade deficits with japan led the us congress to develop and pass ma jor trade legislation such as the super 301 provision of the omnibus trade and competitiveness act of 1988 pl 100418 problems in usjapan economic relations especially the notion that japan was outcompeting the ited states dominated the trade policy debate many scholarly nd popular books and journals were written on the subject9 while the united states and japan consider their bilateral economic relationship important it has diminished as priority and has merged with wider range of issues and concerns one possible reason for the shift may be japans decade of poor economic performance which changed the popul ar perception in the united states of japan as an economic threat to the ited states from 1980 through 1990 japans real adjusted for inflation average gdp growth rate was 41 per year it fell to 14 from 1991 to 2000 and to 09 from 2001 to 200310 however japan has enjoyed continuous economic grow th in the last few years second reason for the shift in priorities may be the rise of china as trade power since 2000 the us bilateral trad deficit with china has exceeded the deficit with japan and the gap between the two deficits continues to grow in 2006 the us trade deficit with japan wa s 828 billion the one with china was 2563 billion the growing deficit with china s forced us policymakers to address actions by china that us companies have asserted are unfair these include barriers to us exports inadequate protection of intellectual property rights an arguably undervalued exchange rate and sales of products in the unite d states at less than fair value for japan china has emerged as major economic competitor andor partner in the region requiring more attention httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32649crs9 11 for more information on japans ftas see crs report rl33044 japans free trade agreement program by raymond ahearnother possible reasons for the shift in policy priorities might include the following foreign policy and national secu rity concerns have trumped commercial concerns especially after the events of september 11 2001 and the increasing instability on the korean peninsula caused by north koreas nuclear ambitions the establishment in 1995 of the world trade organization and restructured dispute settlement body has lessened the scope for us unilateral trade pressures to open japans market further the emergence also of reform oriented government under prime minister koizumi diminished the perception that heavyhanded gaiatsu is an effective policy to influence japanese economic policy however some observers have ra ised concerns that koizumis successor shinzo abe is not as committed to economic reform japans success in the 1990s at re sisting us pressure may have created sense that us influence over japan was limited the united states and japan have been forging economic relations with other countries and regions through free trade ag reements ftas which has reduced the focus on their own bilateral relations in the last few years the united states has entered into ftas with jordan 2001 chile 2004 singapore 2004 australia 2005 morocco 2006 bahrain 2006 nd the dominican republic and central america drcafta 2007 and other agreem ents have either been completed or are still under negotiation the bush admi nistration has also launched initiatives with the asean members the enterpri for asean initiative and countries of the middle east the middle east free trade initiative which could lead to free trade arrangements the ftas are part of the bush administrations competitive liberalization trade strategy which focuses on pursuing trade agreements on multiple fronts japan entered into its first fta with singapore in november 2002 in addition to the singapore agreement japan is building its economic presence in east asia by negotiating ftas with south korea malaysia thailand the phillippines and mexico11 the agreement with mexico is noteworthy because japan had to make concessions on agricultural imports before mexico would conclude the agreement japan avoided this step with singapore si nce agricultural trade is not an important issue between the two countries japan wa s compelled to make the concessions and conclude the agreement because japanese exporters face high tariff barriers in mexico and have been at competitive disadvantage with us and eu producers who do not face similarly high tariffs under ftas with mexicohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32649crs10 12 for more details about the history of the special usjapan bilateral frameworks see appendix the bilateral negotiating framework on june 30 2001 president bush and th enprime minister koizumi announced the formation of new bilateral framewo rk the usjapan economic partnership for growth the economic partnership in so doing the bush administration continued tradition of creating special frameworks as mechanisms for discussing bilateral economic issues w ith japan unique approach in us trade policy negotiating precedents the special bilateral frameworks have rved several purposes to define the issues that plague the relationship to establish goals and methodologies to resolve problems and to create the bureaucratic structures and momentum to launch and maintain the negotiations the frameworks shared characteristics that reflected the dominance of the united states in the relationship and the nature of the trade issues their objectives were largely oneway japan was to remove obstacles to trade and investment while the united states was not required to make concessions they were intended to pressu re japan to reduce or remove government policies or practices that acted as informal barriers to imports and investment they contained an explicit or implicit penalty for japan such as restrictions on japanese exporters access to us markets they were largely outside the general agreement on tariffs and trade gattwto trade structure which did not cover targeted japanese policie s and practices they were designed to affect areas that would reap the greatest benefits to us exporters and investors even though the most favorednation mfn principle that binds all gattwto members by requiring that the concessions japan made should apply to its trade with all wto members the reagan administration introduced the first multisector negotiating framework the marketoriented secto rselective moss talks with japan in march 1985 the moss talk s covered japanese trade in five areas telecommunications medical equipment and pharmaceuticals forestry products electronics and auto parts12 in 1989 president george h w bush launched with prime minister the structural impediments initiative sii that targeted broad range of japanese macroecono mic policies practices and ot her structural factors that underlay the persistent usjapan trade imbalances focusing on the inability of us exporters and investors to penetrate or increase their presence in the japanese markethttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32649crs11 in 1993 the clinton administration negotiated the united statesjapan framework for new economic partnershi p at the insistence of the clinton administration objective crite ria were to be used to determine whether japan was fulfilling its obligations under the frame work this element proved highly controversial and the two c ountries never agreed on the role the objective criteria would play or for that matter what they would be japan did not want to be bound by what it termed managed trade nevertheless by june 1997 the united states and japan had addresse d if not resolved the major issues under the framework in its place the clinton administration got japan to agree to another more loosely shaped format the enhanced initiative on deregulation and competition policy the enhanced initiative this format did not have the specific resultsoriented elements of the previous framework the reagan george hw bush and c linton administrations also negotiated sectorspecific trade issues with japan outside of the framework format for example the reagan administration obtai ned socalled voluntar export restraint ver agreements under which japan agreed to limit exports of autos and steel products to the united states in 1985 the ited states and japan along with other g7 industrialized countries negotiated the plaza accord to promote realignment of the dollar and the yen other agreements were directed at market access in japan for constructions services telecommunications equipment certain agricultural products autos and auto parts and flat glass among others of particular note is the 1986 semiconductor agreement in which the reagan administration got japan to agree to cease dumping semiconductors in the united states and to open its market to u s exporters of semiconductors the semiconductor agreement was milestone in usjapanese trade relations because it included in sideletter minimum target of 20 share of the japanese market for us exporters of semiconducto rs to attain the united states imposed sanctions in 1987 in the form of higher tariffs on imports of selected japanese electronic products when the share did not reach 20 the semiconductor agreement is considered to have been the model for the objective criteria measures that the clinton administration demanded in the framework it used with japan the sanctions that resulted from the semiconductor agreement were also reason japan strongly resisted the use of objective criteria in 1991 the semiconductor agreement was renewed with the 20 share embedded directly in the agreement language it expired in 1996 and was replaced by pact among severa l countries to monitor semiconductor trade the bush administrations economic partnership the bush administrations economic partnership framework closely follows on the clinton enhanced initiative the economic partne rship emphasizes macroeconomic and structural issues that have hampered japa nese economic growth but also examines issues of the us economy the economic partnership consists of several initiatives or dialogues to include participation from subcabinetlevel leaders from both governments and participation from members of the business communities and other nongovernment sectors from both countries the usjapan subcab inet economic dialog ue provides overall direction for the

private sector representatives to work on pertin ent issues and to provide input to the government participants issues that th united states and japan discuss under the economic partnership are deta iled below the united stat has not negotiated any new sectorspecific agreements although bilateral discussions of pending issues continue under previous agreements the wto dispute settlement mechanism in addition to negotiations under the economic partnership framework the united states and japan are using the dispute settlement mechanism in the world trade organization wto more frequently to resolve bilateral issues in so doing the united states and japan have helped to depoliticize their trade disagreements leaving it to panel members selected from trading partner nations to adjudicate the disputes furthermore the wto has pr ovided forum in which japan has felt comfortable challenging us trade practices increased reliance on the wto has reflected major shift in japans strategy in dealing with the united states in trade in 1995 japan filed dispute with the wto as countercomplaint against us complaint against japan on the sale of autos and auto parts for details see appendix the two c ountries reached resolution outside the wto but it was the first time that japan had challenged the united states rather than acceding to us demands japan was emboldened to shift its strategy in 1997 when the wto ruled against the united states on its complaint against japan regarding the marketing of kodak and fuji film in japan13 however the united states has also challenged japan successfully in the wto these and other major pending issues in usjapan econo mic relations are discussed below issues and prospects recently usjapan economic ties have become less contentious

problems us firms have with japan some of these regulations are products of the imme diate postworld war ii era when japan was rebuilding its economy others came ter these regulations have contributed to inefficiency and low productivity in some economic sectors they have been factor in the limited choices that japanese consumers have d in food and other products and also have resulte d in the

difficulty in streamlining them recent japanese governments have undertaken deregulation nd have succeeded somewhat the government of prime minister koizumi initiated program of special zones for

permanent bureaucracies of the ministries ministry of finance minist ry of agriculture and ministry of construction that implement the regulations and that would lose authority if extensive deregulation were to take place the united states has focused its r ecommendations to japan on the following areas in telecommunications the united states has argued among other things that nippon

have claimed and the wto has ruled that the practice violates wto rules24 doha more broadly japan and the unite d states are major supporters of the doha development agenda dda the test round of negotiations in the wto yet the two have taken dive rgent positions in some critical areas of the agenda for example the united states australia and other major agricultural exporting countries have pressed for th reduction or removal of ba rriers to agricultural imports and subsidies of agricultural production position strongly opposed by japan at the same time japan and others have argued that national antidumping laws and actions that member countri have taken should be ex amined during the dda with the possibility of changing them position that the united states has opposed prospects and policy options the usjapan economic relationship is very strong and mutually important the two economies are highly integrated via trade in goods and services more importantly japan and the united states are connected via capital flows japan is the largest foreign source of financing of the u s national debt and is expected to remain so for the foreseeable future as the mountin g us debt needs to be financed and the stock of us domestic savi ngs remains insufficient to meet the demand japan is also significant source of foreign privat portfolio and direct investment in the united states and the united states is the origin of much of the stock of foreign investment in japan the relative significance of japan and the united states as each others economic partner has diminishe d somewhat with the rise of china as an economic power and with deepening us economic tie s with canada and mexico as result of the north american free trade agreemen t nafta nevertheless analyses of trade and other economic data suggest that policy leaders of both countries face the challenge of successfully managing critical economic relationship during the last decade policy leaders seem to have made deliberate effort to drastically reduce the friction that prevailed in the economic relationship on the one hand this calmer environment has stabilized the bilatera l relationship and permitted the two countries to focus their attention on other issues of mutual interest such as national security on the other hand as so have argued the friendlier environment masks serious problems that require more attention such as continuing japanese failure to resolve longstanding market access barriers to us exports of autos and flat glass and the continuing presence of bilateral trade imbalances failure to resolve any of these outstanding issues c ould cause friction to heighten between the two countries as japan and the united states continue to manage their economic relationship they have at least three options on how to proceed these are not necessarily mutually exclusive options but could be employed more or less in tandem httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32649crs22 25 see for example c fred

increasingly on the wto dispute settlement mechanism to resolve bilateral issues by taking more lingering issues to the wto for resolution25 this option could help to promote stability in the bilateral relationship by containing political fricti on like that which erupted in the 1980s and 1990s in addition it could lessen the percep tion that many japa nese have had that the united states was acting unilaterally in making its demands on japan to open up its markets and in threatening to limit market access to japanese exporters in retaliation the wto could provide at the least the semblance of neutrality where both countries could anticipate fair treatment by their peers potentially major constraint on the use of this option is the limited scope of the wtos coverage number of longsta nding issues in usjapan economic ties pertains to competition policy that is how governments use their authority to ensure fair competition among producers althoug h the wto membership is in the midst of the doha development agenda dda round of negotiations to broaden the wto rules they have removed competition policy from the agenda however the wto could be used to resolve issues that come under its purview which may grow as negotiations in the doha deve lopment agenda round progress special frameworks second option would be to discuss economic ties through special framework andor sect orspecific agreemen ts these frameworks allow each country to raise issues that are not subject to international rules but nevertheless cause problems in the relations hip in addition they provide forum for officials to address issues before they emerge as fullfledge d disputes however the record with respect to special framewo rks such as the marketoriented sector selective moss talks and the structural impediments initiative sii is mixed while the united states and japan have ach ieved some successes number of issues seems to have lingered over the years reappearing in successive frameworks similarly the record of sectorspecific agreements such as flatglass and autos and auto parts reflects only partial success it was reported on november 13 2006 that president bush and prime minister abe may introduce new bilateral framework that concentrates on issues of mutual interest such as intellectual property rights protection26 fta third option would be for the united states and japan to form comprehensive bilateral free trade agreement fta this option might prove attractive because tariffs and other customs restrictions on usjapan bilateral trade are already low or nonexistent providing foundation on which to build an fta in addition proponents would argue that th two countries could construct the fta to cover policies and practices that are critical to the

relationship has meant cooperating in areas of mutual agreement and addressing problems in manner that meets the national interest of each country while maintaining the integrity of the alliance while the two countries have succeeded in doing this by and large trade frictions became heated at times making relations difficult the united states dominated the economic relationship with japan for many years after world war ii the united stat was by far the largest economy in the world and japan was dependent on the unite d states for national security the united states set the agenda and the issues on the agenda were driven by the us demands for japan to curb exports to the united states andor to remove barriers to us exports and investments until recently the united states and japan largely at the instigation of the united states had used special bilateral frameworks and agreements to conduct their governmenttogovernment economic relations some of these mechanisms were designed to address trade nd investment barriers in japa n that were productspecific for example semiconductors and autos and ot hers were designed generic barriers that affected many sectors the japanese retail distribution system the reagan administration introduced the first multisector negotiating framework the marketoriented sectors pecific moss talks with japan in march 1985 the process resulted from disc ussions between president reagan and prime minister nakas one to find way to deal with trade issues that had been clouding the relationship for some time th initial set of nego tiations covered four sectors telecommunications medical equipment and pharmaceuticals forestry products and electronics the two countries added auto part s later the sectors were selected because of the potential for us companies to increase xports to the japanese markets if the barriers were re moved they were also sectors in which multiple japanese government barriers to imports existed the united states and japan reached agreement in all of the moss sectors 1988 general accounting office gao study concluded that us ex ports in each of the selected sectors except auto parts increased but that improved market access does not necessarily guarantee huge increases in exports30 macroeconomic trends and other factors also play role that could trump market access in march 1989 president george hw bu sh with prime mini ster launched the structural impediments initiative sii that targeted broad range of japanese macroeconomic policies and practices and structural factors that underlay the persistent usjapan trade imbalances and the inability of us exporters and investors to penetrate or increase their presence the japanese market the sii was pioneering effort in that us negotiators targeted japanese barriers that were citedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32649crs25 by not only american exporters and investors but also by japanese academics business leaders and politicians in so doing the us side sought to increase the possibility of successful outcome if it had domestic constituency in japan that would be working to achieve the same goal in addition the targeted policies and practices were ones that we re fundamental to japane economic life and had not been subject to bilateral negotiation thes targets were japans high savingslow investment imbalance that many economists attribute its perennial current account surpluses the japanese retail distribution system particularly its largeretail store law that favored small mom and pop enterprises at the expense of larger operations such as toys r us land use policies that inhibited the market entry of new firms and kept land prices high the keiretsu business conglomerates that both japanese and us experts blamed as barrier to the entry of new japanese and foreign firms to the japanese market excl usionary business practices such as the formation of cartels to limit competition and business pricing practices under which japanese companies would ll products at premium in japan so that they could undersell their competitors in the us market the sii also included us policies and practices such as the low us savings rate that japanese negotiators asserted was cause of us trade deficits this element was an attempt to make the format more balanced however it was generally understood that the real focus of the sii was japanese barriers the sii process operated throughout th four years of the george hw bush administration us and japanese negotia tors met periodically and reported annually on progress made in resolving the offensive policies and practices the results of the sii process are mixed on the one hand it focused ttention of policymakers of both sides on fundamental causes of problems that cut across many sectors and economic activities the sii is also credited with placing nough pressure on japan to change its large retail store law some observers also argued that by selecting policies and practices that many japanese themselves wanted changed the united states lessened the unilateral thrust of previous negotiations on the othe r hand many of the problems that had plagued the usjapan relationship before the sii remain such as the trade imbalances the clinton administration negotiated is own bilateral framework with japan the united statesjapan framework fo r new economic partnership borrowed elements from the moss and the sii processes by including some sector specific goals along with overall structural and macroeconomic issues these goals were included in five baskets this framewo rk departed from the others in several important ways it obligated the president and the prime minister to meet at least twice year to review progress under frame work at the insistence of the clinton administration objective criteria were to used to determine whether japan was fulfilling its obligations under the frame work this element proved highly controversial and the two c ountries never agreed on the role the objective criteria would play or for that matter what they would be the united states argued the criteria were to be targets japan was to meet while ja pan did not want to be bound by such criteria and argued that the criteria were to be guidelines the differences over objective criteria reached the summit vel and strained usjapan relations the united

example the united states was on th brink of imposing tariffsanctions on japan and both countries were poised to take one anothe r to the wto before they reached agreement on japanese imports of au tos and auto parts usjapanese trade friction reached its peak during the period of that framework that roughly corresponds to the first clinton administra tion the friction was due in part to the longrunning frustration that us exporters and investors were experiencing with the same obstacles that previ ous agreements were supposed to have addressed the resultsoriented strategy was intended to provide clear indicat or of whether japan had removed the barriers but japan resisted such objective indicators because it argued the problems in usjapan trade stemmed from private sector practices and not government policies the framework raised the issues to the summit level to ensure that both sides took the issues seriously by doing so however the framework increased the risk that failure to achieve results would sour the entire relationship with the completion of the auto and auto parts agreement in 1995 most trade issues in the framework had been completed the clinton administration closed the books on the framework in its place it got japan to agree in june 1997 to another more loosely shaped format the enhanced initiative on deregulation and competition policy the enhanced initiative this format did not have the results oriented elements of the previous framework it was mechanism for exchanging views on some of the fundamental aspect s of the japanese economy that limited competition and were likely preventing japan from emerging from the economic malaise that had set in these issues had not received as much attention in previous negotiations the united states focused on getting japan to change regulations and competition policies affecting telecommunications medical devices and pharmaceuticals and financial services as well as more generic issues such as competition policy and regulation transparency31 the enhanced initiative marked turning point in the overall usjapan relationship as economic relations became less prominent while negotiators continued to meet to exchange views and monitor progress under the initiative and previous agreements the issues did not have the importance at the summit level they once had national security issues had become more dominant in the bilateral relationship
