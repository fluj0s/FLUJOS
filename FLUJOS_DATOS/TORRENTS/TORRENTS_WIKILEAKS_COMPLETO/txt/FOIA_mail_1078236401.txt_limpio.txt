from phil jones pjonesueaacuk to ben santer santer1llnlgov subject re fwd more pcmera40 comparisons date tue mar 2 090641 2004 ben thanks for the plots and keeping up to date the era40cru comparisons are quite interesting im hopeful adrian will write up summary for publication in addition to an ecmwf report this sort of thing is important wrt ipcc and also papers such as kalnay and cai im also working with russ vose and others at ncdc to get comparison of crughcn and nasa datasets in grl ncdc have used their first difference technique with cru data differences are very very small due to data and the technique doesnt matter much either all seems to boil down to how the global average is defined calculated as one domain as ncdc and until recently the hc as well want to do it it is biased to the nh if you do it the cru way g05nhsh then it looks much more like an oa version of hadcrut2v that the hc have just produced been saying this for years as has tom so surprises finally got the hc to realise it now just need to convince ncdc ncdc will also have new 5 by 5 deg gridded dataset of tx and tn soon right up to the present need to compare this with era40 cheers phil at 1846 01032004 0800 you wrote dear phil here are the pcmera40 2m temperature comparisons that i mentioned in my email to adrian cheers ben pcmdi has moved to new building note change of mail code benjamin d

comparison of surface air temperature changes in cru and era40 ive been looking at related issue the correspondence between 2m temperature changes in era40 and pcm heres the background to this work increasingly there is some interest in the problem of identifying anthropogenic climate change at regional scales i have to give brief talk on this subject tomorrow in preparing for this talk i decided that it would be useful to show how signal and noise change as function of spatial scale i looked at the behavior of 2m temperature in the four individual realizations of the pcm all forcings experiment the same experiment that we analysed in our joint nature paper for each realization i computed spatial averages over the globe the northern hemisphere and the western united states 3050n 126w114w these spatial averages were then expressed as anomalies relative to climatological monthly means over 19791999 the orange shading in the three panels of the figure entitled tas_tseries3ps is measure of the betweenrealization variability in pcm the envelope is simply the range during any given month between the maximum and minimum values of the four realizations this range was then lowpass filtered the solid red is the lowpass filtered ensemble mean to facilitate comparison with pcm data ive defined 2m temperature anomalies in era40 in the same way ie relative to climatological monthly means over 19791999 and have used the same lowpass filter one can then ask whether the 2m temperature changes in era40 are consistent with those in pcm in other words are they encompassed by pcms envelope of possible climate responses to combined anthropogenic and natural forcing they are surprisingly this consistency occurs not only at the globalmean level but also for the nh and western us for the globalmean and the nh the era40 2m temperature changes are outside pcms envelope of 2m temperature changes during the first 510 years of the reanalysis after the late 1960s however the era40 2m temperature changes are entirely consistent with those in pcm over the western us 2m temperature changes in pcm and era40 are consistent throughout the reanalysis period such qualitative consistency while interesting is substitute for formal patternbased fingerprint detection studies at global hemispheric and regional scales for example an overestimate of the regionalscale variability of 2m temperature by pcm could explain why pcms 2m temperature changes over the western us fully encompass the era40 result see panel c on the other hand there is some real similarity in the lowfrequency component of the 2m temperature changes in era40 and pcm look at the similar responses to agung chichon and pinatubo in panel b the bottom line is that pcms 2m temperature changes are reasonably consistent with those in era40 even at subglobal spatial scales this suggests that formal regionalscale detection work might be useful if you are interested perhaps we could collaborate on such work collaboration would also involve the pcm group at ncar to whom im copying this email the second figure that ive appended shows the globalmean changes in synthetic msu channel 2 temperatures in pcm and era40 the message is pretty much the same as for 2m temperatures pcms envelope of possible changes in tropospheric temperatures largely encompasses the era40 results except during few large nino and nina events once again there is surprising similarity in the lowfrequency component of the model and reanalysis t2 changes it would be fun to take these simple comparisons little further with
