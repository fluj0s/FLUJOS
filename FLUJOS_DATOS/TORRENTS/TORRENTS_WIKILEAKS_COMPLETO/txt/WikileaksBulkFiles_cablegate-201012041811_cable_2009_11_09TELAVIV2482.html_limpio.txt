retransmission of usdao tel aviv 3188 1 c summary on november 1 and 2 assistant secretary of defense asd for international security affairs ambassador alexander vershbow met with number of senior israeli defense officials in israel including ministry of defense mod director general dg pinchas buchris head of mod political military bureau amos gilad assistant chief of defense major general mg benny gantz and head of mod intelligence analysis production brigadier general yossi baidatz the israelis expressed positive views on continued usisrael cooperation particularly on israels qualitative military edge qme and the ongoing juniper cobra missile defense exercise israeli officials explained that they were going through an unprecedented period of calm due to the deterrent effect of operation cast lead but that below the surface were number of significant dangers they continued to emphasize that iran represents the greatest strategic threat to the region both its nuclear program and its axis with syria hezbollah and hamas they also expressed skepticism about palestinian president abbass future given his weakened position as result of his handling of the goldstone report and his inability to get the full settlement freeze he had pushed for they questioned his ability to restart peace negotiations israeli officials were concerned about the deteriorating turkeyisrael relationship and discussed threats emanating from both syria and lebanon end summary bilateral relations 2 s asd vershbows trip to israel came as number of highlevel israeli and american officials were meeting on key issues on october 31 secretary of state clinton arrived in jerusalem for talks on the peace process with prime minister netanyahu defense minister barak and foreign minster lieberman in addition eucom commander admiral stavridis arrived in israel on november 1 to observe the juniper cobra10 ballistic missile defense exercise the asds visit also came in the wake of recent highlevel discussions on israels qme in washington and the october 21 meeting of the joint politicomilitary group in tel aviv 3 s on qme asd vershbow asked for israels assessment of recent discussions and across the board israeli officials expressed gratitude for us efforts on this front and voiced optimism on the steps moving forward amos gilad acknowledged the sometimes difficult position the us finds itself in given its global interests and conceded that israels security focus is so narrow that its qme concerns often clash with broader american security interests in the region israeli officials acknowledged the impressive nature of the qme dialogue mechanisms recently established but stated that the results of the process are what truly matter mg benny gantz defined successful qme relations as the effective process plus the right mitigations while not explicitly saying it gantz seemed to acknowledge that israel does not expect that all qme decisions will break in its favor but that israel only expects fair and equitable process that incorporates intimate dialogue dg buchris thanked versbhow for the recent success of the jpmg and said he looks forward to convening the first meeting of the agreed upon working groups by the end of november vershbow stated that the technical working group discussions would be launched soon and that he was looking forward to future israeli participation on this issue iran remains top of mind 4 s israeli officials continue to uniformly emphasize that irans nuclear program and regional hegemonic ambitions are the greatest strategic threats to israel they view iran as the center of radical axis that includes syria hezbollah and hamas 5 snf israel continues to offer worstcase assessment of the iranian nuclear program emphasizing that the window for stopping the program by military means if necessary is rapidly closing general baidatz argued that it would take iran one year to obtain nuclear weapon and two and half years to build an arsenal of three weapons by 2012 iran would be able to build one weapon within weeks and an arsenal within six months comment it is unclear if the israelis firmly believe this or are using worstcase estimates to raise greater urgency from the united states amos gilad explained his view of the repercussions of an iranian nuclear capability stating that it would give iran free hand in supporting hamastan in gaza and hezbollahstan in lebanon gilad also argued that saudi arabia would definitely react to nuclear iran by obtaining weapon with pakistani assistance and egypt would almost certainly follow he was less sure about whether turkey would respond by pursuing nuclear weapon regardless the security situation in the region surrounding israel would be dramatically altered should iran acquire nuclear weapons capability 6 snf asd vershbow queried various israeli officials about their view of the tehran research reactor trr proposal and irans recent equivocation on the agreement israeli officials uniformly expressed support for the agreement but made clear that by itself it was not sufficient they stated that it was only one stop on the way to containing the iranian nuclear program and that it must be followed by freezeforfreeze agreement and eventually the full suspension of uranium enrichment as well as the end of work on the newly disclosed site at qom they warned that the trr agreement by itself could serve as major victory for iran if it legitimized in the worlds eyes irans right to enrich uranium on its own soil none of the israeli officials expressed surprise about irans apparent reversal on the trr agreement as they viewed this as typical iranian negotiating style and part of an iranian strategy of delay amos gilad stated that iran would never agree to anything that contradicted its overall strategic goal of achieving nuclear weapons capability 7 s when queried about how the us views the iranian response asd vershbow explained that the united states was still seeking greater clarity on what was the real iranian bottom line we may need time to ascertain whether irans response was in fact serious walkback or whether it would be willing to abide by the initial trr agreement that had been agreed to in principle in geneva on october 1 however he also emphasized that american patience is not unlimited and that if the trr agreement did collapse the us would likely begin pursuing the pressure track 8 snf israel was also highly concerned about irans support for proxies with general baidatz emphasizing that there are multiple bases in iran where irgc quds force hezbollah hamas and palestinian islamic jihad operatives all train together and share knowledge mg gantz also emphasized irans role as weapons supplier to syria and that syria actively facilitated arms transfers to hezbollah he expressed concern about iranian shipments of weapons via sudan to egypt and into gaza on the russian delay in delivery of the s300 sa20 to iran gilad voiced satisfaction with the train of events acknowledging prime minister netanyahus secret visit to moscow and president obamas engagement with medvedev had both played role gilad was worried about russian readiness to support tough sanctions on iran asd vershbow said the russians signals on sanctions were mixed but they seemed genuinely concerned about recent iranian missile tests and the revelation of the qom facility west bank and gaza 9 s of particular interest throughout the meetings was the subject of the palestinian political situation it was widely agreed that president abbas is currently in weakened political state and israeli officials generally cast dour assessment of abbass future in one exchange amos gilad stated his opinion that abbas will not survive politically past the year 2011 gilad further stated that abbas is facing unprecedented criticism within the palestinian authority over his handling of the goldstone report and that this coupled with stubborn hamas has weakened abbas considerably the israelis said the perception in the arab world was that the us had encouraged abbas to take difficult positions on goldstone and settlements only to walk away from him asd vershbow queried gilad over measures that could be taken to bolster abbas gilad responded by stating that israelipalestinian peace discussions need to be resumed immediately but without preconditions and that both parties need to seek further cooperation on range of issues specifically on the security sector front gilad expressed optimism over the current atmosphere in the west bank citing improvements in the security and economic spheres and further stated that the reduced israeli defense force idf footprint in the west bank has made conditions ripe for advancing the relationship gilad closed however on sourer note by stating that the government of israel has little faith in the palestinian negotiating team 10 s asd vershbow transitioned off the political discussion to focus on the palestinian authority security force pasf specifically vershbow highlighted the concern that palestinian forces were seen as lacking real authority and therefore asked for steps that could be taken to give the pasf more visible control of security israeli officials responded by citing the decreased number of direct action incursions checkpoints and patrols and seemingly drew correlation between reduced idf activity and increased pasf authority comment despite israeli assurances us and palestinian officials continue to highlight the corrosive effect of regular israeli incursions mg gantz cited palestinian security sector reform as major accomplishment stating that ontheground coordination between the pasf and idf units has improved dramatically despite these positive developments though israeli officials repeatedly underscored the importance of retaining the right to disrupt terrorist operations in the west bank and gaza additionally they stated that if israel allowed weak and untrained security force to take over in the west bank in the short term the result will be deterioration of the israeljordan relationship over the long term the prospect of poor israelijordanian relations according to amos gilad is unacceptable and would result in the loss of strategic depth for israel 11 s asd vershbow urged his israeli counterparts not to soley focus on the shortterm here and now but rathr to envision the possible benefits that strongand viable west bank could have for israels secrity situation in the future vershbow used thi point to springboard to the issue of hamas and aza asking whether success in the west bank coud serve as magnet and help solve the gaza problem he asked if israel had made any headway in tems of an information operations campaign to better communicate with the people of gaza israeli officials offered very little in the way of communications strategy or longterm vision for the territories but reinforced israels core belief that hamas has only sinister motives and that any attempt fatah might make to improve its standing in gaza would only be met with hamas opposition general baidatz articulated israels concern by highlighting recent intelligence that hamas is trying to acquire from iran and potentially testfired the previous weekend the 60 kmrange fajr5 rocket that could reach tel aviv these actions according to baidatz and other officials make any discussion of palestinian reconciliation both premature and unrealistic ambassador vershbow sought further clarification on this point querying israeli officials over the level of public support for hamas specifically the asd asked if there was any way to undermine support for hamas visavis the peace process amos gilad responded simply by saying that one of israels biggest concerns is the atmosphere created by disjointed peace talks specifically gilad stated that political promises of peace unification and reconciliation concepts that are never realized are only resulting in climate of uncertainty that is unhealthy on this matter gilad mentioned that egypts role in pushing reconciliation is not helpful and often counterproductive but that he expects egypt to continue floating the idea at future junctures 12 c in bringing up the goldstone report dg buchris emphasized that the government of israel took extraordinary steps to mitigate civilian casualties despite hamass deliberate use of civilians as human shields he stated that the idf made over 300000 phone calls to alert civilians before bombing legitimate military targets he also compared israeli operations in gaza to us operations in iraq and afghanistan and stated that israel would do whatever was necessary to protect its population in response asd vershbow recalled us support for israel in handling of the goldstone report and offered to share us experience in investigating incidents in iraq and afghanistan as the goi considered whether to conduct an additional investigation anxiety over turkey 13 s israeli officials also expressed growing anxiety over the turkeyisrael relationship after the turkish cancellation of israels participation in the anatolian eagle joint exercise they expressed their belief that the strategic relationship with turkey is critical but that pm erdogans views have increasingly penetrated into the military and have been part of the reason for the deterioration in relations as turkey looks east rather than west gilad believes this is understandable as turkeys eu accession prospects look increasingly doubtful and they must balance their relations with both regions to succeed 14 s baidatz stated that the turks have an agenda to contain any kurdish influence in iraq and that to achieve it they need to improve their relations with iran and syria in his view the worst possible outcome would be new turkeyiransyriairaq axis in the middle east gilad also noted that turkey wanted to improve its relationships with iran and asserted that it had made some very aggressive plans recently to support hamas however he had less pessimistic view than baidatz stating that turkey had played positive role in iraq and that generally the turks agenda was for stable iraq that would be commercially beneficial to turkey gilad stated that he was skeptical of any political rapprochement between israel and turkey in the near term but that israel would continue to foster the militarytomilitary relationship because of its strategic importance 15 c gilad also queried asd vershbow about what israel might do to improve its relationship with turkey vershbow explained that turkey wants to be influential in the region and that if it jeopardizes its relationship with israel it will undermine its status and its leverage as an evenhanded mediator he also commented that erdogans ideological views may lead him to focus on turkeys islamic neighbors but he is also realist who will not want to jeopardize turkeys ties to the us or nato the us and israel should be patient with turkey and stay engaged encouraging the turks to play constructive role in the region he stated that at the upcoming bilateral defense talks between the us and turkey in december he and under secretary flournoy would emphasize the need to improve israelturkey relations quiet on the northern border 16 s israeli officials remain pleased with the quiet nature of its northern border something they attribute to the deterrent effect israel has built up following operation cast lead and the 2006 war in lebano however according to israeli officials it i foregone conclusion that strong cooperation eists between the lebanese armed forces laf and ezbollah the level of cooperation far exceeds wht many assume is simply the daytoday problem of corruption within the ranks on the contrary israel believes that lafhezbollah cooperation is matter of national policy amos gilad attributed this dynamic to elements of nationalism stating that lebanese government and military officials choose not to confront hezbollah out of patriotic zeal moreover according to gilad any information shared with the united nations interim forcelebanon unifil goes directly to hezbollah by way of the laf 17 s israeli officials have major concerns over developments within hezbollah specifically its relationship with syria and iran general baidatz spoke of this relationship and drew attention to the existing supply of fateh110 longrange missile that iran sent to syria israeli officials believe these missiles are destined for hezbollah according to baidatz and others if the delivery were to occur this would significantly alter israels calculus under such scenario the looming question for israeli policymakers then becomes to strike or not to strike optimism on syria 18 s general baidatz offered an israeli intelligence assessment that if syria were able to achieve peace with security and obtain greater us involvement it may pull away from irans orbit he explained that president assad used his negative assets namely hezbollah and hamas to make himself relevant and that ultimately assad wants it all the golan heights peace with israel better relations with the us strong relationship with iran and continued relationship with hezbollah ultimately gen baidatz asserted that if assad had to choose one thing it would likely be peace with israel asd vershbow asked if hezbollah could be sustained without syrian support baidatz acknowledged the difficulty in answering this question but stated his belief that it would be gradual process before hezbollah could completely wean itself from the syrian support apparatus and that ultimately both hezbollahs and irans flexibility would be significantly reduced miltomil relations with egypt 19 c amos gilad commented that he would like to see complete peace with egypt but noted there was very little in the way of egyptianisraeli military relations and that egypt continued to train its military for war with israel gilad stated that egypt was not likely to attack israel and did not represent shortterm threat but that at the very least it was necessary to have modest contact between egyptian and israeli officers he expressed frustration by describing egypt and israels frozen peace and that neither side knows anything about the other he noted that the last highlevel military visit for egypt was in 1991 20 snf israeli officials agreed that egypts countersmuggling efforts have improved particularly since operation cast lead in january however they stated that gaps still exist and that egypt needs to focus its efforts on stopping bedouin smuggling in the sinai gilad said he was disillusioned with the technical monitoring solution tunnels continue and smuggling is increasing even with us assistance along borders with egypt iron dome and juniper cobra strengthening the relationship 21 s on iron dome dg buchris assisted by retired general nagel briefed asd vershbow on the latest developments stating that iron dome is planned to have an initial operating capability by the spring of 2010 and that technological advancements have made the system much more viable defending against short range rocket attacks from gaza or southern lebanon buchris also emphasized the need for additional usg support to help fund additional production of iron dome to protect the civilian population in both the north and the south buchris also noted progress on the upper and mediumtier ballistic missile defense systems arrow3 and davids sling respectively in an earlier meeting mg gantz quantified the importance of fielding adequate missile defense systems by citing critical israeli infrastructure such as ben gurion airport and the ashkelon electricity plant suffering the loss or damage of places such as these according to gantz would be major blow to israel and therefore every effort to stand up capable missile and rocket defense shield should be taken 22 s after gantz highlighted three areas of focus for the idf deterring conventional threats responding nimbly to asymmetric threats and developing an integrated missile defense system asd vershbow asked for gantzs initial impression of the juniper cobra10 exercise gantz stressed the importance of this exercise and stated that so far it had been success asd vershbow stated that the timing of juniper cobra was somewhat fortuitous given the recent developments with iran on the larger issue of missile defense asd vershbow stressed us efforts to try and persuade russia to become more involved in missile defense cooperation but stated that russias realization that the new us missile defense approach in europe is more effective than the previous one is causing the russian leadership to ask many questions about the system summary 23 s all of asd vershbows interlocutors carried consistent message emphasizing that iran remains israels greatest threat recent events have weakened president abbas the pasf have performed well in the west bank and the relative calm on all israels borders does not obscure the fact that israeli intelligence is seeing significant activity and planning by iranian surrogates namely hamas and hezbollah with facilitation from syria these threats suggest that israel must remain vigilant and prepared for the calm to end one day 24 u asd vershbow has cleared this message cunningham
