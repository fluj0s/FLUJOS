the united states and canada to develop periodic bilateral agreements to implement the psts conservation and harvestsharing principles beginning in 1993 longstanding disputes prevented such an agreement from being concluded on june 30 1999 after many years of heated dipl omatic struggles us and canadian officials reached new comprehensive agreement the 1999 agreement 1 established abundancebased fishing regimes for the pacific salmon fisheries under the jurisdiction of the pst 2 created two bilaterally managed regional restoration and enhancement endowment funds to promote cooperation improve fishery management and aid stock and habitat enhancement efforts and 3 included provisions to enhance bilateral cooperation improve the scientific basis for salmon management and apply institutional changes to the pacific salmon commission psc annex iv to the 1999 agreement outlines in detail the fishery regimes to be followed by canada and the united states in cooperatively managing the six species of anadromous pacific salmon and trout before it expires at the end of 2008 the terms of annex iv are to be renegotiated the 1999 conservation and harvestsharing agreement was of interest to congress for several reasons most notably congressional appropriation of 140 million was required to establish the agreements two regional restoration and enhanc ement endowment funds provisions of the 1999 agreement were implemented thorough additional authorizing language and amendment of the pacific salmon treaty act 16 usc 3631 et seq the 1999 agreement under the pst regime has been implemented in accordance with existing us laws pertaining to salmon conservation eg magnusonstevens fishery conservation and management act endangered species act in addition the agreements implementation determines the quantity of fish available for commercial recreational and subsistence fisheries as well as indian treaty allocations many complex issues continue to challenge the psc and the parties several of these will likely be addressed in the renegotiation of the expiring annex iv fisheries regimes many participants believe that the most difficult issue associated w ith the renegotiation concerns the fishery regime for chinook salmon found in chapter 3 of annex iv the problems arising from the status eg us endangered and threatened species listing of certain runs of chinook salmon in washington oregon idaho and perhaps british columbia may pose particular challenges for the negotiators additional concerns have arisen from canada over increasing bycatch of chinook salmon by the us pollock fishery in the bering sea as ma ny of these fish are bound for the yukon river including canadian tributaries this report provides historical background about the pst

and canadian officials signed new comprehensive agreement to resolve longstanding disputes and to ensure implementation of the conservation and harvestsharing principles of the 1985 pacific salmon treaty pst after years of failed negotiations combination of resource management studies jointfishery restrictions to protect wild salmon stocks and the involvement of highlevel government negotiators helped ease tensions between the united states and canada over the shared harvest of pacific salmon moreover the two nations recognized that failure to reach longterm conservation and harvestsharing agreement was in ones best interest the provisions in this agreements annex iv outline in detail the fishery regimes to be followed by canada and the united states in cooperatively managing the five species of pacific salmon annex iv generally applies through 2008 1 and discussions have begun on its renegotiation this report provides historical background about the pst discusses issues that created difficulties in the regime summarizes the 1999 salmon accord and analyzes issues related to the renegotiation of annex iv the 1999 agreement 1 established abundancebased fishing regimes for the pacific salmon fisheries under the jurisdiction of the pst 2 created two bilaterally managed regional restoration and enhancement endowment funds to promote cooperation improve fishery management and aid stock and habitat enhancement efforts and 3 included provisions to enhance bilateral cooperation improve the scientific basis for salmon management and apply institutional changes to the pacific salmon commission psc pacific salmon have long been matter of common concern to the united states and canada in the 1800s with the advent of canning technologies extensive commercial salmon fisheries developed in both countries since their inception salmon fisheries have experienced strong fluctuations in catch and stock abundance periods of great plenty were often followed by years of low returns by the 20 th century it had become obvious that the combined effects of fishing and natural variability in abundance could lead to overharvest the united states and canada recognized that some form of cooperation would be necessary for the sake of the resource for many years piecemeal agreements were forged to protect specific fisheries such as fraser river sockeye and pink salmon2 however because of the diversity in salmon fisheries and recurring disagreements over how best to address the interception problem3 these agreements proved inadequate in 1985 the pst4 created an arrangement for cooperative management research and enhancement of all intercepted pacific salmon stocks the goal of the pst is coordinated management of pacific salmon throughout their range to ensure sustainable fisheries and maximize longterm benefits to the parties 1 chapter 4 of annex iv fraser river sockeye and pink salmon applies thorough 2010 2 the fraser river convention discussed below 3 interception means the capture of salmon originating in one country by the fishing fleets of another salmon intermingle as they migrate from the north pacific ocean back to their natal rivers crossing the international boundaries of the united states and canada some salmon returning to spawn in canadian rivers are incidentally captured intercepted in us fisherie s and some returning to us

strained diplomatic relations between the united states and canada and the parties fundamentally disagreed on how to achieve the conservation and harvestsharing goals established by the pst after longterm harvest agreement expired in 1992 canada argued strongly that the united states was exceeding its share of the catch under the psts benefits equivalent provisions6 in contrast the united states argued that canadian interceptions of pacific northwest washington oregon and idaho coho salmon and chinook salmon were further damaging these depleted stocks7 in years following 1992 unstated assumption of both partiesthat they would both abide by conservation measuresallowed the two countries to manage their fisheries in 1997 bilateral stakeholder talks were held in an attempt to resolve the impasse ultimately these negotiations failed to forge an agreement in august 1997 the united states and canada appointed william ruckelshaus and david strangway respectively to conduct joint investigation and to make recommendations for ending the controversy in addition washington state and canada agreed to restrict several of their fisheries to help protect wild salmon stocks however failure to reach longterm conservation and harvestsharing agreement harmed several salmon stocks and hampered the ability of washington alaska and british columbia fishermen to plan fishing seasons and budget expenses because without harvestsharing agreement yeartoyear salmon allocations were unpredictable 8 thus the 1999 agreement represented major breakthrough in longstanding contentious resource issue g10g146g156g157g152g155g146g140g138g149g561g4g138g140g148g144g155g152g158g151g141g351g561 pacific salmon are among the worlds most highly migratory anadromous fish10 they spawn in fresh water often hundreds of miles from the ocean migrate to the sea as juveniles and then disperse into the open ocean from one to several ears later they return to their natal rivers to spawn and complete their life cycle along the pacific coast of north america many juvenile salmon travel north after they enter the ocean migrating freely across the national boundaries of the united states and canada and into international waters see figure 1 there are six species11 of anadromous pacific salmon and trout chinook king salmon oncorhynchus tshawytscha sockeye red salmon nerka coho silver salmon kisutch 5 in the 1990s many salmon stocks in washington oregon california and idaho were at or near historically low levels of abundance listings under the endangered species act of 1973 16 usc

clarified as additional tag recoveries of fish from the same drainage are recorded along the populations entire migratory route 13 this report focuses on the salmon species covered by the pst however other international agreements pertaining to pacific salmon fisheries exist eg the north pacific anadromous fish commission which was established under the convention for the conservation of

river sockeye fishery by 1900 with the expansion of us purse seine fisheries us harvest quickly surpassed the canadian harvest from 1900 through 1934 us fisheries produced from 61 to 70 of the sockeye salmon canned from the fraser river run17 in 1913 crews blasting railroad rightofway through the canyon walls above the fraser river triggered massive rock slide that choked the river canyon 18 the effects of the slide were most detrimental at narrow section of the river known as hells gate blocking access to spawning areas upstream from the slide19 united states and canadian harvest of sockeye salmon dropped dramatically20 by 1918 with substantial us 14 k thomson et the influence of ocean currents on the latitude of landfall and migration speed of sockeye salmon returning to the fraser river fisheries oceanography v 1 2 1992 163179 15 trolling is vessel fishing technique whereby multiple lines with hooks are pulled behind moving vessels to catch fish 16 for example upper columbia river chinook stocks along with oregon and washington coastal chinook are predominantly wild fish that migrate far north these fish are caught in southeast alaska and northern british columbia lower columbia river chinook stocks are predominantly hatchery fish which typically do not migrate north of vancouver island these fish are caught in southern british columbia and in oceanic washington fisheries thus us hatchery salmon are caught by canadian fisheries off the west coast of vancouver island while alaskan and canadian fisheries compete for upper columbia river wild stocks because depleted wild stocks unlike hatchery stocks cannot withstand substantial fishing pressure competitive fishing begets problems for the united states concerning conservation indian treaty allocation and

could again move upstream to spawn the rise of competing us and canadian fisheries natural fluctuations in salmon stock abundance and the events at hells gate provided impetus for negotiations between the united states and canada over the cooperative management of the sockeye salmon stocks in 1937 after seven years of negotiation21 the fraser river convention22 was ratified the convention established the international pacific salmon fisheries commission with principal responsibility for protecting preserving and extending the sockeye salmon fisheries of the fraser river pink salmon were later added to the convention23 the commission operated under two objectives 1 restore fraser river sockeye runs and 2 equally divide the catch within practical limits between us and canadian fishermen24 in 1946 the commission recommended that regulations be implemented to provide closures designed to permit adequate escapement of all races of salmon comprising the run protect in the greatest possible degree the most seriously depleted runs divide the total catch as equally as might be possible between the fishermen of the two countries and permit the largest catch possible consistent with attainment of these objectives25 however because of the diversity in salmon fisheries and recurring disagreements over how best to address the interception problem the 1937 agreement eventually proved inadequate26 the fraser river convention was an ambitious experiment which unquestionably met its twofold 21 us fishermen dependent on fraser river salmon objected to ratification

of salmon passing through usual and accustomed waters 2 the rise of the recreational fishing industry which increased pressure on coho and chinook salmon 3 the advent of salmon aquaculture as powerful economic and political force 4 the increased canadian harvest of sockeye outside of convention waters made possible by new technologies that allowed canadian trollers to efficiently catch sockeye in the cean and 5 the increased catch of canadian net fisheries in northern british columbia also outside of convention waters because of these latter two points while sockeye catch in convention waters was shared equally fish caught outside of these waters and not counted under the sharingagreement reduced the us share from 50 to about 41 many us fishermen who had already lost half of their share to treaty indians were concerned that their share would continue to decline further as canadians increased fishing outside of convention waters thus these us fishermen were easily persuaded that new

has viewed this interpretation as an oversimplification believing that all of the psts principles must be considered in unison and that there is simple definition of benefits equivalent for example who benefits when salmon are caught in alaska but processed in canada32 and how are the issues of protecting fish habitat by forgoing development opportunities eg logging mining petroleum development to be balanced the memorandum of understanding mou33 which elaborated on elements within the pst provided minimal guidance it stated that because data on salmon interceptions and total production by rivers of origin are imprecise each nations method for determining benefits equivalent may differ thus the mou stated that complete and comprehensive implementation of article iii 1b would not be possible until some time in the future without identifying date or timeline the mou stated that in the short term annual fishery regimes shall be conducted in an equitable manner and that the commissions decisions take into account changes in the benefits flowing to each of the parties through alteration in fishing patterns conservation actions or as the result of changes in the abundance of the runs for the long term if it is determined that one country or the other is deriving substantially greater benefits than those provided from its rive rs it would be expected that the parties would develop phased program to eliminate the inequity within specified time period taking into account the provisions of article iii paragraph 3 of the pst ie the desirability in most cases of reducing interceptions avoiding undue disruption of existing fisheries and accounting for annual variations in abundance of stocks the mou also stated that correcting imbalances is national responsibility and may involve adjusting fishing effort or enhancement projects on regional basis and that the party with the advantage shall propose corrective measures to the psc 34 despite the joint commitment embodied in the pst to conserve and protect the shared salmon stocks the united states and canada spent many years in diplomatic stalemate and the health of the salmon stocks suffered as result35 after the initial disagreements over the equitable sharing of intermingled stocks in the early 1990s number of mechanisms were employed to resolve this issue in 1993 and 1994 canada and the united states appointed new negotiators to address the benefits equivalent principle by 1995 governmenttogovernment negotiations proved unsuccessful and new zealand ambassador christopher beebe

considerable progress this process also eventually broke down36 in august 1997 the united states and canada appointed william ruckelshaus and dr david strangway respectively to conduct joint investigation of the controversy and to make recommendations for ending it their report37 published in january 1998 contained four specific recommendations 1 the governments should cause to be adopted interim fishingsharing arrangements for up to two years stressing that it was incu mbent on the governments to ensure that these arrangements are developed and implemented 2 during the twoyear period both parties should develop practical framework for implementing article iii ie leading to establishment of longterm fishing arrangements 3 the stakeholder process should not be reconvened 4 the parties should also undertake comprehensive review of the psc and dedicate themselves to making it functional institution for preserving and managing pacific salmon 38 they concluded that to accomplish their recommendations meaningful compromises of positions strongly held will be necessary moreover to ensure longterm sustainability of the shared resource rules must be established for the preservation of the salmon and time is not on their side 39 disparate efforts to protect and conserve salmon habitat which contributed to the relatively weak southern stocks and more robust northern stocks may be equally to blame for the lack of stability in the pst regime southern boundary stocks g pacific northwest chinook salmon have suffered extensively from habitat degradation most salmon stocks in the pacific northwest and few in some areas of southern british columbia have been subjected to major habitat damage from dams irrigation projects agriculture logging ports and pollution such habitat damage can degrade salmon production without the damaging activity bearing any of the related costs of resource conservation significant problem with the pst was that the framers did not anticipate the magnitude of harm caused by nonfishing activities on pacific northwest stocks and some isolated canadian chinook stocks 40 36 ibid p 5 37 david w strangway and william d ruckelshaus

washingtonoregon and the treaty tribes are often competing and in the past have impaired the ability of the us section to arrive at unified position50 observers of the process suggest that an overarching difficulty that hindered past attempts to reach consensus is the lack of requirement compelling the us and canadian parties to reach an agreement related to this is the absence of any penalty for nonresolution because both countries could continue to fish in the absence of an agreed harvest regime there is incentive to reach agreement and the parties can abandon negotiations without fear of consequences in sum because the us section is required by law to work by consensus the psc cannot make recommendations to the parties without the approv of all voting members of the us

the pst that is larger catches will be allowed when salmon abundance is higher and catches will be significantly constrained in years when stock abundance is lower it was believed that this type of regime would be more responsive to the conservation requirements of salmon than the fixedcatch ceilings53 that existed under the original pst arrangements54 additionally under the agreement two bilaterall managed regional restoration and enhancement endowment funds were established these funds are used to promote bilateral cooperation improve fishery management and aid stock and habitat enhancement efforts to improve the status of weakened salmon stocks the agreement also included provisions to enhance bilateral cooperation improve the scientific basis for salmon management and apply institutional changes to the psc at the heart of the new accord was agreement between the parties to focus on conservation and habitat protection rather than division of shared salmon stocks the 1999 agreement renewed cooperation between the united states and canada concerning the management of salmon ensured that the conservation and harvestsharing principles of the 1985 pst were realized stabilized the management regime and provided firm and complementary base for other salmon recovery efforts such as habitat restoration underway in both countries to restore depleted stocks of salmon

approach harvest rates for each salmon stock are set relative to stock abundance the objectives of abundancebased management are to sustain wild stocks prevent overfishing set predictable framework for sharing the burdens of conservation and benefits of stock recovery provide costeffective responsive fishery management and establish common basis for stock assessment fishery monitoring and performance evaluation 53 fixedcatch ceilings were specific upper limits on salmon catch that over time came to be regarded as guaranteed quotas with such view fishermen perceived right to catch these quotas regardless of whether the stocks could sustain that level of fishing such practice in period of fluctuating stock abundance and declining ocean productivity contributed to the deterioration of many stocks 54 however while generally supportive of abundancebased management for this approach to work both nations needed to develop better scientific methods for preseason estimates of stock abundance fishery managers in the past have tended to overestimate stock abundance it was questionable management presumption that reductions in catch and improvements in habitat would actually occur

regimes would be more responsive to natural stock fluctuations and more environmentally responsible to be effective this approach requires an informed preseason and responsive inseason approach to fishery management the parties surmise that by matching harvest levels to actual salmon abundance this management scheme reduces the tendency to overfish removes mortality resulting from ineffective live release practices and prevents unnecessary loss of fishing opportunities they also believed that under the 1999 accord curtailment in fishing would be shared proportionately among fishermen in all areas covered under the pst g8g146g156g145g142g155g162g561g20g142g144g146g150g142g156g561 most elements of the agreement were contained in several new chapters that replaced earlier expired versions of chapters 16 of annex iv of the pst additionally an understanding was reached regarding management of certain northern fisheries affecting coho salmon topic not specifically covered in previous agreements most of the fishery arrangements are in effect through 2008 except that for fraser river sockeye which will be in effect through 2010 the united states and canada agreed that the

addressed the management of sockeye and pink salmon fisheries in southeast alaska and northern british columbia the agreement specified how the fisheries would be managed to achieve conservation and fair sharing of salmon stocks that intermingle in the border area between british columbia and southeast alaska the fixedcatch ceilings contained in previous agreements were replaced with abundancebased provisions that allow harvests to vary from year to year depending on the abundance of salmon several provisions because they address longcontentious issues were particularly noteworthy

these stocks including habitat destruction water diversion hydroelectric dams and oceanic and climatic change the parties believed that the conservationbased fishery regimes established by the 1999 agreement would help to ensure the effectiveness of public and private investments in habitat restoration and other aspects of salmon recovery the 1999 chinook salmon regime encompassed marine and certain freshwater fisheries in alaska canada washington and oregon all chinook salmon fisheries were to be managed based on abundance rather than the fixedcatch quotas that applied previously two types of fisheries were designated 1 those that would be managed based on the aggregate abundance of chinook salmon present in the fishery and 2 those that would be managed based on the status of individual stocks or stock groups in the fishery the three fisheries designated for aggregate bundancebased management aabm were ocean fisheries that occur in large areas and affect complex aggregation of many stocks these were southeast alaska troll net and sport fisheries northern british columbia troll and queen charlotte islands sport fisheries and west coast vancouver island troll and sport fisheries each of these aabm fisheries would be managed to achieve specific harvest rate that varied based on an index of abundance of salmon present in that particular fishery for that particular year because each fishery is comprised of different group of stocks that have different survival rates the allowable catch would vary between fi sheries and between years larger catches would be allowed when abundance was greater and importantly catches would be increasingly constrained when abundance is diminished table 1 in chapter 3 of the 1999 agreements annex iv provided maximum catch targets for each of the 3 aabm fisheries through the range of chinook abundance indices all other ocean and freshwater fisheries targeting chinook salmon were designated for individual stockbased management isbm fisheries in this category included but were not limited to central british columbia troll net and sport fisheries southern british columbia marine troll net and sport fisheries other than the west coast vancouver island troll and sport fisheries and all troll net and sport marine and freshwater fisheries in oregon washington and the snake river basin in idaho the isbm fisheries generally occurred in marine waters closer to the rivers of origin or directly in the rivers these fisheries often are aimed at harvesting hatcheryproduced salmon or species other than chinook the catch in these fisheries is comprised of relatively small number of chinook salmon stocks some of which were depleted accordingly these fisheries fell under general obligation that specified certain reductions in exploitation rates relative to 19791982 base period this general obligation required canada to maintain at least 365 reduction in fishing mortality on chinook salmon stock groups identified as depleted relative to the base period this general obligation required the united states to maintain at least 40 reduction relative to the same base period in those cases where the general obligation was insufficient to achieve escapement objectives for natural stocks additional reductions were to be taken as necessary to meet agreed escapement objectives or when taken with the general obligation were

chinook stock group during the years 19911996 the 1999 agreement provided degree of flexibility allowing us and canadian management agencies to decide how best to distribute harvest across their various fisheries to reflect domestic fishery priorities provided the overall reductions were achieved for some chinook stocks the reduction would have to be much greater than the general obligation due to the need to provide extra protection for certain very depleted stocks the general obligation did not apply to hatchery stocks or healthy natural stocks that were achieving escapement objectives and could support harvest 55 in addition to predetermined harvest schedules the 1999 agreement specified conditions eg failure of stock to meet agreed escapement objectives for 2 consecutive years under which even greater harvest reductions would apply these socalled weak stock provisions serve as safety valve to afford additional protection to stocks that may fail to respond to broader recovery programs finally the united states and canada agreed to implement by 2002 subject to improvements in technical information total mo rtality approach to chinook fisheries taking into account indirect or incidental mortality this would provide more accurate information on which to make fishery management decisions these arrangements introduced incentives to reduce incidental fishing mortality and harvest more selectively g8g155g138g156g142g155g561g20g146g159g142g155g561g21g152g140g148g142g162g142g561g138g151g141g561g18g146g151g148g561g21g138g149g150g152g151g561 the us department of state noted that although much of the structure of previous agreements relating to the fraser river was retained the 1999 agreement required substantial reduction in the us share of fraser river sockeye this reduction was phased in over three years and completed by the 2002 fishing season when this reduction was completed the us share taken in washington state fisheries was 165 of the total allowable catch in contrast the us share of fraser river sockeye as specified in the original annex iv to the 1985 pst was approximately 26 to mitigate the effect of the reduced share on commercial fishermen in washington state the washington state legislature and the us federal government were to be asked to contribute to fishing vessel license buyback program 56 this program resulted in the removal of significant portion of the washington sockeye fishery because the buyout affected only the nonindian share the usual 5050 sharing rule per the boldt decision 57 in washington was altered the shares resulting from the revised sharing rule were 68 for the treaty tribes and 32 for the non tribal fishermen this revised sharing rule applied only to us harvest of fraser river sockeye the us share of fraser river pink salmon was 257 of the total allowable catch58 55 neither these stocks nor how health was to be determined were specified in the information provided by the us department of state or the canadian department of fisheries and oceans 56 nmfs officials believed 312b of the magnusonstevens fishery conservation and management act 16 usc 1861ab provided sufficient authority to implement this buyback program 57 see supra footnote 26 58 because pink and sockeye salmon are often caught in the same fishery the rules affecting one fishery may also affect another it is unclear whether catching the allocated amount of one species will halt the entire fishery which could result in forgone catch of the other species

agreement essentially provided strategy and specifications ie biological criteria for conservationbased regime covering border area fisheries in southern british columbia and washington state the specifics of the regime were cooperatively and bilaterally developed for implementation in 2000 the coho regime included rules establishing harvest limits in specified border area fisheries these rules were designed to limit exploitation rates on natural coho stocks to sustainable levels taking into account all fisheries affecting the stocks and thereby improving the longterm prospects of sustainable healthy fisheries in both countries for southern coho stocks abundancebased management reduced catches to sustainable levels as the united states and canada worked to rebuild these depressed stocks specifically the coho management program constrained fishing to enable natural coho stocks to produce long term sustainable harvests while maintaining genetic and ecological diversity responded to the status of stocks was costeffective and flexible enough to take advantage of technical capabilities and information provided predictable framework for planning fishery impacts on natural stocks and established an objective basis for monitoring evaluating and modifying the management regimes for northern coho stocks in times of low abundance certain fisheries were curtailed to assist conservation of these stocks these closures include southeast alaskan troll fishery for 10 days from july 25 when early season catch indicators show low abundance less than 11 million total

agreement highlighted the importance of habitat protection and restoration to achieving the longterm objectives of the parties while the primary focus of the agreement was on setting provisions that govern fishery management it was well understood that achieving optimum production of salmon depended on other initiatives as well these included but were not limited to maintaining adequate water quality and quan tity achieving improved spawning success and migration corridors for adult and juvenile salmon and other measures that maintained and increased the production of natural stocks the psc reports annually to the parties to identify 1 stocks for which measures beyond harvest controls are required and nonfishing factors that limit production 2 options to address these factors and 3 progress of the parties in implementing measures to improve production this arrangement improved the conservation elements of the pst and extended the pst framework to include coordination on habitat protection objectives this provision supports the principle that stock conservation and rebuilding goals require coordinated and effective programs in freshwater to maintain productive habitat or

and fishery managers was believed crucial in determining the degree to which bilateral salmon management under the 1999 agreement was likely to succeed these issues and how they have been addressed include acceptance of the 1999 agreement the 1999 agreement consisted of more than simple amendments to the pst annex which the pst provides for acceptance by exchange of notes thus there was ambiguity over whether the pst was separate treaty requiring senate action or merely supplement to the existing treaty that improved its 62 although most disputes under the psc relate to technical issues such as runsize predictions and total allowable catch the pscs article xii provisions for technical dispute resolution have rarely been used the modifications in the 1999 accord aimed to promote scientific decisionmaking more independent of political and policy pressures prior to the 1999 agreement scientists related to the psc and sa lmon management appeared with rare exception unable to reach objective conclusions with analyses uniformly s upporting their parent agencys desires this lack of objectivity was apparent when scientists working with identical data uniformly

only come by way of congressional authorization and appropriation the 1999 agreement was determined to be an executive agreement and thus did not require senate advice and consent to ratification see the next item on funding congressional appropriation of 140 million for the two endowment funds obligations under the 1999 agreement were contingent upon legislative authority and appropriations from the us congress for these two funds the full capitalization of these two funds relied on repeated action by the us congress to appropriate monies over four years any hesitancy in providing this funding might have been seen by canada as repudiation of us responsibility for compensating canada for larger us salmon harvests in the recent past in addition the joint diplomatic statement accompanying the 1999 agreement stated that the agreement would be suspended if funds were not available at times certain through fy2003 at least suggesting that as noted above acceptance of the agreement was contingent upon appropriation of funds by congress the us congress appropriated full funding for the two endowment funds within the time prescribed allocation of and expenditures from the endowment funds if these two funds were fully funded and grew at 10 interest about 14 million would be available for expenditure annually to be used for salmon restoration and enhancement projects benefitting both countries if however the funds were not capitalized at the anticipated amount canada might have regarded the resulting interest insufficient compared to the perceived damage us fishing had caused canadian salmon stocks in 2006 about 7 million us dollars was derived from interest on these funds and allocated to various projects see implementing the regional endowment funds below equity since the 1999 agreement did not specifically and directly address the issue of salmon interceptions 63 many canadians remained skeptical that the 1999 agreement would result in any improvements toward each party receiving benefits equivalent to the production of salmon originating in its waters for years the united states and canada debated different interpretations of this objective and how it should be measured in addition canadians called on the united states to abide by obligations under the psts memorandum of understanding for implementing article iii paragraph 1b wherein the party with the advantage was to propose corrective measures however the 1999 agreement did not provide any mechanism to reimburse one party if the other overharvested both parties appear comfortable with the equity achieved under harvest regimes of the 1999 agreement and particular concerns related to overharvesting have arisen decisionmaking within the us section to the psc section 3632g1 of the pacific salmon treaty act of 1985 requires consensus among the us section to the psc before decision can be made critics of us section action charge that this requirement has been used as ploy to paralyze operation of the pst and frustrate rational salmon 63 for example particular concerns remain about the southeast alaska pink salmon fishery in district 4 intercepting increasing

section results in fishing activities that threaten the conservation of salmon stocks the united states could be in breach of its pst obligations in such circumstances the federal government is to assume leadership with the option for intervention and preemption64 past hesitancy of the us federal government ie the president secretary of state andor secretary of commerce to exercise authority and assume this necessary leadership role had contributed to the erosion of cooperative relationship with canada beneficial to pacific salmon particular problems have arisen within the us section relative to achieving consensus failure to include british columbia the exclusion by canadian federal negotiators of british columbia from negotiations leading to the 1999 agreement could have been recipe for failure some contended they suggested the united states should have requested that british columbia remain involved since british columbia is where the majority of the canadian salmon originate it is also the location of fishing and other interests affected by the implementation of the 1999 agreement for the 1999 agreement to work it had to address regional interests pertaining to salmon as perceived by british columbia in addition to canadian interests as perceived by the federal government in ottawa the cooperation of british columbia fishing interests was probably essential to achieving rational management of pacific coastal salmon stocks this does not appear to be current issue as canada appears sensitive and responsive to regional concerns perception by some canadians of the 1999 agreement as sellout of canadian interests some canadians felt the united states had been and continued to be the principal transgressor in failed salmon management and always achieved the better outcome in any bilateral dealing for example many canadians perceived that the united states had the ability to force canada to curtail fisheries to address us conservation concerns eg juan fuca summerrun chum salmon but that canada lacked any mechanism to force alaska to do the same when canada was concerned about conservation eg southeast alaska harvest re strictions are triggered by low us coho abundance not low canadian coho abundance 65 such attitudes focused considerable attention on how the united states conducted itself in implementing the 1999 agreement particularly appropriations for and allo cations from the two endowment funds canadians do not appear to harbor intense emotions in response to how equitably the 1999 agreements implementation and funding of the endowment funds has been perceived absence of any penalty for the nonresolution of disputes between the two parties the 1999 agreement did not specify salmon harvest limits but was very complex blueprint for the parties to follow in promulgating harvest limits and taking other actions to conserve salmon fisheries as such it opened the door to considerable dispute canada has repeatedly sought the inclusion of binding arbitration as an option under the pst 64 theodore g kronmiller pacific salmon treaty hearing senate committee on foreign relations feb 22 1985 p 45 65 canadians were concerned about what they referred to as liberal trigger mechanisms regarding this coho fishery some claimed that if the formula in the 1999 agreement were applied to past years it would have resulted in only one 10day pause in alaska fishing in the previous two decades

incentive to settle differences eg it did not prohibit both nations from fishing when accord was reached in addition enforcement mechanism was provided in the pst to guide action if one country should be out of compliance with the agreement or the pst serious disputes have arisen so this aspect has not posed any concerns technical dispute resolution the potential for technical disputes could have increased under the 1999 agreement since harvest levels were to be based on the determination of stock abundance levels however only chapter 5 of the new annex iv on coho salmon required resolution of technical disputes under the provisions of article xii of the pst similar provision was made for other fisheries in the 1999 agreement and even the article xii provisions appear to have been ineffective in the past thus broadbased and readily enforceable means of resolving disputes applicable to all technical disputes may be lacking again serious disputes have arisen so this aspect has not posed any concerns reliability of psc science abundancebased management works when the supporting science is accurate particularly as regards salmon abundance forecasts both nations may gain from committing themselves to promoting greater objectivity and cooperation in the conduct of their scientists the objectivity and reliability of psc science has been widely accepted by both parties use of selective fishing methods canada asserted that its future salmon fisheries would operate differently than in the past with harvestable fish being selectively targeted to avoid undesired bycatch of wild or weak stocks fin marking 66 by us management agencies also was employed to promote selective fishing the degree to which selective fishing practices are used in mixedstock fisheries by both nations to protect weaker wild stocks could minimize conflicts between fishing and the laws and programs seeking to protect threatened and endangered species this appears an emerging arena of potential conflict due to what some consider to be significant canadian harvest of salmon from several populations listed under the us endangered species act

the 1999 agreement as it has been implemented for example one could evaluate the agreement on the basis of its effect on conservation and sharing of the resource its benefits and costs to the fisheries and the agencies who manage them and its effect on the many people who rely on salmon for their economic and cultural value from the perspective of the department of state salient way to measure the relative success of the 1999 pacific salmon agreement is to compare the nature and tenor of relations with canada concerning the shared pacific salmon resource during the period before the conclusion of the 1999 agreement with the period since throughout much of the 1990s disputes over pacific salmon repeatedly became significant irritants in relations between the united states and canada the procedures for handling such disputes established by the 1985 pacific salmon treaty particularly the mechanisms of the pacific salmon commission psc had ceased to work effectively antagonism over those disputes provoked incidents that made frontpage news several different attempts to settle differences essentially failed the conclusion of the 1999 agreement created new and much improved paradigm for addressing pacific salmon issues permitting us and canadian participants in the psc process to work together constructively the two national sections have reached agreement on many issues concerning the implementation of the 1999 agreement for example since 1999 they have agreed to amend some of the fisheries regimes set forth in annex iv to take account of new circumstances they successfully negotiated and implemented biologically sound management plan for coho salmon in the southern portion of psc area they have used the two endowment funds created by the 1999 agreement to advance useful salmon initiatives in both countries the two sections also recently embarked on an effort to give better effect to attachment to the 1999 agreement concerning salmon habitat and restoration 69 the government of canada highly values the treaty and the work of the psc believing that these legal and institutional features have provided each country with important

between alaska and the states of oregonwashingtoncalifornia the 1999 agreement established fishing regimes that spanned several years multiyear fishing agreements have led to profound improvement in working relationships between the various interests involved in the psc processes the parties have been able to focus on other issues with spirit of cooperative resolution that would not have been possible under the stresses of the negotiationdriven atmosphere that existed before technical committees on chinook and coho for example have been able to devote more time to cooperative analysis because the time required to support competitive negotiation of fishing regimes has been reduced although these multiyear regimes have established set of rules to govern the conduct of fisheries they can have the effect of shifting the conservation responsibility the aggregate abundancebased management aabm regimes adopted for alaskan and some canadian fisheries relieve these fisheries of stockspecific obligations to conserve individual stocks of fish consequently managers of other fisheries are required to bear an increasing share of the responsibility for conservation and meeting jeopardy standards for esalisted populations for example the annual allowed salmon harvest is calculated in two different mannersunder an aggregate abundance off of canada and alaska and weakest stock calculation off of the washington coast this has caused reduction in the allowed harvest off of the washington coast because the limiting ie weakest stock for washington has been reduced due to the increase in interception off canada and alaska where the limiting stock for wa is aggregated with other more abundant stocks as the basis of aggregate abundance management 70 personal communication

different fisheries on chinook salmon vary by stock the 1999 agreement relative to chinook salmon has tended to shift the conservation responsibility to fisheries that are not managed under aabm regimes to protect individual stocks the fishing regime established for fisheries off the west coast of vancouver island wcvi has had different effects on individual stocks of chinook salmon returning to puget sound the washington coast and columbia river 77 when the 1999 agreement was negotiated the effects of the were not yet apparent because nmfs had not yet established jeopardy standards with those standards now in place the ramifications of the psts approach to chinook management can be better understood for puget sound stocks canadian wcvi fishery harvest rates have not been reduced to the extent anticipated under the 1999 agreement consequently fisheries that harvest chinook in puget sound including those directed at other species such as sockeye have been further restricted to compensate for lessthananticipated reductions in canadian fishery impacts for snake river fall chinook the impacts of wcvi fisheries have been reduced more than expected providing greater flexibility in allocating impacts among us fisheries affecting this stock complex the magnitude of chinook bycatch in groundfish fisheries directed at other species has not been allocated among individual stocks because data necessary to do so are not available canadian interception of washington state chinook salmon can be seen as quid pro quo for alaskan interceptions of canadian chinook salmon however this situation has resulted in washington state salmon fleets tribal and nontribal alike feeling that they have been denied an equitable harvest opportunity washington salmon fishermen perceive canada as managing their allowed ocean chinook salmon troll harvest to avoi d their domestic stocks and target us stocks these washington fishermen see the canadian use of real time genetic stock analysis where they sample the harvest and allow more or less harvest in the area depending on the mix of the stocks present as violation of the existing treaty where one country is not to target the stocks of the other country in addition washingtons ability to harvest its share of fraser river sockeye and pink salmon both of which are managed under the pst is constrained by the listing of puget sound chinook after canadas allowable harvest of chinook salmon under the existing chinook regime in annex iv combined with the us mandated harvest restrictions on puget sound chinook there is insufficient permissible chinook impacts remaining to satisfy both the treaty and non treaty commercial sockeye and pink fisheries in washington state g23g495g21g495g561g5g152g151g140g142g155g151g156g561 many

agreement known as the habitat and restoration agreement79 this attachment includes among other things section requesting the commission to report annually to the parties on the status of natural stocks not producing at optimum production the nonfishing factors which may be limiting their production options for addressing these factors and the progress of the parties in achieving the objective of optimum production for these stocks the psc has discussed this provision of the 1999 agreement bilaterally on many occasions since 1999 however bilateral progress has been difficult and limited for number of reasons some of which stem from differences within the two na tional sections as well as between them the following summary is based on bilateral discussions and does not attempt to characterize the details of the withinsection differences shortly after the 1999 agreement was concluded the psc established bilateral ad hoc habitat committee to develop options for implementing the habitat provisions of the agreement the habitat committee focused its efforts on collating information developed by domestic management agencies that described some of the major habitat factors limiting salmon production in specific watersheds upon review of this work it was concluded that the ad hoc committees approach was not at that point acceptable the us section agreed to develop an alternative proposal for implementation of attachment for consideration by the psc in october 2005 the us section presented position to the psc at its february 2006 annual meeting the psc agreed to establish bilateral habitat and restoration technical committee that would advise it on matters relating to habitat and restoration thus potentially enabling it to make additional progress toward implementing the habitat and restoration agreement both parties recognize that the amount and pace of work that this committee will be able to undertake will be limited by the available funding the main purposes of the committee would be for list of stocks identified by the psc to inform the psc regarding the status of habitats for naturally spawning stocks subject to the treaty for which nonfishing factors are limiting production identify nonfishing factors that limit production of specific stocks identify options for addressing the appropriate factors to achieve optimum production for those stocks and 78 personal communication with david balton deputy assistant secretary for oceans and fisheries us department of state oct 11 2006 79 attachment to the 1999 agreement concerning

domestic habitat recovery efforts to address the depressed status of natural stocks of salmon in both countries great deal of effort and millions of dollars has been directed at addressing factors other than fishing major source of us funding for habitat restoration has been the six years of congressional appropriations to the pacific coastal salmon recovery fund despite the lack of formal and specific habitat management framework the psc has focused significant attention on certain high priority issues involving nonfishing factors limiting production most notable of these has been the cooperative bilateral program undertaken to address the problem of the early entry of late fraser sockeye an unforeseen and unexplained phenomenon that threatened fishery of major importance to both parties using funds contributed by the parties several important initiatives were undertaken to address this problem bilateral scientific workshops have been held and the psc has implemented significant number of research and technical studies and programs with the assistance of the southern boundary restoration and enhancement fund on an even broader scale the northern boundary

depressed status of this stock has affected the ability of the united states to harvest it s own stocks under the 2002 psc coho agreement an additional area where the influence of habitat affects salmon fishery management under the psc arrangements is through reliance on spawning escapement goals that are tied to the capacity of stocks to produce maximum sustainable harvest msh under current environmental conditions over time as the condition of habitat deteriorates msh escapement levels could be reduced to levels so low that stock sustainability is questionable the psc which historically focused its efforts on developing fishing regimes is now considering measures to implement the habitat provisions of attachment to the 1999 psc agreement in the united states federal actions that affect esalisted salmon populations are considered in the context of evaluating effects relative to established jeopardy standards however the capacity of both parties to muster the resources and

administrations salmon policy as expressed in the january 25 2006 speech by white house council on environmental quality chairman james l connaughton at the future of wild pacific salmon conference at oregon state university 82 the lifecycle and migratory patterns of pacific salmon combined with the jurisdictional landscape of north americas west coast places canada literally and figuratively in the middle of certain pst issues with alaska to the north and several states of the lower 48 to the south as in the past some of the biggest challenges confronting the participants in the upcoming renegotiations will be to find solutions acceptable to all us stakeholders perspectives on the issues raised in chairman connaughtons speech tend to differ depending on location within this region consider for example that chinook salmon originating in the us states of the pacific northwest are harvested in all three regions the pacific northwest states canada and alaska chinook originating in canada are harvested primarily in alaska and canada chinook originating in alaska are harvested only in alaska not surpri singly stakeholders in each of these regions have different opinions on rules to regulate harvest patterns and practices for chinook salmon 83 chairman connaughtons speech was directed primar ily at the situation of mortality of the snake river listed stocks although there is significantly more mortality inriver on those stocks he focused on harvest mortality tting that discussion aside canada ocean fisheries are significant harvester of the allowed snake river fall chinook one approach might consider snake river fall chinook as an indicator stock to measure recovery the current administrations policy will most likely cause washington andor oregon to attempt to exert more pressure on alaska to decrease its impacts on southern chinook stocks it is difficult to see how the united states can expect to obtain much relief from canada since the united states does not have much to offer canada in return whether alaska will agree to any thing less than the status quo may ultimately come down to question of political will table 2 presents nmfs 82 for the text of

river fisheries limiting the discussion to harvest may increase tensions unnecessarily the implications of james connaughtons comments are that the united states is prepared to pay any price to convince canada to reduce its harvest of esalisted fish in the imminent annex iv renegotiation if the position advocated by connaughton for chinook salmon management is pursued aggressively intensive controversy and conflict could arise as concessions are sought for variety of fisheries and species coastwide for example willingness to reduce chinook harvests by canada would likely be contingent on obtaining restrictions on us access to coho pink sockeye and chum salmon concern has been further fueled by connaughtons concluding remarks if agreements cannot be forged through this process the federal government is nonetheless obligated to proceed with the decisionmaking entrusted to its discretion under the law such efforts could intensify political conflict and potential repercussions for federal appropriations to support salmon and other priorities might be anticipated others suggest that the views expressed by chairman connaughton do not reflect current understanding recognition and appreciation for the relative significance of fishing mortalities compared to those caused from hydropower deve lopment for example on page 3 he states however in the columbia river the snake river fall chinook gives about half of its returning adult population to us meaning fishery harvest this statement fails to acknowledge that the mortality rates for juvenile migrants are approximately 1015 for turbines 5 for bypass and 2 for spillways per dam since snake river fall chinook pass through eight mainstem dams before they even reach the ocean as much as 73 of the potential production subject to turbine passage might be lost due to mortality from dam passage alone 84 before these fish even reach the 84 the actual mortality loss varies considerably by species nd will be affected by the proportion of the migrants that are subject to turbine bypass or spillway mortality these proportions are related to streamflow and power continued

migrations they can suffer an additional mortality of from 25 per dam85 so for snake rivers fall chinook from 15 to 34 of the fish that actually live long enough to reach the river on their spawning migration can be lost to dams in addition an extensive system is in place to ensure that harvest impacts on esalisted stocks are kept within acceptable constraints as determined by the federal agencies responsible for establishing jeopardy standards the independent science advisory board issued its report on harvest management of columbia basin salmon and steelhead 86 describing the management process and evaluating harvest management of columbia river salmon and steelhead further some maintain that connaughtons comments on modifying existing agreements for ocean and columbia river fisheries do not fully consider the consequences of disrupting international and domestic legal arrangements that were developed through difficult negotiations spanning many years hatchery reform on the columbia river could refocus efforts on inplace inkind replacement to mitigate for loss and damage of habitat resulting from dam construction unfortunately too often hatchery operations have been painted with broadbrush generalities chairman connaughtons january 2006 speech repo rts figures on the cost of salmon restoration as justification for seeking further reductions of harvest impacts however some argue that the cited cost figures are inflated by speculative extrapolations of foregone powerwater revenues critics maintain that chairman connaughtons comments emphasize the effects of harvest and hatcheries on esalisted stocks while understating the damages caused by other sources such as dam passage water withdrawals water temperatures and habitat degradation from their perspective any emphasis on reducing harvest even further could increase the difficulty in pursuing cooperative efforts to conserve stocks among alaska the rest of the united states and canada

fishing on local natural populations portion of hatchery production is left unmarked and tagged with different cwt comparisons in re covery patterns and exploitation rates between the marked and unmarked cwt fish may be used to estimate the effect of selective fishing estimates of fishery exploitation rates from samples of tagged and marked fish small portion of hatchery fish will still be unbiased estimates of untagged and marked fish but not of fishery exploitation rates of unmarked fish therefore the marked and cwt tagged hatchery fish can longer be assumed to be representative of exploitation rates on natural production if msfs increase in number and intensity the discrepancy between the fates of adiposeclipped marked fish and unmarked fish will increase additionally msfs

impacts of fishery regimes on populations of concern to the psc that separate memorandum of agreement committing the united states and canada to maintain viable cwt system was attached to the 1985 pst in the united states state and federal legislation has required the mass marking of large numbers of coho and chinook salmon produced by hatchery facilities for the purpose of providing increased harvest access to hatchery fish within the constraints established to protect wild fish critics assert that these mass marking developments have reduced the reliability of data derived from the cwt system coastwide greatly increased the costs of fishery and escapement sampling diverted funding from other purposes and required substantial changes to reporting formats and validation protocols issues and concerns regarding adverse effects of mass marking and markselective fishing on the cwt system have been repeatedly raised by the pscs technical committees recently an expert panel was convened to examine issues and problems associated with the cwt system including the mass marking and markselective fishing 87 these issues and concerns have been discussed on many occasions within the psc in addition july 2005 memo from the independent scientific advisory board to the northwest power and conservation council also describes concerns regarding the impacts of mass marking and markselective fishing on the scientific basis for salmon management 88 the psc does not have the authority to impose resolution to the ongoing debate over the merits of mass marking and markselective fisheries msfs on any party thus it has in substantial measure focused its efforts on how best to constructively address the technical issues raised by these new programs to develop bilateral procedures designed to mitigate the negative impacts of the policy and to maintain the functionality of the coastwide cwt system one of the first of 87 report of the expert panel on the future of the

committeethe selective fisheries evaluation committeeto serve as technical review and coordination forum for mass marking and markselective fisheries proposals the current chinook and coho regimes prescribed in the pst are directed at constraining exploitation rates on naturallyspawning stocks to provide means for sharing harvest and conservation responsibilities the chinook technical committee ctc and coho technical committee cotc are charged with assessing the implementation of these regimes and rely on cwt recoveries to complete the required analyses the cwt system remains an important tool for salmon conservation and for this reason the psc has focused its immediate efforts on assessing the actions needed to implement four of the 15 recommendations made by the expert panel in its report these recommendations focus on work necessary to correct current deficiencies in the cwt system not all of which are consequence of mass marking and msfs the psc established working group comprised of scientists from all the relevant agencies coastwide to advise the psc and its participat ing management entities on how to implement the necessary improvements to the existing cwt program the psc likely will review the recommendations of the expert panel that focus on mass marking and msfs including those that call for developing and implementing programs to enhance the capacity to apply genetic or other methods to stock identification the expert panel recommended that the psc look at developing coordinated research and implementation plan while other recommendations suggest that the parties and the psc consider new fishery management regimes that are less reliant on the kind of data derived from the cwt system some of the recommendations will take several years to address and in almost all cases will involve additional consultation coordination and funding to fully implement 89 g3g150g139g146g144g158g146g157g162g561 ambiguity in annex iv language allows different interpretations of expectations from individual perspectives different perceptions of intent have emerged which become manifest as uncertainty and rhetorical debates over intent the chinook regime for example is technically complex to implement and many details were left to be sorted our later another example is the controversy that has emerged with how the us share of fraser river sockeye is to be harvested canada has argued that the united states should harvest its proportional share from each major component of the sockeye run while the united states argues that the proportion is based on the allowable catch of the total sockeye run taking into account the relative strength of component populations to the extent practicable while ambiguity has provided latitude and flexibility to make it easier to reach agreement on fishing regimes controversy has been experienced in implementation when obligations must be transformed into specific terms ambiguities in annex iv language increase challenges for bilateral technical committees over who and what to evaluate when monitoring performance or compliance

sockeye and pink salmon bound for the fraser river but coordination among fishery managers for other species is far less formal for example the 2002 southern coho agreement includes provision for the parties to exchange information on abundance forecasts and fishery expectations for preseason management planning through managertomanger policytechnical discussions but this process has recently been limited to perfunctory exchange of data through emails and conference calls the psc normally convenes three meetings each year meeting in january focuses on review of previous fishing seasons for the purpose of identifying issues for further discussion and making assignments to technical committees an annual meeting in february is devoted to deliberation and resolution of issues in the fall an executive session is convened to allow the psc to review work plans for panels and technical committees and to candidly exchange views regarding issues relating to implementing the pst however the lack of fora to foster and facilitate policy technical exchange for implementing psc regimes is thought to be serious impediment to cooperative salmon management between the united states and canada technical information can affect the need for substantive policy deliberat ion for example the investigations of the psc technical committees include reevaluation of historical cwt data which could produce results that differ significantly from the data that the united states and canada relied upon to negotiate stockspecific exploitation rates in the 2002 southern coho agreement

has become increasingly problematic the lack of full participation in technical committees impedes the ability to make progress on understanding and addressing issues of concern participants maintain that many programs that provide the data required for stock and fishery assessments have been severely reduced or even eliminated consequently these observers maintain that the foundation for

direction of the commission will consider and begin discussions on chapter renewal starting in 2007 canadian officials anticipate that chinook salmon will be an area of particular interest during the renegotiation of the annex iv chapters prior to the signing of the 1999 agreement canada had been implementing significant conservation measures to address weak chinook stocks from the west coast of vancouver island as consequence of these actions canada reverted to an historic fishing pattern in this area moving from predominately summer fishery to the current spring and winter fishery these changes met the new aabm regime set in the 1999 agreement that agreement also changed both countries focus on harvesting respective shares of chinook quotas set under the old treaty arrangements when stocks were abundant to the conservation and abundancebased approach the fishing pattern off west coast vancouver island not only met canadas conservation needs but also reduced canadas overall harvest of us chinook particularly columbia river chinook stocks which includes esalisted stocks as an indirect result of changes in fishing patterns canada now harvests other southern us stocks however canadas catch wasand still is within the parameters of the 1999 agreement for chinook salmon fundamentally it is impossible for canada to harvest its chinook stocks without intercepting southern bound us stocks whether they are columbia river or puget sound stocks or others it is important to recognize that canada is not alone in affecting southern us chinook alaska also has significant harvest of southern us chinook stocks as well as canadian stocks an additional issue of concern to canada is the increasing bycatch of yukon river chinook salmon by the us pollock fishery in the bering sea concurrent with declining numbers of chinook salmon migrating into canada to spawn in upper ukon river tributaries 91 canadian managers claim that salmon bycatch in the pollock fishery has increased substantially in the last five years and blame this interception for poor salmon returns to the upper yukon river tributaries canadian delegation attended an early november 2007 meeting of the north pacific fishery management council to emphasize their concern citing treaty language binding parties to reducing marine catch and bycatch of ukon river salmon meanwhile us pollock fishermen assert that severe restrictions on their fishery could make it unprofitable to continue conservation of canadian pacific salmon populations remains priority and must be consistent with canadas wild salmon policy access to fair share of salmon under the treaty arrangements and receipt of the benefits of canadian stock rebuilding efforts are also important to canada furthermore obligations to canadian first nations must be considered in the renewal of the chapters the government of canada firmly believes that the improved levels of understanding cooperation and trust that have emerged through the work of the psc will contribute decisively toward the successful negotiation of new annex iv arrangements and work through the psc should be strongly supported 91 rebecca r
