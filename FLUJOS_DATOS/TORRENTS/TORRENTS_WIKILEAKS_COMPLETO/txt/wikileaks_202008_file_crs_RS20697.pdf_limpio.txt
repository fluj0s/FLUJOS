commitment to the philippines and the scope of us diplomacy concerning the philippines security problems this report will be updated periodically until 1992 the philippines and the united states had an intimate security relationship based on 1947 military bases agreement and 1952 mutual defense treaty in the treaty each party promises to act to meet the common danger of an armed attack on the other party in accordance with its constitutional process the treaty specifies that an armed attack includes an armed attack on the metropolitan territo ry of either of the parties or on the island territories under its jurisdiction in the pacific or on its armed forces public vessels or aircraft in the pacific the security relationship was frayed in 1991 when the philippine senate voted to reject ratification of new usphilippines agreement to extend us rights to military bases beyond 1992 the expir ation date of the 1947 agreement as result the united states withdrew from its bases by december 1992 including its huge naval base at subic bay the security relationship was damaged further by cuts in us military assistance to the philippines and by philippine supreme court ruling in december 1996 that executive orders by president fidel ramos to continue provisions of the usphilippine status of forces agreement which also expired in 1992 were unconstitutional the ruling ended the legal status of us military personnel in the philippines and the clinton administration and the pentagon responded by ending usphilippine joint military exercises and barring us military personnel from entering the philippineshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20697crs2 1 text of joint press conference of secretary of defense cohen and secretary of national defense mercado october 3 2000 2 gma television

philippine secretary of defense orlando mercado announced on october 3 2000 an exchange of defense experts to facilitate coordinate and assist in meet ing the equipment requirements of the afp armed forces of the philippines this defense assessment team is to clarify the equipment needs of the afp and to set forth priorities for an americ an assistance program1 it is scheduled to submit initial findings in october 2000 issues in renewed security relationship the philippineus agreements are within the context of at least three related security issues that will require manila and washington to make policy decisions in the course of implementing the vfa and the plan for us military support the form and scope of any new us military support program the philippines main motive for seeking us aid was its confrontation with china in the disputed south china sea in 1995 china which claims the entire south china sea basin occupied mischief reef in the philippineclaimed area of the spratly islands since then the philippine navy has confronted the chinese when it appeared that china was seeking to expand its positions in the disputed area incidents have occurred in which the philippine navy has fired warning shots and has rammed chinese vessels the philippine government thus has sought us assistance to strengthen afp naval and air capabilities in the south china sea the philippines however has competing defense priorities related to the escalation of hostilities with muslim insurgents in the southern philippines in 2000 the insurgents seek independence for the muslim regions of the philippines the heavy fighting on mindanao against the moro islamic liberation front and the kidnaping of foreigners by abu sayyuf smaller muslim group appears to have shifted philippine government priorities away from the south china sea by spring 2000 the afp had deployed over 110000 troops against the muslims 60 percent of total afp strength2 these defense priorities contrast with the weaknesses of the afp and the lack of progress of the philippine government in implementing 15 year military modernizationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20697crs3 3 the philippines foreign military

naval vessels date back to world war ii except for three gunboats purchased from hong kong in 1997 logistics capabilities to service equipment is viewed by expert s as deficient the modernization program estimated to cost 82 billion stalled after 1997 when president estrada imposed budget austerity measures including constraints on defense spending in 1999 the philippines spent 52 billion pesos 127 billion on defense 88 percent of total expenditures3 the nature of philippine defense needs and the uncertainty over the philippine governments commitment to strengthening the afp appear to create two apparent options in fashioning us military aid program one is program to create specific naval and air force structure that would give the afp the capability to carry out defined military missions in the south china sea senator rodolfo biazon chairman of the philippine congress committee on national defense and security and respected former marine general has recommended this kind of program4 such program would be analogous in smaller scale to the usjapan defense program of the 1980s under which japan undertook specific antisoviet naval and air missions in geographically defined region in the northwest pacific and developed force structure featuring agreedupon types of weapons and equipment military missions likely would include intelligence gathering and surveillance moving troops philippine marines to occupy islands and atolls mounting credible show of force at particular time and place if it appeared that the chinese were about to occupy another position and successfully engaging the chinese navy and air force if china resorted to military force several types of us weapons would be important in building up afp capabilities to perform such missions surveillance strike and transport aircraft fast attack patrol naval craft frigates armed with surface to surface and surface to air missiles amphibious landing craft and long range troop carrying helicopters such force would not necessarily have to be large given the limited number of islands and atolls in dispute and limits on chinas ability to deploy military forces hundreds of miles from the chinese mainland nevertheless it would have to be well armed well trained with an effective logistics component because of the afps deficiencies in all these areas the united states undoubtedly would have to assist in training for operations and logistics the second apparent option is broader program aimed at general improvement in all services of the afp such program would give more emphasis to supplying the philippine army the largest of the afps services the program would be orientated more towards the war with muslim insurgents us priorities to assist the philippine army doubt would include transportation aircraft troop carrying helicopters naval supply vessels armored personnel carriers infantry weapons ammunition and medical equipment according to informed sources the afp is pressing the united states to provide such support secretary of defense william cohen stated on his trip to thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20697crs4 5 news briefing by secretary of defense william

1999philippines in september 2000 that the united states could assist the afp to develop counterterrorism units5 unlike option one the program would not seek to create new distinct force structure with the exception of counterterrorism units decisions would be more on an ongoing basis depending on the nature of the fighting on mindanao and the needs of the philippine army this program too would appear to require direct role for us military personnel in training and logistics knowledgeable us sources emphasized the need of this kind of us role in developing an afp capability to service and maintain equipment the effectiveness of any us military support program will depend on the commitment of the philippine government and the afp to support it according to us officials the philippines would have to buy us military equipment either on commercial basis or on credit basis through the us foreig n military sales program this would entail major financial expenditure for the philippines other experts assert that the philippines could take much greater advantage of the us excess defense articles program and acquire us weaponry including fighter aircraft and patrol boats and frigates at cost or at depreciated price6 regardless of the form of acquisition sizeable philippine government funds also would be required for training logistics and maintenance of acquired weaponry infrastructure and possibly new military bases the afp would need to commit high level competent officers to administer the program philippine priorities and ideas concerning the type of program would be important to dispel perceptions within filipino political elites that the program was usimposed philippine congressional support for the program would be essential the us defense commitment the renewal of the security relationship has raised anew questions concerning the us defense commitment to the philippines and the us military role in the philippines there has been much discussion over whether the 1952 mutual defense treaty mdt covers the positions in the south china sea in dispute between the philippines and china spratly islands and scarborough shoal successive us administrations have stated that article iv of the mdt calling for responses to an armed attack on either of the signatories does not cover the spratly islands7 but us statements are more vague regarding scarborough shoal us officials however have stated that the united states opposes any country taking unilateral actions to assert territorial claims and that the united states would consult with the philippines on what action to take if philippines military forces in the spratlys were attacked8 article iii of the mdt provides for consultations if either signatory is threatened by armed attack philippine

chinese attack in the south china sea in order to activate article iii regarding consultations9 statements regarding the defense commitment and us military activities in or near the south china sea also appear aimed at deterring chinese aggressiveness the first usphilippine military exercise after philippine ratification of the vfa took place on palawan main philippine island near the disputed area in the spratlys admiral joseph prueher commander of us pacific forces stated in february 1999 that the us navy would make little bigger show of our presence there south china sea than we have in the past10 at that time us military intelligence officials began to disclose publicly details of chinese military activities in the south china sea and provided this information to the philippine government11 the palawan exercise and these other us activities have drawn chinese attention chinese officials criticized the palawan exercise and they have warned southeast asian countries against strengthening military cooperation with the united states12 the mdt does not cover insurrection within the philippines however longstanding us policy supports the territorial integrity of the philippines and past us military aid has been used against filipino communist and muslim insurgents current us policy opposes worldwide islamic terrorist groups philippine military intelligence claims that such groups are supporting the milf and abu sayuyuf more direct us role in the southern philippines thus appears possible even if the intention is to avoid it us military support program that assists the afp in the south would heighten the danger of muslim terrorist attacks against american targets in the philippines pointed up in august 2000 by the kidnaping of an american by abu sayyuf attacks against americans in turn could raise debate and issues in washington regarding more direct us military involvement us diplomacy renewed security relationship also raises the policy issue of the role of us diplomacy in the south china sea dispute the clinton administration did not give the south china sea priority in us diplomacy until 1999 the administration stressed only the right of free navigation it did not raise this issue extensively in the us bilateral dialogue with china moreover it did not get involved in the negotiations since 1995 over concluding code of conduct for the contesting countries in the south china sea those negotiations within the association of southeast asian nations asean and between asean and china have focused on the types and scope of aggressive behavior that code of conduct would prohibit the philippines has pressed its asean partnershttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20697crs6 13 kyodo news agency report july 26 1999 pathan don us urges arf to ease

seizing additional islands and atolls at the meeting of the asean regional forum arf in july 1999 us secretary of state madeleine albright did not endorse code of conduct in contrast to the australian foreign minister who argued for one but she did warn that we cannot simply sit on the sidelines and watch if cycle were to emerge in which each incident leads to another with potentially greater risks and graver consequences13 diplomacy over code of conduct faces two challenges one is whether the ten members of asean can present unified proposal as tough as proposed by the philippines the second is whether china would accept such code of conduct that specifically prohibited seizures of islands and atolls it is argued among us experts on southeast asia that more assertive us diplomacy would bolster asean in its dealings with china the philippines favors more assertive us diplomacy other experts believe that asean is too fragmented to be effective and they warn against the united states making the south china sea contentious issue in uschina relations14 failure of the code of conduct initiative could have serious implications for us philippine security relations in 1999 malaysia another claimant and asean member occupied two islands in the spratlys this intensified debate within the philippine government over whether the afp should occupy key positions in the philippineclaimed area in the spratlys the philippine defense ministry has proposed such action but the foreign ministry opposes it arguing that diplomacy should be given further opportunity15 collapse of the code of conduct initiative could tilt the debate in favor of the defense ministry move by the afp to occupy positions in the spratlys would create new issues and decisions for the united states in terms of the degree of us security support for manila collapse of the code of conduct initiative also could produce chain reaction in which all the claimants moved to occupy islands and atolls either singular philippine reaction or chain reaction could escalate the danger of military clashes in the south china sea
