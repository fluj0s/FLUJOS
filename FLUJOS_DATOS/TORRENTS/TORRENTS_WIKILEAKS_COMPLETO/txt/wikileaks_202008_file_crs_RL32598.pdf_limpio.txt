divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32598tanf cash benefits as of january 1 2004 summary the temporary assistance for needy families tanf block grant is major source of cash assistance commonly referred to as welfare for low income families with children tanf also provide s funds to states for wide range of benefits and services fo r both families receiving cash assistance and other families though the federal government provides tanf funds to st ates the states themselves determine cash benefit amounts as of january 1 2004 maximum benefit amounts vary greatly by state for family of three benefits vary from 923 per month in alaska to 170 per month in mississippi tanf was created by the 1996 welfare reform law which ended the aid to families with dependent children afdc program states also determined afdc benefit amounts and most have retained their pre 1996 benefit structure under tanf during the debate on welfare re form in the mid1990s some feared that fixed funding would lead states to cut be nefits in racetothebottom the race to the bottom did not happen in 24 jurisd ictions there was change in maximum benefits from july 1996 to january 2004 tw entyone jurisdictions increased their benefits eight of these had benefit increases sufficient to offset inflation over the period six jurisdictions cut benefits maximum benefits are ge nerally paid to families without wage earner however almost all jurisdictions have increased rewards for recipients who work effectively raising the amount of earnings recipient may keep before she becomes ineligible for cash assistance the percent of adult recipients reported as employed climbed from 11 in fy1996 to 26 in fy2002 state tanf programs generally disregard sizable share of earnings for at least period of time some disregard 100 of earnings for the first few months on job the rules for treating families with earnings vary greatly from state to state and thus the level of earnings at which family becomes ineligible for tanf varies greatly by state recipient in family of three single mother two children who obtains job and works 20 hours week at minimum wage job remains eligible for tanf in most states though in some she becomes ineligible for assistance in few months however in most states her earnings plus the earned income tax credit eitc and food stamps would be insuffici ent to raise her total income above the poverty line recipient in family of three who obtains job and works 40 hours per week at the minimum wage remains eligible for tanf in the first month on the job in 29 states however after year on the job she would be eligible for tanf cash in only 17 states in all cases with or without tanf the family with year round 40 hour per week minimum wage earnings would have total income counting federally termined food stamps and eitc slightly about the poverty threshold this report will be updated when inform ation about january 2005 benefit levels becomes

known as th 1996 welfare reform law ended the entitlement program of aid to families with dependent children afdc and replaced it with the state block grant program of temporary assistance to needy families tanf tanf gives states broad flexibility in the design of their programs states have adopted wide rang of financial eligib ility and benefit rules in their cash assistance programs to further the policy objectives of moving families from welfare to work supporting work and moving families off the cash benefit rolls tanf is major source of cash assistance for lowincome families with children however ongoing cash assistance is only one use of tanf funds states may use tanf funds on other types of bene fits and services such as child care shortterm emergency benef its work programs or edu cation programs following the state and federal welfare reforms of the mid1990s the cash assistance caseload declined markedly from historical high of 51 million families in march 1994 to 22 million fa milies in september 2003 the shrinkage in the cash assistance caseload has resulted in decline in the share of tanf funds devoted to ongoing cash assistance and an increase in the shar of funds spent on other tanf benefits and services this report describes cash assistance benefits paid to families by state tanf programs on january 1 2004 with historical data to portray changes in benefit payments over time it discusses the rules for determining eligibility and benefit amounts for recipient who gets job showing the maximum amount of earnings family may have and remain eligible for cash welfare finally this report examines the interaction of tanf with two other federal benefit progra ms food stamps and the earned income tax credit the report shows total income available from these sources plus wages at various hours of weekly work state by state this report does not discuss nonfinancial eligibility rules in state tanf cash assistance programs nor does it cover eligibility rules for the wide r range of tanf be nefits and services provided to families the information in this report is base d on responses to congressional research service crs survey of state cash benefit programs it is possible that in some cases crs may have misinterpreted the information provided by the states or failed to ask the correct questions to licit the appropriate responsehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32598crs2 maximum benefit amounts under tanf the pre1996 program of afdc titled fa milies with children who met statedetermined test of need to cash assistance federa l funding was unlimited states determined the amount of cash paid to needy families subject to minimal federal guidelines the block grant of temporary assistance for needy families tanf established in th 1996 law pl 104193 liminated the entitlement to cash welfare for needy families as well as those federal guidelines states are not required to use the tanf block grant to pay cash we lfare it may be used for other benefits and services to achieve tanf goals lthough all states have continued cash assistance program under afdc states based benefits on financial need which varied by family size financial need was greater the larger the family the degree of familys need also depended on its nonwelfare income so maximum afdc benefits generally were paid to those with income other than the welfare benefit most states continue to pay greater maximum benefits for larger families but there are some exceptions wisconsin pays benefits based on the work activity of the adult in the family and its benefit amount is based on the type and hours of work performed by the adult not the size of the family idaho has the same maximum benefit 309 for familie s of all sizes dditionally number of states have adopted family cap policies that pay reduced or zero benefit for new baby born to welfare family few states have also restructured their benefits to pay lower maximum benefits for those families with adults who are expected to work under tanf the maximum benefit still is paid to family with income other than welfare however in order to receive the maximum tanf benefit families must also be in compliance with work rules and c ooperate in establishing child support orders because federal tanf law requires states to penalize families that fail to do so afdc benefits varied greatly among the states large variations in benefits among the states have continued under tanf in january 2004 maximum benefits for family of three ranged from low of 170 month in mississippi to 923 in alaska maximum benefits by family size table 1 shows maximum monthly benefits by family size for january 2004 maximum benefits are generally paid to family with income other than the welfare benefit

families already on the rolls as was generally the case under afdc states may determine the eligibility threshold for cash aid further tanf does not specify federal rules for what types of income and how much of each ty pe of income must be counted in determining eligibility for cash aid in particular states have developed diverse set of rules for the treatment of earnings countable income whether family with working member remains eligible for cash assistance often depends on its circumstances what type of income it has what types of expenses for exam ple child care it incurs and how longhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32598crs10 3 under afdc earnings disregards were taken in the following order both applicants and recipients received 90 work expense earni ngs disregard then recipients received an additional 30 earnings disregard for the first 12 months of employment in the first four months of employment recipi ents also received an add itional 3333 earnings disregardworking recipients have been on the job most states base eligibility at least in part on familys countable income countable income is the familys income minus deductions specified in states program rules for working expenses and portion of earnings disregarded as an incentive to work earnings disregards in most states the maximum level of earnings family may have and retain eligibility for cash assistance depends on its benefit amount and earnings disregards most states reduce benefits for families with earnings though the size of the benefit reduc tion varies by state states generally do not count some earnings when determinin g benefits sometimes to compensate for work expenses and sometimes as an incentive for recipients to get job under afdc federal law specified that earnings disregards were provided for only short period of time so that soon af ter family member went to work most families became ineligible for cash assistance3 under tanf states are free to set their own earnings disregards and today almost all jurisdictions have increased rewards for recipients who work state t anf programs generally disregard sizable share of earnings for at least year and some disregard 100 of earnings for new job holders for the first few mont hs higher earnings disregards increase the exit point from tanf the amount of income recipien ts can earn before cash benefits are terminated also they raise the income eligibility entry point in the18 jurisdictions that do not have different rules for treating the earnings of applicants gross income test some states have adopted second income test to determine whether family with working member remains eligible for benefits based on gross income these gross income tests cut off eligibility to family at certain income level gene rally without regard to its individual circumstances that is family is made ineligible at certain level of income without regard to earnings disregards that otherwise apply and any deductions allowed for expenses federal afdc law required states to impose gr oss income test tanf does not require states to adopt gross income test but 26 ve retained such tests in their programs maximum earnings

eligibility for tanf another way to illustrate how states treat families with earners is to consider minimum wage worker and how many hours she may work and remain eligible for tanf that is in how many states can minimum wage earner work 20 hours or 40 hours per week and remain eligible for tanf table 5 shows the maximum number of hour s per week person earning the minimum wage could work and still retain eligibility for tanf cash assistance as of january 1 2004 for the dollar amounts by month of employment see appendix b in states where the minimum wage is above the federal 515 per hour the higher state minimum wage was used in the calcu lation the information in the table is based on the rules for family of three the average family size for those on cash assistance because the rules for coun ting or disregarding earnings sometimes change depending on how long recipient has been working states sometimes have generous disregards of earnings fo r the first few months on the job these maximum hours are shown for months one through 13 on the job most recipients working 20 hours per week remain eligible for tanf cash the table shows that all states except mississippi allow minimum wage earner with family of three working 20 hours per week to have her family remain on tanf in the first month of employment however after the third month on job this family would longer be eligible for cash benef its in alabama after the fourth month on job the family would longer be eligible for cash benefits in texas after year working month 13 on job recipient remains eligible for some tanf cash in 46 jurisdictions on the other hand tanf recipients working 40 hours week often lose eligibility for tanf cash though in majority of states tanf cash is still paid albeit in some states for short period of time in the first month on job recipient who gets minimum wage job and works 40 hours per week remains eligible for tanf cash assistance in 29 jurisdictions however after year of work month 13 on job she would remain eligible for tanf cash in only 17 jurisdictions table 5 maximum hours per week that minimum wage earner can work and retain eligibility for tanf cash

tanf sets 60month time limit on the use of federal funds to pay cash assistance to family with an adult to c ontinue the work incentive for more than 60 months states must use their own funds though state funds spent for families who passed the time limit are counted toward meeting tanfs maintenance of effort moe requirementearnings disregards and tanf work participation standards the adoption of more generous ear nings disregards and consequent expansion of eligibility for families on the rolls who have earnings is one of the most profound changes states made to thei r cash assistance programs once freed from federal rules for how they must count the earnings of family with working adult these more generous disregards have been seen as increasing incentives to work the more generous disregards mean that the implicit tax rate on earnings reduced welfare benefits as earnings increase is reduced more generous earnings disregards also have been seen as part of strategies to help make work pay as continued cash welfare benefits supplement the earnings of low wage earners from the states perspective the more generous earnings disr egards also have practical consequence they help states meet tanf work participation standards tanf law requires states to meet minimu m standards of work participation and the share of all families with an adult who must engage in specified work activities for minimum hours weekly climbed from st atutory level of 25 in fy1997 to 50 in fy2002 and following years one of the specified work activities creditable toward states meeting work participati on standards is unsubsidized employment combining welfare and work this di ffers from the pre1996 program the job opportunity and basic skills jobs training program which c ounted unsubsidized employment only in the first month on job to ward participation st andards in other months recipients who worked 35 hours pe r week or more were excluded from the participation rate cal culation under pre1996 federal ru recipients who went to work soon became ineligible for cash assistance with the adoption of more generous earnings disregards under tanf the proportion of adults who combine welfare w ith unsubsidized work has risen sharply from 11 in fy1996 to 26 in fy2002 combin ing welfare and work is by far the most common activity among tanf adults job search ranks distant second in terms of the percent of tanf adu lts engaged in an activity at 6 though the work reward policies of states help them meet tanf work participation requireme nts reduce disincentives to wo rk and help make work pay research shows that they tend to incr ease the amount of time families spend on cash welfare6 thus the work reward policies implicitly conflict with tanf time limits on cash assistance and the federal laws st atutory goal of ending dependence on government benefits7 longer use of cash welfare even by parents with jobs sometimes is viewed as prolonging welfare dependencehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32598crs26 appendix resource limits under afdc states could not set their countable resource limit above 1000 for both applicants and recipients under tanf states have the flexibility to establish their own financial eligibility guidelines and most states have raised their resource limits of the states that raised their resource limits the majority have adopted
