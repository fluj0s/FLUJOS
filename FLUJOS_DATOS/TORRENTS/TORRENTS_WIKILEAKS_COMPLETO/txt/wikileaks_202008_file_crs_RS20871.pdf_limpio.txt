against iran originally called the iranlibya sanctions act ilsa it was enacted to complement other measures particularly executive order 12959 of may 6 1995 that banned us trade with and investment in iranintended to deny iran the resources to further its nuclear program and to support terrorist organizations such as hizbollah hamas and palestine islamic jihad irans petroleum sector generates about 20 of irans gdp but its onshore oil fields and oil industry infrastructure are aging and need substantial investment its large natural gas resources 940 trillion cubic feet exceeded only by russia were undeveloped when isa was first enacted iran has 1363 billion barrels of proven oil reserves the third largest after saudi arabia and canada in 1995 and 1996 us allies did not join the united states in enacting trade sanctions against iran and the clinton administration and congress believed that it might be necessary for the united states to try to deter their investment in iran the opportunity to do so came in november 1995 when iran opened its energy sector to foreign investment to accommodate its ideology to retain control of its national resources iran used buyback investment program in which foreign firms recoup their investments from the proceeds of oil and gas discoveries but do not receive equity with input from the administration on september 8 1995 senator alfonse damato introduced the iran foreign oil sanctions act to sanction foreign firms exports to iran of energy technology revised version instead sanctioning investment in irans energy sector passed the senate on december 18 1995 voice vote on december 20 1995 the senate passed version applying the legislation to libya as well which was refusing to yield for trial the two intelligence agents suspected in the december 21 1988 bombing of pan am 103 the house passed hr 3107 on june 19 1996 4150 and then concurred on slightly different senate version adopted on july 16 1996 unanimous consent

companies entities persons that make an investment of more than 20 million in one year in irans energy sector 1 the sanctions section 6 include 1 denial of exportimport bank loans credits or credit guarantees for us exports to the sanctioned entity 2 denial of licenses for the us export of military or militarilyuseful technology 3 denial of us bank loans exceeding 10 million in one year 4 if the entity is financial institution prohibition on its service as primary dealer in us government bonds andor prohibition on its serving as repository for us government funds each counts as one sanction 5 prohibition on us government procurement from the entity and 6 restriction on imports from the entity in accordance with the international emergency economic powers act ieepa 50 usc 1701 in the original law the 1 the definition of investment in isa section 14 9 includes not only equity and royalty arrangements including additions to existing investment as added by pl 10724 but any contract that includes responsibility for the development of petroleum resources of iran interpreted to include pipelines to or through iran the definition excludes sales of technology goods or services for such projects and excludes financing of such purchases for libya the threshold was 40 million and sanctionable activity included export to libya of technology banned by pan am 103related security

g344g561president may waive the sanctions on iran if the parent country of the violating firm sanctions iran provision later made inapplicable or if he certifies that doing so is important to the us national interest section 9c under the original version isa application to iran would terminate if iran is determined by the administration to have ceased its efforts to acquire wmd and is removed from the us list of state sponsors of terrorism application to libya terminated when the president determined on april 23 2004 that libya had fulfilled the requirements of all resolutions on pan am 103 traditionally skeptical of imposing economic sanctions the european union opposed isa as an extraterritorial application of us law in april 1997 the united states and the eu agreed to avoid trade confrontation in the world trade organization wto over it and separate cuba sanctions law pl 104114 the agreement contributed to may 18 1998 decision by the clinton administration to waive isa

administration indicated future investments by eu firms in iran would not be sanctioned isa was to sunset on august 5 2001 in climate of lessening tensions with iran and libya during 1999 and 2000 the clinton administration had eased the trade ban on iran somewhat to try to engage the relatively moderate iranian president mohammad khatemi in 1999 libya yielded for trial the pan am 103 suspects however some maintained that both countries would view its expiration as concession and renewal legislation was enacted pl 10724 august 3 2001 this law required an administration report on isas effectiveness within 24 to 30 months of enactment that report was submitted to congress in january 2004 and did not recommend that isa be repealed

actually imposing isa sanctions the threat of sanctions coupled with irans reputedly difficult negotiating behavior and now compounded by irans growing isolation is slowing irans ener gy development as shown in the table below some foreign investment has flowed into iran since the 1998 total consortium waiver but many projects are stalled some investors such as repsol royal dutch shell and total have announced pullouts or declined further investment on july 12 2008 total and petronas the original south pars investors pulled out of deal to develop liquified natural gas lng export capability at phase 11 of south pars saying that investing in iran at time of growing international pressure over its nuclear program is too risky these trends are likely to constrain irans energy sector significantly irans deputy oil minister said in november 2008 that iran needs about 145 billion in new investment over th next ten years in order to build thriving energy sector as result of sanctions and the overall climate of international isolation of iran its oil production has not grownit remains at about 41 million barrels per day mbdalthough it has not fallen either some analyses including by the national academy of sciences say that partly because of growing domestic consumption iranian oil exports are declining to the point where iran might have negligible exports of oil by 2015 3 others maintain that irans gas sector can more than compensate for declining oil export s although it needs gas to reinject into its oil fields and remains relatively minor gas exporter it exports about 36 trillion cubic feet of gas primarily to turkey some members of congress believe that isa would have been even more effective if successive administrations had actually imposed sanctions gao study of december 2007 gao0858 contains chart of post2003 investments in irans energy sector totaling over 20 billion in investment although the chart includes petrochemical and refinery projects as well as projects that do not exceed the 20 million in one year threshold for isa sanctionability some of the projects listed in that report and in the table below may be under review by the state department bureau of economic affairs but publication of such deals has been placed in the federal register requirement of section 5e of isa and determinations of violation have been announced undersecretary of state for political affairs william burns testified on july 9 2008 house foreign affairs committee that the statoil project listed in the table is under review for isa sanctions he did not mention any of the other projects state department reports to congress on isa required every six months state that us diplomats raise us policy concerns about iran with investing companies and

interpreted by successive administrations to include construction of energy routes to or through iran because such routes help iran develop its petroleum resources the clinton administration used the threat of isa sanctions to deter oil routes involving iran and thereby successfully promoted an alternate route from azerbaijan baku to turkey ceyhan which became operational in 2005 however sanctions were imposed on 1997 project viewed as necessary to us ally turkeyan iranturkey natural gas pipeline in which each constructed the pipeline on its side of their border the state department did not impose isa sanctions on the grounds that turkey would be importing gas originating in turkmenistan not iran however direct iranian gas exports to turkey began in 2001 and as shown in the table in july 2007 preliminary agreement was reached to build second iran turkey pipeline through which iranian gas would also flow to europe however that agreement was not finalized during iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejads visit to turkey in august 2008 because of turkish commercial concerns but the deal remains under active discussion construction of oil refineries or petrochemical plants in iranincluded in the referenced gao reportmight also constitute sanctionable projects iran has plans to build or expand possibly with foreign investment at least eight refineries in an effort to ease gasoline imports that supply about 25 30 of irans needs this dependency on gasoline imports is down from the 40 that preceded the institution of gasoline rationing in iran in june 2007 it is not clear whether or not iranian investments in energy projects in other countries such as iranian investment to help build five oil refineries in asia china indonesia malaysia and singapore and in syria reported in june 2007 would constitute sanctionable investment under isa another pending deal is the construction of gas pipeline from iran to india through pakistan ipi pipeline the three governments appeared committed to the 7 billion project which would take about three years to complete but india did not sign deal finalization that was signed by iran and pakistan on november 11 2007 india resumed discussions on the project following iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejads visit to india in april 2008 which also resulted in indian firms winning preliminary iranian approval to take equity stakes in the azadegan oil field project and south pars gas field phase 12 india continues to raise concerns on security of the pipeline the location at which the gas would be officially transferred to india pricing of the gas tariffs and the source in iran of the gas to be sold us officials including secretary of state rice have on several occasions expressed us concern about the pipeline deal or have called it unacceptable but us official has stated outright that it would be sanctioned coinciding with the ahmadinejad visit other major energy deals with iran are considered blow to european solidarity in march 2008 switzerlands egl utility agreed to buy 194 trillion cubic feet per year of iranian gas for 25 years through transadriatic pipeline tap to be built by 2010 deal valued at least 15 billion the united states criticized the deal as sending the wrong message to iran however as testified by assistant secretary of state burns on july 9 2008 the deal appears to involve only purchase of iranian gas not exploration and likely does not violate isa in august 2008 germanys steinerprematechnikgastec co agreed to apply its method of turning gas into liquid fuel at three iranian plants in early october 2008 ir an agreed to export 1 billion cuftday of gas to oman via pipeline to be built that would end at omans lng export terminal facilities isa is one of many mechanisms the united states and its european partners are using to try to pressure iran us officials whose leverage has been enhanced by five security council

european and other banks not to finance exports to iran or to process dollar transactions with iranian banks and they have persuaded european governments to reduce export credits guarantees to iran the actions have according to the international monetary fund partly dried up financing for energy industry and other projects in iran and have caused potential investors in the energy sector to withdraw from or hesitate on finalizing pending projects some observers maintain that over and above the threat of isa sanctions and the international pressure on iran it is irans negotiating behavior that has slowed international investment in irans energy sector some international executives that have negotiated with iran say iran insists on deals that leave little profit and that iran frequently seeks to renegotiate provisions of contract after it is ratified
