presiden t bush put forward an agenda to enlist equip enable empower and expa nd the heroic works of faithbased and community groups across american1 that agenda included substantial expansion of tax incentives for charitable giving and broad extension of provisions promoting the involvement of religious organizations in the federal governments social services programs provisions that are known as charitable choice the house on july 19 2001 by vote of 233198 adopted modified version of that proposal hr 7 the community solutions act of 2001 but that measure bogged down in the senate due to continuing concerns about the constitutionality and desirability of the government funding entities that employ religious faith in carrying out their programs and that discriminate on religious grounds in their employment practices senators santorum rpa and lieb erman dconn developed compromise measure early in the second session of the 107th congress s 1924 the care act of 2002 that included tax incentives fo r charitable giving and certain other provisions paralleling those in hr 7 but th at excluded most of hr 7s charitable choice provisions the senate finance committee on july 16 2002 reported modified version of the care act that contained none of the charitable choice provisions of either the housepassed vers ion of hr 7 or s 1924 but efforts to obtain unanimous consent agreement allowi ng the legislation to be brought up for senate debate foundere d on continuing disagreements about what amendments could be offered by proponents nd opponents of charitable choice as result the 107th congress adjourned on november 22 2002 w ithout enacting any major charitable choice legislation as consequence the bush ad ministration on december 12 2002 announced series of measures to implement the most salient features of charitable choice administratively2 on that date the white househttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31043crs2 3 eo 13279 published at 67 fed reg 7713944 dec 16

107 th congress the house also adopted bill hr 4737 to reauthorize and extend the welfare reform program acted in 1996 which was the first statute to include charitable choice provisions th at bill contained amendments to the charitable choice provisions of the 1996 temporary assistance to needy families tanf enactment but it did authorize ne w program of grants to the states to promote healthy marriages which would have been subject to the existing charitable choice rules in the statute and it would also have required the states to describe what they are doing to engage religious organi zations in the provision of services under tanf5 in the senate the finance committee reported out modified version of hr 4737 on july 25 2002 that version would have authorized two new granthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31043crs3 6 it might be noted that both measures would so have authorized new program to promote fatherhood but neither version of the program appears to have been made subject to charitable choice 7 these four enactments are summarized in the an swer to question 3 in this report for fuller description of the consideration of th and other charitable choice proposals in the 104th 105th and 106th congresses see crs report rl30388 charitable choice constitutional issues and developments through the 106th congress and crs report rs20712 charitable choice faithbased

homes to help young mothers learn parenting skills in group home setting section 305 but th is measure received further action6 late in the second session the 107th congress enacted short extension of tanf and deferred more thorough consider ation of the issue to the 108th congress although enacted into law in four prior statutes7 charitable choice has been persistently controversial and president bushs faithbased initiative made that controversy highly visible numerous aspects of charitable choice have been disputed although not until the 107th congress were there fu ll hearings and extended debates on its constitu tionality efficacy and public polic implications much of the legal controversy has centered on the constitutionality of the federal government directly subsidizing faithbased social rvices programs and on whether subsidized religious organizations ought to be able to discriminate on religious grounds in their employment practices with particular attention to the legal issues concerning charitable choice this report provides information and analysis on number of factual civil rights and constitutional questions that have been raised the questions it addresses are as follows 1 what is charitable choice 2 arent religious organizations alr eady eligible to receive public funds 3 what charitable choice proposal s have been enacted into law 4 what is president bushs faithb ased initiative and what steps has the administration taken to implement it 5 have any hearings been held on charitable choice 6 what legislative action took plac on hr 7 s 1924 and other charitable choice measures in the 107th congress 7 what did the charitable choice title of hr 7 provide and how did it differ from previous charita ble choice statutes 8 what is the legal framework governin g the civil rights concerns that have been raised about charitable choice 9 does charitable choice violate the blishment of religion clause of the first amendment 10 what court suits involving charitable choice or similar programs have been filed or decided so far the report also includes an appendix that compares the provisions of the four charitable choice measures that have been enacted into law title ii of hr 7 ashttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31043crs4 8 the latter objective may raise constitutional questions about the initiative and may also be foreclosed by certain provisions in the statutes that have been enacted as well as in hr 7 and in eo 13279 see the discussion under questions 8 and 9 9 42 usca 2000e1adopted by the house in the 107th congress and eo 13279 this report will not be updated 1 what is charitable choice charitable choice is set of statutory andor regulatory provisions intended to ensure that religious organizations can appl to participate in federally funded social services programs on the same basis as other nongovernmental providers and can provide services pursuant to such prog rams without abandoning their religious character or infringing on the religious freedom of recipients the underlying assumptions of charitable choice seem to be that religious organizations should be given greater access to public funding and s hould be allowed to employ their faiths in carrying out the publicly funded programs to greater degree than has traditionally been the case8 except for small technical assistance programs operated by the department of labor and th department of health nd human services charitable choice does not in itself contain new fundi ng for faithbased organizations prior to president bushs issuance of executive order 13279 on december 12 2002 charitable choice rules applied only to discrete social services programs specifically designated in four statut enacted by congress since 1996 the four charitable choice measures that have been enacted th housepassed version of hr 7 in the 107th congress and executive order 13279 differ in some of their details and sometimes significantly so see questions 4 7 and the appendix but the major provisions of charitable c hoice include the following protecting the religious ch aracter of the organization charitable choice bars government from discriminating against an organization that applies to provide publicly funded social services on the basis of its religious character to protect such organizations religious ch aracter charitable choice further provides that i religious organizations which r eceive public funds remain independent of government and retain control over the definition development practice and expression of their religious belief ii government may not require such organizations to change their form of internal governance or to remove religious art and other symbols as condition of participation and iii religious organizations which receive federal funds may discriminate on religious grounds in their employment practices as allowed under title vii of the civil rights act of 19649 the charitable choice statutes provide that religious organizations use of public funds is subject to audit but they allo w and in several cases require the public funds to be segregated into separate account and limit the government audit to that account httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31043crs5 10 42 usca 9858 et seq 11 cooperative agreement is the legal phrase us ed to refer to funding agreements between the federal government and social services pr oviders that involve substantial interaction between the government agency and the provid er while the term grant refers to funding agreements that do not involve substantial interaction the term contract is limited to agreements for the provision of property or services to the government itself see 31 usca 63036305b protecting the religious freedom of recipients charitable choice specifies that religious organization ca nnot discriminate agai nst beneficiary or potential beneficiary on the basi s of religion or religious belief and in some versions on the basis of refusal to hold religi ous belief andor refusal to actively participate in religious practice as well charitable choice also requires that an alternate and accessible provider be made available to recipient who objects to the religious character of given provider and th at the government gi ve all beneficiaries notice of their right to an alternate provider title ii of hr 7 as passed by the house in 2001 would have added to these pr ovisions an explicit requirement that participation by beneficiar ies in any religious activity offered by provider that receives direct governmental assistance be voluntary but it also would have provided that this requirement of vol untariness does not apply if religious organization receives funding indirectly ie in the form of vouchers and in such programs it would have barred religious discrimination against beneficiaries only in admissions eo 13279 tracks these provisions as well c protecting the constitutionalit of the subsidized programs charitable choice bars religious organiza tion from using direct government aid for sectarian worship instruction or proselytiz ation unless the aid is received in the form of vouchers in which case this restriction does not apply moreover charitable choice programs are explicitly required to be implemented in manner consistent with the establishment of religion clause of the first amendment to the constitution and in some versions with the free exercise clause as well title ii of hr 7 as passed by the house in 2001 lthough not the charita ble choice statutes previously enacted into law also woul d have required that any religious activity offered by religious organization be sepa rate from the program that receives direct federal assistance and that participation in any religious activity that is directly funded be voluntary for the individuals receiving services eo 13279 imposes these requirements as well charitable c hoice also gives the government discretion with respect to whether religious progra ms and entities receiving federal funds have to be incorporated separately from their sponsoring religious organizations all of these provisions arguably enhance the prospect that charitable choice meets constitutional requirements 2 arent religious organizati ons already elig ible to receive public funds yes some federal programs such as the child care and development block grant program10 explicitly specify that religious organizations are eligible to participate more commonly federal grant and cooperative agreement programs11 provide that private entities or nonprofit entities are eligible to participate and thesehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31043crs6 12 section 501c3 of title 26 of the us c ode provides an exemption from federal income taxes to the following corporations and any community ches t fund or foundation organized and operated exclusively for religious charitabl scientific testing for public safety literary or educational purposes part of the net earnings of which inures to the benefit of an private shareholder or individual substantial part of the activities of which is carrying on propaganda or otherwise attempting to influence legislation and which does not participate in or intervene in including the publishing or distributing of statements any political campaign on behalf of or in opposition to any candidate for public office one of the primary benefits of taxexempt st atus and major incentive for obtaining such status is that donations to such organizati ons may be claimed as tax deduction by the donors see 26 usca 170 tax exempt status is not always requirement for organizations to participate in federal funding programs 13 see eg lemon v kurtzman 403 us 602

the construction of academic buildings at sectarian colleges held constitutional subject to the restriction that continuedcategories include religious as well as secular organizations such entities as catholic charities usa lutheran services in america the salvation army united jewish communities habitat for humanity and numerous other religiously affiliated or religiously sponsored organizations at the national state and local levels have long participated in publicly funded social services programs these organizations are commonly incorporated separately fro m their sponsoring religious organizations and usually have taxexempt status unde r 501c3 of the federal tax code12 but interpretations and applications of the establishment of religion clause of the first amendment as well as policy deci sions by administrators have in the past generally required programs operated by re ligious organizations that receive direct public funding to be essentia lly secular in nature re ligious symbols and art have sometimes had to be removed from the premises and religious worship instruction and proselytizing have been forbidden as conditions of receiving public monies moreover religious entities that have been found to be perva sively sectarian ie entities in which religion is pervasive elem ent of all that they do have until recently generally been deemed constitutionally ineligible to participate in most direct funding programs the courts have applied thes constraints most strictly in the context of direct aid programs benefitting sectarian elementary and secondary schools13 but the same standards have been held to apply to pr ograms of direct public aid to religiously affiliated colleges and social services programs14 recent decisions by the

constitutional constraints to considerable degree but still require that direct public aid not be used for purposes of religious indoctrination charitable choice is legislative and regulatory effort to move beyond these restrictions and to expand the involvement of religious organi zations in federally funded social services programs while allowi ng them at the same time to retain their religious character see question 9 for fuller discussion of the constitutional framework governing charitable choice 3 what charitable choice proposals have been enacted into law between 1996 and 2000 congress

towork grant program added to tanf in 199715 the 105th congress included selected charitable choice provisions in its reauthorization of the community services block grant program in 199816 in 2000 the 106th congress adopted two measures adding charitable choice to th substance abuse prevention and treatment services funded under both the block gran t and discretionary grant provisions of titles v and xix of the public health services act17 the language in the 1996 welfare law s been the basic model for charitable choice that law authoriz the states at their option to administer and provide tanf services or benefits through nongove rnmental entities or through the provision of certificates or vouchers to tanf beneficiaries redeemable with private entities the law said that if state exercise d this option it had to allow religious organizations to participate on the same basis as any other private entity subject to the requirements of charitable choice regarding the religious

summarized the initial findings of the five departmental centers as including the following i small faithbased and secular groups receive very little federal support relative to the scope of the services they provide ii there is widespread bias agains t such groups reflected in cumbersome regulations and prohibitions on religious activities that go beyond constitutional requirements iii regulations often impose requirements beyond what the legislation mandates iv the existing charitable choice statut have been almost entirely ignored by federal administrators v there is very little evaluation of the results that are achieved in federally funded social services programs and continuedof these requirements but the basic fr amework of the charitable choice provisions of welfare reform has been retained18 4 what is president bushs faithbased initiative and what steps has the administrati on taken to implement it initial effort the promotion of increased involvement by faithbased and community organizations in federally funde d social services programs has been centerpiece of presidents bushs domestic agenda soon after taking office on january 29 2001 president bush

the white house office in order to make their agen cies as open and supportive as possible to successful faithbased and grassroots or ganizations and more particularly to identify and eliminate regulatory statutory and administrative barriers to the participation of such groups on august 16 2001 the white house issued the first of what it said will be nnual reports summarizing th initial

under any program or activity funded in whole or in pa rt with funds made available under section of this title 37 42 usca 2000bb et seqregulations incorporate all of the principles set forth above in executive order 13279 all have the following additions as well although eo 13279 states that faithbased organizations that receive direct federal financia l assistance cannot use the assistance for inherently religious activities all of the proposed regulations emphasize that this restriction does not apply to fede ral financial assistance that is received indirectly ie funding that an organization receives as the resu lt of the genuine and independent private choice of beneficiar through voucher certificate coupon or other similar mechanism thus the proposed regulations explicitly affirm that organizations that receive funds indirectly can use them for inherently religious activities and need not segregate their religious activities by time or location from the subsidized activities all of the proposed regulations exp licitly state that receipt of funds under the applicable program by religious organization does not affect the organizations exemption from the religious nondiscrimination in employment re quirement of title vii of the civil rights act of 196435 in other words participating religious organizations can discriminate on religious grounds in their employment practices as allowed under t itle vii notwithstanding their receipt of public funds the regulations applicable to the programs administered by or throug h samhsa further state that the religious nondiscrimination in em ployment requirements in the public health service act36 also do not apply if participating religious organization can demons trate that application of the requirement would substa ntially burden its religious exercise the reason for that exception the expl anatory material states is not anything in charitable choice but the religious freedom restoration act37 which bars the federal g overnment from imposing any substantial burden on religious exercise unless necessary to accomplish compelling public purpose all of the proposed regulations stat that beneficiaries who object to the religious character of given service provider have right to receive services from another provider to whom they have religious objection the regulations require that beneficiaries be given notice of their right to an alternative provider that such alternative providers be reasonably accessible and that the value of the services received be less than those that would have been received from the original provider the regulations further makehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31043crs14 38 the existing regulations for these prog rams are found at 24 cfr part 92 570 572

in the foregoing programs but impose special restrictions on primarily religious entities more particularly existing regulations ge nerally 1 prohibit direct assistance to primarily religious organiza tions for the construction acquisition or rehabilitation of housing or other structures 2 require ch entities in order to obtain grants for the acquisition construction or rehabilitation of housing or other structures to form separate secular corporations and 3 require that stru ctures constructed acquired or rehabilitated with public funds be used for wholly secular purposes in addition existing regulations governing the receipt of grants by primarily religious organizations for the provision of services generally bar them from 4 discriminating on religious grounds in their employment practices and 5 exerting religious influence in their provision of services the proposed regulations would eliminate all of these requirements the new regulations would allow dhud to make gr ants directly to primarily religious organizations for all purposes ie such entities would not need to set up separate secular organizations to receive gran ts for the construction acquisition or rehabilitation of housing or other structures moreover in what may be the most dramatic departure from the existing regula tions structures c onstructed acquired or rehabilitated with public funds could be used not only for eligible secular activities but also for inherently religious ones pub lic funding in such situations would simply have to be limited to the proportion for wh ich the structures are used for eligible activities finally religi ous entities receiving public funds would be permitted to discriminate on religious grounds in their employment practices the proposed regulations would also in corporate all of the charitable choice principles described above in execu tive order 13279 public comments on dhuds proposed regulations we re due by march 7

charitable choice provisions of the housepassed measure or even the more modest provisions concerning religious organizations of s 192450 senators santor um and lieberman led efforts to develop

but the 107th congress came to an end without any sena floor debate on charitable choice on either hr 7 or s 1924 the followi ng subsections give greater detail on what happened on these measures i judiciary committee report in reporting the bill on july 12 2001 the judiciary committee stressed that charitable choice is not new and has previously been enacted four times it stated that th bill was response to the decline in private philanthropy caused by higher and higher taxes as well as to misguided understandings of the cons titution which prevented government from working more closely with religious organizations that support for public funding of social services programs operated by relig ious organizations was strong particularly among africanamericans that existing charitable choice programs have had significant impact on social welfare delivery and that hr 7 had been modified to respond to some of the criticisms that had been made about charitable choice the report also gave an extended defense of the constitutionality of charitable choice and of the provision allowing religious organizations to discriminate on religious grounds in their employment practi ces it emphasized that the bill ensured that aid to social services organizations w ould be distributed in religiously neutral way and that it respected the individual c hoices whether religious or nonreligious of the needy who are served by these programs recent decisions by the supreme court it said had abandoned the notions th at public aid cannot be provided directly to pervasively sectarian organizations nd that employees of such organizations cannot be trusted to follow guidelines pr eventing the use of government funds for proselytizing activities the bill it said contained cons titutionally adequate safeguards for monitoring how public funds are used moreover with respect to the new provision in hr 7 authorizing social services programs to be converted to voucher programs if deemed feasible nd efficient by the secretary of the administering department the report asse rted that charitable choice programs administered through the use of vouchers or certificates to individuals who may then choose to give them to nonreligious or relig ious organizations in return for services enjoy the widest constitutional berthhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31043crs19 51 hrept 10738 part i supra at 28so long as the initial beneficiaries have choice about where to redeem the vouchers or certificates and range of choices are available including religious and nonreligious social service organiza tions such programs do not violate the first amendment51 with respect to employment discrimination the co mmittee report contended that one of the most important charitable choice principles is the guarantee of institutional autonomy that allows faithbas ed organizations to select staff on religious basis this guaranteed ability is central to each organizations freedom to define its own mission according to the dictates of its faith that is the reason the report stated that congress wrote an exemption for religious organizations into title vii of the civil rights act of 1964 and that exemption it asserted is not waived or forfeited when religious organization receives federal funding staffing on religious basis it said does not constitute invidious discrimination and constitutionally the exemption is permissible religious accommodation moreover it stated this exemption shoul d apply even when state or local laws provide otherwise both the autonomy pr ovision and the provision stating that the charitable choice rules apply to state funds that are commingled with federal funds the report stated served to preempt state and local civil rights laws that would intrude on the right of religious organizations to employ persons of their own faiths the report noted that under hr 7 the right is judicially enforceable twelve democrats filed dissenting views in the committee report stating that we cannot support legislation which s eeks to enlarge the role of religious institutions by sanctioning governmentf unded discrimination nd by breaking down the historic separation between church and state contending that the bill not only allowed religious organizations to discriminate on the basis of prospective employees religion but also on the basis of failure to adhere to religious doctrine eg being pregnant and unmarried being gay or lesbian and that it preempted conflicting state and local nondi scrimination laws as well the dissenters asserted that it is unacceptable for any group or entity to discriminate with taxpayer funds given that the federally funde d services to be provided by such organizations must be wholly secular under hr 7 they sai d employment discrimination on the basis of religion is simply unnecessary with respect to the separation of church and state the dissenters contended that the safeguards in the bill were inadequate they noted that hr 7 provided funds to ensure that beneficiarys righ t to secular alternative to faithbased service the most critical establishment clause safeguard included in the legislation could be honored and said the require ment constituted an unfunded and unenforceable mandate they contende d as well that the other key religious protections in the bill the ban on the use of government funds for sectarian proselytization and the requirements that religious activity be separate from the funded program and that par ticipation in such activity be voluntary were largely left to self enforcement they questioned as well whether participation in such programs by children or perhaps even dr ug addicts could ever be truly voluntary the dissenters further argued that the

the existing charitable choice rules60 in lieu of further action on these rea uthorization measures congress included in the final continuing resolution for th session provision extending the existing welfare program until january 11 200361 c other measures another measure in the 107th congress that once contained charitable choi ce provisions was s 304 the drug abuse education prevention and treatment act of 2001 as introduced on february 13 2001 by senators hatch rut and leahy dvt and four cosponsors the bill would have extended charitable choice rules to numbe r of new programs such as jailbased substance abuse programs resi dential treatment programs for juveniles programs to prevent delinquency through character educa tion and programs to help the children of prisoners but in reporting the meas ure to the senate on november 29 2001 the senate judiciary committee by voice vote approved substitute measure that did not contain the charitable choice provisions the committee did not issue report the measure remained pending on the sena calendar when congress adjourned in addition it might be noted that as introduced title v of hr 1 the child left behind act of 2001 would

differ from previous charitable choice statutes the charitable choice title of hr 7 as approved by the judiciary committee and by the house was more elaborate ve rsion of what had pr eviously been enacted and would not only have extended charita ble choice to most of the federal governments social services programs but also allowed administrators to voucherize the programs if they deemed it feasible and efficient to do so title ii contained more expansive purposes secti on than prior enactments stating that the act is intended not only to prohibit discrimination against religious organizations on the basis of their religious character and to protect the religious freedom of beneficiaries but also to provide assistance to individuals and families in the most effective and efficient manner and to facilitate the entry of religious and other community organizations in the adminis tration and distribution of government assistance in addition with the provisi ons that differ from the previously enacted charitable choice statutes highlighted in italics title ii of hr 7 would have extended charitable choice rules to federally funded activities in nine program areas 1

of hr 7 reported by the senate finance committee on july 16 2002 did not contain any of the fo regoing provisions for summary of the more modest provisions of s 1924 see the preceding question 8 what is the legal framework for the civil rights concerns that have been raised about charitable choice several civil rights concerns have b een raised in the debates on charitable choice the primary one has been whether the religious exemption in title vii of the civil rights act of 1964 whic h allows religious organiza tions to discriminate on religious grounds in their employment practices should apply to religious organizations that receive public funds under the rubric of charitable choice president bushs december 12 executive orde r raised related issue by exempting religious organizations that contract to provide goods and services to the federal government or that participate in federa lly financed construction contracts from the religious nondiscrimination in employme nt provisions of executive order 11246 there has also been some concern over the protections from discrimination afforded beneficiaries by charitable choice and in an issue that only became apparent in the debates on hr 7 on whether charitable c hoice should preempt st ate and local civil rights laws that go beyond federa l nondiscrimination re quirements and bar employment discrimination on such bases as sexual orientation and marital status these issues arise in the context of complex panoply of ci vil rights mandates and exemptions that already exist the following subsections explicate charitable choice with respect to 1 existing mandates barring discrimination in programs and activities that receive federa l financial assistance 2 existing regulatory mandates barring discrimination in employment practices particularly title vii of the civil rights act of 1964 and 3 the preempti on of state and local nondiscrimination laws that go beyond federal law final subsection discusses the employment nondiscrimination requireme nts of executive order 11246 and the presidents exemption of religious organizations from the religious nondiscrimination requirement of that order the question of the constitutionality of public aid going to organizations which discriminate on religious gr ounds in their employment practices is discussed in question 9httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31043crs27 73 42 usca 2000d et seq 74 20 usca 1681 et seq 75 29 usca 794 76 42 usca 6101 et seq 77 because hr 7 contained provision statin g that any funds received under the rubric of charitable choice constitute aid to individuals and families in need and not aid to the organization there was some concern in the house about whether title vi title ix section 504 and the age discrimination act would be applicable consequently an amendment was agreed to in the committee markup and re tained in the housepassed bill referencing these statutes and clarifying that nothing in this section affects their applicability 78 see eg the nondiscrimination prohibition attach ed to the head start program at 42 usca 9849aa nondiscrimination in federally assisted programs federal law imposes number of civil rights obligations on the provision of services in programs and activities that receive fe deral financial assistance title vi of the civil rights ac t of 1964 bars discrimination on the bases of race color or national origin73 title ix of the education amendm ents of 1972 bars discrimination on the basis of sex and on the ba sis of blindness in admissions in education programs74 section 504 of the rehabilitation ac t of 1973 bars discrimination on the basis of handicap75 the age discrimination act of 1975 bars discrimination on the basis of age76 all of these prohibitions on discrimination are triggered by the receipt of federal funds but most of them apply only to th delivery of services and not to the employment practices of the entities that receive federal funds the applicability of these statutes to federally financed programs and activities is not altered by charitable choice77 in contrast there is comparable federal statute that generally bars religious discrimination in fe derally funded programs and ac tivities individual programs sometimes contain such prohibition78 but there is general statutory prohibition nonetheless charitable choice has since its inception as part of the welfare reform measure in 1996 included provisions that bar religious organizations from discriminating against beneficiaries on relig ious grounds and that require government to make an alternate provider available to any beneficiary who objects to the religious character of given provider but there ve been some distinctions in the types of religious discrimination that are prohibited and the housepassed version of hr 7 drew new distinction based on whether the religious organization receives funding directly or indirectly with respect to i ndirect assistance hr 7 would have barred religious discrimination against individuals only in admissionshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31043crs28 79 42 usca 12201 et seq 80 29 usca 621 et seq 81 42 usca 2000e et seq 82 20 usca 1681a3 83 42 usca 12113call of the existing charitable choice statutes as well as hr 7 bar religious organization that receives assistance from di scriminating against beneficiaries on the basis of religion or religious belief three of the four statutes also bar such discrimination on the basis of refusal to actively participate in religious practice but hr 7 and one of the s ubstance abuse statutes do not include this latter prohibition although hr 7s require ment that particip ation in religious activity must be voluntary is arguably equi valent moreover hr 7 and the other drug abuse statute also bar discrimination on the basis of refusal to hold religious belief finally hr 7 as passed by th house would have applied its religious nondiscrimination mandate s to all aspects of programs that are directly funded but only to admissions in programs that are i ndirectly funded given that hr 7 also would have allowed the secr etaries of the appropriate department to convert the programs to which the charitable choice pr ovisions would be pplied to vouchers if they find it to be feasible and efficient this distinction might have been very significant b nondiscrimination in employment federal statutes impose number of employment nondiscrimination requirement s on public and private employers and generally these are not dependent on whether or not the entity receives federal financial assistance ie they are regulatory requireme nts that apply regardless of whether an entity receives federal assistan ce with the exception of title ix none of the nondiscrimination statut described in the previous subsection applies to the employment practices of entities that receive federal funds unless primary objective of the federally f unded program is to provide employment but most public and private employers that employ more than specified number of employees are barred by the americans with disabilities act from discriminating in their employment practices on the basis of disability79 by the age discrimination in employment act on the basis of age80 and by title vii of the civil rights act of 1964 on the bases of race color na tional origin sex and religion81 number of these statutes contain special provisions with respect to the employment practices of religious institutions religious educational institutions are exempt from the sex nondiscrimination requireme nt of title ix for instance if the application of this subsection would not be consistent with the religious tenets of such organization82 the americans with disabilities act while barring religious organizations from discriminating on the basis of disability in employment specifically provides that they may still give preference in their employment practices on the basis of religion and ma require their employees to conform to their religious tenets83 most important title vii specifically exempts religious employers from its ban on religious discrimination in employmenthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31043crs29 84 title ii of hr 7 as introduced included as well provision that would have allowed religious entities receiving public funds to require their employees to adhere to their religious practices given the broad cons truction that has been given the title vii exemption that provision likely added nothing to the title vii exemption but in any event the provision was not part of the managers substitute for title ii proposed at the beginning of the markup of hr 7 by the house judici ary committee and was not part of the bill as approved by the committee or by the house 85 42 usca 2000e1 title vii also cont ains two other exemptions now largely redundant allowing religious employers to di scriminate on religious grounds the first allows educational institutions that are religious ly controlled or that are directed toward the propagation of particular religion to discriminate on religious grounds in their employment practices the second allows all employers not just religious organizations to use religion sex or national origin as crite rion in their employment practices if religion sex or national origin is bona fide occupa tional qualification reasonably necessary to the normal operation of that particul ar business or enterprise see 42 usca 2000e2etitle vii and the religious exemption it is the title vii exemption that has generated the most exte nsive debate in the discussion of charitable choice because all of the charitable choice statut and proposals so far including the housepassed version of hr 7 have explicitly provided that the title vii exemption shall not be affected by the religious organizations provision of assistance under or receipt of funds from program described in 84 neither the senate finance committee version of hr 7 nor s 1924 it should be noted contained such provision title vii bars most public and privat employers with 15 or more employees from discriminating in their employment practices on the bases of race color national origin sex and religion this threshold requirement of 15 employees means that many churches synagogues and other congregational entities as well as small religious social services providers are not large enough to be covered by any of the nondiscrimination manda tes of title vii but section 702 of title vii specifically exempts those religious employ ers that are large enough to be covered from its prohibition on religious discrimination as follows this title shall not apply to religi ous corporation association educational institution or society with respect to the employment of individuals of particular religion to perform work connected with the carrying on by such corporation association educational in stitution or society of its activities85 thus religious organizations otherwise covered by title vii may use religion as criterion in their hiring firing promoti on and other employment practices and they may do so not only with respect to employees engaged in religious activities but also those engaged in purely secular activities this exemption has been unanimously upheld as constitutional by the supreme c

regulation that relates to discrimination in employmentemployment by religious organizations of persons who are not engaged in religious ministry or in the training of persons for such ministries such as the administrative and support staff in religious institutions93 because the ministerial exemption is constitutionally based it is not modified by charitable choice in any way thus under the title vii exemption re ligious organization can discriminate on religious grounds with respect to all of its employees but if it meets the minimum size requirement it is otherwise s ubject to the statutes employment nondiscrimination manda tes with respect to the empl oyment of its spiritual leaders however religious organization pursuant to the ministerial exception is unconstrained by any nondiscriminati on requirement c preemption of state and local civil rights laws an issue that received only slight attention in previous debates on charitable choice gained substantial visibility during house consideration of hr 7 that issue concerns the preemptive effect of charitable choice on state and local civil rights laws that bar forms of discrimination that are not barred by federal law such as discrimination based on sexual orienta tion or marital status all of the charitable choice statutes that have been enacted as well as title ii of hr 7 provide that religious organization that is program participant shall retain its independence from federal state and local government including such orga nizations control over the definition development practice and ex pression of its religious beliefs but prior to the house debate on hr 7 there had been legislative history explicating the meaning of this provision similarly all of the charitable choice statutes and proposals have barred governme nt from requiring that religious provider alter its form of internal governance and as noted above have explic itly provided that religious organizations exemption under t itle vii shall not be affected by its participation in or receipt of funds from designated program but with the exception of provision added to the charita ble choice statute c oncerning substance abuse programs94 little attention has been paid to whether these provisions might have preemptive effect on state and local civil rights laws the house debate on hr 7 seemed to make clear that these provisions and particularly the first one concerning the independence of religi ous organizations are intended to preempt state and local civil rights laws the report of the house judiciary committee statedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31043crs33 95 hrept 107138 part i supra at 37 96 id at 38 during the markup of the bill rep sensenbrenner responded to question from rep frank about the preemptive

43 fed reg 46501 oct 10 1978because hr 7 expands charitable choice principles to cover many new federal programs one uniform rule should apply to all programs and allow religious organizations to retain their autonomy ov er the definition development practice and expression of their religious beliefs in cluding through hiring staff this is so even when state or local laws prov ide otherwise wherever federal funds go this statutory right of religious or ganizations to staff on religious basis should follow 95 the report similarly made clear that if state and local funds are commingled with federal funds in an applicable program state and local civil rights laws will not apply to those funds96 under the supremacy clause of the constitution97 it seems clear that congress has the power to preempt state and local laws pursuant to charitable choice what has been the subject of debate has been the desirability of doing so in this case it might be noted however that executive order 13279 issued by president bush on december 12 2003 directs federa l departments and agencies to implement similar policy regarding the independence of religious entities from state and local laws in their social services programs d the december 12 modification of executive order 11246 executive order 11246 in effect since 196598 requires that all federal procurement contracts part ii and

contracts on december 12 2002 president bush issued executive order 13279100 that order inter alia amends eo 11246 with respect to the prohibition on religious discrimination as it applies to religious organizations the amendment adds the following language to eo 11246 section 202 of this order shall not pply to government contractor or subcontractor that is religious corpor ation association educational institution or society with respect to the employment of individuals of particular religion to perform work connected with the carrying on by such corporation association educational institution or society of its activities such contractors and subcontractors are not exem pted or excused from complying with the other requirements contained in this order101 eo 13279 states that the amendment is t further the strong federal interest in ensuring that the cost and progress of federal procurement contracts are not adversely affected by an artificial re striction of the labor pool caused by an unwarranted exclusion of faithbased organizations from such contracts102 the amendment tracks wordforword the exemption afforded religious entities from the religious nondiscrimina tion requirement of title v ii of the civil rights act of 1964103 thus like the title vii exemption the exemption it affords covered religious entities is broad it applies to all of the activities of the organizations regardless of whether an employees functi ons are secular or religious but the amendment does not affect the obligation of covered religious entities to comply with the other requirements of the ex ecutive order regarding employment nondiscrimination on the bases of race color sex and national origin nor does it affect the obligation of covered nonrelig ious entities with respect to religious discrimination to the extent the amendm ent modifies part ii of eo 11246 it seems doubtful that it has substantial significance for religious organizations part ii in itself is not applicable to the federal grant and cooperative agreemen t programs subsidizing the provision of social services that have been the primary focus of debate about charitable choice and religious discrimination by faithbased organizations part ii concerns federal proc urement contracts ie contracts for the provision of goods and services directly to the federal govern ment such contracts can range from foodhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31043crs35 services to office supplies to bombers and can obviously invol ve substantial sums of money but it is not at all clear that religious organizati ons have historically played significant role in such federal procurement contracts however the amendment also appears to apply to part iii of eo 11246 ie to federally assisted construction contracts part iii defines construction contract to mean contract for the constr uction rehabilitation lteration conversion extension or repair of build ings highways or other impr ovements to real property and its coverage includes cons truction contracts that are incident to carrying out federal grant contract loan insurance or guarantee program thus part iii reaches beyond the federal pr ocurement contracts addresse d by part ii and applies to the construction aspects of fe deral grant programs such as for example those of the department of housing and urban devel opment because religious organizations have historically been extensively i nvolved in federally assisted housing and community development programs and b ecause other federally assisted social services programs in which faithbased organizations participate may incidentally involve construction or renova tion activities the amendment to this part of eo 11246 likely has greater signifi cance for such organizations 9 does charitable choice vi olate the establishment of religion clause of the first amendment as noted in question 1 the charitable choice statutes and title ii of hr 7 in the 107th congress contain number of provisions that seem intended to ensure their constitutionality all of these measures require that they be implemented consistent with the establishment clause of the unite d states constitution all require that public funds that are disburse d directly to religious organizations not be used for purposes of religious worship instruction or proselytization ll have provisions to protect those who receive services from religious organizations from religious discrimination all require equal treatment but not preferential treatment for religious organizations seeking to participate in government social services programs title ii of hr 7 although not the charitabl choice statutes prev iously enacted into law also would have required that any religious activity offered by religious organization be separate from the program th at receives direct federal assistance and that participation in any relig ious activity that is direc tly funded be voluntary for the individuals receiving services on the other hand all of the statutes as well as hr 7 also allow religious organizations that receive public funds to discriminate on religious grounds with respect to their employees to display religious symbols on the premises where services are provided and to practice and express their religious beliefs independent of any government restricti ons none of them moreover require the publicly funded program to be separa tely incorporated from its sponsoring religious organization in addition the measures allow religious organizations that receive public funds indirectly ie by means of vouchers to engage in religious worship instruction and proselytization in the funded program and to impose religious requirements on beneficiaries after they are once admitted to program

wh ether they are directly or indirectly funded as consequence questions have been raised about whet her charitable choice on its face or in its implementation is consistent with the establishment of religion clause of the first amendment one asp ect of this issue concerns whether it is constitutional for public funds to go to or ganizations that discriminate on religious grounds in their employment practices mo re generally the question is whether it is constitutional for public funds to go to religious organizations that have the characteristics detailed in the previous paragraph and that in some manner employ their faiths in carrying out the funded programs these questions of constitutionality in turn have at least two dimensions the charitable choice statutes and proposal s govern public aid that is given directly to religious organizations by means of grants or cooperative agreem ents in the specified programs and at least in the cases of tanf and title ii of hr 7 public aid that is given indirectly in the form of vouchers that can be redeemed with religious as well as nonreligious organizations the constituti onal strictures that apply to these two forms of aid differ and as consequence the form in which the public aid is provided to religious organizations under charitable choice has implications for the constitutionality of the aid these questions are further complicated by the fact that the supreme courts interpretation of the establishment clause has been shifting prior to its recent decisions the courts construction of the establishment clause made it difficult if not impossible for religious organizations that are deemed pervasively sectarian to receive aid directly from the government even for avowedly secular purposes and have required that programs receiving di rect public aid be ssentially secular in nature but the courts recent decisions in agostini v felton104 and mitchell v helms105 have relaxed the strictures on direct aid and eliminated the pervasively sectarian barrier although the court still requires that direct aid to religious institutions not be used for religious i ndoctrination with respect to indirect assistance the courts past jurisprudence has been less restrictive and its recent decision in zelman v simmonsharris106 appears to legitimate an even broader array of voucher programs the following subsections detail the constitutional frameworks that appear to govern direct and indirect aid nd apply them to charitable choice direct aid in general terms the establishment clause has been construed by the supreme court to absolutely prohi bit governmentfinanced or government sponsored indoctrination into the belie fs of particular religious faith107 government inculcation of religious be liefs the

religion108 to guard against that effect public assistance which flows directly to religious institutions in the form of grants or cooperative agreements has been required by the court to be limited to aid that is secular neutral and nonideological109 government has been able to provide direct support to secular programs and services spons ored or provided by religious entities but it has been barred from directly subsidizing such organizations religious activities or proselytizing110 the court gradually distilled the constitutional requirements governing direct aid into tripartite test that test known as the lemon test after the case in which it was first given full expre ssion required public aid to meet all of the following requirements first the statute must have secular legislative purpose second its principal or primary effect must be one that neither advances nor inhibits religion finally the statute must not foster an ex cessive entanglement with religion111 the secular purpose prong has rarely posed serious obstacle to the constitutionality of direct aid program but the courts or iginal formulations of the primary effect and entanglement tests ofte n proved fatal to programs providing direct aid to pervasively religious institutions the court construed the primary effect test to mean that direct public aid must be limited to secular use thus direct aid program could founder on this aspect of the lemon test in either of two ways it could be held unconstitutional if the aid was not limited to secular use either by its nature or by statutory or regulatory constraint112 it could also be held unconstitutional if it flowed to institutions that the court deemed to be pervasively sectarian ie entities whose religious and secular functions were so inextricably intertwined that its secular functions could not be isolat ed for purposes of public aid113 moreover even if an aid program was limited to secular use it often foundered on the excessive entanglement prong of the lemon test particularly in the context of direct aid to pervasively sectarian or ganizations the court held that government had to closely monitor the use religious organizations made of the aid provided in order to be sure that the limitation to secular use was observed but the very act of monitoring the court sometimes said excessively intruded the government

organization pervasively sectarian but it looked at such fa ctors as the proximity of the organization in question to sponsoring church the presence of religious symbols and paintings on the premises formal church or denominational control over the organization whether religious criterion is applied in the hiring of em ployees or in the selection of trustees or in the case of school to the admission of student s statements in the organizations charter or other publications that its purpose is the propagation and promotion of religious faith whether the organization engages in religious

made clear that it is not enough to show that the recipient of grant is aff iliated with religious institution or that it is religiously inspired bowen v kendrick supra at 621 indeed none of these factors by itself has been held sufficient to make an institution pervasively sectarian and therefore ineligible for direct aid such finding has always rested on combination of factors for useful lower federal court discussions of th criteria bearing on whether an institution is pervasively sectarian or not see minnesota federation of teachers v nelson 740 fsupp 694 d minn 1990 and columbia

decided june 26 2001 116 see bowen v kendrick 487 us 589 1988affairs of the religious institution and for that reason the aid program was unconstitutional114 thus under this application of the lemon test religious organizations were not automatically disqualified from participating in public programs providing direct assistance but in order to meet the secu lar use requirement such organizations had either to divest themselves of their religious character and to become predominantly secular in nature or at the least to be able to separate their secular functions and activities from their religious functions and activities to the extent they did so it was deemed constitutionally permissible fo r government to provide direct funding to their secular functions this former interpretation of the establishment clause also generally meant that it was constitutionally impermissible for religious organizations that are pervasively sectarian to participate in dir ect public aid programs115 as practical matter these interpretations of the establishment clause had their most severe effects on programs providing direct aid to sectarian elementary and secondary schools because the court pres umed that such schools are pervasively sectarian the court presumed to the contrary with respect to sectarian colleges hospitals and other social welfare organi zations although it held open the possibility that some of these agencies might be pervasively sectarian116 in its most recent decisions however the court has reformulated the lemon test and abandoned the presumption that some religious institutions such as sectarianhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31043crs39 117 521 us 203 1997 118 the agostini decision overturned in its entir ety the courts decision in aguilar v felton 473 us 402

secondary schools are so pervasively sectarian that they are constitutionally ineligible to participate in direct public aid programs the court still requires that direct public aid serve secu lar purpose not have primary effect of advancing or inhibiting relig ion and not lead to excessi ve entanglement but the primary effect test now means that the aid itself must be secular in nature must be distributed on religiously neutral basis and must not be used for purposes of religious indoctrination moreover the court s now made the excessive entanglement test one aspect of the primary effect inqui ry and it longer assumes that such entanglement is the inevitable result of government oversight of its aid program three years ago in agostini v felton117 the court for the first time overturned prior establishment clause decision and held it to be constitu tional for public school teachers to provide remedial and enrichment services on the premises of private sectarian schools to children attending t hose schools who were eligible for such services under title i of the elemen tary and secondary education act118 the earlier decision of aguilar v felton supra had found the delivery of such services on the premises of sectarian elemen tary and secondary schools to be excessively entangling because the pervasively sectarian nature of the ins titutions required government to engage in very intrusive monitoring to be sure that the title i employees did not inculcate religion but in agostini the court stated that subsequent decisions had abandoned the presumption that public employees will inculcate religion simply because they happen to be in sectarian environment119 as consequence it said it had also to discard the assumption that pervasive monitoring of title i t eachers is required120 the court also stated that the factors we use to assess whether an entanglement is excessive are similar to the factors we use to examine effect thus it is simplest to recognize why entanglement is significant and treat it as an aspect of the inquiry into statutes effect121 most recently the court in mitchell v helms122 upheld as constitutional an esea program which subsidizes the acquis ition and use of educa tional materials and equipment by public and private schools more particularly the court found the provision of such items as computer rdware and software library books movie projectors television sets tape recorder s vcrs laboratory equipment maps and cassette recordings to private sectaria n elementary and secondary schools not to violate the establishment clause in the process the court overt urned parts of two prior decisions which had held similar aid programs to be unconstitutional and whichhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31043crs40 123

education v nyquist supra and sloan v lemon supra 127 mueller v allen 463 us 388 1983 witters v washington department of social continuedhad been premised on the view that direct aid to pervasively sectarian institutions is constitutionally suspect123 although the justices could not agree on majority opinion the plurality opinion by justice thomas and the concurring opinion by justice oconnor joined by justice breyer both appear to have eliminated pervasive sectarianism as constitutionally preclusive characteristic regarding direct aid and modified the primary effect test accordingly agostini had hinted at this result but mitchell confirmed it as summarized by ju stice oconnor the primary effect test now has three essential elements 1 whether the aid results in governme ntal indoctrination 2 whether the aid program defines its recipients by reference to religion and 3 whether the aid creates an excessive entanglement between government and religion124 thus the court now appears to construe the establishment clause to allow some forms of direct aid to religious entities that formerly were deemed constitutionally excluded because of their pervasively religious character under the reformulated lemon test direct public aid must still serve secular purpose and not create an excessive entanglement but the most critical elements appear to be that the aid is distributed in religiously neutral manner ie that it does not define its recipients on the basis of religion and provide an incentive for beneficiaries to undertake religious indoctrination and that it does not result in re ligious indoctrination which is attributable to the government b indirect aid indirect aid in the form of tax benefits or vouchers however was less constrained prior to the courts recent revisions of its establishment clause jurisprudence and the courts most recent decision in zelman v simmonsharris125 appears to loosen the constitutional bounds ev more like its standards for direct aid the court requires that indirect aid programs serve secular purpose and be distributed to their initial beneficiaries on religiously neutral basis ie that the beneficiaries not be chosen or given preference on the ba sis of religious criterion but the critical element seems to be whether the initial beneficiaries have true private choice in deciding whether to obt ain subsidized services from secular or religious providers in its earlier decisions the court held indirect aid programs unconstitutional if they had been designed in such manner that the universe of choice available to the beneficiaries was almost entirely religious126 but if the initial beneficiaries had genuinely independent choice among secula r and religious providers the court held the programs constitutional nd ruled that even pervasiv ely sectarian entities were not precluded from participating127 indeed the court made clear that indirect aid

including their religious ones128 the courts recent decision in zelman v simmonsharris supra further loosened the constitutional constraints on indi rect aid that cas involved program of educational vouchers that lowincome parents could us at private schools in the city of cleveland most of those schools we re religious in nature but the court held that in evaluating whether the parents d true private choice in using the aid all of the educational options open to the pare nts needed to be considered and not just the private school options thus enrollment in public schools magnet schools and community schools as well as the possibility of receiving special tutoring assistance all needed to be considered as options ong with the private religious and secular school possibilities in other words the court held that the universe of choice available to the voucher recipients was not defined solely by the private providers where the vouchers could be used but included number of public school and non voucher educational options as well c constitutionality of charitable choice some aspects of the charitable choice proposals that have b een enacted as well as title ii of hr 7 in the 107th congress likely satisfy the foregoing requirements that seems particularly to be the case with respect to social rvices aid that is provided in the form of vouchers the courts interpretations of the establishment clause make clear that such aid can ultimately flow even to pervasively sectarian institutions so long as the initial recipients have true private choice among service providers that means both that such aid can go to religious entities that discriminate on religious grounds in their employment practices129 and that such entities need not be barred from engaging in religious

in finding several religiously affiliated colleges not to be so permeated by religion as to be ineligible for federal construction grants for academic buildings the court placed primary emphasis on the fact that the schools were characterized by an atmosphere of academic freedom rather than religious indoctrinationthus there does not appear to be constitutional problem in the provisions of the charitable choice statutes as well as hr 7 that allow such employment discrimination and that per mit religious institutions receiving social services aid indirectly to engage in religious wors hip instruction or proselytizing in the subsidized program nonetheless there may s till be constitutional questi on raised about charitable choice with respect to indirect aid the critical issue for indirect aid continues to be whether there is genuinely independent decisionmaker between the government and the entity that ultimately receives the assistance or whether the government has dictated that the aid ultimately goes to religious entity all of the charitable choice measures require that those who object to particular re ligious provider be given an alternative that is either secular or as in hr 7 not religiously objectionable but they do not require that voucher recipien t have choice of secular and religious providers initially whether this is sufficient to meet the courts standards does not seem certain whether direct aid to religious entities that discriminate on religious grounds in their employment practices as allowed by all of the charitable choice statutes as well as the housepassed version of hr 7 in the 107th congress can pass constitutional muster seems more complex but still likely prior to mitchell the courts decisions had often used such employment discrimination as an indicator that an entity was pervasively sectarian and he nce ineligible for direct assistance130 but it had never relied on that factor alone other factors always entered into the constitutional equation131 those rulings consequently seem to suggest that religious discrimination in employment by itself might not have been enough to render direct aid program unconstitutional mitchell seems to strengthen that possibility at least for certain kinds of direct aid in that case as noted the court upheld as constitutional direct aid prog ram providing educa tional supplies andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31043crs43 132 mitchell v helms supra at 843 quoting rosenberger v rector and visitors of university of virginia 515 us 819 842 1995 and 841 respectively oconnor j concurring in the judgmentequipment to entities that the court had prev iously found to be pervasively sectarian and had previously held to be constitutionally barred from receiving such aid sectarian elementary and secondary schools in so doing the court shifted the constitutional focus from the nature of the organization receiving the aid to whether the aid is distributed in religiously neutral manner and whether it is used for religious indoctrination as conse quence whether the entity receiving the assistance discriminates on religious grounds in its employment practices seems to have become of little or concern at least for inkind direct assistance the more critical question concerns the role of faith in carrying out social services programs that are directly subs idized the courts decisions make clear that direct public aid cannot be used fo r religious indoctrina tion and all of the charitable choice measures as well as the housepassed version of hr 7 seem to meet this requirement by explicitly prohibiting direct aid from being used for religious worship instruction or prosely tizing hr 7 further buttresses this prohibition by requiring that any religious activity be entirely separate from the publicly funded program and that any pa rticipation in such activity be wholly voluntary but the underlying assumption of charitable choice has been that religious organizations ought to be able to retain their religious character and employ their religious faiths in carrying out the subsidized programs that it is said is what makes their programs distinctive and more effective thus given this assumption and the various possibilities for how particular subsidized programs might be implemented it seems likely that constitutional questions will inevitably arise in the implementation of direct ai d programs under charitable choice notwithstanding its prohibitions on the use of direct aid for religious worship instruction and proselytization in addition it should be noted that mitchell involved an inkind aid program educational supplies nd equipment all of the justices in mitchell expressed doubt that direct grants of money to religious entities could pass constitutional muster even under the courts loosened standards for di rect aid programs and direct grants of money are what seem contemplated in the programs to which charitable choice now applies or would have be applied under the house passed version of hr 7 justice oconnor joined by justice breyer stated in mitchell both that this court has recognized special establishment clause dangers where the government makes direct money payments to sectarian institutions and that direct subsidy would be impermissible under the establishment clause132 justice souter joined by justices

that we have seen special establishment clause dangers when money is given to religious schools or tities directly rather than as in witters and mueller indirectly134 these statements are all dicta and do not indicate with any certainty how the court might rule on case involving particular grant or cooperative agreement but they do indicate constitutional doubt bout direct money grants in addition it deserves notice that one fede ral district court in decision handed down some years prior to mitchell held religious discrimination in employment by religious organization in position specifically funded by government grant to be unconstitutional135 neither agostini nor mitchell addressed the constitutionality of direct monetary subsidies on th other hand it should also be noted that although not in direct conflict federa l appellate court recently upheld state program providing general aid to colleges including religiously affiliated ones as applied to seventh day dventist college notwithstanding that the college gave an express preference in hiring to members of the church136 another recent case that was thought to raise the question of the constitutionality of public funding of an agency that discriminated on religious grounds in its employment practices turned out not to do so in pedreira v kentucky baptist homes for children inc137 the federal district court held that the firing of an employee because of her lesbian lifestyle by an organization whose christian values abhorred homosexuality did not involve religious discrimination because the orga nizations policy did not require employees to accept or practice its religious beliefs but only to conform to behavioral requirement as final observation it so deserves notice that formal neutrality as the controlling constitutional principle did gain the adherence of four justices in mitchell v helms supra chief justice rehnquist and justices scalia kennedy and thomas this perspective contends

insufficient to insure that public funding does not c ontribute to religious end although the state welfaretowork progra m was funded under the federa l welfare reform statute and thus was subject to
