beverages alcohol consumption alcohol consumption is difficult to quantify accurately and there is universally acceptable classification system or standard for safe level of drinking the amount and type of alcohol beverage s americans drink and changes in overall drinking levels are genera lly determined by monitori ng product sales per capita consumption is not possible to determine so it is derived from sales data to represent an estimate of the average amount of cohol consumed per person the result is apparent per capita consump tion which is calculated by dividing alcohol sales or shipment data from every state and the dist rict of columbia by the us population aged 14 years or older to determine the consumption expressed in gallons of pure alcohol the estimates attribute average consumption to all individuals in the population regardless of their actual consum ption thus the da ta have limitations in determining actual consumption total annual per capita alcohol consum ption rose from 1935 when consumption was 12 gallons to 1982 when consumption reached high of about 275 gallons before falling to level of 221 gallons by 1999 for the population 14 years and older2 beer makes the greatest contribution to apparent per capita alcohol consumption in the united states while wine has made the least almost all of the recent decline in alc ohol use can be attri

any positive health effects would behttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30523crs12 outweighed by numerous negative health effect s the final rule also prohibits any advertisements that attribute health benefits to the cons umption of alcohol beverages unless such statement is appropriately qualified in manner that is not likely to result in either consumer confusion or decep tion the agency had sought comments on whether the negative consequences of alc ohol consumption or abuse disqualify as misleading these products entirely from titlement to any hea lthrelated statements and whether healthrelated statements on cohol beverage labe ls and advertising directing consumers to authoritative sources of information are misleading warranting termination of their approval the agency has stated its intention to ensure that labels and adver tisements do not contain statements or claims that would tend to mislead consumers about the sign ificant health consequences of alcohol consumption feasibility in the current health claim regulatory environment it seems possible to interpret ttbs final rule in several ways the regulation seems to suggest that making such claims is possible if the manufacturer or the bureau can craft statements that adequately qualify the health messages to convey the level of substantiation andor provide an authoritative statemen t to support it however the difficulty of establishing such qualifyin g statements has been demonstrated by fdas recent experience with health claims when only limited or preliminary scientific evidence on relationship is available the challenge arises in determining when the scientific evidence availabl is enough to make any meaningful statement and then crafting the claim to be truthful and not misleading to consumers the claim generally needs to be coupled w ith disclaimer to provide context that clarifies the level of evidence supporting the claim the challenge arises in wording the claim and disclaimer so as not to mislead consumers the only way to adequately ascertain success in consumer interpre tation and understandi ng is to conduct consumer research on the claim and disc laimer before they appear on the product the limited space on most packaging further complicates the extent to which adequate information can be provided for consumers use alternatively the ttbs rule might be viewed as suggesting an outright prohibition of any health claim for alcohol this view seems to be supported by the agencys solicitation of comments on whether negative health effects deny any entitlement to health claims in light of the agencys recognition of and request for comments on the negative consequences of cohol use one of the bills in the 106th congress would have prohibited these cla ims on alcohol beverages however an outright prohibition might raise first am endment constitutional questions in 1996 the competitive enterprise institute cei filed suit against ttb to challenge the agencys delay in acting on ceis petition to issue rule allowing truthful statements concerning the health benef its of moderate drinking on alcohol beverage labeling and advertisements the case which had challenged the constitutionality of ttbs ban on information about the cardi ovascular benefits of mode rate alcohol consumption on product labels and advertisements was settled in 1998 by the district court granting the governments motion for summary judgment on ceis challenge to the denial of its rulemaking petition in 1999 fda lost case before the united states court of appeals for the dc circuit in pearson v shalala when the court held unconstitutional under the first amendment f da rules that prohib ited four separate health claims related to dietary supplemen ts the court decision required that fda not only allow the claims but also craft disclaimers to assure that consumers are nothttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30523crs13 misled by them efforts are currently underw ay at fda to broaden the use of health claims with disclaimers to the h ealth claims on c onventional foods if health claims are to be allowed one option might be to consolidate or locate them together with the required warning labels placing the warning statement on the side or back of containers while the health information statement would likely appear on the front seems to have th potential for consumer confusion streamlined statement containing the most pertinent parts of both statements could be developed for example revise d consolidated statement might read government warning 1 according to the surgeon general pregnant women and anyone opera ting car or machinery should not drink 2 learn about the health eff ects of alcohol beverages by consulting your family doctor or sending for the federal governments dietary guidelines for americans center for nutrition policy and promotion usda 1120 20th street nw washington dc 20036 or visit its web site httpwwwusdagovcnpp while consolidating the messages the regulations could continue to require the government warning statement and allo w manufacturers to include the additional statement of health effects on voluntary basis allowing the current practice of directing consumers to the dietary guidelines or physicians for further information on health effects for all alcohol beverage products might be seen as consistent w ith existing policy for food labeling regarding authoritative statements however food labeling regulations prohibit claims on products that contain certain ingredients that are present at harmful levels similar policy does not currently exist for the alc ohol content of beverages furthermore there is the difficulty of establishing harmfu l or unsafe levels of alcohol in addition identifying physicians as the source of additional information assumes that they are knowledgeable about both negative and poten tially positive health effects of alcohol beverages and can advise their patients accordingly agency jurisdiction currently ttb has regulatory jurisdiction over all alcohol beverages and fda regulates other beverages and most foods separate agencies can establish separate standards fo r labeling the products in their jurisdiction so ttb policy does not necessarily have to be consistent with that of fda however different labeling requirements can be potentially confusing to consumers who might assume that labeling and other regulations are set by single agency or consistent across government agencies for example the nutrition information now required on food products is not available to consumers on alcohol beverages which can add significant caloric intake to the daily diet transferri ng alcohol labeling authority to fda as proposed in one of the bills from the 106th congress would promote consistency with the assumption that the agency would require comparable rules for all product claim ssages alternatively options might include leaving responsibility for the labeling and claims standards to the discretion of ttb directing the two agencies to work to gether under the existing mou to achieve comparable claims requirement s or requiring ttb to adopt the comparable rules to fdas nutrient composition and claims rules httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30523crs14 29 guthrie j b derby levy what people know and do not know about nutrition in americas eating habits changes consequences us dept of agriculture ag info bull no750 april 1999 p 243 any proposal to transfer authority to fda raises the issue of the premarket label approval that is currently required for alcohol beverage s this requirement would be departure from current fda po licy in that food labels are not pre approved since fda does not currently have authority to review food labels prior to marketing continued re quirements to do so for alc ohol beverages would need to be addressed since it is tie d to other responsibilities that ttb would be likely to retain another issue would concern the possibility of using structurefunction claims on alcohol beverages if such tran sfer in jurisdiction took place this type of claim which is currently allowed fo r foods and s upplements is truthful not misleading statement on how substance aff ects the structure or function of the body and only requires the manufacturer to notify the agency that the claim will be made substantiation of the claim needs to be in the manufacturers possession but the level of scientific support required for structurefunction claim is considerably less than for health claim finally ftc is re sponsible for food adve rtising and has long sought to make advertising as consiste nt with labeling rule s as allowed under its statutory requirements further research additional research andor consensus may be needed before the issue of health claims for alc ohol beverages can be fu lly resolved since there are questions as to how well the research supports claim on the benefits versus the risks of alcohol beverage cons umption legislation c ould be considered to require either additiona l research andor consensus review to determine the benefits of alcohol consumption this type of work could generate some type of authoritative statement on the relationship the bill language could be written to provide that claims would only be allowed if they we re made in the same manner and under the same conditions as nlea and fdama cla ims including disqualifying levels of substances that present health risk finally the claim wording might also be required to state the limitation of the benefit ie benefit is only observed when total consumption is limited to 12 number of drinks per day depending on sex and age consumer behavior finally the eternal issue arises as to the impact that warning and health benefit bels have in general on cons umer behavior consumers are well aware of the food label and nutr ition facts panel following the education effort carried out by publicprivate part nership after nlea passage and the final rules were published consumer use of th food label especially the changes to improve it since 1990 have been examined by several research

httpwwwcspinetorgboozebatf_labels2001_presshtmacross the front of packages may have mo re influence on consumer purchases and indirectly on food consumption than health claims similarly consumers are aware of the alcohol warning labels but it is unclear whether they have any effect on drinking habits the samhsa survey conducted on the possible addition of health benefit statements to alcohol labels suggests that the additional statements will not influence consumers drinking habits the literature on the impact of the alcohol beverage warning labels suggest that over time knowledge of the label statements increased consumer awareness30 however recent study on alcohol warning labels conducted by the center for science in the public interest found that the statements were difficult to notice due to the size lacked prominence and readibility of the statements which were serious barriers to their overall effectiveness31 nevertheless the long term impact of this knowledge on drinking habits is unclear awareness and an ability to repeat the messages whether the statements are warning labels or health messages does not nece ssarily translate into behavi or change whether concerned with food or alcohol beverage products
