introduction congressional interest in the cost of prescription drugs particularly for the elderly has focused attention on several areas where the federal government has programs and policies associated w ith the development and accessibility of pharmaceuticals in the marketplace one of the most prominent legislative actions in this area is pl 98417 the drug pri ce competition and patent term restoration act of 1984 commonly known as the hatchwaxman act1 this law made several significant changes to the patent laws as they applied to pharmaceutical products in an attempt to balance the need for innova tive new drugs and the availability of less expensive generic products the hatchwa xman act establishe d several practices intended to make it easier for generic drugs to reach the market while per mitting brand name companies to r ecover portion of their inte llectual property rights lost during the pharmaceutical approval process the changes legislated in the hatchwaxman act include methods for extending the term of patent to reflect regulatory delays encountered in obtaining marketing consent from the food and drug administr ation fda statutory exemption from patent infringement for activities associated with regulatory marketing approval establishment of mechanisms to challenge the validity of pharmaceutical patent and reward for disputing the validity forceability or infringement of patented and approved drug the hatchwaxman act also provides the fda with certain authorities to offer periods of marketing exclusivity for pharm aceutical independent of the rights conferred by patents the provisions in the hatchwaxman act are specifically and uniquely applicable to pharmaceutical patents nd different from traditional infringement procedures associated with other patent ed products and processes statutory exemption is created for certain claims of patent infringement based on acts reasonably related to seeking fda approval to market dr ug that has been patented by another firm the company making ge neric product is permitte d to use data paid for and compiled by the original manufacturer to establish the drugs safety and efficacy this may allow bioequivalent dr ug to reach the market as soon as the patent on the original pharmaceutical expires nowhere else in patent law does such robust experimental use exemption exist in the absence of the research developm ent and testing performed by the brand name pharmaceutical companies generic drugs would not exist the generichttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32377crs2 2 us federal trade commission generic drug entry prior to patent expiration july 2002industry relies on the information gene rated and financed by the brand name companies while there is controversy over the actual cost of developing new pharmaceutical the process remains very expensive and fraught with risk in addition almost all other pr oducts may be brought to market without government approval and thus enjoy the full 20 years of patent protecti on allowed by law pharmaceutical firms however must use portion of the patent term to apply for fda market approval thereby forfeiting certain rights afforded other goods additional special provisions for addressing pharmaceutical patents are contained in the 1984 act including specific procedures for challenging the enforceability validity or infringement of pproved drug patents to encourage patent challenges the first generic applicant to file challenge is provided with 180 days of market exclusivity by the f da when the patent is found invalid not infringed or unenforceable or when th patent expires to balance such arrangements that appear to favor generic manufacturers the hatchwaxman act provides that the patent term for pharmaceuticals may be extended for portion of the time lost during the fda pproval process to obtain such an extension patents associated with approved drugs are to be listed in what is commonly called the orange book many policy and industry experts agr ee that the hatchwaxman act has had significant effect on the availability of generic substitutes for brand name drugs generics generally are rapidly available af ter patent expiration and at lower prices concurrently given the increasing investme nt in research and development rd and the gains in research intensity of th pharmaceutical industry it appears that the 1984 act has not deterred the search for and the development of new drugs however over the 20 years since passage of the hatchwaxman act members of congress and others expr essed concerns to whethe r or not implementation of certain portions of the law had led to unintended consequences that affected attainment of the legislations original goals some critics argued that brand name companies andor generic firms exploited provisions of the act to prevent the timely introduction of lower cost drugs and changes were necessary to prevent such actions other experts claimed that pattern of abuse of the law existed and that the few isolated cases of misinterpretation of the act could be addressed through existing procedures to support this pos ition proponents of maintaining the original act pointed to study by the federal trade commission which found that 94 of the 8259 generic applications filed with the fda raised patentrelated issues2 of the generic challenges to brand name pharmaceuticals only 47 patents were the subject of court decisions in the 108th congress members advocating change prevailed as result of the debate over the cost of prescription drug s pl

patent challenges by generic firms several of the changes reflect recent alterations in fda rules regarding patent listings and generic drugs both congressional and executive branch actions are discussed later in this report general provisions of the original law3 patents are issued by the united states patent and trademark office uspto generally for term of 20 years from the date of filing the patent grants its owner the right to exclude others from making using selling offering to sell or importing into the united states the patented invention to be afforded patent rights an invention must be judged to consist of patentable subject matter possess utility and be novel and nonobvious the application must fully disclose and distinctly claim the invention for which protection is sought the grant of patent does not provide the owner with an affirmative right to market the patented invention pharm aceutical pr oducts are also subject to marketing approval by the food and drug administration federal ws typically require that pharmaceutical manufacturers show their produc ts are safe and effective in order to bring these drugs to the marketplace4 uspto issuance of patent and fda marketing consent are distinct even ts that depend upon different criteria the hatchwaxman act modified the 1952 patent act5 by creating statutory exemption from certain claims of patent infringement in the pharmaceutical sector generic manufacturers may commence work on generic version of an approved brand name drug any time during the life of the patent so long as that work furthers compliance with fda regulations although the 1984 act provides safe har bor from patent infringement it also requires wouldbe manufactur ers of generic drugs to engage in specialized certification procedure the core feature of this process is that request for fda marketing approval is treated as an artificial act of patent infringement this action is intended to allow judicial resolu tion of the validity enforceability and infringement of patent rights afforded by the us patent and trademark office under pl 98417 each holder of an appr oved new drug application nda is required to list patents it belie ves would be infringed if generic drug were marketed before the expiration of these patents the fda maintains this list of patents in its publication approved drug products with therapeutic equivalence evaluations commonly known as the orange book httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32377crs4 the orange book provides generic pharmaceutical manufacturers with an accessible list of approved drugs that are potentially eligible for an abbreviated new drug application anda or pap er nda 505b2 application an anda or paper nda permits the generic manuf acturer to rely upon the safety and efficacy data of the original manufacturer when applying to the fda for approval of generic drug generic firm must certify to the fda its intentions with regard to each patent associated with the generic drug it seeks to market four possibilities exist under the 1984 act 1 that patent information on the drug has not been filed 2 that the patent has already expired 3 the date on which the patent will expire or 4 that the patent is invalid or will not be infringed by the manufacture use or sale of the drug for which the anda is submitted these certifications are respectively termed paragraph i ii iii and iv certifications an anda certified under graphs i or ii is approved immediately after meeting all applicable regulatory and scientific re quirements an anda certified under paragraph iii must even af ter meeting pertinent regulatory and scientific requirements wait for approval until the drugs listed patent expires an anda applicant filing paragraph iv certification must notify the proprietor of the patent the patent holder may bring patent infringement suit within 45 days of receiving such notifica tion if the patent owner timely brings patent infringement charge against the anda applicant then the fda must suspend approval of the anda until 1 the date of th courts decision that the listed drugs patent is either invalid or not infringed 2 the date the listed drugs patent expires if the court finds the listed drugs patent infringed or 3 subject to modification by the court the date that is 30 months fr om the date the owner of the listed drugs patent received notice of the filin g of paragraph iv certification once the brand name company indicates an intent to bring patent infringement suit against the generic company as result of the paragraph iv filing the fda is prohibited from approving the drug in question for 30 months or until such time that the patent is found to be i nvalid or not infringed if prior to the expiration of 30 months the court holds that the patent is invalid or would not be infringed then the fda will approve the anda when that decisi on occurs conversely if the court holds the patent is not invalid and would be infringed by the product proposed in the anda prior to the expiration of 30 months then the fda w ill not approve the anda until the patent expires under the original hatchwaxman act the first generic applicant to file paragraph iv certification is awarded 180day market exclusivity period by the fda the 180day market exclusivity period ordinarily begins on the earliest of two dates 1 the day the drug is first commercially marketed or 2 the day court decision holds that the patent which is the subject of the certification is invalid or not infringed the interpretation of court decision includes the decision of us district court successful defense of patent infringement suit is not necessary to obtain this exclusivity periodhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32377crs5 6 for more detailed discussion of these issues see crs report rl31379 the hatch waxman act selected patentrelated issues by wendy h schacht and john r thomasselected patentrelated issues6 the hatchwaxman act requires company submitting new drug application to the food and drug administration for pproval list patent in formation associated with that pharmaceutical in the orange book an fda publica tion this document provides generic manufacturers with an acce ssible list of approved drugs that are potentially eligible for abbreviated new drug applications responsibility for maintaining the integrity of the orange book is an issue the us patent and trademark office issues patents on pha rmaceuticals based upon utility novelty and nonobviousness the fda provides market approval for drugs based on efficacy and safety in some cases certain generic pharmaceutical companies have taken the position that specific listing is inappropriate they maintain that subsidiary patents have been added to the orange book that do not relate to the pa tented drugs active ingredient but still delay generic competiti on however the patent system has long allowed improvement pa tents so long as sufficien t inventive advance exists under the original act the role of th fda in adjudicating orange book listing disagreements is limited if generic pha rmaceutical company di sputes the accuracy of an orange book listing that enterprise must present the grounds for disagreement to the fda in writing the fda will then request that the nda holder confirm the propriety of the listing unless the nda hol der withdraws or amends the listing the fda will not alter the patent in formation in the orange book orange book listing issues typically were resolved once the patentee filed patent infringement suit against the anda pplicant in other words the 1984 act expressly allows the patentee to sue the anda applicant for patent infringement other avenue for resolution of orange book listings was provided in the original 1984 act the law also created statutory exemption from certain claims of patent infringement associated with submitting request to the fda for marketing approval of generic version of patented pharmaceutical several incentives are provided to generic firms to challenge the validity of existing patents through paragraph iv filing including the 180day market exclusiv ity period for the first generic company to make but not necessarily win the challe nge implementation of this provision has led to concerns by some in the community originally fda regulations required that generic firm filing an anda had to be sued for patent infringement and win in court in order to receive pproval for market exclusivity however in response to court decision in mova pharmaceutical corp v shalala fda guidelines were changed to eliminate the necessity for successful defense by generic manufacturer against claims of patent infringement prior to receiving the 180day market exclusivity critics argued that these provisions encourage the filing of sham paragraph iv certifications as generic companies attempt to obtain the firsttofile position and then work out settlement with the bra nd name firm that lays introduction of ahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32377crs6 generic version of the drug others ma intained that settleme nts do not necessarily interfere with the timely marketing of generic drugs such settlements may be less expensive than court cases which typically ta ke longer than 30 months to resolve and generate significant financial costs once paragraph iv filing has been made and the patent owner declares the intention to sue for patent infringement the fda is prohibited from considering the generic product for 30 months or until the pa tent is found invalid or not infringed an automatic 30month injunction differs from typical infringement cases not involving pharmaceuticals commonly th company suing for infringement places bond to cover their competitors market losses should the pate nt be found invalid or not infringed if the patent owner preva ils the infringer is required to pay for lost income and may be required to pay treble damages if the infringement was willful the patent owner may also have the offending product taken off the market however given the circumstances surr ounding pharmaceuticals it may be unlikely that drug once available for sale and in individual medicine cabinets would be removed in addition given the value of certain pharmaceuticals on the market it may be impossible for the brand name firm to recoup monetary loses from generic firms with significantly fewer capital resources some critics also have raised concer ns as to commencement of the 180day market exclusivity period the original hatchwaxman act triggered the generic exclusivity in one of two ways either when the generic manufacturer commences commercial marketing of its drug or when court decision finds the nda holders patent invalid or not infringed with regard to the latter provision the fda interpreted the law as requiring decision of the united states court of appeals for the federal circuit to commence the exclusivity period according to the fda anda applicants that prevailed at the dist rict court level mig ht wish to delay marketing their generic drug until the patent infringement litigation was more conclusively resolved on appeal the f da thus hoped to eliminate what it perceived to be difficult choice for generic applicants either launch generic drug while the litigation was still pending on appeal thereby risking infringement liability if the district courts opinion was overturned by the court of appeals or wait until the appeal was decided which almost certainly meant that the 180day exclusivity period would have elapsed however the united states district court for the district court of columbia held that the fdas interpretation of the phrase decision of the court was erroneous according to judge roberts the correct interpretation of that phrase included decisions of us district court judge roberts further reasoned that nothing prevented the firs t anda applicant fro m utilizing the 180day period if it concluded that the risk of reversal by th court of appeals was low that the fda interpretation prolonged the period at which dr ug prices remained at inflated levels and that exclusivity periods were valuable commodities that could be traded to among other parties the nda holder httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32377crs7 federal trade commission report according to the food and drug ad ministration between 1984 when the hatchwaxman act passed and the nd of 2000 8019 andas were filed in 7536 of these abbreviated new drug applications or 94 of the total patentrelated issues were raised the findings of the federal trade commission which studied andas filed between january 1 1992 and december 31 2000 containing paragraph iv certification cha llenging patents associated with the brand name drug were published in july 2002 report titled generic drug entry prior to patent expiration during this time period 104 ndas were the subject of paragraph iv certifications the ftc found that the patent owner ed the first generic applicant in 75 instances of the patent challenges broug ht to court and decided as of june 1 2002 the patent was found to be invalid in 11 cases and the patents were found not to be infringed in 14 cases twenty suits resulted in settlement between the brand name company and the generic firm the analysis by the ftc indicated that the first 30 month stay expired before district court decision was reached in 22 of the 75 cases that were litigated or are currently in the process of litigation between the brand name firm and the first generic applicant in approximately 85 of the 75 cases wh ere the patent owner sued the first anda applicant the brand name company so sued the second generic applicant as of the date of the report 40 drug produc ts were the subject of court cases in 29 of these suits the generic applicant won wh ile in 11 others the decision favored the brand name firm during the time period studied in 8 instances additional patents were listed in the orange book after an initial anda filing six of these cases occurred since 1998 approval by the fda was delayed an additional 4 to 40 months four cases have been resolved in court to date and the pate nts were found to be either invalid or not infringed the ftc report indicates that fda pproval of anda applications without paragraph iv certification took an aver age 25 months 15 days the time between complaint and district court decisi on on patent infringement challenge took an average 25 months 13 days the time between complaint and an appellate court decision was an average 37 months 20 days most generic companies have waited for at least district court decision prior to entering the market three quarters of the patent cases resolved to date have favored the generic firm since 1998 31 generic products have r eceived an 180day market exclusivity provided by the fda between 1992 nd 1998 180day market exclusivity was granted the ftc found that 14 of the 20 settlements reached between the brand name companies and generic firms had the potential to park the first generic applicants use of market exclusivity and thereby delay entry of additional generic versions of the product httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32377crs8 utilizing the results of this study the ftc made the following recommendations with accompanying rationale for changes to existing law allow only one automatic 30mont h stay per drug product per anda currently according to the study it appears that one stay associated with patents filed prior to the initial anda does not delay generic entry beyond the time needed for fda approval of the filing however there appear to be problems associated with later listed patents the ftc identifie d questions as to whether or not laterlisted patents actually meet the listing requirements to be included in the orange book noting that the only way to challenge these listings is through patent infringement suit enact legislation to require bra nd name companies and firsttofile generic firms to provide the ftc with copies of certain agreements between the parties antitrust sc rutiny should be permitted to insure that such agreements do not delay the first generics use of the 180 day market exclusivity rights the ftc study also recommended that the term commercial marketing be clarified to include instances where the first generic firm markets the brand name drug the meaning of court decision be codified to include any court decision on the same patent being litigated by the first generic filer and any dismissal of declaratory judgment action for lack of case or cont roversy should be considered court decision necessary to trigge r the 180day market exclusivity period fda rule change on june 12 2003 the food and drug administration an nounced new rules associated with the 30month stay and the requirements for listing patents in the orange book originally published as proposal in the october 24 2002 federal register the new regulations allow only one 30month stay in the approval date of each anda or 505b2 application the agency will now prohibit the orange book listing of patents for drug packaging drug metabolites and intermediate forms of drug process patents are not to be listed although pr oductbyprocess patent information is required when the product cl aimed is novel ne w drug application holders are obligated to provide additi onal patentrela ted information upon listing in the orange book and sign as to the ver acity of the inform ation under threat of criminal charges for false statements these changes are similar to those suggested by the federal trade commission and becam effective on august 18 2003 at that time some experts argued that the fda did not have the authority to alter application of the hatchwaxman act through the regula tory process without related legislation they predicted that the fda actions would be challenged in court however the enactment of pl 108173 ma have provided the legisl ative basis necessary for some or all of the fda actionshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32377crs9 pl 108173 the medicare prescription drug and modernization act of 2003 title xi of pl 108173 the medicare prescription drug and modernization act of 2003 as signed into law by the president on december 8 2003 makes several changes to the original hatchwaxman act which are designed to decrease the time needed to bring generic pharmaceuticals to the marketplace the new provisions are designed to close some of the loopholes critics argue the br and name companies are using to delay the introduction of gene ric products the legislation permits only one automatic 30month stay on fda approva l of drugs for whic h patents are listed in the orange book at the time of graph iv anda or 505b2 filing the applicant may not amend the paragraph iv certification to include drug different from that approved by the fda but may amend the application if seeking marketing consent for different strength of the sa drug modifications to the default 30 month stay are allowed based on district court judgments the applicant for an abbreviated new dr ug approval containing paragraph iv certification must provide the brand name company and any patent owners with notice of such action within 20 days of f iling with the fda upon receipt of this notice the brand name manufact urer has 45 days within which to file an infringement suit and thereby be eligible for the automatic 30month stay in situation where patent holder doe s not file an infringement action within 45 days of notification of paragra ph iv anda the anda applicant may request that district court issue declaratory judgment regarding the validity of the patent in order to request declaratory judgment the generic manufacturer must have made available to the brand name company nd the patent owners the confidential information contained in the anda application if sued the generic firm may file c ounter claim to require the patent holder make changes in the orange book listings the generic firm may request that certain patents be delisted because they do not claim the drug to which they are attached monetary damages are to be awarded the food and drug administration ma approve the anda or 505b2 filing containing paragraph iv cer tification on the date of an appeals court decision the date of settlement order or consent decree or when district court decision is not appealed the 180day market exclusivity is to be gin with the first commercial marketing of the generic drug rather than being tr iggered by court decision as under the original legislation this exclusivity can be forfeited in certain situations including failure to market under specific time constr aints withdrawal of the application amendment of the certification failure to obtain approval from the fda expiration of all patents or the dete rmination by the federal trade commission or the assistant attorney general that an agreement between the brand name and generic firms violates antitrust laws subsequent app licants would not be permitted the 180day exclusivity httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32377crs10 multiple generic firms may qualify for the 180day market exclusivity if several anda applicants file substantially comp lete application on the same day agreements tendered between brand name companies and generic firms concerning the production sale or ma rketing of pharmaceutical or 180day market exclusivity must be filed with the federal trade commission and the department of justice within 10 days of the agreement issues and observations several issues may remain of interest to congress as the hatchwaxmanrelated provisions of pl 108173 are implemente d individuals and groups involved with the availability of generic drugs may raise additional concerns as consequence of changes in law others may arise from the original legislation still additional issues may result from court cases that interpret the law these are discussed below patents not listed in the orange book under the original hatchwaxman act brand name firms were encouraged to list all patents associated with an approved pharmaceutical in the orange book because only those patents listed were subject to an automatic 30month stay the listings offer generic firms easy access to information required for f iling an abbreviated new drug application abse nt the compilation of relevant patents associated with the innovator drug provide d by the brand name company generic manufacturers would be forced to independently generate the data at considerable expense in terms of time and money to balance the advantages afforded generic firms through orange book patent listin gs innovator companies benefit from defined timed moratorium on fda market approval of the pharmaceutical multiple 30month stays were permitted by the original act as patents issued later were subsequently added to the orange book the changes to the hatchwaxman act in pl 108173 limit brand name companies to only one 30month stay on t hose patents listed in the orange book at the time of paragraph iv filing thus the incentive to list patents may be diminished if there is perceived benefit for doing so whether or not patents are included in the orange book they continue to confer certain rights to the owner of the intellectual property generic firms ma be subject to infringement suits on all patents it is the responsibility of the ge neric firm to ensure that company products do not infringe on the intellectual property of others and may be subject to treble damages if found in willf ul violation of the patent holders rights it should also be noted that the new f da regulations limit th type of patents that may be listed in the orange book process patents are not permitted however if generic firms infringe upon process patent s in making generic product they may still be liable for damageshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32377crs11 7 21 usc 355j5ci iii 8 us constitution article iii 2declaratory judgments title xi of pl 108173 includes ne w provision allowing an anda applicant who files paragraph iv certification alleging noninfringement to bring declaratory judgment against the brandna drug company after the expiration of 45day period assuming that the brandna company has not already brought suit against the generic firm for patent infringement d eclaratory judgment action is like an ordinary patent lawsuit with the pa rties reversed in declaratory judgment suit the generic firm serves as the plaintiff requesting that the court rule that the brandname companys patents are invalid or unenforceable or that the generic product does not infringe those patents under the new provisions of the hatc hwaxman act the right of the anda applicant to file declaratory judgment action for noninfringement is contingent upon the anda applicant providing the patent owner with an offer of conditional access to its anda the anda applicant is not obliged to offer this conditional access if such an offer is not made however then the anda applicant may not bring an action seeking declarat ory judgment of noninfringement under pl 108173 the offer of confidential access may contain such restrictions as to persons entitled to acce ss and on the use and disposition of any information accessed as would apply had protective order been entered 7 some observers have expr essed concerns that generic drug companies will unilaterally impose such restrictions upon access to the contents of the anda that this provision will become unworkable if an anda applicant limits which portions of the anda may be viewed and also th persons entitled to access brandname firm may have little basis on which to make confident assessment of patent infringement case the fda may be able to issue guidelines that would suggest broad disclosures under this provisions but these guidelines would not bind anda applicants pl 108173 also provides that the fede ral courts shall possess declaratory judgment jurisdiction only to the extent consistent with the constitution that statute references the constitutional requirement that the federal courts hear cases only when there is an actual case or c ontroversy between the litigating parties8 this requirement prevents the federal c ourts from issuing advisory opinions about hypothetical disputes instead allowing only adversarial litigants i nvolved in live dispute to resort to the federal judiciary applying this requirement to patent cases the courts have he ld that in order to serve as declaratory judgment plaintiff generic firm must have reasonable fear of being sued by the patent holder ordinarily the patent holder must actually threaten the generic firm with an infringement suit through cease and desist letter or other mechanism to satisfy this requi rement however other factors such as the enforcement of patent against othe r defendants histor of past disputeshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32377crs12 9 see genprobe inc v vysis inc 359 f3d 1376 fed cir 2004 10 see declaratory judgment is looming issue for generics

patent extension by cannibalization southern economic journal july 1999between the parties and patentee statements that fall short of formal charge of patent infringement may in combination lead to the conclusion that an actual case or controversy exists9 the requirement of an actual case or controversy potentially leads to some strategic behavior on the part of brandna firms some observers believe that brandname firms as matter of market place strategy may choose neither to sue anda applicants nor to create such circum stances that they are subject to declaratory judgment action10 under these circumstances the brandname firm may be able to delay filing patent infringement suit against generic firm until such time as the generic firm is on the verge of rel easing its product onto the market arguably this tactic would not promote the prompt resolution of patent disputes one of the goals of the hatchwaxman act and may so discourage firms from taking the final steps needed to market generic drugs brand name generics brand name companies can authorize anot her firm to make generic version of their product often one that is about to loose patent protection11 this authorized version may be brought to the market prio r to or on the same day as generic drug approved by the fda and manufactured by company that has won paragraph iv challenge such arrangements allow the i nnovator firm to recove r some of the sales income on drug that will become widely available in generic form there are potential benefits and costs to the consumer of these actions on the one hand authorized generics may dissu ade other firms from filing paragraph iv challenges to brand name patents if the often significant financial investments can not be recouped through the 180day market excl usivity period thus potentially invalid patents may delay the intr oduction of generic versi on of certain pharmaceuticals conversely even brand name authorized generics are less expensive than the innovator drug and often can be made available prior to pa tent expiration in addition through the introduction of an authorized generic two lower cost products can be made available to the consumer while re search shows these actions may adversely affect the generic company the bra nd name firm and the public benefit12 the federal trade commission appears to see the entry of authorized generics as an

as proconsumer13 antitrust implications of patent settlements brandname and generic firms engaged in litigation within the hatchwaxman statutory framework have sometimes concluded their litigation through settlement rather than await formal decision from court few of these settlements have called for the brandname company to pay the generic firm in exchange for the generic firms agreement not to market the patented pharmaceutical these arrangements have been termed reverse payment agreements because they are contrary to the usual situation in patent infringement settlements where the plaintiff patentee receives money from the accused patent infringer14 reverse payment settlements potentially had significant market consequences prior to the enactment of pl 108173 u nder the old law such an arrangement could sometimes prevent all other generic firms from entering the market the reason is that the first generic challenger was entitled to 180day exclusivity against other generic firms that could not be re voked or forfeited if the first generic challenger chose not to market at all th generic versions of drug could be approved by the fda until such time as the patent expired15 pl 108173 includes two notable provisi ons that make reverse payment arrangement less likely to occur in the future first settlement agreements between brandname and generic firms must in many cases be filed with the federal trade commission and the department of justice this provision allows the ftc and doj to review the settlements for anticom petitive effects second p l 108173 establishes various events that cause the fi rst generic challenger to forfeit its 180day exclusivity other generic firms will therefore be less easily shut out of the market in the future in the event that the first generic challenger opts not to market particular drug notably certain reverse payment settlements reached under the old law have been subject to scrutiny under the antitrust ws enacted with the goal of preserving competitive open market the antitrust laws make illegal variety of practices that restrain trade and reduce consumer choices both the ftc and private plaintiffs have succeeded in persuading the federal cour ts that particular reverse payment settlements constitu antitrust violations differe nt federal courts have reached conflicting rulings however on whether
