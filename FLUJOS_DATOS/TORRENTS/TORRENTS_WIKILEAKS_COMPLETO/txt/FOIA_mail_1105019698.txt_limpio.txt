from phil jones pjonesueaacuk to parker david met office davidparkermetofficegovuk neil plummer nplummerbomgovau subject re fwd monthly climatbulletins date thu jan 6 085458 2005 cc thomas c peterson thomascpetersonnoaagov neil just to reiterate davids points im hoping that ipcc will stick with 196190 the issue of confusing usersmedia with new anomalies from different base period is the key one in my mind arguments about the 1990s being better observed than the 1960s dont hold too much water with there is some discussion of going to 19812000 to help the modelling chapters if we do this it will be bit of bodge as it will be hard to do things properly for the surface temp and precip as wed lose loads of stations with long records that would then have incomplete normals if we do we will likely achieve it by rezeroing series and maps in an ad hoc way there wont be any move by ipcc to go for 19712000 as it wont help with satellite series or the models 19812000 helps with msu series and the much better reanalyses and also globallycomplete sst 20 years 19812000 isnt 30 years but the rationale for 30 years isnt that compelling the original argument was for 35 years around 1900 because bruckner found 35 cycles in some west russian lakes hence periods like 18811915 this went to 30 as it easier to compute personally i dont want to change the base period till after i retire cheers phil at 0922 05012005 parker david met office wrote neil there is preference in the atmospheric observations chapter of ipcc ar4 to stay with the 19611990 normals this is partly because change of normals confuses users eg anomalies will seem less positive than before if we change to newer normals so the impression of global warming will be muted also we may wish to wait till there are 30 years of satellite data ie until we can compute 19812010 normals which will then be globally complete for some parameters like sea surface temperature regards david on tue 20050104 at 2158 neil plummer wrote hi hama tom and david blair re the issue of using the 19712000 normals in climat rather than 19611990 normals happy new year i have copied the relevant text from ccl xiii below which provides reasons for staying with the 196190 standard my initial recommendation is the same as toms ie stay with the standard for now i think there are two main factors to consider here capability and demand while there are clearly advantages with widespread use of normals derived using the later period there must be the capacity to do so perhaps in the leadup to cclxiv opag 2 can find out the extent of the support for the change among users of climat and opag 1 can find out more about capabilities note however that this is not strictly on issue for opag 1 according to the tors for the ict and any of the ets happy to assist though we may use the climate working groups in the regional associations to assist with surveying members capabilities and could do the same regarding the demand question though i think toms cclclivar et is best placed to give that guidance david blair interested in your thoughts on this matter cheers neil from ccl xiii 612 the commission noted with satisfaction that the 19611990 standard normals were now complete and expressed its appreciation to ncdc for assembling the data as well as to those members who had contributed data it further noted that the 19611990 standard normals would remain in use for global purposes until the next standard normals for the period 19912020 were completed 613 the commission noted that in addition to the 1961 to 1990 wmo standard normals many countries had produced climatic normals using the 1971 to 2000 period the commission also noted the discussion held among members on whether the standard 30year normals should be accompanied by normals calculated over more current period or shorter period to reflect recent climate variability the commission noted the usefulness of periods other than the contiguous 30year period for certain analyses below the global scale however it decided to maintain the climatological standard normals process as it provided common reference period for climate research and monitoring

teunissen neil plummer subject re fwd monthly climatbulletins thanks for responding hama i agree with you on both points i wonder how many countries produced 712000 normals ill cc neil plummer on this as the et on observing requirements and standards for climate is under his leadership regards tom h kontongomde wrote dear tom and hans happy new year i apologize for responding so late i was on annual leave since 13 december the question of which normal between 19611990 and 19712000 is now frequently asked by many wmo members depending on the practical use of the normal one of the two normal can be preffered to the other however the policy for climat messages is to use the 19611990 normals and until ccl change the standard i would also recommend that our colleagues of turkey continue to use these 6190 normals this allows spatial comparisons for the entire globe because not all countries have their 19712000 averages ready for use however i think it is time that the ccl expert team on observing requirements and standards for climate clarifies the problem in explaining why the 6190 normals should continue to be the standard or why it is time to change i will respond to our colleagues of turkey best regards hama kontongomde hans teunissen 132005 121600 pm thanks for those suggestions tom im not sure if your two questions below were meant to be different is word change missing from the first but i think i get the gist from the answers re the climat code official standards i dont think dick or gcos is really the right person to go to that would be hama or it seems osy sasha karpov since they arranged the publication of td1188 is that right hama and are you ok to use toms suggestion in the reply to turkey hans thomas c peterson thomascpetersonnoaagov 171204 195842 dear hans hama as you may remember i was just in turkey in october interacting with many people in their climate group they have pretty good team the question as i understand it is not the reliability of their data that are transmitted eg for december 2004 but for the section of the climat code which shows anomalies to base period or what quintile the precipitation falls in turkey indicates that they think their 19712000 normals are more reliable than their 19611990 normals i would agree with them that they are probably correct in that i believe the same could be said about the us normals however as i recall not all countries redo their normals every 10 years many only redo them every 30 years which i believe is the wmo standard so for this wmo coded transmission climat i expect that they specify the 19611990 normals 1 would it make difference in climate monitoring yes for those users who make use of the anomaly values it could make big difference more important probably than reliability is that the climate changes over decade and taking 19611970 out and substituting in 19912000 to the base period calculation may make big difference in some cases 2 would it make difference in climate monitoring probably not as most climate monitoring groups dont use the reported anomalies each month but rather take the observations and use them with normals they already have in different file in sum if my memory was correct on the coding i would recommend that they continue to use the official standard even if they have something better out there because it has the potential for making significant difference and it is important that all groups follow the official standard does this sound reasonable im not an expert in the climat code so you might want to check with dick about official standards for climat before you answer regards tom hans teunissen wrote hama this one looks like its definitely concern for cclwcd from thegcos side it seems just an issue of whats to be in the gsn archive 1971 to 2000 reliable or 1961 to 1990 possibly unreliable my votewould be for the former but i dont know what ccl policy would be tomdo you agree re the gsn archive i see 6 stations for turkey are inthere now some with very long records not sure what implication ofthis proposal really would be for thoseare you or would you preferto try to salvage some of the older data there at ncdc could you letus know i then suggest that hama respond for the wmoccl system doesthat sound ok ill be away from tomorrow until 3 january best wishes for the holidays and the new year

methanks we are group of people who has been working in the division of climate sectionwhich is the sub departmentof agricultural meteorology in turkish state meteorological service this department is responsible for collecting all climatedata from the observing stations recording and transmitting them via the telecommunication system to the data collectingcentre and archiving them properly this division is also responsible for transmitting monthly climat bulletins to the wmos relevant service on behalf of turkey we consider the climate data which iclude the period of between 1971 and 2000 years are more trustworty because of the development in technological telecommuniational and training fields our experiences are supporting this situation we want to ask you does it any effect on global monitoring system if we use the period of years 19712000 instead of 19611990in transmitting monthly climat reportswe would be very pleasure if you could get us more informationyours sincerely
