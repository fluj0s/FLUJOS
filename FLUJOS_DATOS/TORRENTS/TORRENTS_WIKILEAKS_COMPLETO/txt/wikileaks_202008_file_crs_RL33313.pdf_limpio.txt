2008 matthew glassman analyst on the congress government and finance divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33313congressional membership and appointment authority to advisory commissions boards and groups summary over the past several decades congress by statute has established wide array of commissions boards and advisory bodies to provide it with assistance in meeting various legislative investig ative and administrative re sponsibilities some of these entities are temporary and created to serve specific functions such as studying discreet policy area or performing onetime tasks others are permanent serving an ongoing purpose such as overseeing an institution or performing regular administrative function the majority of these congressional bodi provide that members of congress particularly the leadership be intimately involved in the appointment process either through direct service on commissi on or by appointing or recommending candidates for membership the choice of particular mechanism for membership appointment may have implications for the ability of these entities to fulfill their congressional mandates examination of the statutory language cr eating these bodies reveals several common approaches to membership selection each alternative schema has its advantages commission or board composed entirely of members permits high degree of congressional control over the entitys operations bodies composed mainly of qualified private citizens or executive br anch appointees may provide broader expertise than memberonly bodies asse mblages of mixed membership provide some of the advantages of both member and citizenonly ppointment schemes this report contains compilation of commissions and boards that demonstrates the range of alternative membership ppointment structures it includes any statutorily created advisory entity boards advisory panels etc whose membership scheme mandates the participation of members of congress either as potential members or as participants in the pro cess of appointing the membership for each entity information on the purpose duratio n appointment structure and term of appointment is provided finally

commissions boards and groups introduction over much of its history congress has created wide array of advisory bodies separate from each chambers committees and fficers in order to better exercise its legislative oversight and investigative mandates and to attend to both temporary and ongoing administrative ta sks and responsibilities during the past two decades congress has established or renewed the existence of hundreds of statutory entities to study advise on coordinate or monitor matters of par ticular interest to congress these entities vary in several dimensions including their official designation purpose lifespan membership and mechan ism by which members are appointed many of these bodies are expressly id entified as commissions but others are designated as boards advisory committees or by other terms in this report they are referred to generically as congressional dvisory bodies thes groups are generally created to address single purpose perhap s to study discrete policy issue or to attend to onetime or recurring administra tive functions often they have well defined mandate whic h typically includes the submission of final report to congress detailing findings and recommendations althoug h some have specific lifespan many have been created to provide ongoing support and advice for instance the boards of visitors for the united states military service academies or the commission to recommend individuals to the president for appointment to the office of architect of the capitol the statutory provisions creating s ubstantial proportion of congressional advisory bodies provide for membership that either entirely or in part 1 includes 2 is chosen by or 3 is recommende d by members of congress this report addresses only those statutory groups whose membership involves congressional participation in one or more of these forms it provides selected background information on these groups and specific inform ation relating to th role of members of congress in the appointment process this report is intended to inform members of congress of their specific appointment responsibilities and to make them aware of their opportunities to serve as members of congressiona l advisory bodies additionally observations regarding the rationale and effects for the many va riations in the appoi ntment schemes for existing bodies are intended to provide some alternatives to legi slators to facilitate the drafting of membership language in future statuteshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33313crs2 1 see for example the membership appoint ment scheme for the advisory commission on drug free communities 21 usc 1543 tablished by pl 10520 111 stat 232 all appointments are made by the president with congressional involvement 2 for example provisions for the establishment of 12 separate advisory bodies were included in the text of the fy1999 omnibus cons olidated and emergency supplemental appropriations act p l 105277 112 stat 2681 3 in at least one instance commission mandated by law never formally organized membership selection for the commission on state and private fo rests 16 usc 1601 note pl 101624 104 stat 3548 was not completed apparently due to presidential reservations about the appropriateness of the appointment scheme see separation of powers issues belowscope following an examination of the appoin tment schemes to va rious congressional advisory bodies this compilation attempts to identify all c ongressional advisory bodies currently in existence it include s any statutorily created advisory entity boards advisory panels etc whose memb ership scheme mandates the participation of members of congress either as potential members or as participants in the process of appointing the membersh ip entities created by c ongress that have neither congressional membership nor congressional involvement in the appointment process have been omitted1 boards and commissions to wh ich congress has advise and consent authority are also omitted unless members of congress otherwise participate in the appointment process also excluded are ad hoc commissions and advisory groups empaneled by individual committees of congress under thei r general authority to procure the temporary services of consultants to make studies and advise the committee with respect to any matter within its jurisdic tion pursuant to 2 usc 72a or under chamber rules or resolutions the membership of these entities such as the advisory commission to study the consumer price inde x might be selected by the chairman and ranking minority member of the committee concerned and these bodies are generally empaneled for s hort durations this report does not include caucuses observer groups or working groups creat ed by means other than statute tracking the provisions of law that cr eate congressional advisory bodies is an inherently inexact exercise although many such bodies are created in easily identifiable freestanding statut others are contained w ithin the statutory language of lengthy omnibus legislation2 it is also sometimes difficult to determine when such bodies have ceased to operate3 as termination dates are not always included in the organic statute or may be tied to ambiguous conditions membership composition when making appointments to congre ssional advisory bodies members of congress may be empowered to act independe ntly or in concer t with congressional leaders structurally variations in the autonomy of appointment officials fall within several common patternshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33313crs3 4 see for example the congressional award bo ard the majority and minority of the house and the senate each are given the authority to appoint 12 members 2 usc 803 pl 96 114 93 stat 852 5 under the appointment scheme for th abraham lincoln bi centennial commissi on for example the majority party enjoys threeto two advantage in making appointments to the commission pl 106173 114 stat 15 6 see for example the details of the appointment scheme for the national prison rape reduction commission in table 1 7 for example the law creating the benjamin franklin tercentenary commission pl 107202 116 stat 739 provided that eight of the 15 members of the commission be appointed by congressional leaders and that at least two senators and two representatives be among those selecteddirect designation the statutory scheme may mandate that membership of congressional advisory body be made up in whole or in part by specifically designated members of congress typically members of the leadership or of specified committees in most such cases leadership servi ce is limited to bodies concerned with the internal administrative functions of the house and senate for example membership of the commission to recommend individuals to the president for appointment to the office of architect of the capitol includes the speaker of the house the president pro tempore of the senate the ma jority and minority leaders of the house and the senate and the chairmen nd the ranking minority members of the committee on house administration and the senate comm ittee on rules and administration statutes requiring th appointment of specific members of congressional or committee leadership to commissions are not as common as those that simply grant appointment authority to these leaders appointment selected leaders often with balance between the parties may appoint congressional advisory body members who may or may not be members of congress for appointments made by congressional l eaders the statutory scheme generally mandates that appointments be made by leaders of both parties the members of some congressional advisory bodies are lected by majority and minority party leaders in equal numbers4 in other instances the majority party appoints greater number5 in few cases the majorityminority ratio of appointments to commission varies depending upon whether the president is of the same party as the majority in the house or the senate6 one common component of statutory ppointment schemes for congressional advisory bodies is the requirement that members of congress serve on these panels certain bodies such as the british amer ican parliamentary group are composed entirely of members of congress in other instances statute may require that certain specified number of senators or representatives be selected7 recommendation selected leaders again often with balance between the parties may be authorized to recommend members who may or may not be membershttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33313crs4 8 for example pl 10958 119 stat 594 prescribes that nominees for the united states commission on north american ergy freedom must be knowledgeable on energy issues including oil and gas exploration and producti on crude oil refining oil and gas pipelines electricity production and transmission coal unconventional hydrocarbon resources fuel cells motor vehicle power systems nuclear energy renewable energy biofuels energy efficiency and energy conservation 9 see for example the membership appointment scheme for the commission on broadcasting to the peoples republic of china which consists of 11 members three appointed by the president and two each ppointed by the speaker of the house the majority leader of the senate the minority ader of the house and the minority leader of the senate pl 102138 105 stat 705 10 pl 107173 116 stat 543 of congress for appointment to c ongressional advisory body they may do so either in parallel or jointly and the recommendations may be made either to other congressional leaders such as the speaker of the house and president pro tempore of the senate or to the president qualification provisos some statutory provisos may have the effect of limiting the degree of autonomy memb er has in appointing or making recommendations of individuals for cong ressional advisory body membership for example the appointing offici may be required by law to select members who are specifically qualified by virtue of their education knowledge training experience expertise distinguished service or recognized eminence in particular field or fields8 in other instances appointments are expressly limited to individuals occupying specific federal state or local government positions representing particular occupation or serving as head of particular public or private sector institution or organization separation of powers in many instances the authority to ppoint members to th entities covered in this report is shared by the executive and legislative branches9 when the appointment authority set out in statut creating congressional advisory body is shared by the president and members of congress questions about implementation of the appointment scheme have sometimes prompted th president to comment on separationofpowers issues raised under the appointments clause of the constitution some statutes instruct the pr esident to appoint congressional advisory body members from list provided by cong ressional leadership for example the appointment scheme for the commission on in teroperable data sh aring provides for nine members one member appointed by the president to serve as chairman and eight members appointed by the president from list of nominees jointly provided by the speaker of the house of representatives the minority leader of the house of representatives the majority leader of th senate and the minority leader of the senate10 in the signing statement accompanying the law

documents vol 37 sept 24 2001 p 1336 14 the national commission on terrorist atta cks upon the united states pl 107306 116 stat 2408 was established to examine and repor t upon issues relating to the terrorist attacks of september 11 2001 15 see for example the board of trustees for the american folklife center which is ongoing but was established in 1976 pur suant to pl 94201 20 usc 2103president alone but not by the presid ent from pool of persons selected by congressional leadership11 similarly in statement accompanying the signing of legislation creating the brown v board of education 50th anniversary commission12 the president made it clear that he would not be bound by the membershiprecommendations of house and senate leadership required by the statute but would rather welcome as matter of comity the suggestions of the congressional leadership for those positions 13 impact of appointment framework as the foregoing discussion suggests several alternative approaches are available to legislators in drafting membership selection language the decisions made when devising cong ressional advisory bodys mbership framework are not arbitrary or without consequence inclusion of legislators on such panels insures that congress will be able to exercise certain degree of control over the operations of the entity concerned at the same time service by members on congressional advisory bodies is arguably antithetical to at least one of the rationales for creating the entity in the first place namely to re duce the workload of congress by delegating certain functions to temporary bodies even in the absence of direct member ship on congressional advisory body in drafting the particulars of an appointment scheme legislators can dictate to some degree the measure of autonomy an tity enjoys for example although the legislation creating the na tional commission on terrorist attacks upon the united states the 911 commission did not s tipulate that members of congress be included in the commissions membership it did call for nine of the 10 members of the commission to be selected by congressional leaders14 attention to the proper balance between the number of members ppointed by congressional leaders and by other individuals or to the number of members of congress required to be among the appointees or to the qualifications of appointees can be significant factors in enabling an advisory body to fulfill its congre ssional mandate organization of the report each currently functioning congressiona l advisory body regardless of when it was initially established is profiled following the narrative portion of this report15 for each entity brief summary of its pur pose or role is provided as well as the following information httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33313crs6 16 5 usc appendix 86 stat 770 17 the appointment power of the president pro tempore of the senate is subject to the conditions of 2 usc 199 which requires involv

or if not upon the joint continuedadvisory body type congressional advisory bodies can be generally grouped into four categor ies most advisory bodies study particular policy probl ems or investigate events policy advisory bodies and report their findings to congress less common are advisory bodies that commemorate person or event commemorative advisory bodies policy and commemorative advisory bodies are often alt hough not always temporary in nature congress has also created number of advisory bodies that oversee ongoing functions of congress operational advisory bodies or serve diplomatic or interparliamentary functions diplomatic advisory bodies these adviso ry bodies diffe r from policy or commemorative bodies in that they typically are created to serve ongoing functions often have
