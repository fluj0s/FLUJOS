this report is to document the validation of computer online forensic evidence extractors cofee ability to properly format wipe and generate profile to thumb drive this report includes the validation of cofees ability to generate report from collected data cofee is live information and volatile data acquisition suite it is gui console based digital forensics tool developed for live volatile forensics evidence acquisition and analysis tool tested computer online forensic evidence extractor cofee version 112 run environments microsoft windows xp with service pack 3 supplier microsoft and nw3c purpose and scope this validation study was conducted to verify cofee properly formats wipes and generates profiles to thumb drive including its ability to generate report from collected data this validation study was conducted to ensure that cofee consistently completed all of its required actions test result summary all test assertions conducted on cofee were successful cofee successfully generated listed profile user created profile formatted an attached device as fat 32 and overwrote or wiped data existing in unallocated space on the device cofee successfully generated detailed report of the results of the collected data from specified profile there were unexpected anomalies found during testing test assertions the following test assertions were designed based upon the listed features of the cofee tool 1 cofee will not format drive smaller than 1 gib in size 2 cofee will only format drives 1 gib in size or larger 3 cofee will format drives 2 gib or larger 4 cofee will display warning when formatting drive between 1 gib and 2 gib 5 cofee will format selected drive as fat 32 6 cofee will format and wipe drives 1 gib in size or larger 2 7 cofee will display warning when formatting and wiping drive between 1 gib and 2 gib in size 8 an investigator can create their own application profile 9 an investigator can save their own application profile for future use 10 an investigator created profile can be used after cofee is closed and restarted 11 cofee will not generate profile on device smaller than 1 gib in size 12 cofee will generate profile on 1 gib device along with its required files 13 cofee will generate 2 gib or larger drive with profile 14 all data generated by the programs in the specified profile were successfully created in the report 15 cofee successfully verified the hash values of the files generated in the specified profile to ensure that changes have been made since their creation testing environment test computer 1 dell latitude
