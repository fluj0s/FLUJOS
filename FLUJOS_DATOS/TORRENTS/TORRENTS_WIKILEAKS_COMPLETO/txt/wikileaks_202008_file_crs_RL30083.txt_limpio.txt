disaster aid middle east peace and other initiatives updated may 26 1999 larry nowels specialist in foreign affairs foreign affairs defense and trade division congressional research service the library of congress abstract congress considered several fy1999 supplemental appropriation requests early in the 106th congress including those for central america hurricane relief middle east assistance agriculture farm loans and kosovo military and humanitarian operations major issue in the debate was whether to declare the supplemental proposals as emergencies or offset their costs with cuts in existing program funding this report reviews the presidents supplemental requests discusses the offset issue and tracks congressional action through enactment supplemental appropriations for fy1999 central america disaster aid middle east peace and other initiatives summary during the early months of 106th congress lawmakers considered several major fy1999 supplemental appropriation requests including those for central american and caribbean reconstruction aid in the wake of hurricanes that struck the region in late 1998 additional aid for jordan the most urgently sought portion of threeyear package for israel jordan and the palestinians to help implement the terms of the wye memorandum negotiated in october 1998 farm loan assistance for farmers affected by continued low commodity prices and kosovo military and humanitarian operations proposal initially considered separately from the others the president declared central america aid farm loan funds and kosova operations as emergencies thereby avoiding the need to offset the costs of the supplemental he proposed to cover the expenses of additional middle east aid by using mostly defense department funds last year congress approved about 21 billion in emergency funds that were not offset with cuts in existing appropriations decision some lawmakers strongly opposed they argue that all future supplemental initiatives should be fully offset so as not to violate discretionary spending caps set for fy1999 and beyond or reduce the projected surplus the house and senate approved bills providing most of the presidents requests for central america and farm relief plus adding funds for other congressional priorities the senate s 544 provided 25 billion in supplemental funding including nearly four times as much as proposed for farm relief aid 592 million and about 300 million in loan and other relief programs for american steel and oil and gas industries the house approved hr 1141 13 billion in supplemental funds at levels similar to those proposed by the president for central american jordan and farm relief the congressional decision to provide offsets rescissions and deferrals to cover most of the costs of new supplemental spending raised significant opposition and veto threats from the white house s 544 drew most of the program reductions nearly 3 billion from nondefense emergency supplemental funds appropriated last year in the omnibus appropriations act for fy1999 pl 105277 plus another 13 billion from domestic programs the house bill cut mostly over 850 million from foreign policy programs one of the largest was rescission of callable capital appropriated prior to 1980 to back us contributions to the world bank after the house on may 6 passed separate kosovo supplemental hr 1664 congressional leaders folded it into the conference report on hr 1141 conferees agreed on may 13 to 151 billion supplemental measure providing roughly the presidents request for central america and jordan but significantly higher amounts for farm relief and kosovo operations all but 2 billion of the conference agreement is declared an emergency conferees dropped most of the

appropriating 151 billion supplemental fy1999 funds for central america hurricane relief aid to jordan american farmer assistance and kosovo military and humanitarian operations as approved by congress hr 1141 provides funds roughly at the presidents request for central america 1 billion and jordan 100 million but higher amounts 574 million for farm relief in addition lawmakers merged into hr 1141 another supplemental spending bill hr 1664 passed by the house on may 6 for kosovo and other defenserelated requirements the 12 billion for kosovo and other defense needs is nearly double the 61 billion request but 1 billion less than passed by the house on may 61 all but 2 billion of the hr 1141 is declared an emergency the conference agreement dropped most of the house and senatepassed offsets over which the white house had threatened veto the largest remaining rescission is 125 billion from food stamp surpluses conferees also deleted senate provisions providing 1 billionplus loan programs for us steel and the oil and gas industries the conference agreement retains however senate amendment giving states complete control over how to spend money derived from the settlement of lawsuits against tobacco companies the white house opposes this provision conferees further added 900 million in domestic disaster relief funds to aid victims of the recent tornados in the midwest background when the 106th congress convened in january it was widely assumed that the president would seek immediate approval of fy1999 supplemental funding for two foreign policy requirements that arose in late 1998 after congress had adjourned the administrations february 1 budget submission for fy2000 included the first of the anticipated supplementals 19 billion in fy1999 supplemental and fy200020001 advance appropriations for assistance to israel jordan and the palestinians promised after the october 1998 signing of the wye river memorandum two weeks later 1 for details on the kosovo supplemental see crs report rs20161 kosovo military operations costs and congressional action on funding by stephen daggett crs2 on february 16 the white house submitted the second major supplemental request 9555 million for emergency disaster relief and reconstruction assistance to countries in central america and the caribbean affected by hurricanes mitch and georges that struck the region in late 1998 and for more recent earthquake damage relief for colombia normally when seeking supplemental funds for the current fiscal year the administration recommends prompt congressional action within few months to meet what are usually unanticipated requirements congress generally completes action on earlyyear supplemental requests by may or june in the case of the central americacaribbean natural disaster relief given its emergency nature the president has asked congress to act expeditiously finalizing the funding legislation by the end of march the middle east assistance did not appear so urgent until the death of jordans king hussein following his death the white house modified the pending middle east supplemental on february 19 asking congress to separate the 300 million portion for jordan and to consider it as part of the hurricanes mitch and georges relief package presumably the balance of the wye memorandum proposal for israel and the palestinians and the portion of the jordanian request not funded in the fy1999 supplemental can be taken up later by congress as part of the regular fy2000 foreign operations funding measure central americacaribbean reconstruction2 hurricane mitch which struck in late octoberearly november 1998 left in its wake severe destruction to the economies and people of honduras nicaragua and other countries in the region more than 9000 are confirmed dead with another 9000 still missing more than 3 million people were displaced from their homes infrastructure including roads bridges schools and health clinics especially in honduras was badly damaged more than third of nicaraguas most important crops were destroyed the world bank estimates that destruction to the region totals 536 billion the united states responded immediately to the crises providing over 300 million in emergency humanitarian assistance in the following months for what has amounted to the largest foreign disaster relief operation ever conducted by the united states the administration drew funds for the immediate relief efforts from number of disaster aid accounts managed by the us agency for international development usaid and the defense department to enter the second phase of the us response the rehabilitation phase the administration sought supplemental funding of 9555 million3 most of the funds 2 for more information regarding the effects of hurricane mitch and the us response see crs report 981030 central america reconstruction after hurricane mitch by lois mchugh 3 the clinton administrations request for hurricane relief excluded proposal to enhance the trade benefits now extended under the caribbean basin initiative cbi the administration has announced that it will send separate cbi enhancement proposal soon see crs report rs20102 caribbean enhancement legislation by raymond ahearn march 4 1999 crs3 are for housing education transportation and public health needs for the victims of hurricane mitch but smaller amounts would also provide relief for two other natural disasters that struck the region recently hurricane georges especially in the dominican republic and an earthquake in colombia part of the request would also replenish usaid and dod emergency accounts which were drawndown during the initial us relief efforts major components of the supplemental include 474 million for road school and health clinic repairs and loans for farmers 64 million for environmental management and disaster mitigation aid 42 million for reconstruction assistance to the victims of hurricane georges 10 million for colombian earthquake relief 41 million for debt reduction for honduras 16 million and us contribution 25 million to central american trust fund to help countries service their debts owed to the world bank and regional development banks 80 million for the justice departments immigration and naturalization service to pay for the costs of reduced deportations to central america and to deal with illegal immigrants coming to the united states because of hurricane mitch 1575 million to replenish dod 1325 million and usaid 25 million 56 million for us national guard and reserve new horizons exercises in the region that will assist with infrastructure repair and medical services4 wye memorandum middle east supplemental5 on october 23 1998 israeli and palestinian leaders meeting at the wye river plantation in maryland signed the wye river memorandum calling on the two countries to meet commitments made in earlier peace initiatives including further israeli withdrawal from territory on the west bank in support of the wye memorandum the united states subsequently pledged additional assistance for israel the palestinians and jordan beyond regular annual levels of foreign aid for israel the supplemental military funds would help pay for the costs of redeploying from areas of the west bank for the palestinians the additional aid would support continuing economic development programs mostly administered through non governmental organizations and for jordan the economic and military aid would assist jordanian economic reform programs and military modernization efforts 4 prior to the white house submission of its supplemental appropriations request senator graham and others introduced s 371 the central american and caribbean relief act authorizing funds for disaster aid and rehabilitation for the region amounts recommended in s 371 are very similar to those proposed by the president in his appropriation request s 371 however further includes cbi trade enhancement initiative something the white house says it will submit for consideration but has not yet sent to congress similar bill was introduced in the house hr 984 on march 4 5 for more information on the wye memorandum and middle east peace efforts see crs issue brief 91137 the middle east peace talks by carol migdalovitz and crs report rs20107 middle east us foreign aid wye agreement funding and the request for fy2000 by clyde mark crs4 initially the administration submitted to congress february 1 1999 comprehensive wye memorandum aid request proposing 19 billion over three years 900 million as an fy1999 supplemental and 500 million each for fy2000 and fy2001 as an advance appropriation6 the country allocations and yearly distributions are illustrated in table 1 following the death in midfebruary of jordans king hussein however the administration revised its wye memorandum supplemental asking that the jordan portion be separated and considered by congress on an urgent basis together with the hurricane mitch supplemental in amending its request the white house argued that accelerated assistance would help promote stability in jordan and throughout the region during the leadership transition period table 1 wye memorandum supplemental s in millions fy1999 fy2000 fy2001 total israel military aid 600 300 300 1200 palestinians economic aid 200 100 100

supplementals the president also proposed several much smaller fy1999 supplemental spending proposals in his february 1 budget submission for fy2000 including those for supreme court salaries and expenses 1 million for additional staff national oceanic and atmospheric administration 5 million to address new regulations in the northeast multispecies fishery gulf of maine department of the interior 68 million for the trust management improvement project corporation for public broadcasting 11 million plus 37 million in advance appropriations for fy2000 for acquisition of satellite capacity 6 an advance appropriation is mechanism for congress to appropriate funds immediately for an activity or program that will not require funds in the current year the advance appropriation would be enacted in one year but not be available for obligation until future year for scorekeeping purposes the advance appropriation would count against the year in which the funds are available for obligation congress has generally been reluctant to provide advance appropriations exceptions however are occasionally agreed to including about 7 billion in education funding in the fy1999 labor hhs and education appropriation crs5 on february 26 president clinton proposed further supplemental spending initiative asking for 152 million to provide credit and delivery of services to american farmers and ranchers who continue to be affected by weakened farm economy of the total 1096 million would be available to support 11 billion in additional direct and guaranteed loans extended through five programs because of low commodity prices farmers have been drawing on existing usda loan programs at faster rate than expected that may result in the depletion of current resources sometime in the spring submitted separately from this series of supplemental requests and weeks after the house and senate had given their approval the president sent congress additional supplemental proposals to cover the costs of us military and humanitarian operations in kosovo 615 billion and for additional resources 372 million for the federal emergency management agency fema to aid victims of the recent tornados in the midwest the house passed separate kosovo spending measure hr 1664 but lawmakers added the kosovo and fema funds to the supplemental package for central america jordan and american farmers when the latter was taken up in midmay by housesenate conference committee paying for the fy1999 supplementals continuing controversy during the recent consideration of supplemental appropriations and one that has emerged as the most contentious issue in the current debate is whether to cover the costs of the additional spending through offsets or to declare the requirement as an emergency7 the emergency designation allows congress to approve the supplemental funds without offsetting the amounts with rescissions in previously enacted discretionary appropriations or finding cuts in mandatory spending programs but if congress agrees with the president to define all or part of the supplemental as an emergency and not offset the amounts discretionary spending rises beyond the agreedupon caps and the size of the budget surplus for fy1999 declines between 1994 and 1997 congress usually enacted budget authority offsets for supplementals reversing that practice last year congress declared nearly all of the 21 billion supplemental appropriation enacted in pl 105277 as an emergency some lawmakers strongly objected to this action and are vigorously opposing efforts to approve any supplemental funding for fy1999 without corresponding cuts in existing budget authority some congressional critics argue that since the current surplus is due to social security approving supplemental funds without offsets will reduce social security resources in the future the administration designated the central americacaribbean relief package usda farm loans and kosovo operations as emergencies not requiring reductions in existing budget authority for the wye memorandum however the white house proposed to offset most of the 900 million fy1999 portion with defense department funds has met with some opposition in congress in addition to rescinding 18 million in previously enacted military assistance funds the president 7 for discussion of the debate over emergency supplemental appropriations for defense programs since fy1993 see crs general distribution memo emergency appropriations for the department of defense by stephen daggett august 18 1998 crs6 proposed to use 652 million of dod intelligence and 230 million of dod ballistic missile defense funds enacted last year as contingent emergency supplemental appropriations in pl 105277 additional spending for intelligence and missile defense resulted directly from initiatives developed by congressional leaders because the funds were contingent on the president designating them as an emergency they are not available until the white house makes such determination and the president may choose not to do so the president said the monies for intelligence and missile defense are not needed this year and his budget request includes proposals for advance fy2001 appropriations for both of these accounts as offsets this proposal is especially controversial as it comes at time when many in congress believe that defense spending is too low and are seeking ways to increase appropriations for next year and beyond congress is considering number of alternative offsets and as noted below some of these options have drawn sharp criticism from the administration few have brought veto threats from the white house congressional actions agreeing with the presidents recommendation for immediate consideration of the central americacaribbean and jordan supplemental requests the senate appropriations committee met on march 4 and reported out legislation providing 19 billion in supplemental funding s 544 including 100 million for jordan slightly higher than requested amounts for central americacaribbean rehabilitation efforts and about twice as much as proposed for farm relief aid 308 million the senate panel also added about 340 million to other administration proposals primarily for the transfer of resources for domestic disaster relief programs from hud to the federal emergency management agency fema and for 1 billion loan guarantee program for the american steel industry following three days of debate and consideration of more than 50 amendments the senate passed s 544 on march 23 during senate consideration several amendments adding and rescinding funds were adopted bringing the total amount of new spending to 25 billion the largest new funding amendments were those offered by senator bond for an additional 150 million in aid for american hog farmers proposal by senator bingaman of 125 million for oil and gas industry relief and an initiative by senator domenici to create 500 million oil and gas guaranteed loan program the senate further set aside by tabling three other controversial amendments to require prior congressional approval for the united states to support chinas membership in the world trade organization senator hutchinson tabled 6930 to end funding for any independent counsel in existence more than 42 months after the termination of the independent counsel statute senator torricelli tabled by voice vote crs7 to waive federal recoupment of medicaid claims stemming from tobacco related state settlements if states agree to fund certain health programs senator specter tabled 7129 see below for more on this issue the house appropriations committee meeting on march 11 reported similar bill hr 1141 adding small amounts to the central america rehabilitation request providing 100 million for jordan and 152 million for farm relief assistance as proposed by the president the house appropriations committee reported its measure on march 17 and the full house passed it on march 24 220211 the house rejected several amendments including two relating to the contentious offset issue new spending programs initiated in the senate for the steel and oilgas industries the senate provision permitting states to maintain full control over how to spend money from the settlement of tobacco lawsuits and the congressional proposed cuts in existing resources to pay for the supplementals emerged as the most controversial issues as the legislation went before conference committee in mid may s 544 which offset all new supplemental budget authority and outlays drew much of the program reductions from domestic spending about 13 billion in order to ensure the bill was budget neutral in terms of outlays the senate further adopted an amendment by senator gramm that would rescind 225 billion of non defense emergency supplemental funds enacted in october 1998 pl 105277 for such things as us embassy security and counterterrorism programs y2k problems and antinarcotics programs when congress passed pl 105277 last year lawmakers did not include offsets for these supplemental initiatives hr 1141 which offset in budget authority all but about 195 million in defense funds used to provide emergency relief for central america cut mostly from foreign policy programs 845 million unlike the senate bill however the house measure did not provide enough rescissions to make the legislation budgetneutral in terms of outlays cbo estimated that the housepassed version of hr 1141 would cost about 800 million in outlays over the next 5 years one of the largest rescissions included in the house bill was callable capital appropriated by congress prior to 1980 to back us contributions to multilateral development banks because of this and other foreign policy cuts some administration officials said the president should veto the house measure some house members on the other hand opposed the bill because it does not offset all new supplemental spending efforts to convene conference committee to work out house and senate differences stalled for weeks as controversy continued over higher spending in the senate measure and the composition of offsets in both bills following the submission in april of another supplemental request for kosovo military and humanitarian operations congressional leaders decided to hold preliminary debate on kosovo spending and following house passage to convene conference meeting that would combine the issues of hr 1141 and the kosovo measure on may 13 house and senate conferees reached agreement on 151 billion supplemental measure hr 1141 legislation that passed congress by may 20 and was signed into law by the president on may 21 pl 10631 the enacted bill provides funds roughly at the presidents request for central america 1 billion and crs8 jordan 100 million but higher amounts 574 million for american farm relief hr 1141 as approved nearly doubles the presidents kosovo request from 615 billion to 12 billion but trims 1 billion from the level passed by the house in hr 1664 on may 6 all but 2 billion of the enacted supplemental is declared an emergency conferees dropped most of the house and senatepassed offsets over which the white house had threatened veto the largest remaining rescission is 125 billion from food stamp surpluses conferees also deleted senate provisions providing 1 billionplus loan programs for us steel and the oil and gas industries the conference agreement retains however senate amendment giving states complete control over how to spend money derived from the settlement of lawsuits against tobacco companies the white house opposes this provision conferees further added 900 million in domestic disaster relief funds to aid victims of the recent tornados in the midwest tables 2 and 3 attached at the end of this report summarize funding and offsets proposed in the supplemental and compares congressional positions with the presidents requests congressional action on major elements of the supplemental are discussed below central americacaribbean relief s 544 as passed the senate recommended slightly higher funding 12 million than proposed by the president for hurricanes mitch and georges reconstruction aid and assistance to earthquake victims in colombia the senate fully funded the debt reduction and the immigration and naturalization requests and made small changes to the mix of funding for other elements of the rehabilitation initiative the house in hr 1141 approved the same overall level as the senate for central americancaribbean relief aid making slight modifications in the allocation of funds including the addition of 56 million for usda to repair damage to the caribbean national forest in puerto rico in committee the appropriations panel had defeated an amendment by representative pelosi that would have added 25 million to forgive all debt owed to the us by nicaragua and honduras the enacted bill fully funds the presidents request for central american relief plus adds about 44 million for defense disaster relief and training programs in the region and military construction repairs in puerto rico wye memorandum jordan aid package both the senate and house supported the presidents request for 100 million of additional and immediate economic and military assistance for jordan but deferred the 200 million advance appropriation proposal for funds beyond this year the house appropriations committee further said that it strongly supported the full jordan request and expected to favorably consider it as part of the fy2000 foreign operations spending bill as anticipated the senate and house also deferred consideration of the remaining portions of the wye memorandum package for israel and the palestinians hr 1141 as enacted adopts the approach approved in house and senate bills crs9 farm relief aid s 544 went well beyond the presidents request for supplemental credits and delivery of services to farmers and ranchers affected by continuing low commodity prices the senate approved the presidents full recommendation for agriculture credits 152 million in loan subsidy plus several new initiatives including 100 million for repairs to waterways and watersheds caused by domestic natural disasters 30 million for farm land rehabilitation following storm damage 150 million in relief for hog farmers who have been hurt by continued low pork prices and 70 million the livestock industry in total s 544 appropriated total of 592 million for farm assistance hr 1141 as passed in the house provided funding at levels recommended by the president the final agreement on hr 1141 provides 574 million in farm relief aid roughly at amounts passed by the senate other congressional supplemental and policy initiatives the senate and house funded several of the presidents other smaller supplemental proposals in addition s 544 added 126 million for the us fish and wildlife services storm damage repair efforts in the pacific northwest and nevada and provided 2 million for security enhancements at the holocaust museum the latter was deleted by in the conference agreement an amendment by senator dewine added 23 million for state department counternarcotics programs provision included in the final bill an initiative by senator bingaman provided for 125 million in oil and gas industry relief while related amendment by senator domenici would create 500 million oil and gas guaranteed loan program neither were adopted by conferees the house measure added 3 million for the us commission on international religious freedom also included in s 544 and 56 million for house page dormitory and renovation of the oneill house office building the final legislation includes both of these initiatives the senate bill also contained two new initiatives s 544 transferred from the department of housing and urban development hud to the federal emergency management agency fema 3136 million that had been appropriated in previous supplementals the funds would be available for disaster relief recovery and mitigation assistance to communities included in major disaster declarations issued by the president in fy1998 and fy1999 the committee noted in its report dissatisfaction with huds failure to distribute funds under the disaster recovery initiative view sparked mainly by the management of disaster funds after the northeast ice storms of 19988 the 3136 million fema supplemental is offset by rescission of 3136 million from huds community development block grants the administration opposes this proposal requesting instead to 8 for description of the initiative see us dept of housing and urban development hud disaster recovery initiative federal register v 62 173 sept 8 1997 p 4734458 crs10 consult with the senate appropriations committee regarding its concerns with huds disaster relief program nevertheless the enacted bill includes 230 million transfer to fema on the recommendation of senator byrd s 544 would create 1 billion emergency steel loan guarantee program to aid american steel companies that have been adversely affected by surge of foreign steel imports subsidy appropriation costs for the loan guarantee activity would be 140 million following strong house opposition to the steel loan program because of its cost conferees dropped the proposal house and senate leaders however say they will permit future debate on legislation to establish such guarantee loan program the senate bill further raised as general provisions several policy issues including extension of the public comment period due to expire on may 10 1999 on proposed amendments to surface mining regulations section 2002 there is special concern especially from the western governors association that the department of interior will implement these revisions before the national academy of sciences nas issues its anticipated july 31 1999 report on the adequacy of existing state and federal regulations section 2002 would block any implementation until at least 120 days after the nas issues its report pushing back publication of new rules until at least december 1999 the administration opposes delay in the rulemaking process conferees adopted the senate position prohibition for the federal government to recoup any of the medicaid funds recovered by the states in the 206 billion tobacco settlement the presidents fy2000 budget includes 5year projection of federal recoupment of settlement funds starting at 46 billion in fy2001 and increasing to 48 billion in fy2004 since the lawsuits against tobacco companies were partially based on tobaccorelated medicaid expenditures some argue that some of the settlement money should return to the federal government at minimum some contend the states should be required to earmark portion of the funds for smoking abatement and child health programs during floor debate the senate tabled an amendment by senator specter 7129 that would have allowed the federal government to waive recoupment of medicaid claims if states used portion of the tobaccorelated settlement funds for activities intended to reduce the use of tobacco products to improve public health and to help tobacco farmers diversify their production9 the administration opposes the senate committee provision but supports positions similar to those expressed in the defeated specter amendment the final legislation retains the senate position 9 for more information see the crs tobacco electronic briefing book at httpwwwcongressgovbrbkhtmlebtobtophtml crs11 in addition conferees added new provision regarding the federal aviation administrations faa program of grantsinaid to airports the airport improvement program aip is currently authorized through may 30 1999 house and senate leadership has indicated this leaves insufficient time to enact either of the multiyear faa reauthorization bills under consideration hr 1000 s 82 language added to the supplemental appropriations would extend the aips authorization to august 6 1999 if the authorization is not extended the aip could go into abeyance projects underway could continue but new projects could be approved congressional offsets for supplemental appropriations representing the greatest departure from the presidents supplemental proposal the senate and house recommended the rescission and other savings provisions that would offset nearly all new budget authority and in the case of the senate outlays as well the senate measure cut 48 billion mostly from domestic budgets plus proportional reductions in emergency and regular fy1999 nondefense budget accounts the house measure cut 112 billion from existing budget authority three quarters of which was drawn from foreign policy programs during house floor debate on march 24 lawmakers rejected two amendments that would have in one case deleted several of the foreign policy rescissions amendment by representative obey 201228 and in the other rescinded additional funds in order to make hr 1141 fully offset in budget authority amendment by representative tiahrt 164264 the decision to offset the supplemental and the selection of specific program reductions raised the strongest objections from the administration with recommendations from some officials that the president should veto either measure the final conference agreement however appears to defuse the offset controversy of the total amount of new appropriations 149 billion all but 2 billion is designated as emergencies not requiring cuts in existing funds nearly all of the emergency appropriations are for kosovo operations conferees deleted the most controversial offsets the senatepassed acrosstheboard cuts in nondefense emergency funds enacted last year and the houseapproved 648 million rescission of world bank and other mdb callable capital instead conferees increased senateproposed 521 million rescission in the food stamp program to 125 billion in proposing this offset initially the senate appropriations committee noted that according to revised requirements not all food stamp funds would be needed in fy1999 and would expire at the end of the fiscal year the committee had recommended 285 million rescission but the level grew during senate debate in order to offset additional new spending for hog farmer relief state department counternarcotics programs grants to lowincome migrant and seasonal farm workers the conservation reserve program and the rural communities advancement program based on the most recent estimates it appears that there will be at least 14 billion and perhaps as much as 2 billion surplus in food stamps10 conferees also rescinded 350 million in hud public and indian 10 for further information see crs report 9859 food stamps background and funding crs12 housing funds food stamps the housing deferral and the transfer of hud funds to fema make up nearly all rescissions included in the enacted legislation among those rescissions dropped by conferees but over which strong white house opposition emerged included immigration and naturalization service 65 million rescission in s 544 for salaries and the citizenship and benefits program office the reduction in ins salaries could have effected efforts to hire additional border agents the ins is also facing an unprecedented two million pending case load of naturalization applications contributions to international organizations and peacekeeping 46 million rescinded in s 544 funding that according to the senate appropriations committee was in excess of approved or required levels it is possible that recent exchange rate gains coming from stronger dollar could have reduced the impact of this reduction for international organization contributions but it also might have resulted in adding to existing us arrears to these organizations foreign aid to haiti russia and bosnia 30 million rescinded in s 544 that would be drawn from existing funds for haiti russia and bosnia hr 1141 rescinded 45 million for aid to eastern europe and the former soviet union foreign food aid loans 30 million rescinded in hr 1141 the house appropriations committee said that funds carried in from the previous year would be sufficient to maintain the program at planned levels even with this reduction the administration however had assumed 50 million carryin for fy2000 in its budget request in order to keep the program operating at current levels callable capital for the world bank and other regional international financial institutions 648 million rescinded in hr 1141 prior to 1980 congress appropriated both paidin capital funds the us actually transferred to the banks and callable capital full faith and credit commitment by the us government that could be provided in the event of bank crisis none of this callable capital has ever been drawn upon and since 1980 only paidin capital has been appropriated and scored as budget item the house committee contended that its action would not alter its support for the mdbs nor would it have any significant impact on the financial strength of the banks treasury secretary rubin however told the house foreign operations subcommittee on march 17 that several experts had advised him that the committees action could increase the borrowing costs of the banks and undermine mdb efforts to stabilize asian and latin american economies in crisis he further warned of the precedent this rescission would set about 12 billion in pre1980 appropriated callable capital exists that some lawmakers might be inclined to draw from in future spending bills that require offsets he would recommend veto of the bill he said if the rescission remained in the bill moreover some members pointed out that the callable capital appropriations had crs13 outlays associated with them so that the rescission would not have resulted in any real reduction in us government expenditures russian plutonium and uranium disposal 150 million rescinded in hr 1141 the committee noted that usrussian agreements to set up programs to dispose of the excess plutonium and uranium from nuclear weapons had yet to be settled and that not all of the 525 million appropriated for fy1999 was needed administration and other critics contended however that the agreements are nearly in place and that the house action sent signal that the united states was not committed to maintaining the security of the excess nuclear material in addition s 544 proposed to rescind nearly 3 billion of the funds congress appropriated in last years omnibus appropriation act pl 105277 for non defense emergency activities this would have represented about 44 reduction for all emergency funding other than dodmilitary provided in division b of the omnibus spending measure11 the senate appropriations committee had proposed rescission of 343 million or about 5 of unobligated nondefense emergency funds in pl 105277 in the reported version of s 544 during floor debate senator gramm pointed out that while s 544 offset new budget authority recommended in the bill outlays for supplemental funds would be higher than outlays rescinded in the bill the overall effect of s 544 would be to add about 441 million in expenditures for fy1999 in order to ensure that new spending in s 544 would not reduce the projected surplus senator gramm proposed and the senate agreed to rescind 225 billion in budget authority from emergency nondefense money in pl 105277 an amount that would result in 441 million in fewer outlays for fy1999 after adopting the gramm amendment the senate also approved additional supplementals for livestock industry relief and oil and gas industry aid both of which were offset by additional cuts from last years emergency supplemental as passed s 544 rescinded 2968 billion in budget authority from the nondefense emergency money in pl 105277 cuts would be have been made on proportional basis across all nondefense accounts which congress approved on an emergency basis without offsets among the major emergency initiatives funded in pl 105277 that would have potentially been affected by proportional reduction included money for us embassy security and other counterterrorism enhancements y2k conversion counternarcotics programs and domestic natural disaster assistance the reduction in embassy security funding was especially contentious the administration has proposed followon 3 billion 5year initiative that would begin in fy2001 but an expert panel recommended in late 1998 that the state department needs to spend 14 billion per year for 10 years in order to provide adequate security to counter terrorist threats at 11 congress approved about 59 billion for emergency agriculture relief programs in pl 105277 but because these amounts were enacted in division of the bill where regular fy1999 appropriations were placed they would not be affected by this provision in s 544 crs14 us facilities overseas some critics in congress have called the administrations 3 billion initiative as inadequate and say they will press for more funding12 legislation pl 10631 hr 1141 making emergency supplemental appropriations for fy1999 markedup and ordered reported by the house appropriations committee march 11 1999 introduced and
