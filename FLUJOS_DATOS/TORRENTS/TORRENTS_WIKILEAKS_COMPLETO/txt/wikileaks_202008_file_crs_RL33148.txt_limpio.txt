overseas basing new developments and oversight issues for congress summary on august 16 2004 president bush announced program of sweeping changes to the numbers and locations of military basing facilities at overseas locations now known as the integrated global presence and basing strategy igpbs or global posture review roughly 70000 personnel would return from overseas locations from europe and asia to bases in the continental united states conus other overseas forces would be redistributed within current host nations such as germany and south korea while new bases would be established in nations of eastern europe central asia and africa in the department of defenses dod view these locations would be better able to respond to potential trouble spots the second session of the 109th congress could have to consider approval of the dod proposal or review appropriations requests for construction of infrastructure increased impact aid to local communities and new acquisition programs for mobility and logistics capabilities such as airlift finally the senate may have to consider ratification of new or revised treaties in august 2005 the congressionally mandated commission on the review of overseas military facility structure of the united states also known as the overseas basing commission formally reported its findings it disagreed with the timing and synchronization of the dod overseas rebasing initiative it also saw the initiative as potentially at odds with stresses on the force from operations in iraq and afghanistan and possibly hampering recruiting and retention the commission questioned whether sufficient interagency coordination had occurred it expressed doubts that the military had enough airlift and sealift to make the strategy work and noted that dod had likely underestimated the cost of all aspects associated with the moves dod budgeted 4 billion the commission estimated 20 billion dod disagreed with much of the commissions analysis meanwhile some have voiced concern that the dod plan would harm longstanding alliance relationships while others questioned dods plans to accommodate the thousands of troops returning to the us critics also argued that the 2005 base realignment and closure brac round which entered into force on november 9 2005 and the quadrennial defense review qdr which is to be completed in early 2006 should have been finalized before completing the overseas basing plan congress acted on some of its concerns with the rebasing plan in the fy2006 defense authorization act tasking dod with followon studies of overseas basing criteria and mobility requirements it also directs dod to further examine the state and local impacts on installations gaining personnel from the rebasing implementation recent international diplomatic and security developments could further influence debate on overseas basing uzbekistan one of the test cases for the new strategy recently evicted us forces from the base in that central

diplomacy 16 us military overseas basing new developments and oversight issues for congress introduction and issues for congress on august 16 2004 president bush unveiled one of the most sweeping changes to the numbers and locations of military overseas basing facilities since the beginning of the cold war announcing plan that had been under study for approximately three years the department of defense would move thousands of personnel from installations in europe and asia to bases within the united states simultaneously the military would shift its approach away from huge bases such as ramstein air force base which has all of the comforts of the us family housing supermarkets convenience stores theaters and so forth to reliance on more austere facilities in central asia africa and the middle east that would be less elaborate and lack most of these benefits in 2004 the congress chartered the commission on the review of overseas military facility structure of the united states also known as the overseas basing commission to provide an independent assessment of the dod overseas basing needs1 the dod plan could prompt budget and oversight decisions for the second session of the 109th congress these might include approval modification or rejection of the dod proposal congress could also have to consider appropriations requests for construction of infrastructure at new overseas or expanded continental united states conus locations as well as fund increased impact aid to local communities congress would have to oversee new acquisition programs for mobility and logistics capabilities such as airlift needed for the strategy congress may also consider whether the plan will be executable given the results of the 2005 round of the base realignment and closure brac process finally the senate may consider new or revised treaties with new basing partners submitted for its advice and consent 1 fy2004 military construction appropriations act hr 2559pl 108132 of november 22 2003 sec 128 this commission was chartered to make thorough study of matters relating to the military facility structure of the united states overseas this study would also consider issues pertaining to overseas military construction and facilities host nation support payments training ranges and opportunities to close or realign overseas bases it was specifically chartered to provide

the department of defense global posture review also known as the integrated global presence and basing strategy igpbs is intended to realign united states overseas forces over sixtoeightyear period from the bases basing posture left over from the cold war2 to new posture optimized to support current allies and confront new potential threats3 overall us installations overseas would decline from 850 to 550 roughly 70000 personnel mostly from the army would return to the united states the congressional budget office projects the initial cost of this relocation effort to be 7 billion but with potential savings payoff of 1 billion per year if the number of us troops permanently based overseas were reduced to minimum number needed to receive and host deployments4 the defense department plan envisions three tiers of bases it would retain some of the large main operating basessuch as ramstein afb in germany which have all of the comforts of the united states family housing schools supermarkets convenience stores theaters and populations in the tens of thousands5 secondly the military would establish an overseas network of forward operating sites which would be more austere installations and hosting smaller numbers of personnel military personnel would deploy to these bases for temporary duty typically one year or less unaccompanied by families in contrast to the permanent change of station moves in which an entire family moves to new base for two or more years finally minimalist cooperative security locations would likely be run by host nation personnel and would not host us forces on daytoday basis these locations would be used in the event of crisis to give us forces access to the region they would also allow us forces to train with local allies and participate in cooperative activities such as disaster relief or peacekeeping which could 2 during the cold war us troops were positioned to stop an invasion by tanks and aircraft of the ussr and warsaw pact from eastern europe into western germany this required an extensive infrastructure of bases runways and training areas to support large numbers of conventional forces the us also maintained large forces in japan and south korea both to deter the soviets in asia and to support security guarantees to the south koreans where to date formal peace treaty ending the 195153 war with

militarytomilitary ties6 us forces would also rely increasingly on off shore prepositioning and sea basing to provide logistical support7 the biggest changes would happen in europe where the military would shutter nearly 200 facilities and ultimately draw down roughly 40000 troops from 105570 as of june 20058 some of the forces remaining in europe would periodically deploy from bases in germany for temporary duty to locations in romania bulgaria or central asia both romania and bulgaria have energetically campaigned to win us bases camp bondsteel in kosovo eagle base in bosniaherzegovina and manas air field in kyrgyzstan typify the new forward operating sites while representing full time us presence these bases would lack the elaborate infrastructure of the major installations that evolved in western europe overall the focus of military basing would shift south and east closer to current middleeastern hotspots and central asia9 for east asia the plan advocates consolidating bases in south korea with drawdown of nearly 12500 personnel from strength of 32744 troops in june 200510 and move headquarters for remaining units out of expensive seoul to locations further south adjustments are also envisioned for troop dispositions in japan reports indicate the united states is proposing to move the 1st army headquarters from washington state to camp zama near tokyo to reposition the 5th air force headquarters from tokyo to guam and to relocate 7000 of the 15000 marines currently on okinawa to guam or to other locations in japan11 other us 6 us to close 35 percent

has established memoranda of understanding mous with gabon ghana namibia senegal south africa and uganda where the focus would be on training and cooperation13 the united states established combined joint task forcehorn of africa cjtfhoa in 2002 which is currently located at camp lemonier in djibouti this task force currently focuses on delivering militarytomilitary training and performing public works projects in an area including djibouti eritrea ethiopia kenya somalia sudan and yemen the united states hopes to expand these activities into uganda and tanzania there is even discussion within dod of transforming the cjtfhoa into unified command with responsibility for all of africa us central command and us european command currently split responsibility for africa14 rebasing rationale there are strong arguments motivating the need for revision to the alignment of us bases overseas this structure is legacy of the cold war confrontation and in some cases the us presence may now be less welcome in testimony before the senate armed services committee secretary of defense donald rumsfeld listed multiple reasons for reworking the overseas military basing dispositions he argued that the current arrangements were seriously obsolete oriented to deter and fight the large standing militaries of the warsaw pact in europe rather than the current threats however he gave geographic specifics on where he viewed the new threats as residing he stated that updating the militarys global posture was part of the departments larger transformation effort but his comments did not clarify how the transformational goals such as speed or precision in his words to do more with less drove the overseas basing strategy decisions he argued that relocating 11 continued okinawa washington post

that imposed restrictions or conditions on the use of us forces from their territory would be viewed as less satisfactory locations15 he did not specifically cite the countries he saw as sources of friction with respect to the presence of us forces or the conduct of us operations however it was widely assumed he was referring to friction with germany over the invasion of iraq and german restrictions on us training exercises during his june 2005 testimony to the senate armed services military construction subcommittee principal deputy undersecretary of defense for policy ryan henry echoed many of secretary rumsfelds themes he noted an increased reliance on prepositioned equipment and forces that move to forward operating sites on temporary basis but did not explain the anticipated mix between these forces and permanently stationed forces or what the department would need for airlift and sealift to sustain this approach he also suggested that the new strategy would improve military families quality of life because they would experience fewer disruptive overseas moves and the military member would have more predictable deployment schedule however the strategys reliance on more frequent short deployments which would increase the frequency of family separations would seem to some to contradict this assertion16 deputy undersecretary henry also claimed linkage with the 2005 brac round and the anticipated quadrennial defense review qdr study study that congress mandates dod to accomplish every four years to allocate missions and guide military procurement17 he did not however address the criticism that the first qdr performed after 911 should precede realignment of global basing structure rather than trail it by over year likewise the interaction of impacts from the re basing and from the relocations driven by the 2005 brac process have not been clearly articulated while it is possible that basing arrangements optimized for cold war adversaries may not be suitable to counter current threats the selection criteria for new base locations have not been delineated 15 department of defense global posture testimony as prepared for delivery by

military construction and veterans affairs subcommittee statement by ryan henry principal deputy undersecretary of defense june 28 2005 17 statement by ryan henry june 28 2005 crs6 the overseas basing commission commission report findings on august 15 2005 the congressionally chartered overseas basing commission released its final report the commission visited with senior military leaders defense analysts and senior officials from other government agencies and traveled extensively for site visits while the commission concurred with the need to reshape the structure of us overseas basing in general the report was critical of the dods overseas restructuring process and proposal18 there were several areas in which the commissions report concurred with dod it lauded the concept of transforming of the military from cold war structure to meet new requirements it agreed that the shifting of forces in south korea and the return of most army heavy forces from central europe was appropriate it also supported the concepts of forward operating sites and cooperative security locations with their reduced personnel and smaller infrastructure the commission agreed that these arrangements would give more options in crisis and more opportunities to work with new allies thus expanding positive us influence however the reports major finding held that the timing and synchronization of the global rebasing initiatives must be rethought19 chairman cornella argued that dods plan overemphasized purely military perspective and neglected to fully reflect the concerns of all members of the national security interagency community for example state department concerns about opportunities to enhance alliance relationships through exercises and exchanges and to exert political and diplomatic influence in the regions under review were allegedly given inadequate attention the commission believed the desire to implement base withdrawals quickly rather than specific strategic decisions and coordination seemed to be driving the selections further the report held that the locations were picked based on todays threats rather than long term threat assessment it expressed concern that the plan disregards the politics and values of some of the new potential allies which might not dovetail with us interests20 the report questioned the timing of the moves in environment of fastpaced current military operations the commission expressed concern that the strain of conducting this sweeping series of moves while also conducting major conflicts in iraq and afghanistan has the potential to threaten the capability of the force forces would either be preparing to deploy deployed or returning from deployment while 18 new report on overseas basing plans remains critical of pace timing inside the pentagon august 18 2005 us congress senate appropriations committee military construction and veterans affairs subcommittee opening statement of cornella

pp ixii httpobcgovdocuments 20 commission on review of the overseas military facility basing pp ix 411 crs7 also trying to reestablish their units support structure military personnel and families at new bases further it viewed the pace of the aggressive time line proposed by dod projected as 2006 through 2011 as overly ambitious21 the commission noted that mobility and equipment prepositioning were key to the success of the rebasing strategy however it expressed concern that current and projected strategic airlift and strategic sealift were inadequate for the defense departments concept which relies heavily on transporting troops to crisis areas rather than permanent forward basing it also held that sufficient prepositioned supply stocks do not now exist most importantly it argued that future budget plans for projected sea and airlift procurement did not account for the rebasing plans needs22 the report highlighted claims that the rebasing plan would harm the quality of life of volunteer military personnel it noted that the military has insufficient plans to ensure both that required support facilities at us bases gaining personnel are in place for new personnel on arrival and that facilities are preserved at the losing base overseas until the last person is gone these support facilities include commissaries exchanges hospitals and child care capacity on base and off base support capability provided by the local and state communities such as schools and housing without this support young military families with limited incomes may suffer in areas of spouse employment family health and cost of living the commission also argued that the heightened tempo of temporary overseas rotations that is central to the plan will result in frequent family separations over the course of career that could threaten retention and recruiting the decision to stay in the military is very much family decision and when many child growth milestones are missed or spouse experiences enough home emergencies and worry while the military member is deployed overseas the decision can tip to separation from the military23 significantly the report contended that the dod might have underestimated the total cost to implement their base realignment process the commissions independent analysis calculated 20 billion bill for the moves while the dod has only budgeted 4 billion through 2011 the danger is that the services will need to spend from their operations and maintenance budget accounts which should normally be used to buy daytoday material such as expendable equipment fuel or ammunition to cover the difference this could result in potential damage to force readiness given the concurrent budget demands caused by combat operations in iraq and afghanistan24

crs8 the commission given all its reservations recommended slowing and reordering of the pace of overseas rebasing until that the acquisition of key capabilities such as mobility and prepositioned supplies required to support the new strategy had occurred it also maintained that better budget support for establishing forces at new locations mainly back in the us such as funding for the movement of people and equipment and building at these locations is required further preparatory activities were needed for local communities to absorb thousands of new military families such as support for additional schools and roads25 in general the commission held that coherent national strategy did not sufficiently guide the overseas posture review and that formal national debate on the larger scope of american security postcold war should precede further rebasing moves it argued that completion of the 2005 quadrennial defense review the base realignment and closure commission report and the mobility capabilities study26 were key to providing an overall architecture for updating our overseas posture the commission strongly recommended diligent congressional oversight of this process to ensure cohesive basing strategy27 responses to the commission report the defense department responded to the commissions report upon its release in may 2005 principal deputy undersecretary for policy ryan henry and acting under secretary of the army ray dubois met with the press and delivered specific counterpoints to many of the reports findings mr henry rebutted the commissions critique of the dod choices for strategic dispositions where the commission viewed the dod selections as based on todays threats he asserted that the concept strove to base the forces in locations that supported flexibility and speed of response to anywhere in an unpredictable environment28 critics may contend however to simply assert that future threats are unpredictable sidesteps the challenge of articulating strategic vision which includes projection of anticipated threats mr henry also took issue with the commissions argument that dod had not sufficiently coordinated the global posture review across government agencies he cited meetings with the regional combatant commanders that began shortly after the 2001 qdr as well as consultations with the department of state the national security council and 45 briefings to members of congress and to committee staffs 25 commission on review of the overseas military facility basing pp xixii 2932 26 the mobility capabilites study is department of defense project to analyze how much airlift and sealift will be required for the future it relies on computer modeling of multiple deployment scenarios to determine how much capacity

military facility basing pp xiixiii 28 us department of defense defense department special briefing may 9 2005 httpwwwdefenselinkmiltranscripts2005tr200505092701html crs9 he maintained that congress had indicated satisfaction with the amount of oversight consultation to this point he also highlighted visits to the leadership in over 20 foreign countries that could be affected by the relocations while he noted the number of meetings he did not indicate whether the briefings were indepth or ongoing nor the state of progress particularly regarding the delicate status of forces agreements that guide basing rules with the foreign countries he stated that the global posture review was intended to serve as starting point to feed the 2005 qdr as well as the 2005 brac and the mobility capability study all of which were to be coordinated in parallel therefore it would fall to the qdr to address the timing of lift procurement and other needed equipment acquisition to ensure it supports the integrated global presence and basing strategy igpbs however since the qdr is intended to be the keystone document outlining dods future strategic vision selecting how the military will align its bases before determining the strategy they are trying to achieve raises questions of appropriate sequence mr dubois disputed the commission reports concerns that dod was shortchanging military families quality of life he responded that the rebasing plans decisions were incorporated into the brac analysis he noted that the dod held discussions with the department of education as well as state governors and leaders of communities that would be vital partners in supporting returning personnel and dependents he did not however indicate if additional impact aid for these communities was planned he also did not address plans to expand infrastructure on or near affected installations he held that the rebasing would give other payoffs to improve quality of life noting that the number of family permanent changes of station pcss would be fewer thus reducing the turmoil of overseas moves although reducing the number of pcs moves may offer greater stability it assumes that all military bases are of equal desirability in their geographical location and facilities which is often not the case dod also appears to assume the overseas stationing in permanent european bases such as germany italy are undesirable to military families which is also often not the case in fact the opportunity to periodically live overseas is for some an advantage of military career mr dubois also did not address however the stress that increased unaccompanied overseas deployments would place on families or the troops deployed at isolated bare bones locations neither official addressed the potential impact on recruiting or retention finally mr henry downplayed the disparity between the defense departments and the commissions cost figures he suggested that the commissions study included costs that other programs in the defense budget covered while dod figures only focused on the additional costs driven specifically by the moves mr dubois also noted that the military would eventually accrue savings in operations and maintenance accounts as they drew down from maintaining expensive overseas locations yet even if these costs will be covered by other programs in the budget there is indication that the department has proposed an increase for those budget items such as construction airlift procurement or sealift procurement further it is unclear that the compensation the us would get from the new host nations would offset that currently received from established allies commonly countries in which us bases are located provide various forms of host nation support this could include basic utility services construction and even cash payments in recognition of the benefit to local economies however many of the new locations such as crs10 kyrgyzstan are demanding payments from the us to allow basing in their countries reaction to the pentagons plan continued to emerge from beyond the commission alliance relationships formed one topic for debate historically european allies have been especially desirous of keeping significant us presence which they view as supporting european stability and integration security guarantees to other allies have encouraged their support of nonproliferation regimes some critics such as philip h gordon at the brookings institution fear that moving forces away from long term allies to basing in nations less likely to restrain us military operations would give the administration more latitude to take unilateral military action in future crises without consultation thus further harming relationships and the us image29 others have reinforced the concern that the moves could erode ties with traditional long term american allies with particular focus centered on the relationship with germany some such as pat towell at the center for strategic and budgetary assessments even suggested that the moves were intended as punishment of germany by the bush administration for its opposition to us operations in iraq30 at the same time it bears recognition that land restrictions and real estate costs for some us allies has led to limitations on training and exercises further prudent us relocations could reduce frictions with local populations especially in okinawa and south korea advocacy groups for military personnel and families echoed the reports warnings regarding the impact of the rebasing strategy on quality of life some like joyce raezer of the national military family association suggested that dods record of preparation for past unit moves showed that services were not ready for families at new locations and that services closed before old locations were empty likewise they fear the strain on civilian infrastructure such as roads schools and housing could cause problems with the relocations for example as new brigade recently assumed posting at fort drum watertown new york soldiers had to move up to 75 miles away for housing31 such long commutes will strain soldiers on shift work or delay their response in crisis scarce housing also could harm troops standard of living particularly for families where both adults are active duty members or single parent households it could also drive up rent costs for junior enlisted members and could limit civilian spouse employment opportunities for example schools in watertown became overcrowded and the single hospital in town lacked capacity for the new patients however other larger communities such as paso texas have expressed enthusiasm for the job growth and homebuilding surge these moves would prompt32 29 ronald brownstein turnabout on troops

sealift ships or aerial refueling tankers are needed and calls for ending purchases of c17 and c130j transports it also requires retaining and modernizing all air force c5 transports which historically have poor availability rate35 the recommendation to end c17 construction contradicts recommendations from former us transportation command commander general john hardy who called for at least 42 more aircraft36 september 2005 defense science board report also questioned the sufficiency of airlift and tanker capabilities and proposed that dod should keep open the option to acquire additional c17s given the unpredictable threat and budget environment37 in examining the dod methodology behind the mobility capabilities study the government accountability office also expressed concerns regarding the validity of the modeling and simulation tools used in developing the results38 congressional action congress incorporated its concerns regarding the global posture review into

authorizers ask for dod report on overseas basing choices inside the pentagon december 22 2005 crs13 the mobility capabilities study congress included authorization for the air force to purchase up to 42 additional c17 airlifters however exercise of that authority is contingent on the dod first conducting reassessment of airlift requirements for national defense this assessment must specifically take into account the structure proposed by the igpbs the legislation tasks dod to submit this assessment with the qdr or up to 45 days after the qdr is delivered to congress if more time is required40 congress also gave direction regarding the stateside infrastructure needs that would arise from returning forces the fy2006 authorization legislation also requires the secretary of defense to consult with state and local governments as it develops its global posture implementation plans regarding infrastructure and support needs driven by personnel returning from overseas basing41 the legislation also included sense of the congress that the qualityoflife support facilities should be ready at bases gaining personnel before they arrive and maintained at closing bases until the personnel have departed42 lastly the fy2006 authorization incorporated sense of the congress that roads leading to military installations that gain significant numbers of personnel from the igpbs or brac should be designated as defense access roads43 this section also directs the secretary of defense to conduct study of the surface transportation infrastructure around bases affected by brac and the igpbs and its adequacy to support the gains from redeployments that report is due to congress by april 15 200744 international arena there have been several recent positive events that help the implementation of the global posture review to move forward on december 6 2005 secretary of state rice signed an agreement with romanian foreign minister razvan ungureanu to station us forces at the mihail kogalniceanu air base near constanta on the romanian black sea coast us forces would also be able to use the babadag smardan and cincu training ranges the new location would house the eastern european task force with roughly 1500 personnel reports indicate that negotiations for basing in bulgaria are also nearing conclusion45 the united states also concluded an agreement with japan

relocate the 3 000 marines at futenma to land to be reclaimed off shore at camp schwab46 other recent international developments potentially cast shadows on key assumptions underlying the global posture review there might be indicators of an international shift in the degree of welcome extended by other countries to basing us forces for example statement by south korean president roh moohyun would seem to place limits on the united states ability to employ forces stationed in korea to missions beyond the peninsula47 in another case kyrgyzstan has demanded 100fold increase from 2 million to 200 million in the rent the united states pays for use of manas air base kyrgyz president bakiyev had also been trying to charge the united states an additional 80 million for jet fuel the united states had already paid for this fuel but the payment was allegedly misappropriated by former president akayev the dod has refused this additional charge claiming the corruption is kyrgyz internal problem the kyrgyz government has also begun agitating for compensation for claimed environmental damage due to aircraft emergency fuel dumping48 in yet another instance russian officials quickly expressed dismay at the recently concluded us basing agreement with romania russian defense minister ivanov suggested that the move put the future of the conventional armed forces in europe cfe treaty in doubt and appeared to threaten withdrawal from the treaty the state department countered that the us agreement was in compliance with cfe and other understandings with russia49 of particular concern to the rebasing plan are recent developments in uzbekistan on july 29 2005 the united states was formally notified that it had 180 days to leave its air base at karshikhanabad in uzbekistan this base has served as vital hub for missions flown to support operations in afghanistan and was prototypical of the cooperative security locations envisioned in the pentagon re basing plan the last contingent of us troops departed on november 21 2005 ending four years of operations there one reason for this eviction might have been state department pressure on the tashkent government regarding

member states it also requires advanced notification of significant force movements for further information see crs report rl30033 arms control and nonproliferation activities catalog of recent events by amy f woolf crs15 rights abuses50 another reason for the eviction might have been encouragement from china and russia who have indicated increasing unease regarding us military activity in the central asia region region seen by the united states as strategically vital to the war on terror commentators contend that russia and particularly china are exploiting the perception of us support for democratic revolutions in georgia and the ukraine as examples of us threat to the power of the areas authoritarian leaders such as president karimov in uzbekistan during the demonstrations that prompted the harsh uzbek government response and attendant us criticism china publicly expressed support for karimovs actions furthermore shortly before the united states eviction karimov visited beijing where he garnered 15 billion in contracts and agreements between china and uzbekistan51 finally the political and security climate in some locations proposed for us forward bases could require disproportionate amount of manpower be dedicated to local security requirements for example while president hamid karzai has signaled desire for permanent us military presence in afghanistan an upsurge of violence killed seven us troops in four day period in august 2005 this increase of attacks also wounded two embassy staffers four years after the defeat of the taliban52 other countries reported to be under consideration for or already hosting us troops confront significant terrorist threats of their own for example the lords resistance army continues to stage brutal attacks in uganda with limited ceasefire having failed at the beginning of the year in turkmenistan country under consideration to host the us forces removed from uzbekistan government crackdowns on terrorists have led to accusations of major violations of human rights and civil liberties curtailments53 potential oversight issues for congress the overseas basing commission pointedly emphasized the importance of congressional oversight of the overseas basing realignment process some of the issues congress may wish to consider include the following 50 robin wright ann scott tyson us evicted from

linkage to an overarching strategic framework agreed upon by all key government parties in the national security strategy process while most may agree that revision of the overseas basing structure left from the cold war is overdue some would argue that developing rebasing strategy without completing the defense departments quadrennial defense review and achieving buyin across government agencies and with congress is premature these moves may have major impacts across many aspects of us foreign and security policy the lack of overarching strategy and analysis may also be construed by some to miss vital linkages in execution timing and schedule which could lead to implementation pitfalls in the future cost are the defense departments cost projections for the overseas realignment accurate will projected savings outweigh the cost of realignment and associate systems procurement the dod and the overseas basing commission disagree on these points others might also contend that proposing rebasing strategy before completing the 2005 base realignment and closure round and the mobility capabilities study could result in mismatches of supporting infrastructure or mobility assets the consequence could be shift of these unfunded requirements onto the services which are already under pressure from the cost of ongoing combat operations operational tempo is it feasible to conduct the basing realignment moves given the deployment tempo driven by ongoing military operations in iraq and afghanistan units returning from combat deployments only to immediately pack up families and relocate can put immense burdens on an already stressed force this burden is exacerbated if the bases receiving new troops lack sufficient supporting infrastructure can the services permanently sustain the long term pace of frequent deployments required by the strategy at some undetermined point members may experience enough degraded quality of life for their families and endure such frequent separations that retention or recruiting begin to suffer diplomacy what will be the effect of the rebasing on the relationship with long term us allies such as germany where drawdown is proposed lack of presence could find the united states reducing its voice in european or asian affairs and finding it harder to motivate international coalitions or support when needed have sufficient legal arrangements such as status of forces agreements and overflight rights been negotiated in advance of the arrival of us forces in new host nations the overseas basing commission argued that the preliminary diplomatic legwork had not been fully accomplished do the political climates in the new host nations support us values of democracy and human rights while some nations such as romania have actively sought us presence others such as uzbekistan have crs17 ended those arrangements as soon as they begin to annoy or lose their profitability is the rebasing proposal affected by standing treaties to which the us is state party such as the conventional forces in europe treaty early evidence may indicate that dod and the state department need to further examine potential treaty impacts
