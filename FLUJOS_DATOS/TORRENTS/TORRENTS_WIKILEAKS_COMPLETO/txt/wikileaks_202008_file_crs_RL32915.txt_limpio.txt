2006 nicole t carter analyst in environmental policy resources science and industry division upper mississippi riverillinois waterway investments legislation in the 109th congress summary the upper mississippi river and illinois waterway umriww is at the center of debate over the future of inland navigation the restoration of rivers used for multiple purposes and the reliability and completeness of the us army corps of engineers analyses justifying investments consequently authorization of investments in navigation and ecosystem restoration of the umriww played role in water resources development act wrda hr 2864 debates in the 109th congress among the topics debated were the cost urgency necessity and national benefit of expanded umriww navigation capacity and ecosystem restoration given the constraints and competition for corps construction funding during the 109th congress the house and senate both passed water resources development act bill hr 2864 conferees were named but further action was taken the umriww is 1200mile 9footdeep navigation channel created by 37 lockanddam sites and thousands of channel training structures built beginning in 1822 the umriww makes commercial navigation possible between minneapolis and st louis on the mississippi river and along the illinois waterway from chicago to the mississippi river it permits upper midwestern states to benefit from lowcost barge transport since the 1980s the system has experienced increasing traffic delays purportedly reducing competitiveness of us products in some global markets the river is also losing the habitat diversity that has allowed it to support an unusually large number of species for temperate river this loss is partially attributable to changes in the distribution and movement of river water caused by navigation structures and operation of the 9foot navigation channel in december 2004 the corps chief of engineers approved umriww 50 year framework for navigation and ecosystem restoration investments as laid out in corps final feasibility report this framework consists of combined navigation investments 24 billion and ecosystem restoration investments 53 billion to be accomplished through incremental implementation for the first increment the chief recommends authorizing 188 billion 50 from the inland waterway trust fund and 50 from federal general revenues for seven new locks and smallscale navigation measures and 146 billion 133 billion from federal general revenue and 013 billion from nonfederal partners for ecosystem restoration the house and senate versions of wrda would have authorized investments in navigation 203 billion and ecosystem restoration 158 billion for the umr iww the language would have authorized most of the initial set of

corps of engineers released its final integrated feasibility report and programmatic environmental impact statement for the umr iww system navigation feasibility study1 this study set out 50year plan for combined navigation investments 24 billion and ecosystem restoration investments 53 billion for the upper mississippi riverillinois waterway umr iww from the 50year plan the corps recommended authorization of first increment of investments 188 billion for seven new locks and smallscale navigation measures and 146 billion for ecosystem restoration the feasibility report was approved by the corps chief of engineers in december 2004 the 109th congress considered authorizing these investments during its consideration of water resources development act wrda hr 2864 hr 2864 would have authorized investments in navigation 203 billion and ecosystem restoration 158 billion during the 109th congress the house and senate both passed hr 2864 conferees were named but further action was taken the house and senate versions of the bill would have authorized most of the initial set of activities recommended in the corps feasibility report this report provides background on umriww navigation ecosystem conditions and the corps feasibility report then it compares the plan recommended in the corps feasibility report to the wrda legislation considered in the 109th congress umriww

international markets commercial users of the waterway contend that this competitiveness is in danger because of increasing transit delays most of the lockanddam infrastructure of the umriww navigation system was built by the corps in the 1930s these 600foot locks require the nowprevalent 1100foot barge tows to split in half and pass through in two steps this decoupling contributes to wait times at some locks the corps reports that the umriww system has over half 19 of 36 of the most delayed locks of the countrys inland waterways2 commercial users advocate for expanded lock capacity with new 1200foot locks parallel to the existing 600foot locks keeping both operational they contend that commercial umriww barge operators have been paying fuel tax into the inland waterway trust fund iwtf3 for making this type of infrastructure investment in contrast taxpayer advocacy group taxpayers for common sense and some environmental groups have argued that inexpensive smallscale measures like traffic scheduling congestion tolls and switchboats could manage demand and reduce lockage delays and unlike new locks that would take years to design and build smallscale measures would be implemented quickly at fraction of the cost4 navigation investment supporters contend that the usefulness of smallscale measures is limited in practice some environmental groups are also concerned that additional stress caused by construction activities and increases in barge traffic above current levels could accelerate ecosystem decline for discussion of the environmental impacts of incremental navigation improvements and traffic on the umriww see crs report rl32470 upper mississippi riverillinois waterway navigation expansion an agricultural transportation and environmental

stagnant navigation proponents counter that barge traffic has been steady recently because of delays that is delays are forcing grain shippers to switch to alternate transportation modes to ensure timely arrival at downriver processing plants or gulf ports navigation supporters cite that since the late 1940s the umriww has experienced substantial traffic growth from less than 10 million metric tons in the mid1940s to more than 80 million metric tons in the 1990s for an analysis of the historic trends and the prospect for future traffic see crs report rl32470 upper mississippi river illinois waterway navigation expansion an agricultural transportation and environmental context coordinated by randy schnepf although 1200foot locks are expected to reduce current waiting times at locks they are not expected to eliminate all lock delays because decoupling is only one cause of delay lock delays also occur because of closures for operation and maintenance and the variability in demand more than one boat arriving at the same time results in queue and the seasonality of crop harvesting assures strong autumn demand the corps has not published an estimate of the proportion of delays expected to be eliminated by new locks ecosystem decline the upper mississippi river system umrs an ecosystem defined as including the umriww navigation system and the aquatic and terrestrial habitats and species that are critically important to the river floodplain ecosystem6 is losing the habitat and habitat diversity that support the ecosystems diverse species two structural elements dams and locks that facilitate navigation and flood reduction levees have changed the riverine ecosystems structure and functions altering basic processes and habitats by modifying water levels and their fluctuations the umrs provides habitat and food to at least 485 species of birds mammals amphibians reptiles and fish including 10 federally listed endangered or threatened species and 100 statelisted threatened or endangered species it is critical migration corridor for 40 of north americas waterfowl and shorebirds and home to at least 118 fish species and almost 50 freshwater mussel species in wrda 1986 pl 99662 congress declared the umrs nationally significant ecosystem and nationally significant commercial navigation system and created the environmental management program emp for conducting habitat rehabilitationenhancement projects and longterm resource monitoring for the umrs the ecosystem encompasses four federal fish and wildlife refuges and three national parks lie within or immediately adjacent to the river system the umrs ecosystem also is viewed as significant because of the economic value of its heavy recreational use annually there are 12 million daily visits for recreation in the umrs boating sightseeing sports fishing hunting and trapping are some of the 5 twicecooked pork 6 the lateral boundaries of the umrs are defined by the full extent of the floodplains

activities generate 12 billion and over 18000 jobs annually8 according to the corps current environmental investments 339 million annually on average in federal and state funds are inadequate to prevent continued degradation side channels backwater and wetlands are filling in with sediment the ecosystem is also experiencing loss of connectivity of the floodplain to the river impeded fish migration loss of island habitat and loss of native plant community diversity and abundance although the navigation system and levees significantly altered conditions they are not the only stressors causing decline the mississippi river and illinois river have long history of impaired water quality largely caused by contamination from agricultural industrial residential and municipal sources9 as well as increased sedimentation and altered runoff patterns from land use changes environmental groups seek investments in ecosystem restoration that will support mosaic of habitats and river management that more closely resembles natural hydrograph and riverfloodplain connectivity some cite the loss of migratory birds in the areas of the illinois river and the middle and lower mississippi river as examples of possible outcome if investments are not made environmental groups want to reverse ecosystem decline and to increase the services and benefits provided by healthy ecosystem eg recreational uses umriww feasibility study evolution to inform the congressional decision on whether to authorize umriww investments the corps conducted feasibility study the corps feasibility study begun in 1993 to investigate the longrun navigation needs of the umriww has been the subject of controversy in february 2000 corps economist approached the us office of special counsel an independent federal investigative and prosecutorial agency that protects government whistleblowers contending that the corps manipulated benefitcost analysis to support umriww lock improvements the feasibility study was temporarily halted while the allegations were investigated by the army inspector general ig and available study documents were reviewed by the national research council nrc of the national academy of sciences the igs investigation found incidents of fraud or waste it did reveal serious misconduct and improprieties with the study and suggested an institutional bias that favored largescale projects10 the nrc pointed out several flaws in the economic modeling methodology and data used for navigation estimates including 7 ibid pp 146147 8 ibid p 147 9 ibid p 127 10 us dept of the army us army inspector general agency report of investigation case 00019 washington dc dec 2000 crs5 overly optimistic river traffic projections11 it also criticized the corps for limiting the studys environmental analyses to incremental effects of expanding navigation capacity in response in 2001 the corps reformulated the economic analysis and added an ecosystem restoration component to the study the nrc continues to review the study second nrc panel produced report in early 2004 that reviews the reformulated study12 and another report in october 2004 that comments on an april 2004 draft corps feasibility report which is similar to the final feasibility report13 the nrc suggested in its reports that until small scale measures were investigated and implemented where feasible it would be impracticable to evaluate the benefits of new locks and lock extensions following on the earlier reports the october 2004 report found economic feasibility for any of the navigation alternatives has therefore not been demonstrated and the nrc panel concluded that many of the flaws and omissions in this study can be corrected in the course of implementation by the application of adaptive management principles14 final feasibility report in september 2004 the corps released final feasibility report based on the results of the reformulated study it recommended 50year plan for combined navigation efficiency and ecosystem restoration investments the corps proposed authorization of first increment of measures as well as dualpurpose navigation and ecosystem restoration management of the umriww the corps navigation improvement plan would cost an estimated 24 billion over 50 years while the ecosystem restoration plan would cost an estimated 53 billion over 50 years the corps recommended that congress authorize first increment of the navigation measures at 188 billion and first 15year increment of ecosystem restoration measures at 146 billion although the corps did not implement smallscale measures as the nrc suggested the agency evaluated them as part of the reformulated study few of the smallscale measures that were studied were included in the corps recommendation for navigation investments in addition to supporting navigation and ecosystem restoration investments the corps recommended creating structure for umriww investments and operations consisting of three basic elements adding ecosystem restoration as umriww project purpose creating dualpurpose navigation and restoration authority approving combined navigation and ecosystem

with operational changes and nearterm investments for navigation and ecosystem restoration investments would be part of longterm river management framework that minimizes risk by establishing process to incorporate acquired information into ongoing decisionmaking and phased authorizations feasibility report review the corps chief of engineers in december 2004 chiefs report approved the umriww feasibility report chiefs report contains final feasibility report including studies of engineering feasibility and analyses of benefits and costs environmental studies and the chiefs recommendation on how to proceed the corps umriww feasibility report has also been reviewed for compliance with administration policy by the assistant secretary of the army civil works in contrast to the corps chief of engineers who has signed off on the proposed project the assistant secretary of the army civil works reportedly chose to support proceeding with design and recommended waiting until additional economic data and analysis are available before initiating construction the formal corps project development and authorization process typically has congress authorizing project based on chiefs report that has been reviewed for compliance with administration policy by the assistant secretary of the army civil works then the office of management and budget omb16 in recent years congress increasingly has authorized projects based on informational copies of the chiefs report before complete reviews by the assistant secretary and omb however majority of projects are still authorized after full executive branch review supporters of exceptions from the standard process generally contend that the completion of the administrations reviews and the timing of authorizing legislation are not always synchronized and that exceptions provide the flexibility to bridge the two schedules when most of the corps analysis is already complete environmental and taxpayer groups have been critical of exceptions to the corps standard process they contend that authorizing without complete administration review rushes projects through review that congressional decisions are made with incomplete information and that reviewers may be pressured to make favorable recommendations 15 part of the corps definition of adaptive management is an approach to natural resources management that acknowledges the risk and uncertainty of ecosystem restoration and allows for modification of restoration measures to optimize performance the process of implementing policy decisions as scientifically driven management experiments that test predictions and assumptions in management plans using the resulting information to improve the plans corps final feasibility report and peis p 611 16 for more information on the corps project development and authorization process see crs report rl32604 army corps of engineers water resources activities authorization and appropriations by nicole t carter crs7 navigation investments the umriww feasibility report evaluating the federal interest in investments in navigation improvements is atypical in some respects the analysis had to account for complex set of risks and uncertainties resulting from 50year planning horizon for the extensive umriww system for the final feasibility report and peis the corps used scenariobased approach rather than forecasting navigation demand over 50 years which the corps was doing prior to the criticism in 2000 and 2001 the scenario approach examined umriww movements for five traffic scenarios based on differing world trade crop area crop yield and consumption patterns the corps used the scenarios to arrive at preferred navigation plan and to make three general findings first single navigation alternative was clear best choice across range of economic conditions17 second the preferred navigation alternative depended on two variables 1 traffic forecasts derived from future trade scenarios and 2 price sensitivity of shippers18 third the risks are high if action is taken and high traffic occurs risks are also high if large investment is made and increases in traffic do not materialize19 stated another way the corps found every alternative including action to contain risk in the face of an uncertain future meeting fundamental criterion for federal involvement that national economic development benefits exceed costs depends on what the future holds for example according to the corps analysis if umriww traffic continues at the fairly constant level of the last 20 years costs of largescale measures would likely exceed benefits20 if navigation traffic on the system increases ie follows the longer 50year growth trend benefits probably will exceed costs21 these findings are useful for understanding why proceeding with navigation capacity expansion remains controversial for discussion of the difference of opinion on the urgency of new locks the feasibility of using alternatives to new locks for reducing delays and the confidence level in the corps analysis see crs report rl32470 upper mississippi riverillinois waterway navigation expansion an agricultural transportation and environmental context coordinated by randy schnepf the corps usually recommends authorization of an entire project that it has analyzed and compared to alternatives because the umriww is an extensive navigation system the corps analyzed and compared alternative 50year packages of projects for navigation and ecosystem restoration and it recommended that congress approve the combined plans as framework and authorize subset of initial projects with the implication that it would be asked later to authorize the remaining projects in the 50year plan22 the subset of projects was not analyzed as 17 corps final feasibility report and peis pp x 437438 and 493 18 ibid pp 462 and 493 19 ibid p 493 20 ibid p 458 21 ibid p 459 22 similar approach was used for the corps first largescale ecosystem restoration effort continued crs8 standalone plan for example the corps feasibility report did not have benefit cost analysis for the first increment of navigation activities as subset of the analysis of the 50year plan the report also did not present costeffectiveness analysis for the first increment of ecosystem restoration projects corps navigation plan adaptive implementation the final feasibility report and peis stated that sufficient analysis had been completed to support an initial navigation investment to be implemented using an adaptive approach that minimizes risk by controlling the magnitude of investment decisions23 the corps recommended authorization of an initial set of navigation investments from its 50year navigation plan including seven new 1200foot locks authorization for the remaining navigation investments which consist primarily of extending five 600foot locks to 1200 feet would be sought in later legislation to support this adaptive approach the corps recommended the continued study and monitoring of umriww navigation to produce the data to feed into an adaptive implementation approach in another departure from standard practice the corps recommended that the seven new locks be reconsidered after congressional authorization as additional information becomes available the corps would transmit reports to the administration and congress containing acquired information first the corps would produce notification report at the end of the first phase of lock design and before the award of construction contract the notification report would present all new information resulting from monitoring river traffic and markets and results of any improved models and analysis the corps recommendation was to break up preconstruction engineering and design work for the seven new locks into two segments first the design work on three locks followed by the design work on the remaining four locks the design work for the first three locks was estimated to take three years following initiation of appropriations so the corps anticipated notification report in 2008 if the full annual appropriations were received starting in 2005 the corps estimated that it would spend 30 million on preconstruction engineering and design for the first three lock sites the second report would come five to seven years into implementation ie 2010 to 2012 when the corps submits reevaluation report upon the development and use of new and widely accepted models the report would conclude with recommendation to congress on whether to continue stop or delay lock construction third report would be an updated feasibility report for the 50year plan evaluating investments in second increment of measures the second increment of navigation measures would consist primarily of five lock extensions upstream of the new locks on the mississippi river the corps anticipated that this report would be written 16 years into implementation ie around 2021 22 continued in the florida everglades where wrda 2000 pl 106541 approved the final feasibility report as framework authorized few specific projects under the framework and established process for developing and authorizing additional projects 23 ibid p 493 crs9 first increment the corps 50year navigation plan consists of smallscale measures structural and nonstructural including switchboats24 and largescale improvements seven new locks and five lock extensions the plan would have first cost ie design and construction costs of 24 billion plus annual switchboat costs of 18 million in the final feasibility report and peis the corps recommended that congress approve the 50year plan as framework and authorize first increment of 188 billion to be paid 50 from federal general revenue funds and 50 from the inland waterways trust fund consistent with standard policy for inland waterway projects the first increment would include seven new locks and smallscale measures for use during lock construction the seven new locks would be 1200foot locks parallel to existing 600foot locks the 188 billion authorization proposed by the corps would cover the first costs for authorized navigation measures like most corps authorizations the authorized amount would not reflect operation and maintenance om expenses om for inland waterways is 100 federal responsibility the om for the recommended navigation measures would be 78 million annually the federal government would be responsible for this amount as well the 115 to 126 million spent annually on om of the existing umriww navigation system if fully funded the corps estimated that it would take 13 years for each lock to proceed to completion from the start of preconstruction engineering and design the first three of the seven new locks would be complete at the earliest by 2019 the remaining four locks would be started three years later and completed earlier than 2022 environmental mitigation the final feasibility report and peis assessed and set out process and specific measures for mitigating impacts directly associated with navigation in its preferred alternative the corps concluded that the impacts of largescale umriww navigation improvement measures could be mitigated it stated that by using mitigation the net effect from both increased traffic and site specific impacts would be loss to the five principal areas of concern fisheries submerged aquatic plants backwaters secondary channels and historic properties25 proposed legislation and corps navigation plan as recommended by the corps the house and senate versions of hr 2864 in the 109th congress would have authorized seven new locks and smallscale and non structural measures see table 1 one difference between the two versions was that the senatepassed language directed that the investments be implemented in general conformance with corps documents while housepassed language directed that 24 switchboats would be used to assist tows by managing the second half of their hauls as they move the first half through the 600foot locks resulting in shorter lockage time switchboats would be employed as hired vessels permanently stationed on both the upstream and downstream sides of lock 25 corps final feasibility report and peis p 419 the corps did not established specific mitigation actions instead it identifies potential mitigation measures for each river reach crs10 implementation be substantially in accordance with the corps documents and subject to the conditions described therein table 1 identifies major components of the corps recommendation and the related provisions of hr 2864 although the corps recommendation and the bill language are similar in many respects there are differences for example the bill language included neither an adaptive implementation process nor continued monitoring and study provision except for development and testing of lock appointment scheduling system table 1 corps navigation plan and hr 2864 provisions corps preferred hr 2864 navigation alternative 109th congress reference to feasibility dualpurpose plan approved house authorized

restoration plan is unusual in that the investments are aimed at benefitting diverse set of species most of the corps other environmental investments have been for project mitigation often targeted at specific threatened or endangered species for the umrs the corps is proposing largescale restoration effort that is not directed at specific species but at providing habitat and habitat diversity to benefit populations of multiple native species in situ for more detailed discussion of the ecosystem restoration proposal see crs report rl32630 upper mississippi river system proposals to restore an inland waterways ecosystem by kyna powers and nicole t carter the environmental management program for the umrs authorized in wrda 1986 has allowed the corps to test the impacts of measures similar to those proposed for the umrs however since largescale implementation of these measures may produce uncertain outcomes the corps is recommending an adaptive management approach since the umrs restoration plan is among the first largescale restoration efforts being planned across the country it raises numerous unanswered policy questions which were not addressed in hr 2864 and thus are not addressed in this report including what distinguishes ecosystem restoration from mitigation for past and ongoing damages of navigation projects what qualifies as restoration for example is system that needs regular intervention such as dredging restored is restoration feasible goal for waterway managed for intensive commercial navigation is dualpurpose management for ecosystem restoration and navigation possible for highuse commercial waterway how should federal appropriations be distributed among the universe of ecosystem restoration projects nationally for example how does restoration of the umrs rank compared to the restorations of the california baydelta the chesapeake bay coastal louisiana florida everglades the great lakes and the missouri and rio grande rivers corps ecosystem restoration plan the final feasibility report recommended an ecosystem restoration plan for combating the environmental damage resulting from ongoing navigation om and other factors degrading the umrs ecosystem it recommended longterm 50year restoration framework an adaptive management approach and authorization of 15 year first increment of activities the restoration goals of the plan are26 maintain viable populations of native species in situ represent all native ecosystem types across their natural range of variation 26 ibid p 171 crs12 restore and maintain evolutionary and ecological processes eg disturbance regimes hydrologic processes nutrient cycles etc and integrate human use and occupancy within these constraints the corps limited its ecosystem restoration plan to the navigation project and study and to addressing the cumulative impacts of operations of federal projects and other stressors without reducing the benefits of existing federal projects as such restoration measures are constrained because they cannot impede navigation and they are limited to the umriww and its floodplain rather than the larger watershed for example dramatic water level changes that could produce substantial restoration benefits are not in the corps plan because they would interfere with navigation another consequence of limiting restoration to the navigation project and study is that some of the stressors leading to degradation were not considered in the preferred plan the recommended umrs restoration plan does not include changes to land use practices flood protection practices that isolate the river from its floodplain on largescale or significant alterations to navigation infrastructure for example the corps plan includes backwater dredging measures dredging addresses the symptom of elevated sedimentation but not the land use practices that can cause it directly changing land use is outside the scope of the navigation study and navigation project because only some of the stressors causing ecosystem degradation are managed under the corps plan not all of the ecosystems natural river processes would be restored resulting in the need for regular human intervention to sustain some restoration benefits 15year restoration increment in the final feasibility report the corps proposed that congress authorize an initial 15year 146 billion increment of the corps 50year 53 billion ecosystem restoration plan the 146 billion would cover the first costs ie design and construction for the authorized activities and would be split 133 billion 93 federal and 013 billion 7 nonfederal this costshare arrangement is unusual for most corps ecosystem restoration projects costshare of 65 federal and 35 nonfederal is applied to the project27 the cost share arrangement proposed by the corps for the umriww drew attention because it distinguished between activities that have the 6535 split and activities that will be 100 federal in general the 100 federal components address impacts of the existing 9foot navigation project or are on federal land according to the corps measures in the 15year increment were selected to provide 1 the best return on investment 2 the best gains in habitat diversity and 3 additional knowledge that will facilitate implementing the 50year plan28 the corps also favored measures for which planning design construction and monitoring could occur during the 15year window however some organizations 27 another exception is the corps only other largescale restoration effort the florida everglades restoration the everglades restoration was split 50 federal and 50 nonfederal the everglades ecosystem was harmed by operations of federal projects and encompasses extensive federal lands for information on everglades restoration see crs report rs20702 south florida ecosystem restoration and the comprehensive everglades restoration plan by pervaze sheikh and nicole t carter 28 corps final feasibility report and peis pp 511512 crs13 argued that 15 years would be insufficient to demonstrate substantial improvements unlike the analysis of the 50year ecosystem restoration options the final report did not analyze in detail the ecosystem benefits expected from the 15year increment it also did not present alternative 15year increments or costeffectiveness analysis of the 15year increment the recommended 15year increment included 225 measures from the 1010 measures in the 50year plan the 225 measures were grouped into three main categories of activities fish passage and dam operations fish passage construction at four dams and fish passage planning and design at two dams 209 million and new dam operating procedures and related land acquisition or easements at two dams 41 million 250

floodplain connectivity and wetland and riparian habitat protection and restoration 277 million total 65 federal29 the 935 million in programmatic restoration authorization included 136 million for adaptive management and 136 million for restoration monitoring and evaluation the recommended 146 billion did not include om expenses om for ecosystem restoration for corps projects is typically 100 nonfederal responsibility because some of the projects would be managed by federal agencies their om would be federal responsibility om costs which would be incurred over the 50year planning horizon for the 15year increment were estimated at 615 million annually with an expected split of 96 million federal and 519 million nonfederal proposed legislation and corps restoration plan the house and senate versions of hr 2864 during the 109th congress were largely similar to the corps recommendations they would have authorized the same projects and had the same costshare arrangement although the senate version would have required that restoration be implemented in accordance with the general framework outlined in the final feasibility report and peis and the house version would have required that restoration be implemented in accordance with upper mississippi river and illinois waterway system report of the chief of engineers there were some differences between the corps 15year increment and the proposed authorizing language see table 2 for example the total authorization of 158 billion would have been 012 billion more than the amount in the corps feasibility report 29 ibid p 522

service crs15 the corps recommended an adaptive management approach for the ecosystem restoration plan although the legislative language in hr 2864 made mention of adaptive management the language would have required some complementary measures the house version would have required an ecosystem restoration implementation report by june 2007 june 2008 in the senate version and every five years thereafter the report was to include baselines benchmarks goals and priorities for restoration projects and to measure the progress in meeting goals the language also would have authorized an advisory panel similar to the science panel which was one of 12 elements of the adaptive management strategy outlined in the final feasibility report30 because the bill language did not specifically authorize the adaptive management approach it was uncertain if the corps would have had the authority to implement the 136 million adaptive management program and the complementary 136 million monitoring and evaluation that the agency recommended similarly the corps recommended adding ecosystem restoration as project purpose31 the hr 2864 language would have required the corps consistent with requirements to avoid adverse effects on navigation to modify umriww operations to address cumulative environmental impacts and improve ecological integrity and to carry out ecosystem restoration projects the language did not explicitly add ecosystem restoration as project purpose of the umriww the implications of this for managing for both navigation and restoration were unclear another distinction was that hr 2864 would have authorized lump sum of 158 billion with one primary limitation that land acquisition be limited to 35 million annually in the final feasibility report the corps made recommendations on an annual limitation on land acquisition instead it recommended cap of 35000 acres on land acquisition the final report provided breakdown of the 146 billion among three categories of restoration activities fish passage and dam operations programmatic restoration authority and land acquisition project design hr 2864 would have required that before an individual restoration project begins construction the secretary establish restoration performance measures including baseline indicator and target goals the language also would have required that the design of these projects include monitoring plan for the performance measures including timeline for project completion the provisions appeared to be aimed at addressing concerns over what would be achieved under both the first increment of authorized activities and the longer 50year plan and when restoration would be complete these provisions complemented the corps recommendation for an adaptive management approach which required establishing baselines and monitoring performance to incorporate new information into ongoing investments linked progress hr 2864 would have required the corps to establish milestones for the ecosystem restoration and navigation projects the language also would have required the secretary of the army to determine if the projects were 30 ibid p 516 31 ibid p 491 crs16 being carried out at comparable rates if the projects were not moving toward completion at comparable rate annual funding would have been adjusted to promote comparable progress the provision appeared to be an attempt to address concerns about ecosystem restoration investments being outpaced by navigation investments similar provisions were included in legislation proposed in the 108th congress at that time some environmental groups were willing to accept new locks if ecosystem restoration also was authorized and funded they wanted investments in restoration and navigation linked they feared that if the two were not linked ecosystem restoration could have been authorized but could receive minimal appropriations navigation and agricultural interests expressed their dissatisfaction with linking navigation and restoration progress they consider navigation and ecosystem restoration investments as separable they did not want navigation construction slowed due to constrained federal appropriations for ecosystem restoration in light of the multiple multibillion dollar largescale restoration projects already underway or under development nationally they also contended that linking might delay progress of lock construction thus extending the environmental and traffic disturbances caused by construction linked progress ultimately is policy decision of how congress wants to direct its appropriations differences while the house and senate versions of hr 2864 were largely similar the two had subtle differences for example the advisory panel established under the house language would have had one chairperson the secretary of the army in the senate version the secretary of the army and secretary of the interior were cochairpersons further the comparable progress provisions of the house and senate versions differed the house version would have explicitly required the secretary of the army to submit annual reports to congress describing whether projects were being carried out at comparable rates the senate language did not include this provision project ranking hr 2864 would have required the secretary of the army in collaboration with the advisory panel that the bill established to develop ranking system for restoration projects emphasizing projects that restore natural river processes project ranking based on restoring natural river processes appeared to be an attempt to promote projects that trigger selfrepair and selfmaintenance over large areas at relatively modest cost32 these provisions could have given priority to water level management and other dam alterations floodplain measures such as levee modifications and removals and alteration of river training structures such as wing dams and dikes the impact that these provisions would have had on the implementation of the corps final plan is uncertain it could have given priority to single aspect of project rather than facilitating multiple objectives prioritizing projects that restore natural river processes might not have been appropriate for all river reaches especially lower reaches that are more altered than lessdisturbed upper reaches greater number of engineered restoration activities were recommended by the corps 32 early 2004 nrc report p 19 crs17 in the lower basin which is more heavily developed and leveed than in the upper basin for example the corps recommended artificially mimicking natural hydrograph to restore ecological processes eg pumping water out of areas with water levels raised by dams for reaches where natural river restoration options were limited by the navigation system and development solution using more natural river process might have decreased water levels by altering dam operations thus harming navigation this option was not considered in the corps plan because the agency considered it outside the scope of the feasibility study and navigation project conclusions the corps feasibility report recommended first increment of investments in navigation 188 billion and ecosystem restoration 146 billion the recommendation was for these investments to be made using an adaptive approach and as part of longterm framework for dualpurpose operations the recommendation was to improve navigation efficiency by building seven 1200foot locks to reduce delays caused by decoupling of barge tows the ecosystem restoration proposal was to address cumulative impacts degrading the umrs ecosystem including the ongoing effects of om of the navigation system recommendations for restoration activities were limited geographically to the umr iww and its floodplain and to the scope of the navigation project and its feasibility study more comprehensive watershed approach was not part of the plan recommended in the feasibility report hr 2864 would have authorized many of the elements of the corps recommendation for the first increment of investments the language would have authorized seven new navigation locks smallscale navigation measures and related environmental mitigation the adaptive implementation process that the corps recommended in its feasibility report to integrate new information into the decision on lock construction was not explicitly adopted in bill language instead the senate version directed that the investments be implemented in general conformance with corps documents while the house version directed that implementation be substantially in accordance with corps documents drawing from the corps recommendations hr 2864 would have authorized ecosystem restoration activities to be carried out in accordance with the framework in the feasibility report and these activities would have required operational changes to the umriww consistent with requirements to avoid any adverse impact on navigation additionally hr 2864 contained three provisions related to implementation of ecosystem restoration one provision appeared to require comparable funding requests to be made based on the rate of progress for navigation and restoration projects the other two provisions would have required outcome oriented project design for ecosystem restoration projects and the development of ranking system for restoration projects that prioritizes natural river processes for other versions of this document see httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32915
