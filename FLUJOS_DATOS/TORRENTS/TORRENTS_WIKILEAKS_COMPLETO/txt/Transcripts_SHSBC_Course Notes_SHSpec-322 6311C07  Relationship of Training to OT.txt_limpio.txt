6311c07 shspec322 relationship of training to ot you are very fortunate people to come all the way down the track having done all those stupid things and to wind up here with chance out the chance is as good as you can audit and not bit better the number of rawmeat pcs that will go out through the roof is nonexistent unless they become fully trained auditors they wont make it the raw meat case is very easy to audit but what you are doing is auditing the charge off the top ris scientologist appears to be tougher case because the charge is off of those you will have to find the two top ris now and go on down the bank you cant go on and run the bank on someone who hasnt clue about his mind who doesnt know what is there frontwards and backwards the pcs ris only disintegrate when found in their right locations even though they can be found out of position so dont worry about case getting messed up by ris being found in the wrong place goals which have already been run can mess things up all you can do if an ri or gpm has been run is to date them even after you have run an ri you can verify it by dating the reason for this is that in running it you pulled it little out of its own timesphere so you can still get bit of bang on dating it and reorienting it you are just getting the idea of it which is still there in position the mass is already gone sooner or later someone will take lot of clay and work out the mind with the pc an unusually smart pc who will get it and go on being audited with understanding but this will be very rare occurrence getting someone to be responsible for session occurs on gradient the people who start on an hca course etc are already preselected just by the fact that they enrolled any of them including any upperlevel auditor including lrh gets nervous over pcs wondering if the ta is moving the pc doing ok etc that is to be expected people who persist into upper levels of training are further predetermined by their willingness to continue in the face of struggle and disappointment there is an additional problem where do you take over the pcs itsa so as to allow him to itsa just enough neither cutting it short nor letting the pc wander around mucking things up these points vary from pc to pc and with the same pc as he gets more able some pcs have good perception and if they say it is so it probably is so with other pcs you can count on it that if they say its _______ it isnt you should be increasing the pcs perception of and confront on his own bank so as the pc gets closer to ot you should have him in good enough shape so that he can perceive what is there to be run next where you can deduce change in the pc you are of course changing the values by which you audit also the pcs itsa can deteriorate if he has had some loses and the case is going sideways and backwards you will have to take over more responsibility for directing his attention until he is fixed up cases are always different from one moment to the next lowlevel cases run on fat they have charge leaking out of their ears when you have gotten off the fat that exists on the two top ris you have got the whole bank to deal with now you have to be genius to find some fat to get off the case and the case is more likely to get arc broken from the aspect of cleaning cleans this makes you very good auditor what happens when someone is in the position of doing r4 they are probably somewhat trained by now but they will need more training the surest way to get to be ot is to be highly trained auditor for various reasons including the aplomb that it takes to confront the bank case is on its way to ot when the first gpm has been run out this can take up to two years after finding the first not necessarily the most recent goal running out that first top gpm is more hell for the pc than anything the thetan has thought of confronting and this is true for several reasons the state of the technology the hazards of the auditing possible errors previous errors the lack of the pcs perception of the pt gpm because of its pt restimulators etc etc raw meat not understanding what is happening wont put up with it they cant confront it even though goal is an incorrect goal it could be that only its position is incorrect not its wording you can get wrong items wrong line plot for an implant gpm without turning off the rocket read but if you take an actual gpm and try to run it on an implant pattern it turns off the rocket read right now and it turns off any other meter phenomena as well there is another horrible datum an actual goal invalidated will now behave like wrong goal it will turn on the same creaks as really wrong goal the pc will arc break the same way it will read as wrong goal it will turn off arc breaks when indicated and so forth so now after you do case analysis prepcheck everything found so that you dont discard an actual goal it is possible that wrong goal sufficiently asserted and validated might behave like right goal one thing will still be the case any actually wrong goal or an actual goal run as an implant goal will turn off the rocket read within two or three items this saves you from running wrong goal you wont have any rocket read to run it with what is dangerous is that an actual goal thoroughly invalidated will be consistently discarded by the auditor he and the pc agree that to spit is wrong goal and they continue looking for the next gpm in line or the pt gpm but they will never find it many are called and few ever hit the top of the bank these are the sorts of errors that can occur and that make r4 hell for pc and auditor nothing will make it easier because that is happening with all the data the besttrained auditor and the most educated pcs r4 takes high degree of skill compounded with phenomenal degree of luck with hindsight one can see how things got off the track but as one proceeds one is walking in the dark with thousandth of millimeter peephole what takes time in r4 is the mistake the worse r4 goes the harder it gets for the pc and the auditor to see what is the true state of affairs however dont put attention on not making mistakes because the effort not to make mistakes will produce mistakes directly and indirectly most of the auditing time is consumed in handling mistakes and most of the mistakes you make are in trying not to make mistakes anything that can make meter go out or any condition that can get you an erroneous read is then susceptible to throwing out case analysis and your own efforts to straighten out case analysis are susceptible to throwing out case analysis and case analysis can be wrong in the first place ok those are the nerves with which you live so the only questions for case analysis and the only points of randomity should be 1 exactly what is happening with this bank that i am handling 2 exactly how is it going together 3 what are the contributive data i have with which to make up my mind about the situations in this bank so you have to have basic auditing and techniques down to the noattention state because there are enough hazards and difficulties in case analysis so that you have attention to spare for anything else the ideal scene with the auditor and the pc is still going to be porcupinejuggling act you should be able to think bank so as to be able to parallel the pcs mind well enough to figure out what is happening with the bank in front of you that is plenty to confront and handle therefore training is vital part of becoming an ot thus in the short run many are called but few are chosen though eventually all can make it by the training route
