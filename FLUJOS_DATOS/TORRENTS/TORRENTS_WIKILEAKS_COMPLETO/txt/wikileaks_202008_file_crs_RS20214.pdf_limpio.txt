grand jury under limited circumstances with court approval citations for th quotations nd statements in this report may be found in crs report 951135 the federal grand jury from which this report has been abridged background the grand jury is an institution of antiquity that dates back to the twelfth century by the american col onial period the grand jury had become both an accuser and protector it was the protector the founders saw when they enshrined the grand jury within the bill of rights and the reason it s been afforded extraordinary inquisitorial powers and exceptional deferencehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20214crs2 the right to grand jury indictment is only constitutionally required in federal cases in majority of the states prosecution may be gin either with an indictment or with an information or complaint filed by the prosecutor although abolition of the right to indictment in the states and abolition of the grand jury itself in england came primarily as matter of judicial economy most of the contemporary calls to change the federal grand jury system are reaction to perceived instances of prosecutorial exuberance organization the federal grand jury enjoys sweeping authority it may begin its examination even in the absence of probable cause or any other level of suspicion that crime has been committed within its reach in the exercise of its jurisdiction the grand jury may investigate merely on suspicion that the law is being violated or even just because it wants assurance that it is not and its inqui ries may be triggered by tips rumors evidence proffered by the prosecutor or the personal knowledge of the grand jurors unrestrained by questions of propriety or forecasts of the probable result of the investigation or by doubts whether any particular individual w ill be found properly subject to an accusation its investigation is not fu lly carried out until every available clue has been run down and all witnesse s examined in every proper way to find if crime has been committed federal grand juries are selected by the court in each federal judicial district federal grand jurors must be citizens of the united states eighteen years of age or older and residents of the judicial district for at leas t year be able to read write and understand english with sufficient proficiency to complete the juror qualification form be able to speak english and be mentally and physically able to serve those charged with or convicted of felony are ineligible discrimination in selection on the basis of race color re ligion sex national origin or economic status is prohibite d and grand jurors must be selected at random from fair cross section of the community in the distri ct or division wherei n the court convenes grand jury panels consist of sixteen to twentythree members sixteen of whom must be present for quorum and twelve of whom must concur to indict they sit until discharged by the court but generally not for longer than 18 months or in the case of some grand juries in the more popul ous districts for 36 months proceedings before the grand jury the grand jury does not conduct its busine ss in open court nor does federal judge preside over its proceedings the grand jury meets behind closed doors with only the jurors attorney for the government witnesse s someone to record testimony and possibly an interpreter present in many cases the government will have already conducted an i nvestigation and the attorney for the government will present evidence in other cases the investigation willhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20214crs3 be incomplete and the grand jury either on its own initiative or at the suggestion of the attorney for the government will investigate the attorney for the government will ordinarily arrange for the appearance of witnesses before the grand jury will suggest the order in wh ich they should be called and will take part in questioning them the prosecutor is the most common source of legal advice and will draft most of the indictments returned by the grand jury grand jury witnesses usually appear befo re the grand jury under subpoena although subpoenas may be issued and serv ed at the request of the pane l itself the attorney for the government ordinarily fills in the blanks on grand jury subpoena and arranges the case to be presented to the grand jury unjustified failure to comply with gr and jury subpoena may result in witness being held in civil contempt convicted for cr iminal contempt or both justifications for failure to comply are limited absent selfincrimination or some other privilege the law expects citizens to cooperate w ith efforts to investigate crime even when armed with an applicable privilege witness compliance w ith grand jury subpoena is only likely to be excused with respect to matters protected by the privilege witness subpoenaed to testify rather than merely produce documents is compelled to appear before the grand jury and claim the privilege with respect to any questions to which it applies grand jury subpoenas are subject to rule that the grand jury may not itself violate valid privilege whether established by th constitution statutes or the common law matters that might be cons idered privileged under other circumstances are not always recognized as privileged before the grand jury some privileges like doctorpatient have been refused recognition some like journalis tsource have been recognized for limited purposes that may or may not provide the basis for motion to quash grand jury subpoena and some like attorney client have been recognized as evidentiary privileges for grand jury purposes the shadow of the fourth amendment is vi sible in rule 17c of the federal rules of criminal procedure whic h supplies the grounds most often successfully employed to quash grand jury subpoena the court on motion made pr omptly may quash or modify the subpoena if compliance would be unreasonable or oppr essive subpoena is unreasonable or oppressive if 1 it commands the production of things clearly irrelevant to the investigation being pursued 2 it fails to specify the things to be produced with reasonable partic ularity or 3 it is unreasonable in terms of the relative extent of the effort required to comply it is not unreasonable under the fourth amendment nor contrary to the fifth amendment privilege against lfincrimination to subpoena witness to appear before the grand jury in order to furnish voice exemplar handwriting exemplar or to sign consent form authorizing the disclosure of bank records conseque ntly the courts will not quash an otherwise valid subpoena issued for any of those purposes although the fifth amendment privilege against selfincrimination precludes requiring witness to testify at his or her criminal trial it does not confer an absolute right to decline to respond in grand jury i nquiry once before the grand jury witness may decline to present selfincriminating testimony httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20214crs4 secrecy grand jury proceedings are conducted be hind closed doors and the rules cloak matters occurring before the grand jury in s ecrecy violations of grand jury secrecy are punishable as contempt of court the rule s however are not all encompassing grand jury witnesses are free to disclose their testimony while matters occurring before the grand jury are secret the rules do not ordinarily bar disclosure of information because the information might be presented to the grand jury at some time in the future the rule protects the workings of the grand jury not the grist for its mill the fact of disclosure to the grand jury rather than the information disclosed is the object of protection the rules specifically permit government attorneys who acquire information while assisting grand jury to disclose it to government attorneys and employees assisting in the criminal process which is the focus of the grand jurys inquiry they allow disclosure of foreign intelligence information to government officers and employees they also permit the court to authorize di sclosure 1 preliminary to or in connection with judicial proceeding 2 upon defendants request showing grounds may exist for motion to dismiss the indictment because of matters occurring before the grand jury 3 to second grand jury and 4 to state enforcem ent authorities limite d disclosure may also be possible under separate stat utory or common law authority final grand jury action there are four possible outcomes of conveni ng grand jury 1 indictment 2 vote not to indict to find bill or true bill or to endorse the indictment ignoramus 3 discharge or expiration w ithout any action 4 submission of report to the court in an indictment the grand jury accuses designated person with specific crime it contains plain concise and definite written statement of the essential facts constituting the offense charged and bears the signature of the attorney for the government and of the grand jury forepe rson an indictment 1 must contain statement of the essential facts constituting the offense charged 2 it must contain allegations of each element of the offense charged so that the defendant is given fair notice of the charge that he must defend and 3 its allegations must be sufficiently distinctive so that an acqu ittal or conviction on such charges can be pleaded to bar second prosecution for the same offense every defendant to be tried for federal capital or otherwise infamous crime has constitutional right to demand that the process begin only after the concurrence of twelve of his or her fellow citizens reflected in an indictment it is right however which the defendant may waive in noncapital cases misdemeanors may but need not be tried by indictment the grand jury may indict only upon the vot of twelve of its members and upon its conclusion that there is probable cause to believe that the accused committed the crime chargedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20214crs5 defendants have urged dismissal of thei r indictments based upon wide array of alleged grand jury irregularities they are rarely successful the irregularities which warrant dismissal are few and the obstacles which must be overcome to establish them substantial the courts are most hospitable to dis missal motions predicated upon constitutional violations thus indictments returned by grand jury panels whose selection has been tainted by racial or sexual discrimination will be dismissed the courts will likewise dismiss indictments which char ge defendant on basis of his or her immunized testimony taken pursuant to an order entered in lieu of his or her fifth amendment self incrimination privilege which are defective for failure to state an offense contrary to the fifth amendment right of indictment before trial for felony which are tainted by violations of the speech or debate privilege or which are based solely on evidence secured in violation of the fourth amendment they will also dismiss indictments in the name of due process where the prosecution sought indictment selectively for constitutionally impermissible reasons or for reasons of vindictive retaliation where the prosecu tion has secured the indictment through outrageous conduct which shocks the conscien ce of the court where the prosecution has unjustifiably delayed seeking an indictment to the detriment of the defendant where the government knowingly secures the indictme nt through the presentation of false or perjured testimony or where witness is called before the grand jury for the sole purpose of building perjury prosecution against the witness in the absence of one of these rarely found causes for constitutional challenge facially valid indictment returned by legally constituted grand jury is almost uniformly immune from dismissal the supervisory pow er of the courts can be used to dismiss an indictment because of conduct before the grand jury at least where the misconduct amounts to violation of one of those few clear rules which were carefully drafted and approved by this court and by congress to ensure the integrity of the grand jury functions the supervisory authority to dismiss an indictment however is only appropriately exercised where it is established that the violations substantially influenced the grand jurys decision to indict or if there is grave doubt that the decision was free from such substantial influence if the error is harmless the indictment will not be dismissed district court may not dismiss an indictment for errors in grand jury proceedings unless such errors prejudiced the defendants timing is also important after trial jury has found sufficient evidence to convict defenda nt claim of prejudice based on grand jury irregularities may lose much of its force in addition to dismissal of the indictment at the request of the accused the government may move for dismissal of the indictment although the rule requires leave of court prosecutorial discretion is ve sted in the executive and the court cannot effectively compel prosecution the authority of the courts to deny dismissal is therefore limited to instances where dismissal would be clearly contrary to manifest public interest in most instances dismissal is without prejudice to the government and the prosecutor may seek to reindict for the same offense as long as neither the statute of limitations nor the double jeopardy clause pose barhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20214crs6 the decision to indict rests with the grand jury it may indict in the face of probable cause but it need not it cannot be required to indict nor punished for failing to do so on the other hand the prosecution is free to res ubmit matter for recons ideration by the same grand jury or by subsequent panel and gr and jury panel is free to reexamine matter notwithstanding the prior results of its ow n deliberations or t hose of another panel the law regarding the last alternative available to the grand jury the authority to send forward reports or prese ntments is somewhat obscure it is clear that in the limited case of the special grand juries in popul ous districts the grand jury has statutory authority to report on organized crime most federal grand jury pa nels however have express authority to issue reports they nevertheless appear to have common law authority to prepare reports at least under some circumstances the district court which empane led the grand jury receives such communications and enjoys the discretion to determine the extent to which the reports should be sealed expunged or disclo sed some of the factors considered in making that determination include whether the report describes general community conditions or whether it refers to identifia ble individuals whether the individuals are mentioned in public or private capacities the public interest in the contents of the report balanced against the harm to the individu als named the availability and efficacy of remedies whether the conduct scribed is indictable nd whether the report intrudes upon the prerogatives of state and local governments the court has the power to discharge grand jury panel at any time within its term for any reason it sees fit the courts author ity to discharge pane l quash its subpoenas seal or expunge its reports or dismiss its i ndictments afford check on runaway grand jury panels
