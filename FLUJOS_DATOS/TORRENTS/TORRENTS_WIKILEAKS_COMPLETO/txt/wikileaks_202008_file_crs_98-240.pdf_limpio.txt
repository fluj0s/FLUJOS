fought iraq in the gulf wa r may not file claims through the process unless they were taken prisoner and mistreated by iraq in addition the costs of allied militar operations against iraq cannot be

increase in iraqi oil sales to 525 billion every5 six months and thus an increase in compensation funds generated the uncc has acknowledged that the compensation process has been slow an d might take many years to finally reso lve uncc officials have set goal of processing all claims by 2003 in late 1996 corporate claimants about 82 bi llion in total claims began to receive awards in december 1996 kuwait petroleum corp oration was awarded 610 million to settle 950 million claim for extinguishing 800 oil well fires set by retreating iraqi troops in 1991 in apr il 1999 israeli firms and

us claims about 3200 in all categories have an asserted3 value of abo ut 17 billion among us corporate claims the bechtel corp of sa n francisco has filed claim for losses incurred when the gulf crisis despoiled the bekhme dam project in northeastern iraq that it was managing in late june 1999 several us firms received awards including saudi arabian texaco 506 million and oilservice firm halliburton 18 million the us government seeks 88 million in compensation for the eight us departments that contributed scientific or technical help to the gul f environmental cleanup4 fund ing for compensation the large number of unresolved claims and th limited funds available for compensation have raised questions about the future of th uncc process as noted above compensation and the unccs operating budget ar funded by iraqi oil revenues at current oil export capabilities of about 10 billion per year iraq can generate only about 3 billion annually for compensation even if only a5 fraction of claims filed result in awards or if sanctions on iraq were completely lifted it might take several decades for iraq to generate sufficient revenues to pay the awards the compensation mathematics have led some obse rvers to speculate that the uncc process will terminate short of completion if iraqs leadership changes before th compensat ion process is completed and at some point iraq rejoins the internationa l communit iraqs reintegration will almost certainly spur calls in the internationa l community to terminate the process and ask claimants to abrogate their claims on th other hand some countries such as germany continued to make compensation payments even though they had rejoined the international community some observers believe the united states should offer an end to the reparations process as an incentive to iraqis who are willing to overthrow saddam husayn and comply with all applicable gulf war related resolutions opposition by some security council members

temporarily suspen d compensation deductions with the proceeds to go toward increased humanitarian relief iraq also has succeeded in persuading some international firms to drop claims before the uncc in exchange for contracts with iraq under the oilforfood program 6 claims against iraqi frozen assets some us claims against iraq arose before the iraqi invasion of kuwait and ar ineligible for consideratio n under the uncc process to try to resolve these claims the bush and clinton administrations have proposed plan to seize and distribute to us claimants the approximately 22 billion in iraqi assets blocked in us financia l7 institutions and their foreign branches in cases such as this us claims usually ar settled in the context of reconciliation with the country at issue bush and clinto n administra tion officials have determined that in the case of iraq the prospects fo r reconciliation are so limited that the united states should resolve the claims dispute s unilaterally the iraqi assets in question were blocked pursuant to president bushs executive orders 12722 and 12724 of august 2 and august 9 1990 respectively since the gulf war some licenses have been issued to use some of the frozen assets to pay us companies who exported goods to iraq prior to the iraqi inv asion under confirmed letters of credit these funds were judged by the office of foreign assets control ofac department of treasury to be the property of the us exporter and not iraqi funds about 3 billion more remain frozen in foreign banks around the world and remai n blocked by their host countries

commission is maintaining registry f us claimants in anticipation that an iraq claims process will be enacted by congress congressional debate the limited assets available relative to total claims s created deba in congress over claimant priorities congress has thus far been unable to resolve that debate and bush and clinton administration claims p roposals have not been enacted in october 1992 the bush administration submitted to congress draft bill entitled the iraq claims act of 1992 that would have seized iraqi assets and established claims adjudication process under the foreign claims set tlement commission the draft bill suggested that priority be given to nonc ommercial claims from members of the armed forces including crewmen of the uss stark and other claims arising from iraq s invasion of kuwait the house and senate introduced versions hr 3221 s1401 of the iraq claims legislation in mid1993 despite substantial debate over which categories of claimants to assign priority to the house passed the legislation in much the same form as th administration draft bill on april 28 1994 however s1401 did not reach the senate floor because of opposition from some s enators who wanted to give priority to corporate claimants exporting to iraq under advised letters of credit version of the legislation that gave priority to all categories of corporate claimants was contained in the conferenc report on the fy1996 foreign aid authorization bill hr 1561 that bill was vetoe d because of other issues in the first session of the 105 congress iraq claims legi slation was incorporated intoth the senate version of hr 1757 the foreign relations authorization act for fy199899 the provision drew opposition from veterans groups because it excluded gulf wa r veterans from the claimant pool on october 1 1997 the house passed motion t instruct its conferees on the bill to strike the senate provision because of that exclusion supporters of the provision maintained that gulf war veterans had other recourse such as veterans affairs programs to be treated for injuries related to the gulf war and tha t there is n tradition of us servicemen and their families suing us adversary for war losses the legislation conta ining this provision was not enacted in the 106 congressth rep lloyd doggett introduced hr 618 the gul f war veterans claims protection act of 1999 the
