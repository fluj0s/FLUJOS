the 108th congress summary trade remedies are government measures to minimize the adverse impact of imports on domestic industries antidumping duties are used to counter the effects of imports sold at unfairly low prices on the domestic market countervailing duties are used to counter the price effects of imports that be nefit from government subsidies in the exporting countries sa feguard remedies also called section 201 and escape clause remedies are used to redu ce the injurious impact of surges in fairly trade imports some of the bills introduced in the 108th congress would revise safeguard remedies others would change antidumpi ng and countervailingduty remedies the congressional proposals follow di fferent approaches to the same goal to ease the procedural burden in obtaini ng relief and improve the ch ances that us industries would obtain relief in so doing the gislation would make it less likely that industries would press congre ss to directly restrict im ports through protectionist legislation the 106th congress did pass one change to us trade remedy law the socalled byrd amendment the 107th congress did not act on trade remedy legislation but treatment of trade remedy laws in trade negotiations was major point of contention during the debate over legislation to gran t the president trade promotion authority several bills that would amend us trade remedy laws have been introduced in the 108th congress trade remedy legislation is largely suppor ted by those industries such as steel that are most sensitive to foreign comp etition the legislation is generally opposed by those industries and groups that use impor ts as inputs or consume them as final products increased trade relief would likely result in higher prices to these latter groups this report will

to counter the effects of unfair foreign trade practices such as foreign government subsidies or dumping that is selling an import below its fair market value remedies might also be applied to reduce the impact of surges in fa irlytraded imports while having some antecedents in earlier us law trade reme dies largely came into use when the united states and other economica lly developed countries gaged in bilateral and multilateral negotiations to re duce tariff and nontariff trad barriers policymakers consider trade remedies tool to cushion the adverse impact of trade liberalization on importsensitive industries nd in so doing to build political consensus for trade agreements and open trade the constitution assigns primary respons ibility for regulating trade to the congress but the congress over time has delegated for specified periods of time much of the authority to the executive branch but continues to shape us trade policy by passing new trade laws or amending old ones at times congress has responded to trade crises by proposing nd sometimes enacting changes in the trade remedy laws or new laws increasingly u s trade partners have challenged in the world trade organization wto actions th at the us government has taken under its trade remedy laws and have even challenged the validity of the laws themselves in some cases the wto has ruled against the united states ruling that the united states must repeal the laws or else face sanctions since repeal would require congressional action these cases have beco the subject of congressional debate and legislation the report examines us trade remedy programs it also analyzes the legislative proposals pending in the 108th congress and their potential implications what are trade remedies and how do they work us law provides for range of administrative measures to reduce the adverse effects of foreign trade po licies and practices on us industries three forms of relief safeguards antidumping and c ountervailing duty remedies have been the subjects of recent legislation and are the subject of the report1 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30461crs2 1 continued jobs because of imports coming into the united states as result of the north american free trade agreement naftathe department of commerce operates trade adjustment assistance program for firms section 337 of the tariff act of 1930 as amended gives authority to the us international trade co mmission to issue an excl usion order andor ceaseanddesist order against imports that it has determined are sold in the united states through unlawful methods of competition or sa or the products of intellectual property rights infringements section 406 of the trade act of 1974 provides for remedies against imports from communist countries that cause ma rket disruption it is provision that is similar to but more restrictive than the safe guard remedies sections 301310 of the trade act of 1974 as amended often more simply called section 301 give authority to the united states trade representative to act against fore ign unfair trade practices it is most used against practices that violate us rights under trade agreements or inhibit us exports and foreign investments 2 19 usc 22512254 3 19 usc 16731673h 4 19 usc 16711671htrade remedies overview safeguard also referred to as escape clause and section 201 relief provides for temporary duties quotas or other restricti ons on imports that are traded fairly but cause or threaten to cause serious injury to domestic industry the relief is intended to give the domestic industry the opportunity to adjust to the new competition and remain competitive the authority for the safeguard relief is found in sections 201 204 of the trade act of 1974 as amended2 antidumping ad is relief to remedy the adverse price impact of imports sold on the us market at less than fair value the relief is in the form of extra duties on the dumped imports the authority fo r ad relief is found in sections 731739 of the tariff act of 1930 as amended3 countervailing duty cvd is relief from the adverse price impact of imports that receive foreign government subsidies the relief is in the form of extra duties on those imports the authority for cvd re lief is found in sec tions 701709 of the tariff act of 1930 as amended4 objectives of trade remedies the three programs are designed to level the playing field for adversely affected industries in the face of unfair fo reign competition or rapidly increasing fair foreign competition specifically ad and cvd relief eliminates the price advantages that foreign competitors attain through unfair trade practices the rationale underlying safeguard relief is that while the bene fits of trade liberalization are distributed throughout national economy the adverse effects loss of profits worker layoffs firm and plant closures are concentrated in specific import sensitive industries safeguard relief is designed to give the injured industry the opportunity to adjust minimizing the destabilizing effects of trade httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30461crs3 5 see for example lawrence robert z and robert litan saving free trade pragmatic approach the brookings institution washington 1986 p 25 6 destler im american trade politics institute for international economics and the twentieth century fund second edition june 1992 p 172 7 for the sake of brevity this description provides the highlights of the complex process for more information see united states international trade commission summary of statutory provisions related to import relief usitc publication 2944 january 1996 in addition to these economic arguments many trade specialists have argued that trade remedies are means by which the united states has been able respond to the concerns of the advers ely affected sectors of th economy and achieve domestic political consensus on trade liberalization without these remedies they argue the congress would not have approved major agreements such as the general agreement on tariffs and trade gatt and the wto that became the foundation for the postwar international trading system5 economics of trade remedies many economists assert on the other hand that while trade remedies may assist injured industries they do so at cost to the economy as whole they argue that whether imposed to mitigate the negative effect s of unfair trade or fair trade trade remedies lead to higher costs to consumers from this perspective higher costs reduce the real income and therefore the st andard of living of american consumers trade remedies can also dversely affect us domes tic industries especially those that rely on imports as inputs in production in 1991 for example major us computer manufacturers objected when us manufacturer of flatpanel screen displays won an ad case against japanese display manufacturers japanesemade computer displays dominated the us market the us computer manufacturers argued that the higher production co sts resulting from the ad duties made it unprofitable for them to manufacture in the united states and forced them to move production abroad6 eligibility criteria and procedures for ad and cvd7 us trade remedy statutes and oblig ations under the world trade organization agreement require that an investigation be conducted of the re levant circumstances surrounding the trade remedy petitions for the investigation the petitioning industry must provide information and unde rtake certain measures the government must adhere to specific criteria and procedures for ad cases and most cvd cases industries must go through multistage investigation conducte d by the department of commerce doc and the us in ternational trade commission itc the process begins when an industry union or other representative group of the industry files relevant petitions with the office of import administration of the doc and with the itc the doc may so initiate an inve stigation successful completion of the process is contingent on four affirmative decisions the itc makes preliminary determination whether there is reasonable indication thathttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30461crs4 8 in cvd cases the injury test and therefor itc participation is required only if the country against which the us industry is bringing petition is member of the wto which includes most trading partners or is nonmember country which is entitled to mfn treatment under an agreement or has assume d equivalent obligations otherwise only final determination by the doc of the existe nce of subsidy is required for the assessment of the countervailing dutyimports in question are causing or threaten to cause material injury to the industry8 an affirmative decision allows the inves tigation to continue negative decision terminates the investigation the doc then must make preliminary determination whether dumping or subsidies have taken place and if so make pre liminary calculation of what the dumping or subsidy margin would be regardless of whether the docs determination is positive or negative the doc continues the investigation and makes final determination of dumpi ng or subsidies and fina l calculation of duty margins the investigation is terminated if doc ma kes negative final termination if the doc makes an affirmative final dete rmination then the itc continues its investigation and renders final determination of material injury or threat thereof negative itc determination terminates the investigation if the two final determinations are affirmative then extra duties are placed on imports to be paid by the importer the determinations are subject to judicial review both the doc and the itc must take into account number of criteria in making their respective determinations in cvd cases the doc must consider evidence of direct subsidies or upstream subsidies subsidies provided to inputs the benefits of which are passe d on to the final producer and if found what would be the net countervailable subsidy in ad cas the doc must first determine the normal value of the import based on th price in the exporting countrys home market on the price of the export of the product to third country market or on constructed price depending on the availability of data the doc must compare the normal value with the actual price of the import in question to determine whether dumping is taking place and if s what the dumping margin is in either procedure the itc must make two determinations 1 is the domestic industry being materially injured or facing threat of material injury 2 are the imports in question cause of the material injury us law establishes deadlines under which the respective agencies must make their determinations eligibility criteria and pro cedures for safeguard relief the process for safeguard relief begi ns when itc receives petition from representatives of an industry firms asso ciation unions etc alleging that imports of like product as produced by the industry ve surged at such rate as to be substantial cause of serious injury or the threat thereof the itc may also initiate an investigation on its own accord or as result of request from the president the united states trade representative ustr the senate finance committee or the house ways and means committeehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30461crs5 9 bhala raj and kevin kennedy worl d trade law lexis law publishing charlottesville va 1998 p 882883 in the meantime us law encourages the domestic industry to submit plan stipulating how it would use the relief if granted to make adjustments to become more competitive in conducting its inves tigation the itc must consider the state of the domestic industry including number of factors listed in the statute if the itc determines in the affirmative it recommends appropriate remedial measures which must be an increase in tariffs on that product tariffrate quota quantitative restriction trade adjustment assi stance or combination thereof the itc submits its recommendation to the president who must decide whether to take the recommended action an alternative action or action at all in making his decision the president must consider number of factors including the industrys adjustment plan if submitted the probable effectiveness of remedial action to promote adjustment the national economic interest and the national security interest us law requires the itc to make its respective determinations within specified deadlines the president must report to congress on the action he will take if he decides to take action other than that recommende d by the itc or to take action the congress may direct him to implement the remedy recommended by the itc by enacting joint resolution of di sapproval of his proposed action comparison of injury thresholds and procedures procedures and injury thresholds applie d in safeguard determinations are higher and stricter than in the those applied in ad and cvd cases the former require that the imports be substantial cause or threat of serious injury substantial cause is defined in law as cause which is important and not less than any other cause serious injury is one that is significant overall impairment to the position of the domestic industry ad and c vd statutes require the termination of material injury defined as injury which is not inconsequential immaterial or unimportant and ad and cvd statutes require that th injury occur by reason of the dumped or subsidized imports less precise nd lower causation threshold than under the safeguard statute9 in addition to stricter causation and inju ry standards safegu ard relief requires that final decisions be made at higher policy level the president than in the ad and cvd in addition the president s wide discretion as to which safeguard relief to implement including taking action on the other hand discretion exists in cvd and ad cases relief as determined by the doc is implemented by doc antidumping or countervailing duty order without presid ential involvement the higher injury thresholds and more demanding procedures for safeguard relief reflect the fact the procedures involve fairly traded imports from all sources in addition the impact on overall us nationa l interests would likely be greater than in the case of ad and cvd determinations

general agreement on tariffs and trade gatt which was negotiated during the tokyo round negotiations and went into effect in 1979the stricter standards and procedures are probably significant reason why us industries have used and received re lief much more often from ad and cvd programs than safeguard betw een 1984 and 2002 397 ad cases and 120 cvd cases resulted in relief10 whereas during the same period seven safeguard cases resulted in relief11 the most recent case was pres ident bushs imposition of higher tariffs on the import of certain steel products12 the higher standards for section 201 have also led to criticisms that us safeguard relief does not meet the needs of us importsensitive industries and ther efore must be reformed changes in trade remedy laws the congress has amended us trade remedy statutes over the years largely in response to industry concerns that the remedy procedures were not adequately meeting their needs in general cong ress has amended criteria for determining injury which made it more likely that determinations would be made in favor of the petitioning industry and s shortened the timeframes for agencies to make determinations13 the congress has comprehensiv ely amended trade remedy laws most recently with legislation to imple ment the uruguay round agreements under the general agreement on tariffs and trade14 specifically the amendments brought us laws into conformity with the multilateral wto agreements on antidumping subsidiescountervailing and safeguard procedures us international obligations ad cvd and safeguard remedies reflect

the subsidized imports are from another wto membercountry the agreemen t also prohibits certain subsidies and allows others and defines subsidies that are counterva ilable in addition the agreement provides for adjudication of cvd disputes between wto members similarly the united states and other wto members must adhere to the uruguay round antidumping agreement which blishes procedures for implementing national antidumping programs including determinations of dumping and material injury or the threat thereof16 article xix of the general agreement on tariffs and trade 1994 lays out the basic conditions under which wto member can apply safeguards remedies the uruguay round negotiations resulted in an ex pansion of article xix by stipulating among other things sunset requirements for member safeguard actions already in effect time limits on new safeguard actions and criteria for determining serious injury before the enactment of the ur uguay round agreements member countries that were the targets of safeguard acti ons could seek compensation from the country taking the action under the safeguards agreement such compensation is delayed for three years the united states also has

more than three years chapter 19 allows for cvd and ad final determinations involving another members goods to be review ed by binational panel instead of in domestic court number of trading partners including japan korea chile and brazil have criticized us use of its trade remedy laws especially ad as not fully in line with wto rules they argued that review of membercountry trade remedy practices and policies should be on the agenda of th forthcoming wto round of negotiations the united states resisted this demand and many members of congress opposed it however in november 2001 at the wto

reform proposals hr 2365 english the trade reform act of 2003 would make changes in number of us trade remedy laws includi ng the section 201 safeguard law among other things hr 2365 revises to the causal linkage that must be established between surge in imports and serious injury us importsensitive industries and other critics of trade remedy laws have argued that the significant cause linkage to injury that domestic industries must establish is too difficult and diminishes its utility hr 2365 would lower the causal threshold to require that import surges be only cause of injury to us domestic industr supporters have asserted the change would bring the us the causation threshol d in line with that required by the wto although such conclusion would likely be subject to legal interpretation of wto rules in practical terms the new thre shold would mean that an investigation would have to find only that imports have contributed to injury not that they are cause which is important and not less th at any other cause in addition under current us safeguar d statutes the itc must consider number of factors when determining whether an industry faces serious injury or the threat of serious injury regarding serous injury the itc must examine whether there has been significant idling of pr oductive facilities in the industry there has been significant number of firms to opera at reasonable profit and there has been significant level of unemployment or underemployment in the industry hr 2365 would require additional f actors be considered includi ng changes in the level of sales and production chan ges in productivity changes in capacity utilization changes in profits and losses and changes in employment levels furthermore under current law the itc must consider number of factors in determining whether surge in imports has been the cause of serious injury including whether imports have increased either absolutely or relative to domestic production and whether the share of the dom estic market supplied by imports has increased hr 2635 would require the itc to consider in addition the rate and timing of the increase in imports especially if the increase has been over short period of time current law permits provisional relief be provided under critical circumstances that is when failure to take expedited action would do irreparable injury to an industry hr 2365 would require the itc to make determination whether critical circ umstances exist within 45 days of receiving the petition cvd and ad reform proposals several bills have been introduced in the 108th congress that would change us antidumping or countervailing duty laws s 136 lincolnhr 2092 berry would authorize an expedited antidumping investigation to take place if imports

implications of trade remedy reform and alternative options at this time it is difficult to determined what impact the byrd amendment will have although it has alr eady proved controversial trade remedy legislation generally ignites debate over the direction of us trade policy trade remedy legislation is largely supported by those industries such as steel that are most sensitive to foreign competition the legisla tion is often opposed by those industries and groups that are users of imports as inputs or consumers of final products increased trade relief would likely resu lt in higher prices to these groups changes in trade remedy laws could ve an impact on us relations with its major trade partners who might challenge the legality of some changes in us trade remedy laws under the wto along with their challenge of the byrd amendment the european union and japan are challe nging other us antidumping laws and practices in the wto in 1999 the two trad ing partners filed disputes regarding the us antidumping act of 1916 law which allows us firms to sue foreign companies in us court over dumping of imports and to collect damages if dumping is found they claimed it violates th wto antidumping agreement the wto upheld their claim with the united states in mind the eu ropean union and japan are advocating review of the antidumping practices of wto members as part of the agenda for new round of wto negotiations the united states opposes this position amending us trade remedy statutes is one option available to congress to cushion the impact of import competition on american industries some trade specialists have suggested for example that the federally funded trade adjustment assistance taa programs could be refo rmed and made more effective taa programs are available for workers throug h the department of labor and for firms through the department of commerce they provide funds for training and other adjustment measures to those who can demonstrate an adverse impact from imports many economists prefer this option over trade restrictive remedies because its directs assistance to those most affected and doe s so without distorting prices but taa programs as currently designed and administered have been criticized by labor advocacy groups as ineffective in respondi ng to workers needs in globalizing economy the congress might also require the president to halt or quantitatively restrict imports such measure would resolve the immediate problem of adverse effects on the importsensitive workers and firms nd have been proposed and in some cases enacted in the past but they would very likely be challenged by other wto members as violating wto rules they would also reduce competitive pressures on us industryies which might encourage inefficiency higher costs and decline in the general economic welfare
