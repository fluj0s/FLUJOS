primarily latino gang ms3 has recently been reported as expanding its influence throughout the united states oregon alaska and california are all listed as areas of operation for ms13 by geographical analysis alone this constitutes threat to washington state however washington state demographics include an exceptionally large latino population heavily concentrated in the yakima region ms13 members have been known to specifically target police officers officers should be aware that members may not b deterred by the uniform they may be encouraged to assault or kill extreme caution is advised when encounteringconfronting potential member threat points ofinterest ms3 announces its arrival through violence against rival gang members including murder rape and assault members are heavily recruited from middle schools and high schools ms13 members are often tattooed with the gangs symbols ms3 funds its operations through activities including car theft armed robberies drug sales firearm sales and homeinvasions awareness and prevention police should be aware of any dramatic increases in levels of criminal activities as ms13 announces its arrival via violence when obtaining witness accounts or video evidence note any descriptions which include latinos wearing bluewhite jerseys or bandannas note any tattoos which reflect the attached symbols ofms13 informing the population of the high risk will increase awareness and counteract terrorism created by the gang amongst the population once ms3 has established itself in community the community is afraid to tell police about ms13 activities and members by alerting the population before they are established ms3 may find greater resistance and police awareness as they attempt to bolster membership and fear school should be afforded greater concentrated efforts as ms13 recruits its members by offering skip parties drugs sex and alcohol school officials should be informed regarding the increase in gang activity and be on the lookout for students discussing ms13 activities students suddenly found to be truant should be questioned specifically if possible members are also often beaten into the gang as such students who appear to have unexplained injuriesfbruises should be questioned or their parents notified ms13 gang members conduct surveillance of targets and areas with potential for criminal activities police officers and the public should be on the lookout for personnel matching the profile discussed above conducting suspicious surveillance activities ie searchingrecording the location of security cameras inquiring as to the presencefrequency of police patrols etc potential terrorism applications ms13 is associated with trafficking both weapons and drugs across the mexican border washington state shares border with canada and as slch is prone to similar illegal cross border activities as ms13 moves in with the skills and knowledge already acquired from their activities along the mexican border as ms13 bring larger amounts of weapons and drugs into the area crime and terrorist organizations may take advantage of the gangs activities as middle man for acquiring weapons for terrorist activities in the washington state area to prevent detection of their own operations this is especially possible as gang members become more successful in an area ms13 as gang is currently small scale terrorist group instilling fear in the public and showing aggression towards the community just as terrorist organization does priority intelligence requirements 10 is ms13 operating in washington state lj are

within our air force special operations group during his time working for he served in many capacities briefing commanders training software applications as first line supervisor and countless other duties i relied on james to train my new troops and further the training of my older analysts he built training program for our primary aviationplanning software suite james was able to show how to overlay multiple data streams to build coherent analytical tool that our analysts and crews could use in training and while flying combat missions in southwest asia to do this he had to use multiple software applications and intranets to build his coursework we still use his lessons as our benchmark for computer based training james also took on the challenge to organize three day africa course for our group as whole he was able to fmd college professor to teach the course james then coordinated across our air force base to arrange facilities video taping services attendance from multiple organizations etc in three days james was able to get over 40 people the equivalent of approximately 2 credit hours of undergraduate training on our groups primary area of responsibility the course was huge success and he was personally thanked by our group commander for his efforts james was one of my front line supervisors who were responsible for every aspect of his young troops work he trained them up to be combat mission ready and pushed them to excel he was very successful and as result many of his troops won awards across our squadron james was also able to deal with my most difficult troop the young man ran into trouble with the authorities james maturity and professionalism helped tremendously as i had to separate james young charge from the military james is the total package technical skills analytical ability academic interest managerial and people skills i relied heavily on james for my organization to complete our highly classified and worldwide mission james was able to meet every challenge that i handed him for the bottom line is that if i owned my own business id hire james because he makes great things happen if you would like to contact to further discuss jamess qualifications and capabilities please contact at craigmillermildenhallafmil if you would prefer to talk via jhone please email and we can set up time to talk im currently deployed to

with james for three years while he was assigned to the 352d special operations group he always displayed high degree of integrity responsibility and professionalism and is definitely leader rather than follower james possesses excellent office and administrative skills necessary to administer project while motivating his coworkers to excel the intelligence he developed using multiple classified networks for five unit commanders and over 1000 personnel was accurate concise and delivered ahead of schedule his good judgment and mature outlook ensured practical solutions to complex problems in just one example saving over 5000 in operational funds unique individual with positive attitude he smoothly executed such diverse responsibilities as writing employee performance reports tracking deployment expenses training new analysts and managing equipment inventories with almost oversight or direction necessary he was recognized for demonstrated superior performance that ensured successful accomplishment of special operations missions on two continents james would be an asset to any organization and i am happy to give him my wholehearted endorsement sincerely douglas strouth

have had the distinct pleasure of knowing james ward for over two years james and i served in the usaf together while we were assigned to the 352 special operations group at raf mildenhall united kingdom when james worked for he was responsible for briefing the group commander on the current intelligence within the european and african areas of responsibilities additionally he was responsible for ensuring intelligence information flowed to our subordinate units utilizing various intelligence and telecommunication systems as james supervisor i had first hand experience witnessing almost all of his distinct skills by far he was the best briefer that i have seen his ability to capture rooms attention when giving brief is mesmerizing this was confirmed by our commanders and other supervisors the commanders would praise his briefing skills and performance over and over again furthermore i saw the sacrifices he made and diligent work that he put in leading up to the briefs he would come in at 430 in the morning to update the brief and make sure the commander had the most current intelligence another example of james dedication when james got to the unit he found that one really had good way to convey the important topics of africa to the new personnel additionally he realized he didnt understand africa as well as he needed to for the job james went out and meticulously researched crafted and edited presentation on the important and significant parts of africa not only did he research this information so he could learn he then made sure to prepare and present it in format that others could learn from this presentation is so good that it is still being used even after he has left the unit to educate dozens of new personnel furthermore james ward is the most knowledgeable person i know when it comes to ms powerpoint and other ms office products he could create presentation in half the time as most of his colleagues sometimes he would finish his work and then take time to help others with their products however this is not the essentially unique aspect of james what sets james above the rest is his ability to learn quickly and teach himself when necessary if james does not understand or know something he will research it find the answer train himself and then prepare materials to train others so that he can share what he learned this trait of sharing his knowledge is very characteristic of james and important in fostering good and developing work environment james was also one of the best supervisorsleaders i have met james was the epitome of af leadership when he led his subordinates he made sure that everything his subordinate needed to accomplish the mission was there for him he paid more attention to his subordinates needs then his own personal needs ifit wasnt available james made sure to inunediately go out and get it so that the mission could be accomplished james concern over his subordinates first exemplifies the usaf core value of service before self james ward will make great addition to your workforce andor company while at the 352 sog he was major contributor and the entire leadership sorely misses him and his expertise whatever employer takes him on next will be gaining key asset to their business that will have the opportunity to grow with him david amar capt usaf dod human spaceflight payload

being james instructor for introduction to psychology he is one of the best students i have taught demonstrating excellent understanding of the concepts presented in class strong motivation to do his best in all things and clear empathy for other people while i can not speak directly to his abilities related to computer skills and accounting abilities i have doubt that he will be dedicated to his work motivated to do his best and responsible in all decisions that need to be made james demonstrated willingness to learn new things and challenged himself in all areas that i generally do not see in the average student james also never backeddown from challenge and always demonstrated important critical thinking skills when evaluating class assignment or lecture topic in addition james ability to understand and apply what he has learned is in the top 10 of all students i have taught lastly james easy marmer and happy demeanor made him an enjoyable student to have in class in conclusion i

degrees i was actually looking for more explanation of his experience and expertise which resulted in the evaluators considering him better qualified than others we need as much information as you can provide thanks answer this is the answer that was received in the selection for the position within wajac melton was compared to four other applicants and it was determined that he would be the best fit for that particular position the decision to select him was based on his military experience his proficiency using certain software programs the positions of trust he recently held and his education of the four positions within wajac three are filled by contractors who have retired from law enforcement in king county the evaluators thought it best to select contractor for the final position who has recent military experience and who can provide different analytical insight questioncomment shawn please provide further explanation re mr meltons background and experience that supports the fact that he has strengths in those areas answer mr melton has masters degree in criminal justice from washington state university the rfqq states fouryear or higher college degree in criminal justice law enforcement statistical analysis or related field may be substituted for the work experience requirement his qualifications exceed the minimum qualifications required by the rfqq questioncomment the filing indicates the contract maximum as 79000 but the attached contract document indicates 76000 which is correct if the filing please revise the contract and reattached to pscd if the contract is correct i will change the total in pscd for you httpcontractsofmwagovpscdlfilinglprintfilingsunnnaryaspxmenuselectmnu vp 111232005 page 4 of4 answer both are correct the contract itself excludes travel costs under the maximum contract amount however your office wanted travel costs included in the filed amount we estimated those costs to be 3000 per contractor employee and filed 11 previous contracts at 79000 per contractor employee vs the 76000 per contractor employee on the contractual documents we will do this either way but we thought we would continue in this
