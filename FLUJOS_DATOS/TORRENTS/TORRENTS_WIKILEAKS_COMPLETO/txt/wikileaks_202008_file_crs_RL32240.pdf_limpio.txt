central to the definition and implementation of public policy in the united states regulations generally start with an act of congress and are the means by which statutes are implemented and specific requirements are established the terms rule or regulation are often used interchangeably in discussions of the federal regulatory process the administrative procedure act of 1946 defines rule as the whole or part of an agency statement of general or particular applicability and future effect designed to implement interpret or prescribe law or policy the procedures that federal agencies are required to follow in writing regulations is called the rulemaking process and are the subject of this report during the past 60 to 65 years congress and various presiden ts have developed an elaborate set of procedures and requi rements to guide the federal rulemaking process often with the implic it or explicit goal of reduc ing the amount of regulatory burden placed on the public statutory rulema king requirements applicable to wide range of agencies include the administrative procedure act the regulatory flexibility act the paperw ork reduction act the unf unded mandates reform act and the information quality act these and other crosscutting rulemaking requirements often requi re some type of analysis on the part of the rulemaking agency before issuing covered rule but also often give agencies substantial discretion regarding whether the requirement s are applicable other statutorilybased rulemaking requirements are contained in agency or pr ogramspecific laws which provide varying levels of di scretion regarding the substance of agencies rules and may impose or exclude additional analytical or procedural requirements the most important of the current set of presidential rulemaking requirements are in executive order 12866 which establishes presidential review of c overed agencies rulemaking within the office of management and budg ets office of information and regulatory affairs oira the executive order requires covered agencies to submit their significant rules to oira for review befo re they become final and requires those rules to meet certain minimal standards other executive orders and presidential directives delineate other specific rulema king requirements in cumbent on covered agencies however these requirements so often provide subs tantial discretion to agencies regarding whether and if so how they are applied the purpose of this report is to provi congress with an overview of the federal rulemaking process and

like taxing and spe nding is one of the basic tools of government used to implement public polic in fact the development and framing of rule has been described as the c limactic act of the policy making process1 another observer described the rulemaking process as absolutely central to the definition and implementation of public policy in the united states and said that significant attempt to alter the dir ection of public program can succeed without effective management of the rulemaking process2 regulations generally start with an act of congress and are the means by which statutes are implemented and specific requirements are established federal agencies issue more than 4000 final rules each year on topics ranging from the timing of bridge openings to the permissible levels of arsenic and other contaminants in dr inking water the costs and benefits associated with all federal regulations have been subject of great controversy with the costs estimated in the hundreds of billions of dollars and th benefits estimates even higher the costs federal regulati ons impose on regulated entities to accomplish policy goals are not reflected in the federa l budget process and some view these off budget regulatory costs as greater than ll federal domestic disc retionary spending estimates of the benefits of federal regulations are even higher the terms rule or regulation are of ten used interchangeably in discussions of the federal regulatory process th administrative procedure act apa of 1946 defines rule as the whole or part of an agency statement of general or particular applicability and future effect designed to implement interpret or prescribe law or policy3 the process by which federal agenci develop amend or repeal rules is called rulemaking and is th subject of this report figure 1 illustrates in general manner the process that most federal agencies are generally required to follow in writing or revising significant rule however we should be quick to point out that some aspects of figure 1 do not apply to all rulemaking for example as discussed later in this report an agency may in certain circumstances issue final rule without issuing notice of proposed rulemaking thereby skipping several steps depicted in the figure on the other hand some rules may be published for public comment more th an once also independent regulatoryhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32240crs2 4 as used in this report the term independent regulatory agencies refers to the boards and commissions identified as such in the pa perwork reduction act 44 usc 35025 including the federal communications commission the federal energy regulatory commission the nuclear regulatory commission and the securities and exchange commission the term independent agencies refe rs to other agencies that answer directly to the president but are not pa rt of cabinet departments agencies4 are not required to submit their rules to the office of management and budgets omb office of information and regulatory affairs oira for review and agency is required to do so fo r rules that are not significant source crs the office of management and budgets omb office

453459 6 national advisory committee on occupational safety and health report and continuednote at the top of figure 1 that the rulemaking process begins when congress passes statute either requiring or authorizing an agency to write and issue certain types of regulations an initiating event eg recommendation from an outside body or catastrophic accident can prompt either legislation or regulation where regulatory action has already been authoriz ed for example in response to lethal chemical releases by plants in bhopal india and west virginia congress enacted section 313 of the emergency planning and community righttoknow act of 1986 42 usc 11001 11050 11023 the act required the owners and operators of certain types of fac ilities to report the amounts of various toxic chemicals that the facilities release to the nvironment above certain th resholds and requires the environmental protection agency epa to make this information available to the public epa subsequently issued detailed regulations implementing these requirements and using the authority provide d to it through the statute has required reporting for more than 300 toxic substances in addition to those delineated in the law as this example illustrates the authority to regulate rests with congress and is delegated through law to an agency th statutory basis for regulation can vary greatly in terms of its specificity from 1 very broad grants of authority that state only the general intent of the legislation and leave agencies with great deal of discretion as to how that intent shoul d be implemented to 2 very specific requirements delineating exac tly what regulatory agencies should do and how they should take action note also in figure 1 the roles that congress and the courts can play at the end of the rulemaking process which may result in rule being returned to an earlier point in the process or bein g vacated by the reviewing body congress may also play role at other stages in the process through its oversight and appropriations re sponsibilities implicit within the steps depicted in figure 1 is an elaborate set of procedures and requirements that congre ss and various presidents have developed during the past 60 to 65 years to guide the federal rulemaking process some of these rulemaking requirements appl to virtually all federal agencies some apply only to certain types of agencies and others ar agencyspecific collectively these rulemaking provisions are voluminous and require wide range of procedural consultative and analytical actions on the part of rulemaking agencies some observers contend that the requirements have resulted in the ossification of the rulemaking process causing agencies to take years to develop final rules5 f r example the national advisory committee on occupational safety and health noted that it takes the occupational safety and health administration osha within the department of labor an average of 10 year s to develop and promulgate health or safety standard6 on the other hand while thes congressional and presidentialhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32240crs4 6 continued recommendations related to oshas standards

sum of 19 plus the additional premium if any determined under subparagraph for each individual who is participant in such plan during the plan year 8 dots 1998 appropriations act stated that none of the funds in this act shall be available to prepare propose or promulgate an regulations in any model year that differs from the standards promulgated for such automob iles prior to the enactment of this section 9 for an examination of the amount of regulatory discretion afforded in specific statutes see us general accounting office regulatory burden some agencies claims regarding lack of rulemaking di scretion have merit gaoggd9920 jan 8 1999 rulemaking requirements are numerous it is not clear whether they or some other factors eg lack of data congressionally imposed delays court challenges etc are the primary cause of the long timeframes th at are sometimes requi red to develop and publish final rules statutory rulemaking requirements statutory rulemaking requi rements can be generally categorized into two groups those that are specific to an individual agency or program and those that are more crosscutting in nature and therefore applicable to wider range of agencies or programs agency or programspecifi c rulemaking requirements may be in authorizing or appropriating statutes and can have significant or even determinative effect on an agencys rules and rulemaking procedures as noted previously these statutes sometimes specifically delineate what the agencys rules should require for exampl the employee retirement income security act 29 usc 1001 et seq gives the pension benefit guar anty corporation discretion in drafting rules that establish minimum pension insurance premium rates specifying to the dollar what those rates should be7 also for number of years the department of transportation dot concluded that it had discretion in setting the average fuel economy standards for light trucks and was required to keep the standard at 207 miles per gallon8 agencyspecific statutes may also impose specific procedural requirements on their rulemaki ng processes eg the conduc t of public hearings the publication of notice of proposed rulema king by particular date or the coordination of rulemaking w ith another agency in ot her cases though the statutes give rulemaking agencies substantial disc retion in how rules ar developed and what they require for example the agricultu ral adjustment act pr ovides broad grant of rulemaking authority to the secretary of agriculture stating only that agricultural marketing should be orderly but provi ding little guidance regarding which crops should have marketing orde rs or how to apportion the market among growers9 agency rulemaking is also often significantly influenced by court decisions interpreting these agency or programspecific statutory requirements for example in 1980 the supreme court ruled that befo re promulgating new health standardshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32240crs5 10 industrial union department v american petroleum institute 448 us 607 1980 11 see for example american textile mfrs inst inc v donovan 452 us 490 1981 and united steelworkers v marshall 647 f2d 1189 dc cir 1980 cert denied 453 us 913 1981 12 see for example motor vehicle manufacturers association v state farm mutual automobile insurance co 463 us 29 1983 the supreme court said the agency must examine the relevant data and articulate sa tisfactory explanation of its action including rational connection between the facts found and the choice madeosha must demonstrate that the particular chemical to be regulated poses significant risk under workplace conditi ons permitted by current regulations10 the court also said that osha must demons trate that the new limit osha proposes will substantially reduce that risk this d ecision effectively requires osha to evaluate the risks associated with exposure to chemical and to determine that these risks are significant before issuing regulatory standard other court decisions have required osha rulemaking to demonstrate the technical and economic feasibility of its requirements11 still other decisions have required agencies to permit meaningful public participation in rulemaking and to fu lly explain what they considered and why they did and did not ta ke particular actions12 the following discussion of statutory rulemaking requireme nts focuses solely on the crosscutting requirements that are applicable to more than one agency the discussion provides descriptions of some of the major rulemakingrelated statutes and is not intended to be catalogue of all ch requirements some of these rulemaking requirements have been in place for more than 70 years but most have been implemented within the past 25 years so of these statutor requirements apply to cabinet depar tments and independent agencies ot hers apply to those agencies as well as the independent regulatory agencies federal register act with the surge of new deal legislation enacted in the 1930s congress made federal agencies responsible for issuing tailed regulations on variety of complex social and economic issues however central regulatory publication system existed so there was efficient way fo r citizens to know about regulations that affected them therefore congress enacted the federal register act which became law in july 1935 44 usc chapter 15 the act established uniform system for handling agency regulations by requiring 1 the filing of documents with the office of the federal register 2 the placemen t of documents on public inspection 3 publication of the documents in the federal register and 4 after 1937 amendment permanent codification of rules in the code of federal regulations publication of rule in the federal register provides official notice of its existence and contents other documents that are generally published in the federal register include presidential proclamations and ex ecutive orders notices and documents that the president or congress require to be published regulations for carrying out the federal register act deal with among other things the format and distribution of the federal register and how documents arehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32240crs6 13 1 cfr ch i pts 122 14 electronic access to the federal register is provided through government printing office website at httpwwwgpoaccessgovfrindexhtml 15 some agencies begin the rulemaking process by publishing an advance notice of proposed rulemaking in which the agency notif ies the public that it is considering an area for rulemaking and often requests comments on th appropriate scope or topics of the rule the apa does not require the use of advance tices but some other statutes require it for particular types of rules similarly agen cies may issue supplemental notice of proposed rulemaking after an nprm is issued if they wish to obtain public comment on new factual proposals before issuing final rule 16 executive order 12866 discussed in detail late r in this report suggests that agencies allow the public at least 60 days to comment for significant rules prepared transmitted and processed13 the office of the federal register is responsible for printing and distributing the federal register and the office has published guide and drafting handbook explaining how federal register documents are to be prepared the federal register is published each business day and is now available electronically14 administrative procedure act the most longstanding and broadly applicable federal rulemaking requirements are in the administrative procedur act apa of 1946 5 usc 551 et seq the apa was written to bring regularity and predictability to agency decisionmaking and provides for both formal and informal rule making formal rulemaking is used in ratemaking proceedings and in certain other cases when rules are required by statute to be made on the record after an oppor tunity for trialtype agency hearing however few statutes require such ontherecord hearings informal rulemaking also known as notice and comment rulemaki ng is used much more frequently and is the focus of this section in informal rulemaking the apa generally requires that agencies cabinet departments and indepe ndent agencies as well as independent regulatory agencies publish notice of proposed rulemaking nprm in the federal register 15 the notice must contain 1 statement of the time place and nature of public rulemaking proceedings 2 reference to the legal authority under which the rule is proposed and 3 either the terms or substa nce of the proposed rule or description of the subjects and issues involved afte r giving interested persons an opportunity to comment on the proposed rule and afte r considering the public comments the agency may then publish the final rule incorporating general statement of its basis and purpose although the apa does not sp ecify the length of this public comment period agencies commonly allow at least 30 days16 public comments as well as other supporting materials eg hearing r ecords or agency regulatory studies but generally not internal memoranda are placed in rulemaking docketwhich must be available for public inspec tion finally the apa states that the final rule cannot become effective until at least 30 days afte r its publication unless 1 the rule grants or recognizes an exemption or relieves re striction 2 the rule is an interpretativehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32240crs7 17 the apa judicial review provisi ons are codified at 5 usc 701706 18 in addition to the apa exceptions congress sometimes includes specific exemptions from notice and comment procedures in other stat utes for example section 161d under title i of the federal agriculture improvement and reform act of 1996 pl 104127 110 stat 934935 instructed the secretary of agricultu re and the commodity credit corporation to issue regulations not later than 90 days after the date of enactment of the title without regard to the notice and comment provisions of the apa 19 senate committee on the judiciary administrative procedure act legislative history senate document 248 79th congress 2nd session 1946 rule or statement of policy or 3 the agency determines that the rule should take effect sooner for good cause and publishes that determination with the rule the final rule cannot adopt provision if the nprm did not clearly provide notice to the public that the agency was considering adopting it if challenged in court under the apa an agency rulemaking can be held unlawful or set aside if it is found to be arbitrary capricious an buse of discre tion or otherwise not in accordance with the law17 the court can also compel agency action unlawfully withheld or unreasonably dela yed amendment or revocation of an existing rule generally requires the responsible agency to issue new rule through the apa process exceptions to the apa notice requirement although the apa generally requires agencies to publish npr ms before promulgating final rule the act provides exceptions to this requirement for example the apa states that the notice and comment procedures generally do not apply when an agency finds for good cause that those procedures are impracticable unnecessa ry or contrary to the public interest when agencies us the good cause exception the act requires that they explicitly say so and provide rationale for the exceptions use when the rule is published in the federal register the apa also provides explicit exceptions to the nprm requirement for certain categories of regulatory actions such as rules dealing with military or fore ign affairs agency manage ment or personnel or public property loans grants benef its or contracts further the apa says that the nprm requirements do not apply to interpretative rules general statements of policy or rules of agency organization procedure or practice18 however these rules do have to be published in the federal register the legislative history of the apa make s it clear that congress did not believe that the acts good cause exception to th notice and comment requirements should be an escape clause according to th senate committees report accompanying the apa true and supported or supportable finding of necessity or emergency must be made and published when the agency uses the good cause exception19 the legislative history also indicates that congress envisioned agencies using the notice and comment procedures even in some cas in which the apas exceptions applied federal agencys invocation of the good cause exception or other exceptions to notice and comment procedures is subj ect to judicial re view after having reviewed the totality of circumstances the courts can and sometimes do determine that an agencys reliance on the good cau exception was not authorized under thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32240crs8 20 for discussions of these court cases see llen r jordan the

specified period of time eg 30 days however if an adverse comment is filed the direct final rule is withdrawn and the agency may publish th rule as proposed rule under normal nprm procedures direct fina l rulemaking can be viewed as particular application of the apas good cause exception in which agencies claim nprms are unnecessary22 both vice president gores national performance review and the administrative conference of the united stat encouraged agencies to use direct final rulemaking for noncontroversial rules23 the administrative conference also ndorsed the use of what is known as interim final rulemaking in which an ag ency issues final rule without an nprm that is generally effective immediately but with postpromulgation opportunity for the public to comment if the public comments persuade the agency that changes are needed in the interim final rule the agency may revise the rule by publishing final rule reflecting those changes interim fi nal rulemaking can be viewed as another particular applicati on of the good cause exception in the apa but with the addition of comment period after the rule has become effective24 in august 1998 the general accounting ffice

technical issues with limited applicability however 11 of the 61 final rules publis hed during 1997 that were major eg having 100 million impact on the economy did not have npr ms the agencies most commonly cited the apas good cause exception as their justification for not publishing nprms frequently noting the timesensitive nature of the actions being taken the agencies also frequently used the categorical exceptions permitted in the apa eg actions involving agencies management or personnel in some cases gao concluded that the agenci explanations for why nprms were not used were not clear or understandable with the ag encies sometimes maki ng broad assertions that an nprm would delay the issuance of rules that were in some general sense in the public interest for example in one case the

national environmental policy act the national environmental policy act nepa of 1969 42 u sc 4321 4347 was the first statute to require an impact statement as way to ensure that federal agencies give special consideration to certain issues during the rulemaking process nepa requires ll federal agencies to include in every recommendation or report related to major federal actions significantly affecting the quality of the human environment detailed statemen t on the environmental impact of the proposed action initially though agencies make threshold termination known as an environmental assessment as to whether the rule or other action represents significant impact on the environment if not the agency issues finding of significant impact if the agency concludes that there is significant impact the agency then prepares full environmental impact statement describing the likely effects of the rule according to the act and its implementin g regulations devel oped by the council on environmental quality the environmental impact statement must delineate the direct indirect and cumulative effects of the proposed action27 agencies are also required to include in the statement 1 an adverse environmenta l effects that cannot be avoided should the propos be implemented 2 lternatives to the proposed action 3 the relationship between local shor tterm uses of the environment and the maintenance and enhancement of longterm productivity and 4 any irreversible and irretrievable commitments of re sources that would be involved if the proposed action should be

the paperwork reduction act pra 44 usc 35013520 was originally enacted in 1980 but was subsequently am ended in 1986 and again in 1995 one of the purposes of the pra is to minimize the paperwork burden for individuals small businesses and others resulting from the collection of information by or for the federal government the act generally defines collecti on of information as the obtaining or disclosure of facts or opini ons by or for an agency by 10 or more nonfederal persons many information coll ections recordkeeping requirements and thirdparty disclosures are contained in or are authorized by regulations as monitoring or enforcement tools in fact these pa perwork requirements ar the essence of many agencies regulatory provisions29 the pra requires agencies to justify any collection of information from the public by establishing the need and intended use of the information estimating the burde n that the collection will impose on respondents and showing that the collecti on is the least burdensome way to gather the information the original pra established the office of information and regulatory affairs oira within the office of management and budget omb to provide central agency leadership and oversight of g overnmentwide efforts to reduce unnecessary paperwork burden and improve the management of in formation resources agencies must receive oira approval signified by an omb control number displayed on the information collection for each collection request before it is implemented and those approvals must be renewed at least every three years

independent regulatory agencies can by majo rity vote void any oira disapproval of proposed collection of information 32 an agencys annual paperwork burdenhour estimate is function of 1 the frequency of the information collection 2 the estimated number of respondents and 3 amount of time that the agency estimates it takes each responde nt to complete the collection for example if an agency estimates that an informati on collection conducted twice each year will take each of the estimated 10000 respondents 10 hours to complete each time the total annual burden hour estimate for the collection is 200000 burden hours 2 times 10000 times 10approval for an active collection or the lapse of that approval represents violation of the act and triggers the pras public protection provision under that provision one can be penalized for failing to comply with collection of information subject to the act if the collection does not display valid omb control number30 oira can disapprove any collection of information if it believes the collection is inconsistent with the requirements of the pra31 the pra clearance process is described in the act and implementing regulations for new collections later than the publication of the nprm the issuing agency must submit the proposed rule and any background information to oira at the same time the agency is required to publish notice in the federal register stating that oiras approval is be ing sought thereby providing the public with an opportunity to comment on the proposed collection for any collection of information that is not contained in pr oposed rule oira staff have up to 60 days under the statute to review the proposed collection and ensure among other things that the collection is statutorily authorized and necessary and that the agencys paperwork burden estimate m ost commonly measured in terms of burden hours is reasonable32 at the end of the process the agency is notified of the disposition of the review oira data indicates that the office takes action on between 3000 and 5000 information collection requests new approvals renewals or revisions each year the 1995 pra reaffirmed the pr inciples in the original act and gave significant new responsibilities to oira and executive br anch agencies fo r example the act currently requires oira to oversee the use of information resources to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of governme ntal operations to serve agency missions the pra also requires federal agencies to establish process independent of program responsibility to ev aluate proposed collections of information manage information resources to reduce information collection burdens on the public and ensure that the public has timely and quitable access to information

requiring the disclosure to third parties or the public effectively overturning the supreme courts 1990 decision in dole v united steelworkers of america 494 us 26 one of the key features of the pra of 1995 was the requirement that oira in consultation with the agency heads t annual governmentwide goals for the reduction of information coll ection burdens by at least 10 in fiscal years 1996 and 1997 and by at least 5 in each of the cceeding four fiscal ears the act also required oira to establish agency burden reduction goals each year representing the maximum practicable opportunity in each agency at the end of fy1995 just before the pra of 1995 took effect federal agencies estimated that their information collections imposed about 7 billion burden hours on the public therefore if all federal agencies had been able to meet each of the governmentwide goals by september 30 2001 the burden hour estimate would have decreased about 35 to about 46 billi on hours however this reduction did not occur in fact as of september 30 2002 the governmentwide bur den estimate stood at more than 82 billion hours 17 increase since the pra of 1995 took effect nearly half of that increase occurred during fy2002 alone and about 70 occurred during fiscal years 2001 and 200234 the agencies contend that they are often unable to reduce paperwork requirements without changes in the underlyi ng statutes that require the information to be collected regulatory flexibility act the regulatory flexibility act rfa of 1980 5 usc 601612 requires federal agencies to assess the impact of their forthcoming regulations on small entities which the act defines as including small businesses small governmental jurisdictions and certain small notforprof it organizations under the rfa cabinet departments and indepe ndent agencies as well as independent regulatory agencies must prepare regulatory flexibility analys is at the time proposed and certain final rules are issued the analysis for propos ed rule is referred to as an initial regulatory flexibility analysis irfa and the analysis for final rule is referred to as final regulatory flexibility analysis the rfa requires the analysis to describe among other things 1 the reasons why the regulatory action is being considered 2 the small entities to which the proposed rule will apply and where feasible an estimate of their number 3 the projected reporting recordkeeping and other compliance requirements of the proposed rule and 4 any significant alternatives tohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32240crs13 35 many agencies are apparently aware of this limitation gao estimated that in more than 500 final rules published in 1997 the agencies specifically stated that the rfa was not applicable or that regulato ry flexibility analysis was not required because the action was not preceded by an nprm see gaoggd98126 p 31 36 us small business administration 20 years of the regulatory flexibility act rulemaking in dynamic economy washington 2000 37 this requirement as well as similar requirement in executive order 12866 is generally met via entries in the unified agenda of federal regul atory and deregulatory actions the unified agenda is published twice each year in the federal register by the regulatory information service center and provides uniform reporting of data on regulatory activities under development throughout the federal government the rule that would accomplish the stat utory objectives while minimizing the impact on small entities however these analytical requirements are not triggered if the head of the issuing agency certifies that the proposed rule would not have significant economic impact on substantial number of small entities the rfa does not define significant economic impact or substantial number of small entities thereby giving federal agencies substa ntial discretion regarding when the acts analytical requirements are initiated also the rfas analytical requirements do not apply to final rules for which the ag ency does not publish proposed rule35 the rfa initially did not permit judicial review of agencies actions under the act however amendments to the act in 1996 as part of the small business regulatory enforcement fairness act s brefa 110 stat 857 5 usc 601 note permitted judicial review regarding among other things agencies regulatory flexibility analyses for final rules and any certifications that their rules will not have significant impact on small entities as result small entity that is adversely affected or aggrieved by an agencys dete rmination that its fina l rule would not have significant impact on small entities could seek judicial review of that determination within one year of the date of the final ag ency action in granting relief court may remand the rule to the agency or defer enforcement against small entities the addition of judicial review in 1996 is genera lly viewed as significant strengthening of the rfa and is believed to have improved agencies compliance with the act36 the rfa also contains several other not able provisions for example section 602 requires each federal agency to publish regulatory flexibility agenda in the federal register each october and april listing regulations that the agency expects to propose or promulgate which are likely to have significant economic impact on substantial number of small entities37 section 610 of the act requires agencies to review those rules that have or will have significant impact within 10 years of their promulgation to determine whether they should be continued without change or should be amended or resci nded to minimize their impact on small entities section 612 of the rfa requires the chief counsel of the small busine ss administrations sba office of advocacy to monitor and report at least annually on agencies compliance with the act sbas primary thod of monitoring agencies compliance is to review and comment on proposed regu lations when they are

put in place special requirement s for proposed rules issued by the environmental protection agency epa and the occupational safety and health administration osha epa and osha ar required to convene

report on the comments received and on the panels recommendations later than 60 days after the panel is convened and the pane ls report must be made public as part of the rulemaking record38 an agency may or may not dopt the panels recommendations gao has examined the implementation of the rfa several time s within the past 10 to 15 years and recurring theme in gao s reports is lack of clarity in the act and resulting variability in the acts implementation for example in 1991 gao reported that each of the four federal ag encies that it reviewed had different interpretation of key rfa provisions39 in 1994 gao again reported that agencies compliance with the rfa varied widely from one agency to another and that agencies were interpreting the statute differently40 in 1999 report on the implementation of section 610 of the rfa and in 2000 report on the implementation of the rfa at the environmental protection agency epa gao concluded that agencies had broad discretion to determine wh at the statute required41 in all of these reports gao suggested that congress consider clarifying the acts requirements andor give sba or some other entity the responsibility to develop criteria for whether and how agencies should conduct rfa analyses in 2001 gao testified that the promise of the rfa may never be realized until congress or some other entity defines what significant

however other observers have indicated that the definitions of these terms should remain flexible b ecause of significant differences in each agencys operating environment periodically legislation is introduced to amend the rfa for example in the 110th congress hr 4458 the small busine ss regulatory improvement act was introduced on december 12 2007 and wa s reported by the house committee on small business the next day among other things hr 4458 would define economic impact as including indirect effects that are reasonably foreseeable and would clarify that agencies review s of existing rules should not be limited to rules for which regulatory flexibility an alysis had been conducted the bill would also require agencies to develop plan for the review of all existing rules within 10 years require more details in agencies an alyses and notificati ons and require annual reports to congress on certain agency det erminations as part of their reviews although some of these provisions addre ss longstanding issues some provisions seem unclear and some may add time and costs to the rulemaking process most notably though hr 4458 does not addre ss gaos longstanding concerns about the lack of clear definitions for key terms in the rfa43 small business regulatory enforcement fairness act as noted in the previous section of th is report certain provisions in sbrefa amended the rfa to permit judicial review and to permit small entities to participate in epa and osha rulemaking before pr oposed rule with significant impact on small entities is published other provisions in sbrefa did not amend the rfa but imposed new rulemakingrelated re quirements on federal agencies for example section 212 of sbrefa requi res agencies to develop one or more compliance guides for each final rule or group of related final rules for which the agency is required to prepare regulatory flexibility analysis specifically section 212 requires the guides to 1 be publis hed 2 be designated as small entity compliance guides and 3 explain the actions small entity is required to take to comply with an associated final rule however the discretion inherent in the rfa regarding when regulatory flexibility analysis is required also applies to whether compliance guides must be developed s ection 212 gives agencies broad discretion in other areas as well for example it sa ys agencies may prepare separate guides covering groups or classes of similarly affected small entities and may cooperate with associations of small entities to develop and distribute the guides agencies are given sole discretion in th use of plain language in the guides the statute does not indicate when the guides must be veloped or how they must be published in december 2001 gao reported that secti on 212 of

small entities to establish program fo r responding to i nquiries c oncerning compliance with applicable statutes and regulations the section also says that in any civil or administrative action against small entity such guidance may be considered as evidence of the reasonabl eness or appropriate ness of any proposed fines penalties or damages sought against such small entity section 222 of sbrefa amended the small business act 15 usc 631 et seq to require the sba administrator to designate small business and agriculture regulatory enforcement ombuds man who was directed to work with each agency to ensure that small busine ss concerns have an opportunity to comment on agencies enforcement actions the om budsman was directed to annually evaluate and report on each agencys enforcement activities including rating of the responsiveness to small business of each agencys regional and program offices section 222 also required the administr ator to establish small business regulatory fairness board in each sba regional office to report to and advise the ombudsman on excessive enforcement actions of agencies against small business concerns section 223 of sbrefa requires agencies to provide small entities with some form of relief from civil m onetary penalties specifica lly subsection 223a of the act required federal agencies regulating the activities of small entities to establish policy or program by end of march 1997 for the re duction and under appropriate circumstances the waiver of civil pena lties by small entities in february 2001 gao reported on the implementation of sec tion 223 and concluded that all of the agencies penalty reduction and waiver po licies were within the broad discretion afforded by the statute45 however gao also reported that some of the policies covered only portion of the agencies forcement actions involving small entities and some treated small entities differently than large entities the agencies policies also differed in terms of how key terms such as small entity and penalty reduction were defined nd most were developed be fore sbrefa took effect gao suggested several changes to the statut to strengthen agencies penalty relief policies and make them more consistent for example gao suggested amending the act to require agencies to maintain data on the number of enforcement actions involving small entities and the amount of penalty relief provided this recommendation was later implemented with the passage of the small business paperwork relief act of 2002 pl 107198 116 stat 729 which required

of disapproval46 under the cra before any final rule can become effec tive it must be filed with each house of congress and gao the act also requires federal agencies to submit to gao and make available to each house of congress copy of any costbenefit analysis prepared for the rule and report on the agencys actions related to the rfa and any other relevant act or executive order the definition of rule under the cra is very broad and the act applies to ru issued by cabi net departments and independent agencies as well as i ndependent regulatory agencies if oira considers the issuing agencys rule to be major eg has 100 million impact on the economy the agency must delay the rules effective date by 60 days after the date of publication in the federal register or submission to congress and gao whichever is later within 15 calendar days of receiving major rule gao is required to provide congress with report on the rule assessing the issuing agencys compliance with the procedural steps required by the various acts and executive orders applicable to the rulemaking process although the cra establishes these special requirements for major rules the cra procedures for disapproving regulations apply to all rules whether or not they are declared to be major within 60 days after congress receives an agencys rule excluding periods when congress is in recess or adjournmen t member of congress can introduce resolution of disapproval that if adopted by both houses and enacted into law can nullify the rule even if it has already g one into effect c ongressional disapproval under the cra also prevents the agency from proposing to issue substantially similar rule wit hout subse quent statutory authorization but this provision is not intended to vitiate altogether the agencys power to establish regulations in the area in question the cra provides that nate action on disapprova l resolution under the act must occur within 60 days of session afte r the regulation is submitted and makes available during that period an expedited pr ocedure intended to ensure that the senate can take up and vote on the measure before the period expires the act establishes such expedited procedure for the house if congress adjourns less than 60 days of session after rule is submitted new 60 day period for disapproval under the act begins on the 15th

standard in march 2001 pl 1075 many reasons have been suggested for wh the cra has not been used more often47 but chief among them may be the fact that if the president vetoes resolution of disapproval which is likely if the unde rlying rule is developed during his administration then enactment of the re solution would require approval of two thirds majority in both houses of congress the rejection of the ergonomics rule was the result of specific set of circumstances created by transition in party control of the presidency the majority party in both houses of congress was the same as the party of the incoming president georg w bush when the new congress convened in 2001 and adopted resolution disapproving the rule published under the outgoing president william j clinton the incoming president did not veto the resolution congress may be most able to use the cra to disapprove rules in similar transitionrelated circumstances48 congress can also stop agency rulemaking or regulatory enforcement through provisions added to agency appr opriations legislation there appear to be four types of such appropriations provisions 1 rest rictions on the finalization of particular proposed rules 2 restrictions on regula tory activity within certain areas 3 implementation or enforcement restrictions and 4 conditional restrictions eg preventing implementation of rule until certa in actions are taken some of these kinds of provisions have been included in appropriations bills for many years in row the reasons behind thes restrictions vary with so appearing to be based on economic considerations some requiring or preventing th implementation of rules issued at the end of presidential adminis tration and some incl uded for various other reasons such provisions are generally applicable only for the period of time and the agencies covered by the relevant appropriations bill but depending on how they are worded can be more broadly applicable also to the extent

requires cabinet departme nts and independent agencies but not independent regulatory agencies to among other things prepare written statement containing specific descriptions and estimates for any proposed rule or any final rule for which proposed rule was published that includes any fede ral mandate that may result in the expenditure of 100 million or more in any year by state local or tribal

ecause of the way the statute was written title ii of umra had little effect on agencies rulemaking actions during its first two years of implementation52 first many of the acts requirements did not appear to apply to most of the economically significant rules eg rules with 100 million impact on the economy that were promulgated during this period for example if final rule did not have an associated nprm or imposed mandate as condition of federal financial assistance the written statement requirement in section 202 of umra does not apply s econd umra does not require agencies to take the actions specified if the agencies determine that they are duplicative of other actions or that accurate estima tes of the effect of their rules are not feasible third even when umra is triggered it often requires agencies to take actions that are identical or similar to actions that they were already required to take for example umras requirements in sections 202 and 205 for the conduct of costbenefit analysis and identification of regulatory alternatives are similar to the requirements that were already in place under executiv order 12866 which was issued more than year before umra was enacted see below for discussion of executive order 12866 the consultation requirements in s ection 204 are traceable to the notice and comment requirements in the apa and are almost identical to the

significant final rules issued in 2001 and 2002 only 9 of 12253 however gao also said that some of the rules not triggering umras requirements appeared to have potential financial impacts on affected

agencies to issue their own guidelines not more than one year after the issuance of ombs governmentwide guidelines and to establish administrative mechanisms allowing affected persons to seek and obtain correction of informati on maintained and disseminated by the agency finally the act required agencies to report periodically to the director of omb on the number and nature of complaints received and how such complaints were handled by the agency the first agency reports were due by january 1 2004 in response to separate congressi onal requirement in april 2004 omb provided congress with report on the implementation of the iqa during fy200356 the report said that agencies received onl about 35 substantive correction requests during the year and said it wa s premature to make broa d statements about both the impact of the correction request proce ss and the overall responsiveness of the agencies many other correction request s listed in the report were on minor issues or involved matters that had been dealt with before the iqa was enacted omb indicated that the correction requests came from all segments of society and said there was evidence that the iqa had affected the pace of rulemaking however omb watch public interest group said ombs report was seriously flawed in that it understated the number of correction requests and di d not disclose that nearly threequarters of the re quests were from industry57 the iqa builds upon existing agency responsibilities to assure the quality of information collected used or disseminat ed to the public proponents of the act contend that the law and the omb and agency guidelines will improve the quality of agency science and regulation and force agencies to regulate based on the best science available some of these propone nts also maintain that the act will help agencies defend their regulations against lawsuits and reduce the number of lawsuits filed they also point out that in any re quests for

version of the peer review bulletin on its website63 the final bulletin was published in the federal register on january 14 200564 omb said this version refl ects minor revisions made in response to more than 50 comments from the public on th revised bulletin for example the final bulletin requires agencies to disclose the names of peer reviewers to the public and adds an annual reporting requi rement to allow omb to track how agencies are using the bulletin however agencies are still afforded substantial discretion to determine when and what type of peer review is required omb also retains substantial discretion in certain areas omb and supporters of the peer review bulletin indicate that peer review standards across the government are currently inconsistent and th at more consistent use of peer review can increase the technical quality and credibility of regulatory science65 they also assert that peer review can protect sciencebased regulations from political criticism and litig ation opponents view the bulletin as an effort to inject political considerations into the world of science and to use the uncertainty that inevitably surrounds science as an excuse to delay new rules that could cost regulated entities millions or even billions of dollars they also expressed concerns regarding the need for the bulletin and ombs authority to issue it66 other statutory provisions related to rulemaking other statutory provisions ve been enacted over the years that while generally not imposing new rulemaking requirements per can aff ect the rulemaking process federal advisory

simply serve as sounding board for agency ideas th enactment of the federal advisory committee act faca of 1972 5 usc app ii established requirements to ensure that agencies using advisory committees receive impartial and relevant expertise specifically faca require s that the advice provided by advisory committees be objective and accessible to th public with certain exceptions each advisory committee meeting is presumptivel open to the public adequate advance notice of the meetings must be published in the federal register and all papers records and minutes of the meetings must generally be made available to the public faca also requires that the advisory committees be fairly balanced in regard to the points of view of affected interests and the functions pe rformed the act defines an

rule making act of 1990 5 usc 561570a as amended and perm anently authorized in 1996 110 stat 3870 seeks to overcome what some observers describe as an adversarial relationship between agencies and affected interest groups that often accompanies agency rulemaking the concept of negotiated rulemaking sometimes referred to as regulatory negotiation or regneg emer ged in the 1980s as supplement to the traditional procedure for veloping regulations ne gotiated rulemaking does not replace procedures necessary under the apa instead the act encourages but does not require agencies to consider c onvening negotiated rulemaking committee before developing and issuing propos ed regulation under the apa the committee composed of representatives of the agency and the various interest groups that would be affected by the proposed regulation ddresses areas of concern in the hope that it can reach agreement on the contents of proposed regulation the agency can if it agrees then issue the agreement as proposed rule and eventually final rule under existing apa requirements the expect ation is that any rule drafted through negotiated rulemaking would be easier to implement and less likely to be the subject of subsequent litigati on however any proposal agreed to by the negotiated rulemaking committee is not binding on the agency or other parties the major provisions of the act requi re that 1 negotiated rulemaking committee consist of at least one member of the agency and more than 25 members unless the head of the agency determines that more are needed 2 the agency select

actions related to establishing assisting or terminating the committee are not subject to judicial review but any judicial review available regarding the rule resulting from negotiated rulemaking is unaffected67 although the use of negotiated rulemaking was expected to improve rulemaking timeliness and reduce litigation one examination of agencies efforts in this area indicated that those expectations were not being fulfilled68 however another study indicated that negotiated rulemaking can improve particip ants perception of the final rule and of the overall rulemaking process69

information collection requirements on small businesses executive orders and directives during the past 20 years each president has issued executive orders andor presidential directives designed to guide the federal rulemaking process often with the goal of reducing regulatory burden although independent regulatory agencies are generally not covered by these requirements they are often encouraged to follow them by far the most important of th current executive rulemaking requirements is executive order 1286677 which describes both the pr inciples and the process by which presidential regulatory review currently takes place executive order 12866 centralized review of agencies regulations within the executive office of the president has been part of the federal ru lemaking process for more than 30 years although each of his three predecessors had some type of review process the most significant development in the evolution of presidential review of rulemaking occurred in 1981 when president reag an issued executive order 12291 the executive order established set of ge neral requirements for rulemaking and required federal agencies other than inde pendent regulatory agencies to send copy of each draft proposed and final rule to omb before publication in the federalhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32240crs30 78 although issued on september 30 1993 the executive

regulatory impact analysis for each major rule eg those w ith 100 million impact on the economy as result of this order oiras responsib ilities were greatly ex panded from paperwork reviews to examinations of the substan ce of covered agencies rules between 2000 and 3000 reviews per year in 1985 presid ent reagan expanded oiras influence further by issuing executive order 12498 which required covered agencies all except independent regulatory agencies to submit regulatory plan to omb for review each year that covered all of thei r significant regulatory actions underway or planned on september 30 1993 president clinton issued executive order 12866 which revoked executive orders 12291 and 12498 and established new process for oira review of rules78 like its predecessors the new executive order limited oiras reviews to proposed and final rules publis hed by agencies other than independent regulatory agencies however it also limited oira reviews to actions identified by the rulemaking agency or oira as signifi cant regulatory actions defined as those that were economically significant eg those with 100 million impact on the economy or that 1 were inconsistent or interfered with an ac tion taken or planned by another agency 2 materi ally altered the budgetary imp act of entitlements grants user fees or loan programs or 3 raised novel legal or policy issues as result the number of rules that oira reviewed dropped from between 2000 and 3000 per year to between 500 and 700 per year executive order 12866 also differs from its predecessors in other respects for example the order requires that oira ge nerally complete its reviews of proposed and final rules within 90 cale ndar days it also requires both rulemaking agencies and oira to disclose certain information about how the regulatory reviews were conducted for example agencies are to identify for the public 1 the substantive changes made to rules between the draft submitted to oira for review and the action subsequently announced and 2 changes ma at the suggestion or recommendation of oira oira is required to among othe r things provide agencies with copy of all communications between oira personne l and parties outside of the executive branch and to maintain pub lic log of all regulatory ac tions under review and of all of the documents provided to the agencies79 for each significant draft rule the executive order requires the issuing agency to provide to oira the text of the draft ru description of why the rule is needed and general assessment of the rules costs and benefits for draft rules that are economically significant the executive order requires detailed costbenefit analysis including an assessment of the co sts and benefits of potentially effective and reasonably

another regulatory approach in choosing among lternative regulatory approaches agencies should select those approaches that maximize net benefits80 during the formal executive order 12866 review process oira analyzes the draft rule in light of the principles of the executive order and discusses the rule with staff and officials at the rulemaking agency oira may also discuss the draft rule with other agencies with whom interage ncy coordination will be necessary and may meet or otherwise communicate with interest ed stakeholders outside of the federal government81 at the end of the review oira either concludes that the draft rule is consistent with the principles of the ex ecutive order the majority of the cases or returns the rule to the agency for furthe r consideration in some cases agencies withdraw their draft rules during oiras revi ew if the draft is proposed rule the agency may then publish an nprm if the draft is final rule the agency may then publish final rule and allow the rule to take effect oira staff also sometimes review draft rules informally before their formal submi ssion under the executive order particularly when there is statut ory or legal deadline or when rule has large impact on society oiras formal review process has not changed substantially since executive order 12866 was issued in 199382 however gao reported in september 2003 that there had been several changes in oira policies and practices since the current oira administrator dr john graham took office in july 2001 including 1 increased use of public letters explaining why oira returned rules to agencies for their consideration and suggesting regulato ry action 2 increased emphasis on cost benefit analysis and peer review of agencies rules 3 stricter adherence to the 90 day time limit for oira review 4 improvements in the transparency of the oira review process and 5 an increase in the size and skills of oiras staff83 underlying many of these changes is shift in how

review process was still not very transparent to the public and recommended several changes in oi ras disclosure policies gao and others have also examined agencies analyses of economically significant rules under the executive order84 for example in 1998 gao reported that some of the 20 economic analyses that it examined from five agencies did not incorporate all of the best practices set forth in ombs guidance85 five of the analyses did not discuss alternatives to the proposed regulatory action and in many cases it was not clear why the agencies used certain assumptions also five of the analyses did not discuss uncertainty associated with the agencies estimates of benefits andor costs or document the agencies r easons for not doing so executive order 12866 also includes severa l other notable requirements for example section 5 of the order requires agencies to periodically review their existing significant regulations to determine whethe r they should be modified or eliminated in march 1995 president clinton reemphasi zed this requirement by directing each agency to conduct pagebypage review of all existing regulations in june 1995 the president announced that 16000 pages had been eliminated from the code of federal regulations gao reported on this review effort in october 1997 noting that the page elimination totals that four agencies reported did not take into account pages that had been added wh ile the eliminations took place86 gao also reported that about half of the acti ons taken appeared to have effect on the burden felt by regulated entities would have little effect or could increase regulatory burden executive order 13422 on january 18 2007 president george w bush issued executive order 13422 making the most significant amendmen ts to

and lessens c ongressional authority and by others as paragon of common sense and good government th most important changes made by executive order 13422 fall into five genera l categories 1

measure funding omb for fy2008 that would have prevented the imp lementation of the executive order but the measure was eliminated from the final version of th legislation the significance of the changes made to the review process by executive rder 13422 may become clear only through their implementation but those changes represent clear expansion of presidential authority over rulemaking agencies in that regard executive order 13422 can be viewed as part of broa der statement of presidential authority presented throughout the bush administration88 other executive orders and directives agencies other than independent regulatory agencies must also be aware of an array of other rulemaking requirements cont ained in executive orders and presidential directives for example executive order 13132 on federalis m requires covered federal agencies to have an accountable pr ocess to ensure meaningful and timely input by state and local officials in the development of regulatory policies that have federalism implications89 the order defines federalism implications as substantial direct effects on the states on the relationship between the national government and the states or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of gove rnment federal agencies are prohibited from promulgating any regulation with unfunded federa lism implications unless

cong ressional and presidentia l requirements is an attempt to ensure that certain interests or issues are considered during the rulemaking process andor to minimize the burden associated with federal regulations however these rulemaking requireme nts impose burdens of their own on rulemaking agencies and clearly are fact or although it is unclear whether they are the most important factor in the length of time it takes agencies to issue rules federal agencies must be aware of the crosscutting and the programspecific statutory and executive requirements underlying their regulations and must craft rules that are consistent with those requirements or run the risk of having their rules returned to them by oira or rejected by congress or the cour ts several of these statutes and orders indicate th at their requirements may be integrated with or satisfied by the requirements in other statutes or orders for example the regulatory flexibility act states that federal agencies can develop their regulatory agendas and perform their regulatory flexibility analyses in conjunction with or as part of anyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32240crs37 other agenda or analysis required by any other law some observers believe that integration and consolidation of all these requirements could improve the rulemaking process in 1993 the administrative confer ence of the united states noted that the simple requirements in the administrative procedure act for informal rulemaking had been overlain with an increasing number of constraints including those imposed by congress presidents and th courts the administrative conference recommended coordinated fra mework of proposals aimed at promoting efficient and effective rulemaking since then the number of rulemaking requirements has increased on the other hand many of these st atutory and executive order provisions provide the agencies substantial discreti on regarding when and how the rulemaking requirements are to be applied for exampl because the regulatory flexibility act does not define the term significant impact on substantial number of small entities agencies have great deal of latitude to determine when regulatory flexibility analysis is required similarl executive order 13132 does not define the term significant federalism implications so agencies have substantial discretion in deciding whether the analytical requirements of the order have been triggered other rulemaking requirements are written in such way that they actually apply to only small number of rules for example title ii of the unfunded mandates reform act does not apply to any rules published by inde pendent regulatory agencies or any rules for which an agency determines there is good cause not to publish notice of proposed rulemaking other rules are exem pt from umra if they are conditions of federal financial assistance or enforce constitutional rights the discretion and exceptions built into these rulemaking statutes and orders diminish their impact and allow agencies know ledgeable of their provisions to avoid many of the analyses and procedures they seem to require for example on hundreds of occasions agencies have stated in the preambles to their rules that because they believed there was good cause not to issu notice of proposed rulemaking the requirements of the rfa andor umra do not apply agencies also have standard language that they insert into preambles certifying that their rules do not require regulatory flexibility analyses or umra written statements and if agencies are not required to prepare regulatory flexibility an alyses for their proposed rules they are also exempt from the sbrefa requirements to prepare small entity compliance guides and in the case of osha and epa to convene advocacy review panels because of the inevitability of regulation and its associated burden efforts to either tighten existing requirements or impose new ones are likely to continue clear understanding of the existing requirements and how they have been implemented may inform any such future effortshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32240crs38 for additional information kerwin cornelius m
