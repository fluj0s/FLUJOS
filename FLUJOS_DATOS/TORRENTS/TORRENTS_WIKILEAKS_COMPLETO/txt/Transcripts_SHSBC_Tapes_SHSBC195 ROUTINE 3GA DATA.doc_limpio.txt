routine 3ga data lecture given on 26 july 1962 thank you whats the date audience 26th male voice june 9th thank you all right july 26 ad 12 saint hill special briefing course lecture number one im going to talk to you about 3ga now dont consider this summary lecture about 3ga its data lecture the last two i gave you were data lectures the basic summary lecture on 3ga was given some little time ago and most of the data in it still applies there have been few changes based upon the usual reason yeah its tough i dont give you unusual solutions i keep taking solutions out dianetics modern scienceoh it was dianetics evolution of science talks about the introduction of an arbitrary every time you introduce an arbitrary into an action you inevitably will develop little confusion around that arbitrary this is law governments basically and originally started getting in trouble with by the number of arbitraries they can introduce the number of government employees and that sort of thing the tremendous expansion of units and agencies and finally the final asininity the man in whitehall knows best all of these things come out of just one thing people have introduced arbitrary after arbitrary after arbitrary and it is very difficult to avoid the introduction of arbitraries because people demand them of you constantly and continuously hcahpaa practice not your type of practice but the handling of academy courses has just been changed too many arbitraries have been introduced into it and person couldnt get his hpahca certificate until he had done an extension course and took him year and until this and until that until the other thing and it was sixteen weeks and after that they retreaded and on and on there were all kinds of reasons why you couldnt make an auditor thats all they added up to they were an effort however to get people to complete their courses and know their business but why then did we have to start introducing regulations it must have been that the instruction of academy courses was deficient so we introduced regulations you see to make the academy course more efficient and then having introduced these we introduce few more and then we have some demands from somebody for clarification and ruling so we introduce few more regulations and then somebody else has problem and we solve that for them in the line of training or the academy you see and we have few more arbitraries introduced until all of sudden we cant make auditors i mean thats the final culmination of the introduction of that many arbitraries now let show you exactly how this occurs as cycle i swept these away few days ago by the issuance of policy letter that said there would be limit on the number of weeks that person would be in an academy course in other words i wanted to make auditorsthat was the main thing lets make auditorsthat was the main point and that it wouldnt be this many weeks or that many weeks and that there would be extension course you see not make it necessary before they get any uppergrade training that they have to have completed their extension course orand if they complete that validation seal something like that but lets not make that condition for professional certificate and then stop people from being certified you see lets fix it up so that person goes throughthis was made possible by the way by the simplification of what we are doing these days with auditingand person should be able to go through and at the end of the time he knows his business he can pass his examinations and so forth and he is at that moment given his certificate yeah thats the way it ought to be well i streamlined it all down to that by simply saying there would be limit on the number of weeks and arbitraries about their certificate the person would be examined and be issued his certificate well i said thats job well done weve got our material now our technical material is sufficiently simple thatso forth person can push in some sort of job on this and without getting people into too much trouble and lot of complexities dropped out of it thats fine i dusted my hands off feeling very very complacent about the whole thing and i was walking around happy as clam this afternoon and i walked into the telex office and here sat peter sitting there hair streaming down in his eyes pounding madly away on the telex machine answering despatch from london well actually peter knew better than to show this despatch and i probably never would have known about it if i hadnt gone in and actually started looking over his shoulder wanting to see him about something else such as who has just dug up the grounds without permission you know some minor thing see and i read this and my teeth sort of fell apart and my jaw muscles became rather slack and i quickly buttoned this up and discussed this in an intelligent fashion with peter but actually i was bit stunned because what was demanded was clarification of this order and some ruling so that the order could be implemented went like this i said that anybody would go on being consecutively trained unless they left the course and leaving the course would be defined as two weeks see gone off the course couple of weeks why then if they came back on the course then they could retread the course and this applied to all old auditors who wanted to get new material they could retread the course for 30 percent of the cost of professional course without discount you see just 30 percent of that and thats retread fee and thats all fine and thats all very simple i thought it was simple anyway nope apparently this is not simple problem what if student leaves course with the d of ts permission now is that included in the order now what if hes ordered to the hgc for auditing for more than two weeks and that would cause him if he came back to retread wouldnt it and what if he blew the course and was gone for more than two weeks you see does this include blows hgc retreads or people given permission to leave the course for short while you see and peter was saying well the wording may be ambiguous however and he threw the whole thing off you know and you know sort ofon the basisyou know peter hed say it very mildlywell sort of to hell with it but that was exactly what should have been said he said this very politely but here you had an introduction of arbitraries into simple order which was an effort to take out the arbitraries now were going in and put more arbitraries in this thing dont you see now the reason for arbitraries is the lack of judgment and the unwillingness to assume an initiative wherever we have zone or action where we have an unwillingness to assume initiative or responsibility or take terrific judgment on the thing or to use ones judgment or judgment is poor then we get this phenomenon of the introduction of arbitraries now games consist of freedom and barriers and remember that game does consist of freedom and barriers lot of the chaps running around saying three cheers were going to have revolution see this revolution which is going to come up at any moment is going to give everybody freedomeverybody freedom theyre all going to have freedom yes sir of course most revolutions have the kind of freedom like the fellow says when it comes to revolution we have strumberries everybody eats strumberries and the guy in the audience saysthe guy in the audience says but i dont like strumberries and the speaker on the stand says when it comes to revolution youll like strumberries see in spite of the fact that the revolution is all in favor of freedom we still seem to have barrier sitting there actually game cannot exist without freedom and barriers it must be and barriers you know this old principle weve had it around for quite while now game ceases to exist when you have too much freedom or too many barriers and the trick is to keep something like practical percentage of freedom and barriers there must be an interrelationship of these which is compatible with game otherwise we never get any action at all you talk about m1 and fast highways and the hundred and eightyfourpass cloverleafs that came over telstars broadcast the other night they showed cloverleaf outside of detroit i dont know why they picked that particular one because there are lot of them bigger than that and they only had one car on it i thought it was rather poor choice of shots but then i guess it was just the time of day or something like that and the placement of tvthe camera but if you look at those very carefully that is freedom of travel and then they start putting stuff up at both sides of the road see and then they start putting go slow signs up and then they put radar traps see and signs about radar traps and then they neglect the highway and let it pit nicely and sometimes they go so far as they did down in texas of putting deep dips in the road so if anybody hit one of these dips at fifty miles an hour or above the speed limit you see why all the car springs broke and so forth and after that the roads impassable and then you get the total freedom of road at all all youve got to do is imbalance the ratio of barriers and freedom and you get complete hotchpotch and its longer game country does not exist well without some laws they form basic agreements on what theyre doing you see and country exists very poorly without too manywith too many laws and of course although perhaps just by the nature of technology we tend to go in the political direction of anarchyyes that happens to be truebut of course anarchy is always something that arrives when there is political philosophy extant in that particular time and place which is applicable or acceptable to the problems which athe race is meeting at that particular time you finally get political setup where the political solutions called political philosophies in light moments these political philosophies become so overwhelming as far as the individual freedom is concerned that eventually all one can think about in the zone and area of politics is just lets be free of it see lets not have any more to do with it well of course if that took place you would have government at all and by definition thats anarchy but thats not saying all scientologists are anarchists but it says thats the only political philosophy that you tend to approach but theres quite another reason why if you thought it out very very carefully you would see that anarchy was very proper and fitting target you see anarchy has never been possible and if every individual had judgment and good sense there wouldnt be much reason to have any government so government you see is substitute for judgment and responsibility the more government you have why the heavier criticism it is of peoples initiative judgment and responsibility youre operating in political area which says the man in whitehall knows best you see that type of philosophy or you should have the commissar within call at any moment to know whether or not you dare talk to your neighbor across the back fence you see as they have in russia this type of philosophy rather dims out initiative and rather dims out judgment and rather ruins ones sense of responsibility and thats poor thingextremely poor thing so when wewhen we have an absence of this you see when you have an absence of restrictions in business or social or scientific group and yet the people involved with that group are individually politically involved with system which denies them responsibility and judgment dont you see they start taking it out on you to some degree so you get telex saying what is the meaningwhat is the meaning of this policy letter which says students should be trained to become auditors and left on course until they are auditors but what is off course i knew that would be asked you see and well off course is anybody whos gone for two weeks you see and that just served then as wideopen invitation to introduce all manner of arbitraries we promptly got an invitation for more arbitraries please give us more arbitraries well i sometimes almost explode under situations like this and i say all right what have we got d of t for see whats he doing first place i certainly should never be expected to lay down regulation on students who blow what lay regulation down on becausewhy why gods sakes somebody has just goofed man somebody has just missed all the withholds in the book dont you see and then some d of t didnt get that shepherds crook of old and reach snare and yank well all of this is to quite selfevident and iwow see wow andyouveim sure have heard protest somebodyi say well all you do is you just ask the guyyou just ask the guy how hes doing how hes getting on you know just ask the guy and so forth and thats sufficient and somebody always comes up and says what words do you use you know it leaves speechless see what words do you use i dont know and im sucker enough occasionally to say well say how are you doing and see and after that wow youve had it you go by and somebodys running the session and he saysand its running like this and hes saying do birds fly or whatever it is do birds fly how are you doing do birds fly how are you doing do birds fly how are you doing and then some people have been known to come around to afterwards and say look at this horrible thing you have just put out see look at this horrible thing you are doing there look at that auditor and look at what that auditors doing whats he doing well hes saying do birds fly how are you doing do birds fly how are you doing do bird and it doesnt make any sense well i have been in the process of stripping off arbitraries ever since weve been going forward and to lot of people anchored down and conditioned to changing and senselessly changing world and so forth see it as changes its strictly not changes its continuous series of omissions not omissions on the standpoint of overts but things are dropping out all the way along the line the track of scientology looks like some old model t ford has passed by the nuts and bolts are strewn all over the highway youto show you what sort of job im doing in this directionyou just pick up list of bulletins that are for four years ago and just count the number of nuts and bolts that have been taken off the machine and look at it that way not how many things have been changed how many nuts and bolts have been found unnecessary for the explanation and running of this machine because we get down to more fundamental actions were always working with more fundamental action and the more fundamental it is the less nuts and bolts you need to hold it together thats for sure now weve just stripped one out of the rudimentsthe beginning rudiments get along without it fine there it is see and frankly if an auditor is having hard time reading an emeter and is throwing the pc out of session hes frankly better off to say to the pc who cant be put insession hes better off to say start of session you see and start doing some action that he is doing but only those actions which require metering can be done this way thats an unfortunate fact in other words you could say to somebody start of session you see and just start doing what youre doing but unfortunately metering action can be performed in that type of session so you could possiblyyou could list goals in that type of session or you could list items you couldnt do much of anything else in that type of session well of course its quite adventurous running session without any rudiments in but lets look at the practicalities of the thing instead of the rudiments going in if were introducing lot of new arbitraries into the session under the guise of rudimentsyou see misread here and cleaning clean there and that sort of thingif that many arbitraries are being introduced into the session left and right of course the pcs going to go further and further out of session now actually the more actions and the more arbitraries are introduced by the auditor into whatever he is doing the less he gets done lets take some auditor he runs along for very short time and then he decides the pc looks bored and so he runs some ow you see and he runs few commands of ow the pc looks less bored looks kind of resentful now and he says well lets go on and list little while longer now and looks at the pc and then the pcs sitting there and just about getting interested in listing again or something like that and the auditor looks up and he says i think id better run some change of space on you and he does and he thought the pc was getting too introverted and then he got down toward the end of session you seedown toward the end of session and he says well now youve been outflowing the whole session and i just had good idea here and lets inflow little while so im going to tell you everything ive been thinking about during the session see thats before he ends the session so he tells him all the criticisms he thought of the pc during the session see and then he ends the session now the odd part of this is that you go over all of these introduced arbitraries and thats all youre going to find hanging up in the session isnt that interesting that is on rawmeat pc too thats not trained pc or somebody whos used to being audited or anything you take your meter and you find all the places where he tends to be stuck in the session he just had and each one of them will coincide with the introduction of an arbitrary now model session is designed to repetitively introduce an arbitrary so that even the arbitrary runs itself out we always ask do you have present time problem exactly that same place in the session dont you see well actually just asking it every session tends to run it out but how about sessions which have wild variations in them all over the place well they dont run out thats all youll find the only place pcs hang up is on the introduction of an unnecessary arbitraryunnecessary arbitrary remember games consist of freedom and barriers therere certain number of barriers have to be introduced or youre not even going to get the pc to sit in the chair long enough to be audited for instance some of younot after youve been here for little whilebut some of you when you first come here and get audited in the goldfish bowl on rudiments and that sort of thing would just love the arbitrary of wall to keep out the sessions to the left and right see that would be lovely well barriers have advantages you see as well asfrankly you give people too many barriers and they will do nothing but fight barriers but remember they can fight barriers to point where they have game of any kindno action of any kind there are activities now your barriers if kept to minimum and if they are stripped down to the point where they are necessary barriers vital barriers without which were not going to have anything at allif we can strip down toward that minimum and then not expand it out toward vast numbers of unneeded arbitraries why we will have rather effective and efficient session you see that session has got to have some arbitraries see theres the arbitrary of knowing the english language if youre being audited in english theres various little arbitraries set up around session but we start deleting too many of those arbitraries we dont have session you see well similarly if we add too many arbitraries we dont have session same thing happens what were seeking in the form of session is rather optimum balance between the freedom of the pc and the arbitraries entered into the session and if we can get that into nice balanced ratio were fine now i told you the other daythe other evening that pc got along all right but that inunless he was faced with an auditor who was too slavishly following rote or was neglecting it utterly there would be three conditions either the auditor would so slavishly follow rote that nothing would happen or the auditor had so much freedom that nothing got followed now theres third condition where the auditor introduced so many arbitraries that lord knows what the pc was now in any of those three conditions could obtain were seeking happy balance of these conditions but the auditor could be far too fixed too slavish in going ahead and doing what hes doing lets look at the type of impasse that an auditor could get into by being absolutely knuckleheaded this is very important to 3ga its not so much lecture on auditing as it is 3ga because when you get into anything like 3ga man any weakness along the line peaks it looks like signboard before it looked like about the size of blade of grass but now its one of these big gaudy signboards with naked girl bathing on it you know and heres your situation auditor starts his session glances at the needle and its going bzzzzzzzzzz well he says well i have to get in rudiments one two and three so he asks rudiment one and the immediate response is on the needle throughout the whole enunciation of are you willing to talk to about your difficultiesrudiment one is goals the effective rudimentis bzzzzzzzz so the auditor says that read was equivocal and by god i think hed come around after the session and ask meif he would go this fixedlyask to introduce new arbitrary as to how many times should you ask question when youre getting an equivocal read before abandoning it and expect to say five and half you see he shouldnt have been asking it at all anyhow thats the whole thing he should have enough judgment to know damn well that he isnt going to be able to sort anything out on this meter see heyou could run into this this would be very rare but wow well the best thing to do at time like that you see best thing to do at time like that would be to lay the meter asidethis is an unusable instrument at this momentand lets just run some ow you see you do have solution lets treat the thing as the pc must be sick see or something like that and we run some ow and the pc says he feels better now andor feels disgusted or something we dont care what the pc said but the pc feels different thats what were looking for lets put him back on the meter and if this thing is still going bzzzzzz which it wont be itll be doing something else now maybe be totally stuck or something we can at least ask him the random rudiment because all dirty needles are basically missed withholds but lets not be so knuckleheaded as to ask him the random rudiment if it is random rudiment that he has never been able to answer you get the idea hes never been able to answer this particular random rudiment he always has trouble with it see he gets into arguments with this thing or he gives motivators all the time well lets be smart enough to run rudiment which still gets off the missed withhold i was into this situation the other night in an auditing session and i had to phrase before i was finally finished upi had to phrase the missed withhold question about five different ways treated as rudiment in the middle of the 3ga run until finally the penny dropped and that was it and that needle quieted down but the pc had missed withhold but i just couldnt get the missed withhold question answered so that the missed withhold came off you understand so it was matter of bad luck the first four times i asked the missed withhold questionthe first four timesobviously were wrong i got them all answered whati got what i asked answered but they obviously were the wrong missed withhold questions there was wrong wording or the wrong phrasing or the wrong something but lets get the slight difference here the old man was in here puppy to the root he knew if hein order to go on nailing goals list and go on nulling goals he jolly well had to have clean needle so he wasnt saying all right well cancel outwell gae the pc see we wont do that well just sit here all night if necessary and slug this needle out of the road till we get it see now i carefully settled such things as is there anything you have done that people have failed to find out aboutyou couldnt read the needle anyhowuntil i got response from the pc and was able finally to check this out somehow in some haphazard fashion andbut i wasnt letting go of any missed withholds you see who had missed this withhold that was the thing who had missed the withhold and i was cheered up by little success as i went along on this by this interesting phenomenon of halfadialwide rock slam turning on occasionally just for moment brr i dont have any missed withhold read on the meter either except bzzzzz so finally finally i found out it was other people and that they didnt know it wasnt that they missed withhold see that was different yeah that was different see god knows why it was different but it was and just other people didnt know so that was that and at that moment the needle started to sweep up and down and around beautifully readable and i went on about my business and got us some nulling done see but that you might have said was slugfest i was unwilling to settle for nothing see my job was to null list first to make the pc feel better which i had to docured half dozen chronic somatics and that sort of thing some mild job see get in there null list how the hell could you null list with dirty needle you couldnt i tried thinking it wouldyou know it sometimes is just lack of auditing all right i got in there thinking well were going to get some auditing here and the dirty needle will clean up you know haha then all of sudden i said well we cant go on with this any further i went through this kind of system and this isbe an interesting system for you and its quite useful first ask the pcnow 3ga you see has its problems i should have told you the problems of 3ga is reading meterand ask the pc whats going on thats number onefirst action this needle is going bzzzbzzzbzzz whats going on you say to the pc something like that and then you get your middle rudiments in you didnt do anything with that see thats flop see he said oh life is terrible and youre doing awful things to well pursuing that particular course is not necessarily conducive to settling free needle see first place twoway comm may say twoway comm but its onequestion proposition see you go more than one question and youve had it for instance somebody today should be ashamed they were in there running the cchs and they were saying to the pc apparently i hear is there any more that you wish to tell about that is there any more to that is there any more about that after the pc had originated you see that was tr 4 tr 4 took the shape of is there anything more to that would you like to tell any more about that see good tr 4 you know qanda oh nothing like that see in other words the auditor never gave the character cheery aye aye and we were all set see but is there any more is there any more is there any more till the poor pc you see is bled white and trembling and then goes up in small bundle of smoke now this action of twoway comm doesnt work still got messy needle your next action is get in your middle rudiments just standard middle rudiments and you still got messy needle its hard to read through see well now youd better roll up your sleeves and put on your judgment boots because you cant go on man now youve just cleared failed to reveal havent you just in that many words in the middle rudiments as well as you could clean it you cleared it off and it didnt affect the dirty needle well that doesnt vary the fact that that dirty needle now must be coming from missed withhold of some kind or another and you better find out what it is now theres sixteen versions of missed withhold question and therere probably several more that you could ask cats im not going to give you the categories what you want to know from the pc is what did he do that was criminal and sinful that people slipped up on getting wise to see is it you in the session was it during the day was it in the last week or so was it now what the hell is this thing that the pc is holding on to with all of these ski ropes and so forth thats towing him all over the bay see whats he got hold of thats what you want to know because its missed withhold of some kind or another you can count your stars on that now some pcs will answer up and all of sudden terrific cognition falls off the meter everything else the questions hot as pistol and so on what didnt they know see is there anything people didnt know about you today see or something like that see oh thats hot as pistol but for some reason or other for some reason or other you ask him is there anything you didnt tell people today that you should have well theres nothing to that thats not the question you got the idea i mean peculiar reason the piano only resonates to very very tiny shading of meaning i ran somebody one time had she ever done anything to x had she ever done anything to x had she ever done anything to x nothing nothing nothing you know didnt wipe the dinner dishes completely dry before putting them on the table you know big overts big overts man this is colossal see so i got tired of this patacake you know and i said well have you ever done anything that x didnt find out about oh well yes put down things on the expense account slightly you know altered the household budget two cents here and there and thats about the limpest nowhere i ever saw i could get needle reaction you understand and finally i said all right is there anything you have done that x never knew about at the time and it went bang see oh well yes see and equivalent of affairs and you know bank robbery and sinking steamers on the high seas and all of this sort of thing and it was just that shade of question that rang the bell and it came under the heading of didnt know see he didnt know well found out that was different dont ask why found out is different from notknow but to this pc it was that wildly different and it was that sort of thing that finally settled up this case and got this case firing got some tone arm action going and that sort of thing case just did not respond to the exact question that one would normally would have thrown youd said since you have been living with x is there anything that you have failed to reveal reaction but since you have been living with x is there anything x didnt know about oh man volcanic action see but on the same question is theresince youve been living with x is there anything that x didnt find out action at all you tell you see what youre into there is very thin shading of semantics and the pc in an almost childlike daze reactively hides behind some of the thinnest little excuses but remember my job as the auditor was to get the needle cleaned up that was my job as the auditor and if everything i was supposed to do usual natural and normal that were doing today just as you are doing didnt finally accomplish this action then i had to assume that there was some shading of meaning there was something we just werent getting at here man and start drilling away on it theres something i certainly didnt know certainly there was something going on here i didnt know about now whats going on can take in the wildest and widest of horizons of course the goal youre trying to prove out may be the very very wrongest goal you ever heard of on the pc at which time hell get very withholdy and his needle will go very dirty and then you find yourself in the silly silly position of trying to pull missed withholds from the guythe missed withhold is something he knows reactively but does not know it is not his goal and he sits right there and he says its my goal and so forth and yes theyre very happy to have the thing checked out and so on and but what are you doing yakyak and all of sudden natternatter and screamscream and i think im going to blow course tomorrow because im just not ever going to be audited again auditing isim finished theres going to beno more i just dont want any more of any kind you see and yapyapyap and it doesnt matter what the auditor does the needles unreadable everythings going to hell yeah theres missed withhold there but the pc doesnt know it and you couldnt dig it up except by actually checking out hundred percent the whole problem of goals with this pc see thats your answer to the situation but it might beyou see this is where youre hung as an auditor and where youve got to use some judgmentit might be that during the noon hour they were mad at you at the thought that youthey weresee you already got missed withholds see its the little missed withholdsand they took your lunch kit see and threw it on the floor see it might be that one too see you get the idea you see what youre into here youre sorting through the human jungle called the reactive mind and in sorting through that jungle you are fortunate in having the keys the maps you know the blazes on the trees but remember there are conditions here where the same white blaze occurs simultaneously on twenty different types of trees youve got missed withhold which is the guys goal is wrong but he doesnt know it and you dont know it and the thing is reading on an invalidation only that the lines are wrong or that his goal has already been nulled out early on the list he knows that reactively see it was his goal there it went he doesnt know it there isnt anything under the sun would tell you that was his goal you just did little sloppy piece of metering or something or maybe your rudiments werent in at the beginning of session and the goal just before it something like this happened you looked up and sounded rather interested or amused on the goal just before his goal you get the idea it was to lick pots and pans of old fudge or something like that you know and you looked at this and you sort ofyou know and he says what the hell is he doing that for you know and the meters inoperative for the next couple of goals and the time he wakes up on down the line someplace he says i wonder what page were on what page are we on you know reactively sort of what page are we on what hes sort of reactively listening for to catch catfish and it doesnt come up see sometimes hell want to look through the goals list you know x see hell just see that down deep someplace and after that its chopchopchop nyatnyatnyat yapyapyap now he doesnt know what happened you dont know what happened youve got dirty needle and you go ahead slavishly trying to clear have i missed withhold on you see what have you done you are saying see what have you done that i havent found out about he hasnt done thing and it cant of course be cleared you missed his goal of course you dont find that out till next month or something like that see when the data does you good whatsoever well there are several trees have the same white blaze there is substitute for good metering theres substitute for being alert all the way along the line and theres also substitute for using your ruddy ead once in while see i can give youi cani can fill your arms full of charts and stuff your pockets full of good compasses and things like this and give you little playing records of witty sayings for the session and ways to open the petcock and drain the oil out of the pc give you all sortsgive you lube charts of his mental machinery but please i think youre asking too much too much you see to absolve you of any sense of any kind whatsoever and that ive always steadfastly refused to do even if my goal wereand it isntto overwhump you i wouldnt heres the point were already along line you see of your doing what ron says you see were already along that line fine very heavily and that became necessary through such randomity that nobody in the world was getting audited dont you see but that came into being there all right now lets not push that forward through to the final hilt of saying thou must never have any initiative lets be worse than that lets say thatlets not cook up things of this is and blasphemy since one is having an idea see lets not get that corny see were notthese arent the days of buddha heres the final word on the thing yes there is way and frankly if you put your very best efforts to it and work like mad with the sweat heldyou have to have rain gutters across above your eyebrows to channel the sweat offfor years and years and years you would eventually possibly have come up with just about what weve got because its been continuously monitored not by my inventions but by my observations both of human behavior the human mind and the activities of people doing things with these items now ill probably have to run some of that out as invalidation later but anyhowof but the point the point im making here is you get too slavish an adherence and you will commit as grave as introducing too many arbitraries and too many barriers or introducing none in some wild burst of imagined freedom and your pc practically spins in now im not trying to give you distrust of what youre doing im merely saying that in 3ga youre confronting pc youve got pc in front of you youre auditing the pc who is in front of you now there are various exact textbook reasons why this pc misacts the way he does these have been ferreted out and someday youll come to the knowledge that these are youll know that definitely and now lets come to further action and we dont use our good sense in handling of this situation believe youll get auditing done you see there are various directions you can go and one of them is too fixed fixedness and you can become complete idiot this way just completely idiotic we say to the pc start of session see well thats fine were getting him all ready and hes going into session and so forth he keeps vomiting you see but were not paying attention to that and we say are you willing to talk to about your difficulties you know and he vomits bit more and so forth and we get very upset and cross with the pc because he wont hold still long enough to see if hes willing to talk to us about our difficulties you get what i mean you see its just stupid all right similarly pc sits down looks at us very gloweringly and we say well i shouldnt inquire too deeply into this pcs past because he looks dangerous now the best thing to do with this pc is to just open up the session not do any rudiments because they do contain this withhold question and lets keep out of all the trouble we can keep into and now lets go into an auditing session and lets omit prepchecking on this pc because we really want to get 3ga done you see well thats way too wide at that moment you would have had it in the first place the pc isnt insession isnt going to give us any data isnt going to asis anything its all going up in balloon and youre operating across continuous piling up missed withholds and youre lucky if you can get out of it with your life man you get the idea all right but then lets have this other situationhave this other situation see thats total freedom the one i just gave you and lets get the other situation of where just to make sure hes insession lets put in fifteen or twenty extra beginning rudiments letswe know that his mother has violently opposed to his having processing so every session before we get into the body of the session lets ask him rudiment about how his mother is even the rawestmeat pc would begin to realize that bunch of arbitraries were going here who wouldnt but the pc wouldnt look good just the pc would look worse and worse and get worse and worse because man hes being run into practically every present time problem he ever heard of dont you see before he is brought to the body of the session he just cant quite concentrate by the time he gets to the body of the session so you wouldnt get anything done either you can also startle pcs you can decide that we should run several extra middle rudiments see middle rudiments are working all right theyre cleaning up things when theyre used lets run in several extra middle rudiments we found out that the pc has tendency to repress cough so irrespective of the pcs coughing well lets introduce middle rudiment asking specifically we say careful of that have you suppressed cough in this session see lets get that going and lets get several others going and lets have some fancy curves in here of some kind or another and finally the whole body of the session is taken up with middle rudiments you know because you never seem to be able to clear have you suppressedin this session have you suppressed cough thats the one thats giving us trouble you see because the guy says kumm you see and you say that read just doesnt ever seem to clean up and we find out when were auditing him on the fullthe whole track that he has button called cough and you finyoud find out its funny every time you say cough to him hell cough you know coughcough coughcough its very interesting very amusing we find out hes also coughing as thetan which is very interesting we never seem to get that one in but we tried too many wild variables now its amongst this tangled brier patch that we walk in order to get somebodys list of goals and get somebodys list done on the goal that is found and so on its our job to get the auditing done now the best way to get it done is the model session youve got right here according to various findings and your middle ruds are pretty good but i can and am going to slightly change their sequence to give you just little more of the stuff youre asking for dont you see just slightly change that i have reason to publish it at the moment but its just all in the interest of lets make it nicelylets get it good and patterned and then were not upsetting the pc by giving him something unexpected every two minutes and lets get it nice and patterned and lets adhere to that pattern and lets do minimum of rudiments and maximum of auditing in any session but lets not do such minimum of rudiments that we have the pc out of session while were doing the auditing do you see the nice balance there well that is only furnished by an auditors judgment there is substitute for an auditor taking responsibility for his pc there is substitute whatsoever for an auditor using his initiative and theres also substitute of any kind for an auditor basically getting resultstheres substitute for that and if i could invent something that you would say to pc and wouldnt require any barriers of any kind whatsoever and you just said boojum boojum boojum three times to the pc like that and the pc was instantly cleared and you didnt even have to say it in sudden tone of voice or anything else you could say one word boojum and the next word boojum it wouldnt matter and so forth why youd be all set but unfortunately this small fact stands in your road of that is pcs dont go clear when you say boojum boojum boojum to them it takes model session it takes very accurate reading of the meter and it takes very set pattern that has been piloted through with vast ardure and is rather narrow road actually at the same time i think narrow road can be followed so as to pitch over the edge of the nearest cliff you see and it can also be followed rather easily and comfortably but even mule has to have some judgment to go up one its bad judgment to introduce too many arbitraries its bad judgment to put in too much freedom and its also very bad judgment to be so damn fixed to what youre doing that you never look up and find what has to be done in the session see your auditing actually becomes happy mean amongst those things and if you do that well why youll really get there youll really make clears weve got several people coming up to clear this minute and isnt it interesting that the people who are coming up toward clear and so forth are being audited by the auditors who do the best model session and best reading of the meters i dont think its any coincidence at all itll inevitably be that way but im also saying that in those sessions where people are going in that direction and coming up to clear there must have been little judgment sitting there in the auditors chair do you follow that all right so there is the razor edge we walk and that razor edge of course spells success thank you
