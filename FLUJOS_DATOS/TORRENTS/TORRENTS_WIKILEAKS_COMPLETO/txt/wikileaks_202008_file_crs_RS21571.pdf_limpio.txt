extend the mcfl exception to the section 441b prohibition on cor porate treasury fund direct contributions as applied to taxexempt corporations the district court granted summary judgment to ncrl and held that the prohibition is unconstitutional as applied to ncrl4likewise the us court of appeals for the fourth circuit ruled that the ban was unconstitutional as applied to ncrl relying primarily on the supreme courts decision in mcfl according to the fourth circuit the rationale behind the mcfl exception for independent expenditures made by entities that do not accept significant corporate or labor union money also applies to contributions and as an mcfl type corporation nrcl is constitutionally exempt from the prohibition5 supreme court decision on june 16 2003 in 72 decision the supreme court in fec v beaumont6 reversed the fourth circuit and reaffirmed the prohibition on allcorporations making direct treasury contributions in connection w ith federal elections and upheld the ban on corporate contributions as applied to ncrl maintaining the distinction between contributions and expenditures the cour t found that limits on contributions are more clearly justified under the first amendmen t than limits on expenditures because of their greater link to corruption7httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21571crs3 8idat 220506 citing united states v automobile workers 352 us 567 585 1957 9494 us

federal prohibition against corporate contributions from tr easury funds is contrary to century of congressional efforts to curb the potential of cor porate deleterious influences on federal elections the current law originated from public opinion in the late 19thcentury that aggregated capital unduly influenced politic s an influence not stopping short of corruption which resulted in president th eodore roosevelt supporting enactment of the tillman act of 1907 the first fede ral statute to prohibit corporate political contributions the court noted that the public policy interest behind todays law still focuses on restricting the influence of political war che sts funneled through the corporate structure that threaten the integrity of the political process8in elaborating on the rationale behind the prohibition the court quoted from its 1990 decision in austin v michigan chamber of commerce state law grants corporations special advantages such as limited liability perpetual life and favorable treatment of the accumulation and distribution of assets that enhance their ability to attract capital and to deploy their resources in ways that maximize the return on their shareholders investments these statecreated advantages not only allow corporations to play dominant role in the nations economy but also permit them to use resources amassed in the economic marketplace to obtain an unfair advantage in the political marketplace9 the court further stated that subsequent amendments to the federal election law have consistently strengthened the original core prohibition on direct corporate treasury contributions and as its decision in austin v michigan chamber of commerce and other recent supreme court campaign finance opinions have demonstrated the rationale behind the prohibition has endured10 in addition to preventing corruption or t he appearance of corruption the court found that the prohibition on corporate treasury f und contributions protects individuals who have paid money into corporation for r easons other than to support candidates from having their money used to support candida tes to whom they may be opposed moreover the court determined that the prohibition protects against corporation serving as conduit for circumvention f valid contribution limits11that is the persons who created own or are employed by the corporation could exceed their individual contribution limits by diverting money through the corporation which could in turn make political contributions invoking its recent d ecision regarding limits on coordinated expenditures by political parties the court cautioned experience demonstrates how candidates donors and partie s test the limits of the current law and it shows beyondhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21571crs4 12idquoting

220910serious doubt how contribution limits would be roded if inducement to circumvent them were enhanced12 in summarizing its findings the court emphasized that its campaign finance decisions represent respect for the legislative judgment that the special characteristics of the corporate structure require particular ly careful regulation nd demonstrate that the court understands that such deference to gislative choice is particularly warranted when congress regulates campaign contribu tions carrying as they do plain threat to political integrity and plain warrant to count er the appearance and reality of corruption and the misuse of corporate advantages13the court also clarified that limits on contributions are more clearly justified than limits on other kinds of political spending corruption being understood not only as quid pro quo agreements but also as undue influence on an officeholders judgment nd the appearance of such influence14 turning to the specific question of whether 2 usc 441b applies to ncrl the court determined that its holding in fec v national right to work comm as interpreted bysubsequent court decisions generallya pproves of the applicabilityof the section 441b prohibition to taxexempt corporations wit hout great financial resources for example infec v national conservative political action comm the court noted that it interpreted national right to work as consistent with the well established constitutional validity of regulating corporate contributions including contributions by membership corporations that might not exhibit all the evil that contributions by traditional economicallyorgani zed corporations exhibit15stating its refusal to second guess legislative determination as to the need for prophylactic measures where corruption is the evil feared the court rejected the argument that deference to congressional judgments is determined by wh ether the corporations affected by regulation are forprofit or nonprofit16 the fourth circuit relied on mcfl in concluding that section 441b cannot constitutionally apply to taxexempt advo cacy corporation such as ncrl however mcfl made an important distinction between restrictions on contributions and restrictions on expenditures ierestrictions on contributions require less compelling justification than restricti ons on independent spending17inbeaumont the court found that the corrupting potential underlying th ban on using corporate treasury funds may indeed be implicated byadvocacycorporations18like forprofit corporations nonprofit advocacy corporations enjoy substantial stateconferred advantages are able to amasshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21571crs5 19idat 2207 indeed the court further notes that so of the most powerful organizations in the us are taxexempt advocacy corporations such as the american association of retired persons the national rifle asso ciation and the sierra club idat 220910 20the court explained that while contributions may result in political expression if spent by candidate or an association the transforma tion of contributions into political debate involves speech by someone other than the contributor idat 2210 quoting buckley 424 us at 2021 21idquoting buckley 424 us at 25 cfaustin 494 us at 657 22in the courts view the pac option allows co rporate political participation without the temptation to use corporate funds for political influence quite possibly at odds with the sentiments of some shareholders or members and it lets the government regulate campaign activity through registration and disclosure see 432434 without jeopardizing the associational rights of advocacy organizations members idat 2211 23idciting national right to work 459 us at 201significant funds for political use and are also capable of serving as conduits for individuals attempting to circumvent contribution limits19 thebeaumont court also clarified the standard for review applicable to campaign finance regulation under the first amendmen t in the view of the court determining the appropriate standard of review depends on th nature of the activity being regulated commencing with its 1976 ruling in buckley the court said that it has treated the regulation of contributions as only marginal speech restriction subject to relatively complaisant review under the first amendment since contributions are less direct form of speech than expenditures20hence the court concluded that instead of requiring contribution regulation to pass strict scrutiny by meeting the requirement that it be narrowly tailored to serve compelling governmental interest contribution regulation involving significant interference with asso ciational rights passe s constitutional muster by merely satisfying the lesser requirement of being closely drawn to match sufficientlyimportant interest21with regard to the section 441b prohibition the court held that it passes this lower level of scrutiny because it does not render complete ban on corporate contributions iecorporations are still per mitted to use treasury funds to establish solicit funds for and pay the ad ministrative expenses of political action committee or pac which can then in turn make contributions22invoking its unanimous holding in fec v national right to work the court rejected the argument that the regulatoryburdens on pacs inc luding restrictions on their abilityto solicit funds renders pac unconstitutional as the only way that corporation can make political contributions23 in summary the supreme court in fec v beaumont upheld the ban on corporate contributions as applied to ncrl because corporate campaign contributions including contributions by taxexempt advocacy cor porations pose risk of harm to the political system consequently the courts owe defer ence to legislative judgments on how best to address their risk of harm and limits on cont ributions are merely marginal speech restrictions subject to relatively compl aisant or lesser review under the first amendment than the strict scrutiny standard of review in his dissent justice thomas joined by j ustice scalia maintained that the strict scrutiny standard of review should apply in beaumont and that under that standardhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21571crs6 24idat 2211 25linda greenhouse supreme court roundup ban on corporat contributions is upheld ny times

implications for bcra in mcconnell v fec the supreme courts ruling in fec v beaumont has prompted commentary regarding possible implications for the pending campaign finance litigation mcconnell v fec

corporations including ban on corporations using treasuryfunds to pay for electioneerin g communications 30 days before primary and 60 days before general election section 203 it does not affect the statutory provision that was upheld in beaumont among other provisions bcra also prohibits political parties from raising unregulated soft money contributions from corporations and labor unions section 101 on the one hand commentators supporting bcra infer from the beaumont ruling that the court will continue to exercise deference to legislative choice in order to uphold key provisions of bcra25in addition bcra supporters note that beaumont expressly held that prohibiting corporate treasury contributions does not violate the first amendment because corporations are still pe rmitted to use treasury funds to establish solicit funds for and pay the administrative expenses of pac which can then in turn make political contributions26 on the other hand commentators cha llenging the cons titutiona lity of bcra emphasize that the beaumont decision narrowly affirms corporate contribution limits and is restricted to the issue of campaign contributions while the mcconnell case involves political expenditures27any implications for bcra they maintain are extremely narrow28
