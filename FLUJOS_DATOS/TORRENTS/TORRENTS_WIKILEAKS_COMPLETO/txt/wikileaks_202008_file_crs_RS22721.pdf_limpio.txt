tidal and instream energy projects which federal agency has the lead nic lane analyst in natural resources policy resources science and industry division summary developments in wave tidal and instr eam energy generation technologies also referred to as hydrokinetic or marine energy are beginning to gain momentum at the same time their regulatory status is still evolving as shown by recent changes in law aimed at clarifying the federal role in cean wave and renewable energy two federal agencies currently appear to have lead ro in offshore renewable energy projects the department of the interiors mine rals management service mms indicates that the energy policy act of 2005 388 gave it authority as the lead agency for projects proposed on the outer continental shelf ocs mms is developing regulatory framework and is not accepting applications for hydrokinetic and other alternative energy projects until its rulemaking process is complete the federal energy regulatory commission ferc has issued preliminary permits and accepted license pplications for hydrokinetic projects on the ocs and in the nearshore ocean environment also ferc is developing licensing process specific to hydrokinetic projects the i ssue of which agency has final regulatory authority over hydrokinetic projects that ar partially or completely on the ocs is unresolved and may affect project development in this burgeoning industry background electric generation projects that are designed to harness the power of waves tides or river currents without dam or impoundment are known as hydrokinetic or marine energy projects while the technolog to harness this energy is still in the developmental stage interest has increased in exploring this potential source of electric power for example projects are being c onsidered in number of states including alaska california hawaii louisiana maine new york new jersey oregon rhode island and washington special temporar license exemption was issued for prototype tidal energy project in new yorks east river and fede ral energy regulatory commission ferc hydropower license the first for this type of project is pending for wave energy

development see crs report rl33883 issues affecting tidal wave and instream generation projects by nic lane 4 the ocs is composed of the submerged lands subsoil and sea bed lying between the seaward extent of the states jurisdiction and the seawar d extent of federal jurisdiction typically this is the area between 3 and 200 nautical miles opportunities in this sector congress has in troduced legislation to support and regulate this nascent industry epact the 109th congress considered legislation related to hydroki netic power in particular the energy policy act of 2005 epact1 addresses wave tidal and instream energy directly or indirectly in number of ways epact addresses federal jurisdiction over and development of alternative energy sources title ii contains provisions for assessing and reporting on renewable energy resources by the department of energy it also establishes incentives for renewable energy production specifies benchmarks for renewable energy purchases by federal fac ilities and authorizes grants supporting rural electrification with preference given to renewable energy facilities section 931 directs the secretary of energy to establish rd programs for

2005 granted mms additional aut hority to act as the lead federal agency for offshore renewable energy projects mms views its primary authorities under epact 388 to be 1 granting leases easements nd rightsofway for renewable energyrelated uses on federal ocs lands 2 acting as the lead agency for coordinating the permitting process with other federal agencies and 3 monitoring and regulating facilities used for renewable energy production nd energy support services5 mms has issued final programmatic environmental impact statement peis analyzing the environmental impact of progra m to develop hydroki netic energy projects on the ocs it anticipates issuing final rule on the process of lease application and energy project development in the fall of 20086 mms will not issue decisions on hydrokinetic energy projects until final rule is established7 but indicates that in advance of final rule it has established an inter im process that includes limitedterm leases to allow data collection and technology testing but commercialscale project development8 mms has received over 40 nomina tions for these limited use leases9 additionally mms has released proposed rule s for alternative energy projects on the ocs with 60day comment period10 the proposed rules indicate that two types of leases may be available fo r project sponsors commercia l and limited commercial leases would have term up to 25 years and allo w full commercial ener gy production limited leases would have shorter fiveyear rm and are intended for site assessment technology testing and ot her precommerc ial activities11 epact 388 stipulates that mms aut hority does not supercede the existing authority of any other agency for hydrokinetic project permitting so it is possible that wave or tidal energy project on the ocs may also require ferc license to operate although leasing and environmental re view would be conducted by mms12 mms indicates that it intends to finalize its rulemaking process by

ferc 61248hydropower projects15 there has been debate about fercs jurisdiction over hydrokinetic projects in rivers and inland waters but ther may be some question about its authority over these projects in the ocean ferc has asserted that its authority includes hydrokinetic projects in the ocean up to 12 miles from shore16 ferc supports this statement with citations to the fpa17 and presidential pr oclamation 592818 which extended the territorial sea19 and thus ferc asserts its jurisdicti on to 12 nautical miles further ferc has indicated that project features such as undersea anchors or transmission lines leading to grid conn ection on the shore would occupy land under federal jurisdiction thereby requiring the pr oject to have ferc license in addition ferc has stated that it considers hydrokine tic energy facilities to be powerhouses as defined by the fpa licensing provision20 and has indicated that it considers wave and tidal projects that connect to the electric gr id to be affecting interstate commerce thus requiring ferc license21 ferc had issued over 100 pre liminary permits for develope rs to study hydrokinetic project sites and dozens more preliminary permit applications are pending approval22 preliminary permit is not license to construct and operate project but rather grantsthe applicant the right to study an area for suitability of project development prior to formal license application additionally fe rc has finalized the first license for hydrokinetic project under new conditi onal license program see mmsferc conflict below 23 mmsferc

pre liminary per mits for similar projects on the ocs24 the three reasons mms cites are as follows fpagranted jurisdiction for ferc does not explicitly extend on to the ocs further mms refutes fercs claim that presidential proclamation 5928 also extends ferc authority to 12 nautical miles in support of this point mms refers to pr oclamation language indi cating that nothing in this proclamation extends or otherwise alters existing federal or state law or any jurisdiction rights gal interests or obligations derived therefrom25 mms stresses that 388 of epact sp ecifically grants it authority for renewable energy projects on the ocs mms says that fercs existing hydropower permitting and licensing process is inappropriate for hydr okinetic energy projects on the ocs because preliminary per mits may reserve large areas of potential development to the first applicant rather than to the best applicant also mms says that 30 to 50year license is too long for prototype projects at least one preliminary per mit applicant in the instan ce cited above subsequently submitted additional information for its permit application rec onfiguring to project area located in state waters within three nautical miles of shore thus avoiding the ocs and any issue of mms jurisdiction26 ferc issued preliminary permit for the project reflecting the modified footprint of the site provided by the applicant27 ferc has since posted notice of inquiry soliciting comments on its preliminary permitting procedure and outlining its inter im policy on the issue the agency has received numerous comments from project propone nts state agencies and tribal entities pending final resolution it w ill continue to issue prelimin ary permits for hydrokinetic projects under stricter scrutiny policy ferc states that pre liminary permits will be issued with more limited project boundaries and that required project progress reports will be given closer review28 although crs has found public ferc response to the mms protests it appears that for period of appr oximately one year following the protests none of the preliminary permits issued were for projects that reach onto the ocs however in

the interi or has filed request for rehearing of the ferc order issuing those permits29 ferc has since reasserted its authority over projects on the ocs and denied the department of th interiors request for rehearing30 ferc has developed modified license for hy drokinetic pilot projects this process is available immediately for interested par ties though the agency is accepting comments on the process in order to refine it ferc held technical conference on october 2 2007 to seek feedback from stakeholders on the new license the goal of the hydrokinetic license is to eliminate barriers to development by reducing processing time to as little as six months allowing installati on of test equipment and allo wing power generation to the grid the license requires that projects have size of five megawatts or less be easily removed or deactivated and be installed for longer than fiveyear term there are additional provisions for site decommissioning and project changes or equipment removal if unexpected environmental impacts arise31 further ferc has also developed conditional license unlike the pilot license program this is full project operating li cense that allows applicants to begin non construction activities while some permitting processes such as water quality certification are still pending ferc and mms are on separate tracks to develop regula tory processes for energy projects in the ocean however the issue of ultimate regulatory authority for projects entirely or partially on the ocs remains the uncertainty over lead regulatory status on the ocs is an important issue that may disc ourage investors in this developing industry under the current regulatory framework proj ect owners may be reluctant to develop sites beyond three nautical mile s to avoid the possibility of regulatory duplication the final configuration of each agencys regulatory framework could have major impact on projectsiting decisions developers may decide to site projects completely on one side of the threemile ocs boundary depending on which regulatory process they deem to be more favorable this type of approach could distort the i ndustrys development or leave otherwise promisin g sites undeveloped
