confidence date tue 20 jan 2004 102709 0700 cc scott rutherford srutherfordrwuedu mannvirginiaedu mike you are right that we should probably leave the network uncahnged for this mss in fact however as keith indicated the vaganov data probably retained fair amount of low frequency because of the use of the corridor method ie were not heavily standardized cheers malcolm on 20 jan 2004 at 758 michael mann wrote thanks keith i agree w thisi think the vaganov chronologies were pretty heavily standardized and the other issues you raise are important in the future we would and will be bit more circumspect about the use of some of these data in the present case however i think we are forced to use the exact same network re the omission of some results i think we can probably keep them simply by cleaning up the text removing redundancy etc ive shortened and tightened the manuscript considerably and i think ive improved the logical flow bit in the process so my feeling is that we will not have to split this up but ill leave this to all of you to decide after you see the revised draft from scott and thanks mike at 0945 am 1202004 0000 keith briffa wrote malcolm seems to have done good job sorting out these constituent sets and i dont have anything to add other than agreeing that as general principal where possible original chronologies should be used in preference to reconstructed temperature series the latter having been already optimized using simple or multiple regression to fit the target temperature series this applies not only to our western us reconstructions which it should be stressed are based on very flexible curve fitting in the standardisation and inevitably can show little variance on time scales longer than decade or so but also to the tornetrask and polar urals reconstructions each of which was based on ring width and density data but standardised to try to preserve centennial variability though the density series had by far the largest regression coefficients there is though question regarding the pcs of the siberian network presumably provided by eugene the correlation between density and ring width can get high in central and eastern parts of the network so even though these are different variables it might not be strictly true to think of them as truly independent statistically of the density chronologies we use from the schweingruber network there may also be standardisation issue here as the density chronologies were standardised with hugershoff functions for our initial network work as reported in the holocene special issue whereas your pc amplitudes may be based on corridor standardisation which likely preserves less low frequency these remarks are simply for clarification and discussion and i too will wait on your response draft though i would throw in the pot the fact that omitting the time dependent stuff would simplify the message at his stage cheers keith at 0142 pm 11904 0700 malcolm hughes wrote mike there are the following density data in that set 1 20 schweingruberfrttss series from the itrdb those that met the criteria described in the mann et 2000 ei paper 2 northern fennoscandia reconstruction from keith 3 northern urals reconstruction from keith 4 1 density series for china hughes data and one from india also hughes data neither included in keiths data set i think 5 to my great surprise i find that you used the briffa gridded temperature reconstruction from w n america misattributed to fritts and shao of course i should have picked up on this 6 years ago when reading the proofs of the nature sup mat it was my understanding that we had decided not to use these reconstructions as the data on which they were based were in the itrdb and had been subject to that screening process so depending on whether you used the long or the shorter versions of these there will have been considerable number of density series included some of them twice it means that there is considerably more overlap between the two data sets in north america than i have been telling people i stand corrected cheers malcolm malcolm hughes professor of dendrochronology laboratory of
