member spending on domestic support summary under the world trade organizations wtos agreement on agriculture aa member countries agreed to general rules regarding disciplines on domestic subsidies as well as on export subsidies and market access the aas goal was to provide framework for the leading members of the wto to make changes in their domestic farm policies to facilitate more open trade under the aa domestic spending is disaggregated according to those outlays that have the greatest potential to distort agricultural markets ie amber box and therefore are subject to spending limits and more benign outlays ie which cause less market distortion that are exempted from spending limits under green box blue box minimis or special and differential treatment exemptions of the 148 members in the wto on february 16 2005 35 had made specific commitments to reduce domestic spending based on review of the 19952001 period for which wto member data are available wto policy commitments appear to have either reduced or redirected domestic subsidies away from marketdistorting policies and towards programs of the exempt categories in addition amber box spending generally has declined relative to spending limits notable exception to these trends is the united states where domestic support has trended higher both in total value and as share of wto spending limits during 19952001 three wto members the 15member european union eu15 the united states and japan dominated every wto category of domestic support spending together they accounted for over 90 of amber box spending by wto members the eu15 had commanding 60 share compared with 19 for japan and 13 for the united states however policy reforms in the eu15 and japan have helped to reduce their amber box spending in recent years both in total value and as share of the amber box ceiling eu15 amber box spending has declined steadily from 665 billion in 1995 to 348 billion in 2001 while the outlaytoceiling average share has held fairly steady at about 65 japans amber box outlays have fallen from 368 billion an outlaytoceiling share of 73 in 1995 to 53 billion 17 in 2001 us amber box spending has trended higher from an average of 61 billion during 199597 to 16 billion during 19992001 as share of its wto ceiling us amber box spending has risen from 27 to 83 during those same two periods tightening gap between wto spending limits and outlays has the potential to constrain flexibility and policy choices in considering ways to assist domestic agricultural producers as well as to limit trade negotiators in the ongoing doha round of trade negotiations in contrast widening gap between the amber box ceiling and actual outlays represents greater negotiating power for future cuts

agriculture in the wto member spending on domestic support introduction under the world trade organizations wtos agreement on agriculture aa member countries agreed to general rules regarding disciplines on domestic and export subsidies and concessions on market access1 with respect to domestic subsidies the aas goal was to provide framework for the leading members of the wto to make changes in their domestic farm policies to facilitate more open trade domestic programs deemed at the time to have the greatest potential for stimulating excess production and thereby distorting world trade in various agricultural commodities became subject to annual subsidy limits of the 148 members in the wto on february 17 2005 35 had made specific commitments to reduce domestic spending as measured by the aggregate measure of support ams in the initial wto agreement 26 countries out of 125 members made ams reduction commitments between january 1 1995 and february 17 2005 an additional 23 countries joined the wto of these newly acceded countries nine had also made specific ams commitments see appendix tables 24 for list of countries with ams reduction commitments this report focuses solely on the commitments made by wto member countries concerning government outlays in support of domestic agricultural production the introductory section provides brief overview of wto domestic policy commitments as well as background information on wto member requirements for reporting on domestic subsidy outlays in the second section wto member outlays made to support agricultural production as reported in member notifications to the wtos committee on agriculture are discussed following the wto reporting format domestic spending is disaggregated according to those outlays that count against spending limits ie amber box and those outlays that are exempted from spending limits ie green box blue box minimis or special and differential treatment sdt exemptions special attention is paid to the spending levels and exemptions for the three major wto members the united states the 15member european union eu15 and japan together these three entities account for over 90 of all domestic agricultural subsidies reported by wto members the third and final section describes in more detail us agricultural support outlays and compares them against spending limits in addition it briefly discusses the implications for us agricultural policy of continued adherence to existing wto commitments 1 for information on the full range of member commitments see crs report rl32916 agriculture in the wto policy commitments made under the agreement on agriculture crs2 data on domestic support by wto members have been assembled from available notifications and are presented in series of appendix tables appendix tables 19 at the end of this report detailed data on us domestic support as notified to the wto are presented in appendix tables 1013 these tables are referenced throughout this report domestic support commitments domestic support broadly refers to those agricultural policies that operate within country so as to influence internal farm and rural incomes resource use production and consumption of agricultural products or the environmental impacts of farming the agreement on agriculture aa recognizes that individual wto member countries reserve the right and may be obligated by their electorates to use domestic support policies to pursue various national policy objectives as result the aa distinguishes between support programs that have direct effect on agricultural production and those that are deemed minimally trade or production distorting the aa commits countries to discipline their domestic farm subsidies primarily by establishing an annual dollar limit on those policies determined to have the greatest potential to distort markets while allowing exemptions for less distortive policies negotiators not the agreement itself used colorcoded analogy based on traffic light for these program categories as described below for detailed description of domestic support criteria in accordance with wto commitments see crs report rs20840 agriculture in the wto limits on domestic support amber box policies those policies deemed most likely to cause producers to divert resources into or out of the production of various commodities thus affecting supplies and world prices are categorized as amber box policies by the wto in the traffic light analogy amber signifies proceed with caution subject to rules and commitments each wto country with such policies has its own dollar limitation termed its aggregate measurement of support ams annex 3 of the aa specifies the methods countries must use to calculate their ams for example an ams must be calculated on productspecific basis for each agricultural product supported supports that are not productspecific for example irrigation subsidies must be aggregated into one nonproduct specific ams national and subnational eg state support must be counted levies or fees on producers are subtracted from the ams calculation examples of such policies or programs include price supports where the government ensures that the farm price of particular commodity will not fall beneath prescribed level direct payments tied to each unit of commodity currently produced subsidies on such inputs as fertilizer seed irrigation or feed and subsidized crop loans each wto member agreed that total annual subsidies for its amber box policies its ams would not exceed base period level generally 19861988 in addition 35 of these countries including the united states and most other major agricultural traders agreed to gradually reduce the maximum permitted levels of crs3 amber box support each year using the ams calculation to determine this support the rates of spending reduction and the length of the implementation period varied according to countrys status as either developed developing or leastdeveloped in general the developed countries agreed to reduce their total ams by 20 from their base period over sixyear period of implementation 19952000 developing countries agreed to 13 reduction over 10year period 19952004 least developed countries agreed to not increase support beyond the base period level each members ams for the final year of implementation is the bound level applying to each succeeding year until new trade agreement is negotiated reductions do not have to be made equally across commodities or on commodity bycommodity basis each country can decide which programs to reduce and how in order to meet its obligation individual country negotiations resulted in some variation from these general rules the list of specific commitments along with their implementation period are spelled out for each member country in its schedule of concessions also referred to as its country schedule2 new members that join the wto must negotiate their specific policy commitments also detailed in country schedule during their accession negotiations commitments made by wto members could potentially constrain their flexibility and spending choices when they consider ways to assist their agricultural producers at home in other words wto member might not be able to undertake or expand domestic farm program if that action would cause the member to exceed the annual support limit it agreed to as wto member nation these constraints also apply to the united states which was leading voice for agricultural trade reforms including reductions in tradedistorting domestic subsidies exemptions from ams reduction commitments the aa defines four categories of domestic support that are eligible for exemption from ams reduction commitments green box blue box minimis and special and differential treatment sdt exemptions the aa describes the general conditions that policy must meet to qualify for one of these four exemptions however each country may have its own interpretation of the wto conditions as result country notifications3 are the primary means for determining 1 how country has chosen to categorize its domestic subsidies and 2 whether country is fully meeting its ams reduction commitments disagreements between or among wto members over whether certain subsidies have been correctly categorized ie as exempt from or subject to ams reduction commitments often give rise to wto dispute settlement cases where the issue is ruled on by wto dispute settlement panel4 2 each wto members schedule of concessions is available at httpwwwwtoorg englishtratop_eschedules_egoods_schedules_ehtm 3 see monitoring implementation of commitments section below for explanation of notifications 4 for more information see crs report rs20088 dispute settlement in the world continued crs4 green box certain types of domestic subsidies that do not distort trade or at most cause minimal distortion while achieving various domestic policy goals are exempted from domestic support disciplines5 complying policies include outlays for activities such as agricultural research and extension conservation and the environment rural development food security stocks domestic food aid eg food stamps farm disaster payments and structural adjustment programs also exempted are decoupled payments that is payments not linked to current production decisions such as commodity direct payments these specific exemptions are referred to as green in the trafficlight sense since countries can go ahead with these policies without limit blue box direct payments may qualify for exemption in the blue box from ams reduction commitments if they are made under productionlimiting programs for crops this includes those payment programs based on fixed area and yield or based on more than 85 of base production for livestock production this includes those payments tied to fixed number of livestock there are limits on blue box spending minimis exemptions the idea behind the minimis exemption is that small levels of domestic support matter what their nature are deemed sufficiently benign ie not likely to distort trade that they do not have to be included in the ams calculation the minimis exemption may be applied to domestic subsidies at two levels productspecific ie support that applies to specific product such as wheat sugar etc and nonproduct specific eg irrigation if total nonproduct specific subsidies are below 5 10 for developing countries of the value of developed countrys total agricultural production then they do not have to be included in the ams calculation in order to evaluate productspecific subsidy first total all forms of nonexempt support for that particular commodity then apply the 5 rule to the value of production for that specific commodity for countries that have ams reduction commitment in their schedules domestic support is limited to their minimis values on both productspecific and nonproductspecific basis for any given year special and differential treatment sdt exemptions certain types of government assistance in developing countries and ldcs are exempt from support reduction commitments6 these include both direct and indirect domestic investment in agriculture and rural development as well as agricultural input subsidies generally available to lowincome or resourcepoor producers in developing countries also included are investments intended to encourage diversification away from growing illicit narcotic crops 4 continued trade organization 5 the types of green box policies are identified in annex 2 of the agreement on agriculture aa at httpwwwwtoorgenglishdocs_elegal_e14agpdf 6 for more details see article 62 of the aa crs5 monitoring implementation of commitments to provide for monitoring and compliance of wto policy commitments the uruguay round established committee on agriculture and assigned it the duty of reviewing progress in the implementation of individual member commitments notification of domestic support each wto member country is expected to routinely submit reports called notifications on the implementation of its domestic support commitments for monitoring and review by the wto committee on agriculture these notifications serve as the primary source of information about each countrys domestic agricultural subsidy outlays and on how such subsidies have been classified as exempt from or as subject to reduction commitments although the aa has firm deadlines for notifications the committee on agriculture has adopted explicit notification requirements and formats that member countries are expected to follow see appendix table 1 in this report for details7 in general members with base and annual domestic support commitments should submit notifications on domestic support implementation later than 120 days following the end of the marketing year choosing marketing year wto members are given considerable flexibility in defining the 12month marketing year most relevant to their situation countries may choose between calendar fiscal or marketing year as their implementation year as result the marketing year reporting period and notification duedate vary widely across countries some countries including the united states report their ams data using mixture of different commodity marketing years for example the 2001 marketing year for us wheat began in june 2001 and ended in may 2002 the corn marketing year began in september 2001 and ended in august 2002 most us livestock activities are reported on calendar year basis usda analysts who prepare the notifications must wait until after the end of each commoditys marketing year when all spending and program details become available then more time typically is needed to review and calculate expenditures and organize them into wto formats and categories overdue notifications although all wto members agreed to abide by their commitments and to provide notifications of their implementation status the wto has formal method for enforcing such promises as result delays in submitting notifications have become nearly routine for most wto members and substantial number of notifications has fallen overdue the wto committee on agriculture releases occasional reports detailing the status of members implementation of policy commitments see appendix table 2 7 for more information see crs report rl32916 agriculture in the wto policy commitments made under the agreement on agriculture the wto source document is notification requirements and formats gag2 june 30 1995 crs6 according to wto data through june 1 2005 1995 was the sole year for which all members with domestic support reduction commitments for that year had submitted notification for 2000 out of 30 countries with commitments 25 or 83 had notified for 2003 of the 35 countries with commitments 8 or 23 had notified and 27 were overdue including the united states the most recent us notification was for 2001 which was not submitted until march 17 20048 some particularly egregious examples of overdue notifications include brazil mexico switzerlandliechtenstein and venezuela whose most recent notifications of domestic support are for 1998 their 1999 notifications of domestic support are now approximately five years late with respect to compliance the wto again has enforcement mechanism instead individual members may bring case against another member in the event of apparent noncompliance with policy commitments however the burden of proof is upon the accuser whose case is made all the more difficult if the accused member has failed to keep up with annual notifications issues with subsidy categorization and reporting wto trade negotiators and countries that rely heavily on them consider domestic support subsidies made under the four exemption categories to be more virtuous ie cause less market distortion than amber box spending however some market analysts and wto members argue that these exemption categories as well as the entire notification process have two principal faults first categorizing and reporting exempted subsidies are largely selfpoliced that is each member country has some discretion in determining whether subsidy is green or amber and if it is the latter in calculating its value for wto reporting purposes second critics maintain that the various exemption categories have been used by few countries primarily the eu15 and the united states to shield some large subsidies from any required cutbacks creation of the blue box is cited as an example of an exemption designed strictly to protect the eu15s compensatory payments similarly the united states heavy use of the minimis exclusion is often characterized as dodge of subsidy commitments defenders of the language in the wtos aa argue that criteria for defining ams outlays as exempt or nonexempt are sufficiently explicit to prevent wto members from undermining the basic objectives of the uruguay round agreement furthermore they contend that the agricultural policy commitments made under the uruguay round and the aa represent the first meaningful attempt to bring the agricultural sector under any significant discipline therefore since consensus was paramount it could have been unhelpful from the pointofview of reaching final agreement if the trade negotiators had tried to overreach on the extent of disciplines to be imposed on domestic support 8 wto document gagnusa51 march 17 2005 available at httpdocsonlinewto org crs7 domestic support comparisons among wto members total ams spending as notified by all wto members has been broken into exempt and nonexempt categories for comparison in figure 1 total domestic support declined from 2949 billion in 1995 to 1893 billion in 2001 36 decline this period encompasses all of the implementation period 19952000 for developed countries the decline in domestic support spending was expected to continue albeit slower through 2004 the final implementation year for developing countries since 18 of the 35 current wto members with ams reduction commitments are developing countries appendix table 2 shows the status of wto member notifications on domestic support as of january 14 2005 because so few wto members have notified their domestic support activity for the 20022004 period the following discussion focuses on the 19952001 period where data are sufficient to permit valid comparisons figure 1 total domestic subsidies for agriculture all wto members 19952001 300 amber box exemptions 250 200 150 100 50 0 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 source usdaers wto database and recent wto member notifications subsidies that are exempted from ams reduction commitments most of the ams decline 58 occurred in amber box outlays which fell by over onehalf from an aggregate of 1192 billion in 1995 to 584 billion in 2001 total spending on exempt policy categories also exhibited decline but by smaller amount 25 from 1757 billion to 1309 billion as result of this uneven rate of decline total exempt spending increased steadily as share of total ams spending rising from 58 share in 1995 to 69 share by 2001 it is likely that significant portion of the decline in amber box spending resulted from shifting of domestic subsidies from the marketdistorting policies of the amber box category to more virtuous programs that qualify for one of the wto exemption categories crs8 the pattern of rapidly declining amber box spending relative to exempt ams spending holds for all major wto members with the exception of the united states in contrast to the rest of the world both amber box spending as well as exempt spending by the united states trended higher through this initial sevenyear period of review with amber box spending increasing at generally faster rate than exempt spending see the third section of this report implications for us agriculture for discussion of us domestic support data on ams spending by categories both exempt and nonexempt are presented in appendix tables 38 it is noteworthy that three wto members the 15member european union eu159 the united states and japan dominate nearly every ams spending category appendix table 9 to better contrast the preeminence of domestic support by these 3 members from the other 145 members of the wto data are disaggregated as the eu15 the united states japan and restofworld row group using this breakout wto member spending under each of the ams categories is discussed below amber box ceiling and outlays under an ams spending limit wto member commits to not exceed an established amber box spending level as point of reference the united states amber box spending limit began from base of 239 billion during 198688 but declined in six successive annual steps to 191 billion in 2000 in any year after that or until new negotiating round is concluded us amber box outlays cannot exceed 191 billion this compares with the amber box ceiling of 598 billion 672 billion euro for the eu15 and 359 billion 3973 billion yen for japan in 2000 strengthening of the euro and yen against the us dollar resulted in rising dollar value for both the eu15s and japans amber box ceiling in 2004 to 833 billion and 363 billion respectively10 in 2000 the eu15 the united states and japan accounted for over 80 of the aggregate wto amber box ceiling only two other wto members had amber box limits above 3 billion in 2000 mexico at 88 billion and poland at 33 billion appendix table 3 shows base period and annual amber box commitments and final year bound commitments as well as the final implementation years fiys for those wto members with ams reduction commitments in general the fiy was 2000 for developed countries and 2004 for developing countries however three countries that acceded after january 1 1995 have alternate fiys jordan 2006 lithuania 2005 and the former yugoslav republic fyr of macedonia 2003 appendix table 4 shows actual annual amber box outlays the eu15 accounted for commanding 59 of all amber box outlays during 19952001 compared with shares of 19 for japan and 13 for the united states figure 2 9 on may 1 2004 the eu15 added 10 new members however aggregate data for the expanded eu25 will not appear until notification for the 2004 marketing year is submitted 10 this is purely an artifact of exchange rate fluctuations and does not represent loosening of in either the eu15s or japans true ams ceiling since both countries undertake all of their domestic policy subsidies in euros and yen respectively crs9 together the eu15 the united states and japan have accounted for over 90 of all actual amber box spending by wto members figure 2 amber box outlays eu15 united states japan and rest of world 19952001 120 restofworld japan 100 united states eur union15 80 60 40 20 0 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 source usdaers wto database and recent wto member notifications the eu15s actual amber box spending has declined steadily from 644 billion in 1995 to 352 billion in 2001 figure 2 this decline has been in lock step with the eu15s declining amber box ceiling and has resulted in fairly steady outlayto ceiling average share of 64 figure 3 large gap between the amber box ceiling and actual outlays is significant because it represents real negotiating power for future cuts in wto amber box ceiling levels without sacrificing domestic policy flexibility the eu15s ability to easily absorb further ceiling cuts has been enhanced since 2000 by series of internal agricultural policy reforms which are expected to dramatically reduce its amber box spending both in total value and as share of its amber box ceiling11 key element of recent eu policy reforms has been reorientation of subsidy payments away from coupled payments ie subsidies that are linked directly to producer behavior and are therefore subject to amber box reduction commitments to decoupled payments ie minimally distortive subsidies that are linked only indirectly to producer behavior and are therefore eligible for exemption from reduction commitments these reforms are thus expected to give the eu15 much greater flexibility in negotiating cuts in ams spending in future wto trade negotiations 11 major eu agricultural policy reforms include agenda 2000 and the cap reform of 200304 for more information see usda ers cap reform of 200304 wrs0407 august 2004 at httpwwwersusdagovpublicationswrs0407

usdaers wto database and recent wto member notifications since the mid1990s japan has been gradually reforming its domestic policy including the removal of government controls over its wholesale and retail rice markets12 as result market prices for rice traditionally japans largest crop have been declining however producer prices remain substantially above international market prices due to stringent import barriers in 1998 japan abandoned its program of administered producer prices in favor of rice producers income stabilization program whose payments are notified as blue box stronger use of rice land diversion program whose payments are notified as green box and continued reliance of import controls which are dealt with under market access commitments to support domestic prices as result of these changes japan stopped notifying rice as receiving any productspecific ams price support despite domestic prices that were still 10 or more times higher than prices in other japonica ricegrowing countries japans notification of productspecific rice price support dropped from 2315 billion yen 188 billion in 1997 to only 419 billion yen 327 million in 1998 and this latter amount was exempted under the productspecific minimis exemption none of these notification changes were challenged by other wto members these changes resulted in substantially lower annual amber box outlays during 19982001 for example during the 19951997 period japans annual amber box outlays averaged almost 31 billion since 1998 they have averaged just 61 billion substantially below japans amber box ceiling of about 36 billion concomitantly the share of 12 usda ers rice sector policies in japan rcs030301 march 2003 crs11 japans amber box spending relative to its ceiling has fallen from 72 share during 199597 to only 17 share during 19992001 suggesting that japan like the eu 15 will have substantial flexibility in negotiating future cuts in domestic support during wto trade negotiations in contrast to the declining pattern of amber box spending by the eu15 and japan the united states has seen its annual amber box outlays jump from an average of 61 billion during 199597 to 16 billion

expressed concern that developed countries particularly the eu15 the united states and japan have used the various exemption categories to their advantage to shelter large subsidy outlays to their agricultural sectors as result they have argued that stricter limits should be placed on exemptions or alternately on total exempt and nonexempt ams spending indeed such an overall spending cap is

database and recent us notifications implications for us agricultural policy farm subsidy trends from 1995 through 2001 the united states annual ams was below the levels to which it committed under the agreement on agriculture aa and in most cases comfortably so however as mentioned earlier in this report us domestic support both for total ams spending and for amber box outlays trended higher during the first seven years of the aa figure 9 this pattern is contrary to the general pattern exhibited by the rest of the wto membership the reasons for this as well as its potential implications are discussed below after declining to 583 billion in 1997 total us ams outlays for all categories exempt and nonexempt climbed to over 74 billion in 1999 and remained wellabove 70 billion during 2000 and 2001 appendix tables 1013 green box subsidies which comprised 76 of total us domestic support during the 19952001 period remained relatively stable at about 50 billion in contrast us spending under both the amber box 16 of total and the minimis exclusion 6 experienced rapid growth and accounted for nearly all of the surge in ams outlays that started in 1998 although the united states has not yet notified its domestic support spending for 2002 through the present crs estimates of us domestic support based on crs17 available usda budget data15 suggest that us amber box outlays are likely to have declined substantially during 20022004 from the relatively high level of 19992001 before rising once again to approach the us amber box ceiling for 2005 and 2006 the question of how high us domestic support will eventually climb to depends on how the administration chooses to notify countercyclical payments and on the eventual level of commodity market prices amber box policies during the 19952000 implementation period the us amber box ceiling was reduced from 239 billion in six equal annual installments to its current ceiling of 191 billion figure 10 since 2000 the united

include the dairy peanut and sugar price support programs marketing loan programs for grains and cotton crop storage payments irrigation and grazing subsidies and crop insurance support see appendix table 10 subsidies under the dairy peanut and sugar price support programs do not involve direct payment to producers instead price supports are defined by the wto as the difference between the higher protected domestic price and the unprotected international market price times annual production 15 usdafsa reports historical and projected outlays of commodity credit corporation program spending in table 35 ccc net outlays by commodity function available at httpwwwfsausdagovdambudbud1htm these data do not correspond exactly with wto notification criteria but they do provide rough approximation of wtospecific domestic support crs18 in accordance with wto classification criteria each ams outlay is notified by whether it is productspecific subsidy or general subsidy this productspecific versus nonproductspecific distinction for ams outlays has proven crucial to the united states ability to meet its ams spending limits during 19952001 non exempt us productspecific support averaged 111 billion per year all of which has counted against the amber box ceiling in contrast nonproductspecific support which averaged 42 billion per year was exempted from ams limits every year under the minimis exclusion as mentioned earlier the distribution of us domestic support subsidies has shown an increasing trend in the first four years of the wto 19951998 annual amber box outlays by the united states averaged 72 billion while minimis exemptions averaged 21 billion blue box payments of 7 billion were for single year 1995 during the most recent three notification years 19992001 average amber box and minimis outlays had jumped to 16 billion and 73 billion per year respectively the surge in domestic support under these two ams categories was due to combination of weak us and international commodity market prices and poor growing conditions in certain regions of the united states during the 1999 2001 period low commodity prices resulted in large amber box payments under commodity marketing loan provisions both loan defeiciency payments ldp and marketing loan gains16 of us farm programs see appendix table 10 while crop failures generated large disaster relief payments that were classified as non commodityspecific outlays and thus were exempted under the minimis exclusion in addition the united states made large ad hoc farm payments referred to as crop market loss payments during the 19982001 marketing years these payments were intended to partially offset the economic loss of unexpectedly low market prices and as such were notified as eligible for the amber box they included nearly 38 billion of commodityspecific payments and another 184 billion of non commodity specific payments the latter noncommodity specific market loss payments were entirely exempted under the minimis exclusion minimis exemptions to highlight the importance of noncommodity specific exemptions total annual us minimis exclusions have been appended to amber box payments and compared against the amber box ceiling figure 10 in 1998 us minimis exemptions productspecific and nonproductspecific combined were 48 billion this jumped to over 7 billion per year during 1999 2001 nonproductspecific crop market loss payments accounted for 71 of us minimis exemptions during those same three years while crop insurance costs also declared as nonproduct specific accounted for another 21 if minimis exemptions were added to amber box outlays for 19992001 the united states clearly would exceed its 191 billion amber box ceiling as result without significant shift in market conditions and us program subsidies any future reduction in minimis exemption levels negotiated under the wto could result in constraint on us domestic policy intervention 16 for more information on

include loan deficiency payments ldps and marketing loan gains cotton and sugar subsidies each averaged about 11 billion per year with 10 shares respectively of annual ams outlays sugar subsidies are derived entirely from the usinternational price wedge while cotton subsidies originated from several programs including marketing loan provision payments the step2 user marketing payments and ad hoc

framework agreement of the current doha round of wto trade negotiations includes proposal for spending caps on productspecific ams18 although the details of such productspecific ams cap are yet to be

green box exemptions averaged nearly 50 billion per year and accounted for 43 of total wto member green box outlays appendix table 13 and figure 12 during the uruguay round wto trade negotiators deemed green box programs to be more virtuous ie cause less market distortion than amber box programs as result subsidies that qualify for the green box may be used without any spending limitation the most prominent example of us green box policies is the wto category of domestic food aid which includes food stamps the women infants and children wic program and various child nutrition programs us exempt subsidies under the domestic food aid category averaged 349 billion during 19952001 and accounted for 70 of total us green box outlays general services which includes administrative costs for

crs21 share finally various other programs including the conservation reserve program crop disaster payments and diverse environmental payments averaged 3 billion per year and 6 share during the 19952001 period decoupled payments consisted primarily of production flexibility contract pfc payments made under the agricultural market transition act amta title i of the 1996 farm law under this law those who formerly were enrolled in the annual usda crop price and income support programs for grains and cotton and who signed contracts received fixed but declining annual payment totaling 36 billion over the sevenyear term of the law 19962002 the level of each recipients annual subsidy known variously as freedom to farm transition pfc or contract payment initially was determined by farms past level of production of these particular crops but these payments bore relation to current production patterns as result pfc payments were eligible to be placed in the green box because they were decoupled according to us officials in the 2002 farm act pfc payments were replaced by similar direct payment dp based on historical area and yields although the new dp payments have not yet been notified it is expected that the administration will continue to classify them as decoupled and therefore exempt them under the green box however this classification has been brought into question by march 2 2005 appellate ruling in wto dispute settlement case ds267 brought by brazil against the us cotton program19 wto dispute settlement panel found that us direct payments do not qualify for wto green box exemption from ams reduction commitments as fully decoupled income support because of prohibition on the planting of fruits vegetables and wild rice on covered program acreage however the panel did not specifically reclassify us pfc or dp payments as amber box nor did the panel recommend that the united states should notify such future payments as amber box blue box exemptions since us targetprice deficiency payments were ended in the 1996 farm act the united states has not notified any other domestic support subsidies in the blue box however the 2002 farm act included new program provision countercyclical payments ccp which could potentially fall into the blue box exemption category under the ccp program target price was established for each unit ie bushel pound or hundredweight of grains cotton and oilseeds ccp payments occur when the national average market price falls below the target price after adjusting for per unit direct payments with the ccp payment making up the difference between the adjusted target price and the market price thus ccp payments tend to rise when market prices decline and to decrease as market prices rise as with the fixed direct payments each eligible producers ccp is based on an historical not current period of production in other words unlike the old target price program in place before the 1996 farm bill the new payments are decoupled from current output because the producer does not have to produce any particular crop to receive the payment 19 see crs report rl32571 usbrazil wto cotton subsidy dispute crs22 because ccp payments did not start until 2002 the united states has yet to notify them to the wto however under the current doha round of wto trade negotiations the united states has been negotiating to have blue box criteria be redefined to include ccp payments20 some other wto members have argued that because ccp payments are directly tied to market prices and acreage limitations are required they should be notified in the amber box further it is also unknown whether such payments would be considered noncommodity specific on the argument that producers do not have to plant particular crop in the year payment might be triggered or commodityspecific on the argument that they are in fact based on the production of specific crop even if it was in the past if ccp payments ultimately are counted toward the 191 billion ams limit it is unclear whether this would force cuts in other program spending to keep the us within the ams spending ceiling future market prices are difficult to predict in turn making future subsidy levels uncertain wto circuit breaker the 2002 farm act pl 107171 contains provision sec 1601e1 in the commodity title title i aimed at ensuring that future farm program benefits do not exceed the united states annual wto limit this has been termed informally as the circuit breaker more specifically if usda determines that total spending for commodity support will exceed the limit in any year the secretary shall to the maximum extent practicable make program adjustments to ensure that such expenditures do not exceed such allowable limits despite the high levels of support since 1998 the united states so far has remained within its prescribed wto annual support limits and therefore use of the wto circuit breaker has never been tested critics have questioned the feasibility of implementing the circuit breaker besides the political difficulties of proposing farm program cutbacks usda would face administrative problems as already noted projections of both private market conditions and government farm spending are notoriously imprecise that is one reason the usda analysts who prepare the wto notifications must wait until after the end of the marketing year when all spending and program details become available more time typically is needed to review and calculate expenditures and organize them into wto formats and categories if such calculations were made in advance and usda found that farm support might exceed the allowable ams would it have to withhold from farmers some or all of the years expected subsidy which commodities andor supports would be affected some of them or would usda make an acrosstheboard reduction how would that affect farmers planting decisions and their access to loans what if usda wrongly predicted that spending would not exceed the allowable ams but it ultimately did defenders of the provision counter that the provision would not be as complicated as critics contend suggesting that relatively modest adjustments in programs and payment levels could be made easily on an asneeded basis 20 wto wto agricultural negotiations the issues and where we are now dec1 2004 p 57 at httpwwwwtoorgenglishtratop_eagric_enegs_bkgrnd00_contents_ehtm crs23 issues surrounding domestic support commitments foreign competitors are closely monitoring us actions some have raised concerns about increased us farm spending in light of the current wto negotiations to further reform agricultural trade which were initiated in march 2000 and are now continuing under the more comprehensive multilateral trade negotiations launched at doha qatar in november 200121 defenders of current us farm policy point out that the eu15 chief us export competitor continues to spend far more than the united states on domestic farm aid under current wto disciplines they argue that as long as the eu15 which nonetheless is still within its permitted annual subsidy limits and other foreign countries heavily subsidize their farmers free world market in agriculture is illusory and us farm aid should not be singled out for criticism or unilateral reductions world trade obligations are factor as congress begins to consider the issues relevant to new farm legislation most commodity price and income support provisions are due to expire in 200722 because of the interrelationships between trade and domestic support policies lawmakers are interested in what the current wto trade commitments stipulate with regard to domestic supports and how the various proposals being considered under the

various summary reports produced by the wto committee on agriculture see individual appendix table source notes and from wto member notifications to facilitate crosscountry comparisons of available wto member notifications all data in the appendix tables have been converted to us dollars by crs using exchange rate data for each year from the notifications when available and from the international monetary fund when not as result readers should be aware of the potential role that exchange rate fluctuations have when reviewing these data tables wto member countries are free to choose the currency in which they notify their domestic support subsidies the notification usually includes exchange rate data for conversion to us dollars for the period in question however because the ams calculation for given notification year may involve the summation of commodity subsidies for different 12month periods there is some flexibility in how exchange rates may be reported or applied to the notification data an obvious exchangerate influence is as follows because member countries initially agreed to freeze their ams at base levels then reduce it gradually during an implementation period the cumulative ams should show steady decline from 1995 through 2004 after which it stabilizes at its lowest point however fluctuations in the exchange rate between the us dollar and foreign currencies particularly weakening of the us dollar from 2001 through the present have resulted in substantial variability and slight rise in the aggregate ams when reported in us dollars
