protection at minimum all point s ource dischargers i industrial fac ilities and municipal sewage treatment plants must attain technol ogybased requirements to limit pollutant concentrations in effluents th requirements take the form of nationally uniform standards which are incorporated in discharge permits issued to individual facilities the act also requires that poi nt sources meet more stringent effluent limitations in certain circumstances if technol ogybased controls are insufficient to attain stateestablished ambient water quality standa rds for specific waterbodies these standards serve as the regulatory basis for developing more stringent effluent limitations to be applied to point sources or other dischargers through dditional control measures since enactment of the cwa in 1972 p l 92500 the nation has made much progress towards the acts wa ter quality goals through its program of technologybased effluent limits for industrial nd municipal point sources ho wever

watershedbased effluent trading may 30 1996 httpwwwepagovowow watershedframeworkhtmlprotection agency epa and states have succeeded in regulating and reducing pollution from point sources the relative importance of nonpoint source pollution to water quality has increased overall data indicate that lmost 40 of waters evaluated by states do not meet applicable standards and are impaire d for one or more desired uses nonpoint pollution rainfall runoff from urban suburban and agricultural areas for example is believed to be the dominant cause of remaining water quality impairment in many areas but is subject to much less clean water ac t regulation than is point source pollution policymakers now seek new policy approach to continue pr ogress towards water quality improvements increasingly many are interested in marketbased alternatives to traditional regulation water qua lity trading is one of the marketbased innovations of interest the basic theory behind effluent trading is that certain dischargers may be able to achieve the same degree of control as others in the same area but at lower expense under trading program some dischargers could avoid costly treatment upgrade by paying for or otherwise arranging equivale nt or greater reductions in discharges from other facilities or sources that discharge into the same receiving waters the attraction of trading is that it reduces the total cost of compliance for the regulated community and provides monetary compensation for those who exceed minimum requirements for reducing pollutants the common denominator is providing flexibility in allocating pollution control responsibilities so as to achieve water quality goals more cost effectively trading is supplement to not substitute for core regulatory programs water quality or effluent tr ading concepts have long been advocated by academics and economists as means of achieving environmental objectives costeffectively1 few projects were initiated in the early 1980s by local groups who were searching for means to avoid additional and increasingl expensive restrictions on point source discharges in the area of air quality trad ing received significan t endorsement in 1990 with enactment of clean air act amendments title iv of that act authorized formal program for electric utilities to trade sulfur dioxide emissions which cause acid rain and affect human health the acid rain program is widely believed to be one of the most successful environmental programs of recent times2 during the 1990s the clinton administra tion pursued number of initiatives to reform the management of environmental prog rams as part of that effort in january 1996 epa issued policy statement to enc ourage effluent trading in watersheds3 soon thereafter the clinton epa issued draft framework to implement that trading policy it identified series of conditions necessary for trading and template of regulatory economic and technical issues to facilitate evaluation of trading opportun ities4 although this document was never released as final framework it served to encouragehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21403crs3 5 environomics summary of us effluent tr

tradin g projects around the country some partly supported with epa grant funding and techni cal assistance since the 1980s there have been about 35 trading programs or activities including studi and pilots in the united states trades have been approved for about onethird of these but actual trades have occurred in only few5 in 2002 the bush epa proposed new wate r quality trading policy building on the 1996 policy statement and lessons learned from activities over the last two decades the final policy superseding the 1996 statemen t and 2002 draft was issued january 13 20036 summary of the new policy the new epa policy is intended to guide and encourage states interstate agencies and tribal governments in veloping trading programs and projects it identifies number of objectives such as to establish economic incentives for voluntary pollutant reductions from point and nonpoint sources with in watershed and to reduce the cost of compliance with water qualitybased requirements it describes several basic characteristics for trades that occur under the policy for exam ple it states that trading must be consistent with the cwa and shoul d not result in viola tions of water quality standards epa does not support trading to ach ieve technologybased standards that is source that has not yet attained regulatory or permit requirements may not trade some of those requirements with other sources in the watershed the policy endorses trading of credits for nutrients and sediment loads but trading of other pollutants that pose higher environmental risk may only be considered on casebycase basis the agency does not currently support trading of persis tent bioaccumulative and toxic chemicals pbts and plans to conduct future pilot projects to obtain information on trading of pbts the policy states that trading should occur within waters hed or similar defined area thus facilities may not purchase credits from an unrelated geographic area to meet pollutant reduction to address local water quality need under the new policy trades should ve certain common elements including appropriate legal authority clearly defined units of trade standardized protocols to quantify pollutant loads reductions and credits mechanisms to determine and ensure compliance and periodic assessments of the environmental effectiveness eg monitoring or studies to quantify polluta nt reductions and economic eff ectiveness in terms of the number and types of trades transaction and administrative costs the policy states that in the case of trades between point and nonpoi nt sources the point source permittee shall have ultimate responsibility fo r compliance specific trades may be identified in discharge permits the policy says but it is flexible in how this might occur permit might for example contain general conditions that authorize trading or it might set variable permit limits to be adjusted up or down based on credits generated or used epa says that in general it will not exercise higher scrutiny of trading than it does of other cwa programs ie epa approval of individua l trades will not be required one aspect of oversight however is public involveme nt trading programs should require public participation from the earliest point the policy sayshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21403crs4 five distinct water pollution tr ading scenarios have emerged under pointpoint source trading designated point sources trade permitted discharge allowances only among themselves with one point source negotiating to buy portion of the loading allocation of effluent allowances from another point source in the trading area under pointnonpoint source trading regulated point source dischargers are allowed to pay for reductions in nonpoint source control within their watersheds in lieu of upgrading their control technology nonpointnonpoint source trading provides mechanism to achieve nonpoint source reductions bey ond those obtainable through pointnonpoint source trading it may be appropriate where new nonpoint sources enter watershed and are subj ect to stricter erosion or runoff standards under state and local law than are existing nonpoint sources new nonpoint sources may be able to meet requirements at least cost by combination of onsite controls nd offsite controls acquired through trades with existing nonpoint sources in that area industries that discharge wastes to municipal sewer system for treatment at publicly owned treatme nt works potw facility are often required to pretreat certain of their wastes which could interfere with the potws operation pretreatment trading allows industrial dischargers in community to allocate control efforts among themselves so that the total quantity of pollutant entering the potw either would not change as result of trading or could be reduced overall under intraplant trading single point source allocates its total allowed pollutant discharges among its outfalls in costeffective manner existing clean water regula tions for the iron and steel industry specifically allow intraplant trading to meet regulatory requirements trading and tmdls trading finds considerable support from many in connection with implementing the clean water acts total maximum daily load tmdl program tmdl is essentia lly budget to allocate additional pollutant reductions which are needed to attain standards in waters that remain impaired even after application of technologybase d controls by industry and m unicipalities implementation of the acts tmdl program has recently been propelled by judicial and administrative actions across the country epa estimates that as many as 40000 tmdls need to be developed for over 20000 waterbodies where standards are not being met for information see crs report 97831 clean water act and total maximum daily loads tmdls of pollutants trading is viewed as offering flexible approaches to improving water quality in the many areas where tmdls will be required one prominent example is in long island sound epa has approved tmdl that will require 585 reduction of nitrogen from sources in new york and connecticut most of the nitrogen that reaches the sound is from municipal sewage treatment plants connecticut adopted legislation authorizing ahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21403crs5 7 statement of thomas morrissey connecticut department of environmental protection hearing held by the

permit to regulate all of the nitrogen discharged by 80 of these plants and setting annual nitrogen limits if facility removes more than its annual limit it has credits to sell and if facility does not meet its limit it must buy credits state officials estimate that sewage trea tment facilities will save 200 million in cap ital construction costs as result of using trades to attain nitrogen limits7 in other watersheds where tmdls are being developed ma ny supporters hope that tr ading opportunities will bring nonpoint sources more fully into the proce ss of achieving wate r quality improvements issues of concern many state and local govern ments as well as industry and wastewater treatment groups support the ne w epa policy especially as possible mechanism to meet tmdl requirements ag riculture groups also are supportive so long as nonpoint sources can continue to participate in tradin g voluntarily and will continue to generally be outside the jurisdiction of cwa enforcement including litigation environmental groups are somewhat split on the issue of water quality trading some argue that trades are not legal under th clean water act saying that there is provision in the law that c ontemplates point source buying what amounts to displaced compliance from another source8 environmental critics fear that trading will be used as way to avoid regulatory re quirements of the clean water act even though epa points out the policy prohibits any trade that would violate water quality standards these groups are critical of what they view as number of significant loopholes in the policy the policy is flawed they say because it does not entirely prohibit trading of toxic discharges and thus could result in toxic hot spots fails to mandate reliable method for calculating discharges from nonpoint sources and requiring ratios of better than 11 for trades between point and nonpoint sources to account for the uncertainty of nonpoint sources in achieving and maintaining pollutant reductions over time and gives guidance as to how caps on discharges shoul d be set and decline over time thus while the epa policy supports pretmdl trading in impaired waters to achieve progress towards standards critics say that trading in impaired waters should only be allowed after tmdl pollutant caps have been established nd after sources in the watershed recognize the pollutant reductions that are need ed in order to achieve standards some environmental groups such as the national wildlife fede ration believe that trading can be valuable tool in cleanin g up waterways provide d that it is done with adequate safeguards another group the nvironmental defense fund has participated in developing trading projects in several locations including the tarpamlico nutrient reduction trading program in north carolina still environmental groups that support such activities identify severa l necessary safeguards to ensure that water quality is protected these include tmdls as prerequisite good compliance records by participating sources having adequate trading ratios setting pollutant limits in discharge permits epa oversight public participation and ensuring sufficient monitoring both to establish baseline conditions for trades and to assess pollutant reductions for trades involving nonpoint sources enforceability is

while point source controls are enforceable through citizen suits nonpoint source controls are not9 the new epa policy opens the door to increas ed trading whether this occurs will depend on many factors epa has acknowledged that trades are very sitespecific and require number of important conditions including there must be sufficient number of sources that contribute si gnificant portion of the total pollutant load in the watershed there must be water quality goal for the wa tershed that necessita tes action there must be accurate and sufficient data with which to establish targets and measure reductions there must be economic gains from the trade in terms of the marginal cost of pollutant reductions and there must be an institutional structure to facilitate trading and monitor results10 further it is unknown whether the flexib ility that epa attempted to incorporate in the policy which some environmental dvocates view as loophol will be sufficient to encourage new projects industry gr oupswhile generally supportivemight have preferred not including some of the environm ental safeguards that the policy contains such as the prohibition on trading to achieve technologybased standards or the bar on trading across watersheds if the policy is to offer significant incentive to trading congressional interest in water quality trading congressional interest in these issues has been limited trading is not currently addressed in the clean water act but epa officials have long held the view that it is already allowed under the law as noted bove some environmenta l critics believe that water quality trading is unlawful and even some advocates agree that articulating such policy in the act would be beneficial in the 104th congress the house passed comprehensive cwa reauthorization bill h r 961 with provision that would have authorized modification of discharge permit requirements for conventional or toxic pollutants to allow for trading between sources the senate did not consider this house passed bill other legi slation dealing with water quality trading has been pr oposed since then in the 107th congress the house transportation and infrastructure subcommittee on water resources and envir onment held hearing in june 2002 to examine epas efforts to foster innovative ma rketbased approaches to improving the nations water quality in the 108th congress members and committees may pursue additional oversight of water quality trading especially as epa states and others implement the new policy legislation to codify water trading
