with extraordinary threats to our national security foreign policy or economic well being under such conditions for example he may freeze the assets located in this countryhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31200crs3 1 three kinds of forfeiture were established in england at the time the eighth amendm ent was ratified in the united states deodand forfeiture and statutory forfeiture of englands three kinds of forfeiture only the third took hold in the united states austin v united states 509 us 602 61112 1993 2 statutory forfeitures have often been accomplished through civil proceedings conducted in rem with the offending property treated as defendant as result some came to believe that the necessity of the property owners criminal conviction constituted the essential distinction between forfeiture of estate and statutory forfeiture yet occasional forfeiture statutes have predicated confiscation upon the owners conviction throughout our history moreover it defies credibility to claim that forfeiture of estates only ameliorating attribute is its only essential element 3 the statutory ban and its successors remained in effect until 1984 when it was repealed continuedof foreign nation or national responsible for the threat during war time the trading with the enemy act twea gives him the power to confiscate enemy property located in the united states 50 usc app 1 et seq section 106 amends section 703 of ieepa 50 usc 1702 to permit the president to confiscate foreign property in response to foreign aggression the authority becomes available when the united states is engaged in armed hostilities or has been attacked by foreign country or its nationals at that time the property of any foreign person organization or nation which planned authorized aided or engaged in the hostilities or attack becomes forfeitable the president or his delegate may determine the particulars under which the property is confiscated administered and disposed of subject to an innocent owner defense created by section 316 of the usa patriot act elsewhere the usa patriot act gives the president an alternative means to confiscate the same property on similar grounds section 806 section 106 is intriguing because on one hand it seems logical extension of ieepa and twea but on the other it appears to revive the constitutionally suspect forfeiture of estate forfeiture of estate was creature of the common law1 upon conviction and attainder felon or traitor forfeited all of his property statutory forfeiture more familiar feature of american law consists of the confiscation of contraband the fruits of crimes and the means to commit crime untaxed whiskey the drug dealers profits and the rum runners ship three distinguishing features characterize forfeiture of estate the property is lost solely by reason of its ownership by the felon or traitor there need be other nexus to the crime as consequence it works the confiscation of all of felons property not just his crimerelated property third it extinguishes his future right to hold property and title to property may pass through him to his heirs2 it is this last feature this corrupt ion of the blood which the authors of the constitution found most distasteful they decreed that attainder of treason shall work corruption of blood or forfeiture except during the life of the person attainted usconst art iii 3 cl2 and when first assembled in congress they extended the ban to all federal crimes conviction or judgment for any offences aforesaid shall work corruption of blood or any forfeiture of estate 1 stat 117 17903httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31200crs4 3continued through misunderstanding as part of comprehensive revision of federal criminal law 18 usc 3563 1982 ed 4 cf societe internationale v rogers 357 us 197 211 1958this summary power to seize property which is believed to be enemyowned is rescued from constitutional invalidity under the due process and just compensation clauses of the fifth amendment only by those provisions of the act which afford nonenemy claimant later judicial hearing as to the propriety of the seizureno suggestion that due process likewise condemns forfeiture of estate in cases that do not involve treasonduring the civil war congress authorized the confiscation of the property of supporters of the confederacy 12 stat 589 1862 but in deference to president lincolns constitutional doubts interest in the property reverted to the offenders heirs upon his death 12 stat 627 1862 on the other hand confiscation under the trading with the enemy act twea looks for all intents and purposes like the confiscation of estate of the property of an enemy nation or national 50 usc app 5b yet the supreme court has upheld twea as valid exercise of the war power without mentioning of any obstacle interposed by constitutional reservations concerning forfeiture of estate silesian american corp v clark 332 us 469 19474 section 106 also amends ieepa to cover situations where either the covered foreign person or the covered property are within this country or otherwise subject to the jurisdiction of the united states it allows the president to freeze assets during the pendency any international emergency economic act investigation rather than await its outcome as was previously the case finally it permits the government to present in secret ex parte and in camera any classified information upon which an ieepa decision has been based should the decision be subject to judicial review title ii enhanced surveillance procedures section 201 authority to intercept wire oral and elect ronic communications relating to terrorism title iii of the omnibus crime control and safe streets act of 1968 18 usc 2510 et seq establishes judicially supervised procedure under which law enforcement authorities may intercept wire oral or electronic communications the procedure however is only available in connection with the

25161r one of the two paragraphs previously identified as 18 usc 25161p section 201 is subject to the sunset provisions of section 224 section 202 authority to intercept wire oral and electronic communications relating to computer fraud and abuse offenses section 202 adds computer fraud and abuse to the title iii predicate offense list this section is subject to the sunset provisions of section 224 section 203 authority to share criminal investigative information previously federal law enforcement officers who uncovered details of the activities of international terrorist organizations or of foreign agents in this country were often not free to pass the information on to federal intelligence officers this section allows federal law enforcement officers to share limited range of foreign intelligence information notwithstanding earlier limitations such as those involving the use of grand jury information or title iii evidence rule 6e of the federal rules of criminal procedure prohibits disclosure of matters occurring before federal grand jury the rule recognizes exceptions for disclosures in other judicial proceedings to prevent abuse of the grand jury process for presentation of evidence to other grand juries and to state law enforcement officials section 203 creates an exception for intelligence matters it covers information 1 related to the protection of the united states against foreign attack or other foreign hostile action against sabotage or international terrorism by foreign power or its agents or against foreign clandestine intelligence activities 2 concerning foreign power or territory related to the national defense security or foreign affairs activities of the united states or 3 constitu ting foreign intelligence or counterintelligence as defined in section 3 of the national security act of 1947 that is information relating to the capabilities intentions or activities of foreign governments or elements thereof foreign organizations or foreign persons or b information gathered and activities conducted to protect against espionage other intelligence activities sabotage or assassinations conducted by or on behalf of foreign governments or elements thereof foreign organiza tions or foreign persons 50 usc 401a2 3 now when such information comes to light during the course of federal grand jury investigation it may be passed on to other federal law enforcement intelligence protective immigration national defense or national security officials but only for use in the official duties within reasonable time thereafter federal prosecutors must notify the court of the disclosure under seal prosecutors must also follow disclosure procedures outlined by the attorney general when sharing intelligence information that identifies an american citizen or permanent resident alienhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31200crs6 when authorities executing title iii interception order discover this same type of intelligence evidence they may reveal it to any of these same officers for use in their official duties before the passage of section 203 such information could only be shared for law enforcement purposes 18 usc 2517 as in the case of grand jury information title iii intelligence information that identifies an american citizen or permanent resident alien can be divulged only pursuant to disclosure procedures outlined by the attorney general finally section 203 creates generic exception to any other law which purports to bar federal law enforcement officials from disclosing this type of intelligence information to these federal officers for official use the sections amendments to title iii are subject to the sunset provisions of section 224 the grand jury and generic exceptions are not section 204 clarification of intelligence exceptions from limitations on interception and disclosure of wire oral and electronic communications title iii at one time stated that the interception of wire or oral communications for foreign intelligence purposes should be governed by the provisions of the foreign intelligence surveillance act fisa rather than those of title iii or of chapter 121 of title 18 of the united states code relating to stored wire and electronic communications and transactional records access or of the federal communications act 18 usc 25112f section 204 amends this instruction in 18 usc 25112f to confirm that in foreign intelligence investigations fisa governs the interception of electronic communications and the use of pen registers and trap and trace devices as well this section is subject to the sunset provisions of section 224 section 205 employment of translators by the federal bureau of investigation existing law sometimes waives personnel requirements and limitations in order to fill positions requiring foreign language skills eg 22 usc 14741relating to employment of translators with respect to united states information and educational exchange programs 22 usc 4024a4 b relating to the employment of linguists in connection united states foreign service training section 205 waives otherwise applicable personnel requirements and limitations to permit the federal bureau of investigation fbi to hire translators expeditiously to support counterintelligence investigations and operations the director of the fbi will see to the necessary security requirements the attorney general will report to the committees on the judiciary on the number of translators employed by the fbi and by the department of justice on the impediments to using translators employed by other government agencies on the fbis needs and on his recommendations to meet the fbis needs for translation services this section is not subject to the sunset provisions of section 224httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31200crs7 section 206 roving survei llance authority under the foreign intelligence surveillance act of 1978 speaking of identical language in an earlier bill the house committee on the judiciary explained section 1805c2b of title 50 permits the fisa court to order third parties like common carriers custodians landlords and others who are specified in the order specified persons to provide assistance and information to law enforcement authorities in the installation of wiretap or the collection of information related to foreign intelligence investigation section 152 amends 1805c2b to insert language that permits the fisa court to direct the order to other persons if the court finds that section 1805c2b of title 50 permits the fisa court to order third parties like common carriers custodians landlords and others who are specified in the order specified persons to provide assistance and information to law enforcement authorities in the installation of wiretap or the collection of information related to foreign intelligence investigation section 152 amends 1805c2b to insert language that permits the fisa court to direct the order to other persons if the court finds that the actions of the target of the application may have the effect of thwarting the identification of specified person who would be required to assist in the installation of any courtauthorized intercept this amendment is intended to expand the existing authority to allow for circumstances where the court finds that the actions of target may thwart the identifica tion of specified person in the order this is usually accomplished by the target moving his location the move necessitates the use of third parties other than those specified in the original order to assist in installation of the listening device this amendment allows the fisa court to compel any such new necessary parties to assist in the installation and to furnish all information facilities or technical assistance necessary without specifically naming such persons nevertheless the target of the electronic surveillance must still be identified or described in the order as under existing law for example international terrorists and foreign intelligence officers are trained to thwart surveillance by changing hotels cell phones internet accounts etc just prior to important meetings or communications under present law each time this happens the government must return to the fisa court for new order just to change the name of the third party needed to assist in the new installation the amendment permits the court to issue generic order that can be presented to the new carrier landlord or custodian directing their assistance to assure that the surveillance may be undertaken as soon as technically feasible hrept 107256 at 5960 2001 this section is subject to the sunset provisions of section 224 section 207 duration of fisa surveillance of nonunited states persons who are agents of foreign power prior to the usa patriot act unless directed at foreign power fisa surveillance orders and extensions expired after ninety days and fisa physical search orders and extensions were effective for more fortyfive days 50 usc 1805e 1824d2000 ed section 207 extends the tenure of physical search orders to ninetyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31200crs8 days surveillance and physical search orders may now remain in effect for up to 120 days with extensions for up to year 50 usc 1805e 1824d this represents compromise over the justice departments original proposal which would have set the required expiration date for orders at one year instead of 120 days this section is subject to the sunset provisions of section 224 section 208 designation of judges fisa is in essence series of procedures available to secure court orders in certain foreign intelligence cases it operates through special court which before passage of section 208 consisted of seven judges scattered throughout the country two of whom are now from the washington dc area section 208 authorizes the appointment of four additional judges and requires that three members of the court reside within twenty miles of the district of columbia 50 usc 1803a this section is not subject to the sunset provisions of section 224 section 209 seizure of voicemail messages pursuant to warrants section 209 treats voice mail like email thus federal officers may gain access with warrant or court order they need longer resort to the more demanding regime of title iii that applies in the case of live telephone conversations united states v smith 155 f3d 1050 105556 9th cir 1998 this section is subject to the sunset provisions of section 224 section 210 scope of subpoenas for records of electronic communications terrorists and other criminals often use aliases in registering for internet and telephone services this creates problem for law enforcement attempting to identify the suspects of terrorist acts or criminal acts that often support the terrorists while the government currently can subpoena electronic communication s or remote computing services provider for the name address and length of service of suspect this information does not help when the suspected terrorist or criminal lies about his or her identity permitting investigators to obtain credit card and other payment information by subpoena along with subscriber information already permitted to be obtained under current law will help law enforcement track suspect and establish his or her true identity this section amends 18 usc 2703c to authorize subpoena for transactional records to include information regarding the form of payment in order to assist law enforcement in determining the users identity hrept 107236 at 56 7 2001 this section is not subject to the sunset provisions of section 224 section 211 clarification of scope telephone and electronic communications providers may be required to provide law enforcement officials with customer identifying information without notifying their customers 18 usc 2705b cable companies are prohibited from disclosing customer identifying information without customer approval 47 usc 551 et seq when cable companies began to offer communications services uncertainty arose over whether law enforcement access to their customers records was to be governedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31200crs9 by the standards applicable to the communications industry or by the earlier cable standards see in re application of usa for an order pursuant to 18 usc 2703d 158 fsupp2d 644 dmd 2001holding the cable provisions implicitly repealed and summarizing existing ambivalent case law section 211 resolves the question by amending the communications act 47 usc 551 to make it clear that when cable company offers communications services it is subject to the provisions of title iii and chapters 121 and 206 of title 18 of the united states code relating to stored wire and electronic communications and transactional records access and to pen registers and trap and trace devices respectively cable customer video subscription records however remain in the shelter of the communications act protection section 211 is not subject to the sunset provisions of section 224 section 212 emergency disclosure of electronic communications to protect life and limb as the house committee on the judiciary observed with respect to substantively identical provision this section amends 18 usc 2702 to authorize electronic communications service providers to disclose the communications or records relating to such communications of their customers or subscribers if the provider reasonably believes that an emergency involving immediate danger of death or serious physical injury to any person requires disclosure of the information without delay this section would also amend the law to allow communications providers to disclose noncontent information such as the subscribers login records under current law the communications provider is expressly permitted to disclose content information but not expressly permitted to provide noncontent information this change would cure this problem and would permit the disclosure of the lessprotected information parallel to the disclosure of the more protected information hrept 107236 at 58 2001 this section is subject to the sunset provisions of section 224 section 213 authority for delaying notice of the execution of warrant standing alone rule 41 of the federal rules of criminal procedure seems to preclude delayed notification of the execution of sneak and peek warrants sneak and peek warrant is one that authorizes officers to secretly enter either physically or electronically conduct search observe take measurements conduct examinations smell take pictures copy documents download or transmit computer files and the like and depart without taking any tangible evidence or leaving notice of their presence the rule on its face requires that after the execution of federal search warrant officers leave copy of the warrant and an inventory of what they have seized and advise the issuing court what they have done frcrimp 41d the lower federal courts are divided over the extent to which the rule reflects fourth amendment requirements the ninth circuit sees the fourth amendment in rule 41 united states v freitas 800 f2d 1451 1453 9th cir 1986 the fourth circuit finds fourth amendment offense in search warrants secretly executed and seizures of intangible evidence that remain unannounced until weeks thereafterhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31200crs10 united states v simons 206 f3d 392 4th cir 2000 the second circuit whose views the congress found persuasive 147 congrec h7197 daily ed oct 23 2001 thinks the validity of sneak and peek warrants and of delayed notice are better judged by rule 41 standards united states v pangburn 983 f2d 449 2d cir 1993 section 213 rests on the belief that the fourth amendment does not condemn either sneak and peek warrants or delayed notice for searches conducted under warrant issued pursuant to rule 41 or under warrant or court order issued pursuant to any other rule of law it adopts the delayed notification standards of 18 usc 2705 relating to delayed notification of the execution of court order authorizing government access to electronic communications held in third party storage for longer than 180 days an issuing court may order notice delayed for reasonable period of time and with good cause extensions if it finds reasona ble cause to believe that contemporaneous notification may have any of the adverse consequences described in section 2705 section 2705 mentions endangering the life or physical safety of an individual b flight from prosecution c destruction of or tampering with evidence d intimidation of potential witnesses or otherwise seriously jeopardize an investigation or unduly delay trial as the kinds of adverse consequences that justify delay unless the court concludes seizure is reasonably necessary the section only permits delayed notification if the warrant prohibits the seizure of any stored wire or electronic information unless otherwise authorized of any tangible property or of any wire or oral communications section 213 is not subject to the sunset provisions of section 224 section 214 pen register and trap and trace authority under fisa trap and trace devices and pen registers are devices which secretly identify the source and destination of calls made to and from particular telephone intelligence officers may use them pursuant to court order authorized in the foreign intelligence surveillance act section 214 grants the request of the department of justice for elimination of the requirements which limited fisa pen register and trap and trace device orders to facilities used by foreign agents or those engaged in international terrorist or clandestine intelligence activities 50 usc 1842c32000 ed applicants must still certify that the devices are likely to reveal information relevant to foreign intelligence investigation section 214 also adjusts the language of the fisa pen registertr ap and trace authority to permit its use to capture source and destination information for electronic communications eg email as well as telephone communications 50 usc 1842d finally the section makes it clear that requests for fisa pen registertrap and trace order like requests for other fisa orders directed against americans and permanent resident aliens us persons may not be based solely on activities protected by the first amendment 50 usc 1842 1843 section 214 is subject to the sunset provisions of section 224httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31200crs11 section 215 access to records and other items under the foreig n intelligence surveillance act fisa previously allowed senior officials of the federal bureau of investigation to apply for court order in connection with foreign intelligence investigation for access to the records of common carriers public accommodation providers physical storage facility operators and vehicle rental agencies 50 usc 18611863 2000 ed section 215 rewrites those provisions assistant special agents in charge of the fbi field offices may now also apply the court orders extend to any tangible object held by anyone items sought need not relate to an identified foreign agent or foreign power as was once the case but they may only be sought as part of an investigation to protect the united states from internat ional terrorism or clandestine intelligence activities nor may they be sought in conjunction with the investigation of an american or permanent resident alien predicated solely on the basis of activities protected by the first amendment there is good faith defense for anyone who produces items in response to court order under the section and production does not constitute waiver of applicable privilege section 215 is subject to the sunset provisions of section 224 section 216 modification of authorities relating to use of pen registers and trap and trace devices with one critical exception section 216 tracks language in similar section of hr 2975 the house committee on judiciarys description of that section is instructive under 18 usc 3121b law enforcement may obtain authorization from court upon certification that the information to be obtained is relevant to pending criminal investigation to install and use pen register device that identifies the telephone numbers dialed or pulsed from outgoing calls or trap and trace device that identifies the telephone numbers to particular telephone incoming calls these court authorizations do not permit capturing or recording of the content of any such communication under the terms of the court order currently the government must apply for new pentrap order in every jurisdiction where the target telephone is located this can cause serious delays that could be devastating to an investigation particularly where additional criminal or terrorist acts are planned section 216 does not change the requirement under 18 usc 3121 that law enforcement seek court order to install and use pen registerstrap and trace devices it does not change the law requiring that the attorney for the government certify to the court that the information sought is relevant to an ongoing criminal investigation this section does change the current law requiring the government to obtain the order in the jurisdiction where the telephone or its equivalent is located this section authorizes the court with jurisdiction over the offense of the investigation to issue the order thus streamlining an investigation and eliminating the need to intrude upon the resources of courts and prosecutors with connection to the investigationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31200crs12 5 thus for example noncontent information contained in the options field of network packet header constitutes signaling information and is properly obtained by an authorized pen register or trap and trace deviceunder the bill 18 usc 3123a would authorize courts to issue single pen registertrap and trace order that could be executed in multiple jurisdictions anywhere in the united states the bill divides the existing 18 usc 3123a into two paragraphs the new subsection a1 applies to federal investigations and provides that the order may be issued to any provider of communication services within the united states whose assistance is appropriate to the effectuation of the order subsection a2 applies to state law enforcement and does not change the current authority granted to state officials this section updates the language of the statute to clarify that the penregister authority applies to modern communication technologies current statutory references to the target line for example are revised to encompass line or other facility such facility includes cellular telephone number specific cellular telephone identified by its electronic serial number esn an internet user account or email address or an internet protocol ip address port number or similar computer network address or range of addresses in addition because the statute takes into account wide variety of such facilities section 3123b1c allows applicants for pen register or trap and trace orders to submit description of the communications to be traced using any of these or other identifiers moreover the section clarifies that orders for the installation of pen register and trap and trace devices may obtain any noncontent information dialing routing addressing and signaling information utilized in the processing or transmitting of wire and electronic communications5 just as today such an order could not be used to intercept the contents of communications protected by the wiretap statute the amendments reinforce the statutorily prescribed line between communications contents and noncontent information line identical to the constitutional distinction drawn by the us supreme court in smith v maryland 442 us 735 741 43 1979 thus for example an order under the statute could not authorize the collection of email subject lines which are clearly content further an order could not be used to collect information other than dialing routing addressing and signaling information such as the portion of url uniform resource locator specifying web search terms or the name of requested file or article this concept that the information properly obtained by using pen register or trap and trace device is noncontent information applies across the board to all communications media and to actual connections as well as attempted connections such as busy signals and similar signals in the telephone context and packets that merely request telnet connection in the internet context further because the pen register or trap and trace device is often incapable of being physically attached to the target facility due to the nature of modern communication technology section 101 makes two other related changes first inhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31200crs13 recognition of the fact that such functions are commonly performed today by software instead of physical mechanisms the section allows the pen register or trap and trace device to be attached or applied to the target facility likewise the definitions of pen register and trap and trace device in section 3127 are revised to include an intangible process such as software routine which collects the same information as physical device section 216c amends the definition section to include new nexus standard under 31272a to provide that the issuing court must have jurisdiction over the crime being investigated rather than the communication line upon which the device is to be installed this section is also amended to account for the new technologies relating to the different modes of communication section 216d amends section 3124d to ensure that communication providers continue to be covered under that section technology providers are concerned that the single order provisions of section 101 of the bill eliminates the protection of 3124d of title 18 that provides that cause of action shall lie in any court against any provider of wire or electronic communication service its officers employees agents or other specified persons for providing information facilities or assistance in accordance with the terms of court order once there is nationwide order it will not specify the provider and thus the providers believe they could become liable upon compliance with the order the intent of the current statutory language is to protect providers who comply with court orders which direct them to assist law enforcement in obtaining the noncontent information the bill removes the phrase the terms of so that the phrase reads in accordance with court order this will keep the requirement of court order but protect the providers even when that order does not specify the provider current practice includes compliance with pen registers and trap and trace orders by the service provider using its systems and technologies to provide the government all noncontent information ordered by the order without the installation of an additional device by the government to capture that order it is intended that these alternative compliance procedures should continue when the provider is willing and technologically able to comply with the order by these means in an efficient complete and timely manner additionally this section clarifies that upon request those being served with the generic pentrap order created under this section shall receive written or electronic certification from the serving officer or official stating that the assistance provided is related to the order hrept 107236 at 524 2001 the critical difference in section 216 is its reporting feature federal agents executing pen register or trap and trace order involving an electronic communications service to the

attacks come in many forms that cost companies and citizens millions of dollars and endanger public safety for instance the denialofservice attacks where the objective of the attack is to disable the computer system can shut down businesses or emergency responders or national security centers this type of attack causes the target sites servers to run out of memory and become incapable of responding to the queries of legitimate customers or users the victims of these computer trespassers should be able to authorize law enforcement to intercept the trespassers communications section 217 amends current law to clarify that law enforcement may intercept such communications when authorized by the victims under limited circumstances section 2171 of the bill adds to the definitions under 18 usc 2510 the term 1 protected computer and provides that the term has the same meaning set forth in 1030 of title 18 and 2 the term computer trespasser means person who is accessing protected computer without authorization and thus has reasonable expectation of privacy in any communication transmitted to through or from the protected computer section 2172 of the bill amends current law to allow victims of computer intrusions to authorize law enforceme nt to intercept the communications of computer trespasser that have been transmitted to from or through the protected computer under limited circumstances the circumstances are 1 the owner or operator of the protected computer must authorize the interception of the trespassers communications 2 the person who intercepts the communication must be lawfully engaged in an investigation 3 the person acting under color of law has reasonable grounds to believe that the contents of the computer trespassers communication to be intercepted will be relevant to the investigation and 4 the investigator may only intercept communications of the computer trespasser hrept 107236 at 556 2001 this section is subject to the sunset

been the case as originally enacted the application for fisa surveillance order required certification of the fact that the purpose for the surveillance is to obtain foreign intelligence information 50 usc 1804a7b2000 edemphasis added from the beginning defendants have questioned whether authorities had used fisa surveillance order against them in order to avoid the predicate crime threshold for title iii order out of these challenges arose the notion that perhaps the purpose might not always mean the sole purpose6httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31200crs15 investigation the courts are entirely competent to make the usual probable cause determination and because importantly individual privacy interests come to the fore and government foreign policy concerns recede when the government is primarily attempted to form the basis for criminal prosecution subsequent case law however is not as clear as it might be eg united states v duggan 743 f2d 59 77 2d cir 1984fisa permits federal officials to obtain orders authorizing electronic surveillance for the purpose of obtaining foreign intelligence informat ion the requirement that foreign intelligence information be the primary objective of the surveillance is plain not only from the language of sec 1802b but also from the requirements in sec 1804 as to what the application must contain the application must contain certification by designated official of the executive branch that the purpose of the surveillance is to acquire foreign intelligence information and the certification must set forth the basis for the certifying officialss belief that the information sought is the type of foreign intelligence information described united states v pelton 835 f2d 1067 107576 4th cir 1987 we also reject peltons claim that the 1985 fisa surveillance was conducted primarily for the purpose of his criminal prosecution and not primarily for the purpose of obtaining foreign intelligence information we agree with the district court that the primary purpose of the surveillance both initially and throughout was to gather foreign intelligence information it is clear that otherwise valid fisa surveillance is not tainted simply because the government can anticipate that the fruits of the surveillance may later be used as evidence in criminal trial united states v sarkissian 841 f2d 959 9078 9th cir

it was undertaken not for foreign intelligence purposes but to gather evidence for criminal prosecution fisa applications must contain among other things certification that the purpose of the requested surveillance is the gathering of foreign intelligence information although the evidence obtained under fisa subsequently may be used in criminal prosecutions the investigation of criminal activity cannot be the primary purpose of the surveillance the justice department sought fisa surveillance and physical search authority on the basis of foreign intelligence purpose section 218 instead demands certification that foreign intelligence gathering is significant purpose for the fisa surveillance or physical search order application 50 usc 1804a7b 1823a7b this more exacting standard than the purpose threshold proposed by the justice department but clear departure from the original the purpose entry point fisa once described singular foreign intelligence focus

generals authority to pay rewards to combat terrorism the attorney general enjoys the power to pay rewards in criminal cases but his power under other authorities is often subject to caps on the amount he might pay thus as general rule he may award amounts up to 25000 for the capture of federal offenders 18 usc 3059 and may pay rewards in any amount in recognition of assistance to the department of justices as long as the appropriations and judiciary committees are notified of any rewards in excess of 100000 18 usc 3059b although he has special reward authority in terrorism cases individualhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31200crs40 awards are capped at 500000 the ceiling for the total amount paid in such rewards is 5 million and rewards of 100000 or more require his personal approval

judiciary committees 501 the funds to pay the rewards may come from any federal department or agency in addition the counterterrorism fund of section 101 can be used without limitation to pay rewards to prevent investig ate or prosecute terrorism section 502 secretary of states authority to pay rewards the secretary of states reward authority was already somewhat more generous than that of the attorney general he may pay rewards of up to 5 million for information in international terrorism cases as long as he personally approves payments in excess of 100000 22 usc 2708 the act removes the 5 million cap and allows rewards to be paid for information concerning the whereabou ts of terrorist leaders and facilitating the dissolution of terrorist organizations 502 section 503 dna

provider the request must certify 1 that the information sought is relevant to an authorized foreign counterintelligence investigation and 2 there are specific and articulable facts that the person or entity to whom the information sought pertains is foreign power or an agent of foreign power as defined in fisa this requirement is more burdensome than the corresponding criminal authorities which require only certification of relevance the additional requirement of documentation of specific and articulable facts showing the person or entity is foreign power or an agent of foreign power cause substantial delays in counterintelligence and counterterrorism investigations such delays are unacceptable as our law enforcement and intelligence community works to thwart additional terrorist

these proscriptions it makes terrorist attacks and other acts of violence against mass transportation systems federal crimes punishable by imprisonment for any term of years or life if the conveyance

from it to define domestic terrorism section 2331 has for some time defined international terrorism as those criminal acts of violence committed primarily overseas or internationally that appear to be intended to intimidate or coerce civilian population or to influence governmental policy by intimidation or coercion or to affect the conduct of government by assassination or kidnaping 18 usc 23311 section 802 simply modifies this last element to include acts that appear to be intended to affect the conduct of government by mass destruction assassination or kidnaping it defines domestic terrorism as those criminal acts dangerous to human life committed primarily within the united states that appear to be intended to intimidate or coerce civilian population or to influence governmental policy by intimidation or coercion or to affect the conduct of government by mass destruction assassination or kidnaping 18 usc 23315 section 803 prohibition against harboring terrorists

accessory after the fact to federal crime including by harboring the offender 18 usc 3 the justice department asked that terrorist harboring offense be added to the espionage section and that it be

section 804 jurisdiction over crimes committed at us facilities abroad crime is usually outlawed prosecuted and punished where it is committed in the case of the united states this matter of practical and diplomatic preference rather than constitutional necessity consequently surprising number of federal criminal laws have extraterritoria l application in some instances the statute proscribing the misconduct expressly permits the exercise of extraterritorial jurisdiction eg 18 usc 2332a relating to use of weapons of mass destruction by an american overseas in others such as those banning assassination of members of congress 18 usc 351 or the attempted murder of federal law enforcement officers 18 usc 1114 the court will assume congress intended the prohibitions to have extraterritorial reach10 section 804 touches upon extraterritoriality only to limited extent and in somewhat unusual manner the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the united states represent two variations of the extraterritorial jurisdiction congress has made most common law crimes murder sexual abuse kidnaping assault robbery theft and the like federal crimes when committed within the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the united states the special maritime jurisdiction of the united states extends to the vessels of the united states historically the

some courts have found in assistance which takes the form of trainingand personnel humanitarian law project v reno 205 f3d 1130 1137136 9th cir 2000 finally the section declares that prosecution for violation of section 2339a support of terrorists may be brought where the support is provided or where the predicate act of terrorism occurs the full benefit of this amendment may have to await

instrumentality of terrorism the usa patriot act attacks terrorism at its most vulnerable spot its need for financial support the acts invigorating of the international economic emergency powers act asset forfeiture and its money laundering measures are calculated to encumber and prevent terrorism by drying up its sources of financial support section 806 supplies another tool for that effort it subjects to civil forfeiture property wherever located 1 which belongs to an individual or entity planning or engaging in domestic or international terrorism against the united states as defined in 18 usc 2331 or which affords the individual source of influence over terrorist organization 2 which is acquired or maintained for use in furtherance of acts of domestic or international terrorism committed against americans or 3 which is derived from or is useful for the commission of acts of domestic or international terrorism committed against the americans 18 usc 981a1g the section is

federal property property used in an activity affecting interstate commerce and use of an explosive during the commission of federal offense 18 usc 3295 the administration recommended the elimination of statute of limitations in terrorism cases section 809 takes less dramatic approach it eliminates the statute of limitations for any federal crime of terrorism as defined by 18 usc 2332bg5b with the amendments of 808 that risks or results in death or serious bodily injury 18 usc 3286 in the absence of such risk or result all other terrorism offenses become subject to the eight year statute of

distinguish between those convicted of some garden variety crime of terrorism and the more serious offender meriting the alternative supplementary penalty section 810 instead opts to simply increase
