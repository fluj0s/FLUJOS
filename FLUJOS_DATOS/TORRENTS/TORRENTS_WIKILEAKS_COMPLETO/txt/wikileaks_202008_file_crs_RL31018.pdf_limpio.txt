us national security summary globalization is term usually used to describe intercontinental economic social and political integration many people businesses and countries benefit from globalization but others may be hurt economically some cultures may be harmed and the environment may suffer us national security faces both benefits and risks from globalization several contemporary developments that effect us security are often linked to globalization even though they may not be not directly related to multinational integration developments such as decreased defense budgets increased military use of civilian products and technology privatization of defense rd consolidation of defense industries and increased military use of sophisticated information systems are the results of decisions based on changes in the foreign threat technological innovations and domestic political and economic changes globalization and other developments affecting us defense industry and government research acquisition security and export control policies have shaped security environment sharply different than that of the cold war globalization may actually reduce the risks of conflict among closely connected nations economic integration probably contributes to international political stability by increasing economic interdependence and helping the spread of democracy in conjunction with related defense developments globalization has contributed to enhanced us military capabilities through the efficient application of commercial technolog ies and commercial services and has improved interoperability of allied forces according to study by the defense science board the us militarys exploitation of advanced information systems sensors navigation devices and computers some of the same technologies that have driven globalization has enabled us leaders to coordinate firepower and troop movements with unprecedented combat effectiveness while reducing the level of us casualties globalization is also increasing us vulnerability as key military and dualuse technologies become available to all countries that can afford them and world travel and information flows have been made inexpensive and relatively easy the us armed forces also have become more reliant on sophisticated electronics some of it produced abroad and are exposed to new forms of information warfare the military industrial base may become less responsive to national security needs as it takes clients materials labor and capital from the global market many policy options have been suggested that may offer limited means for exploiting the opportunities and ameliorating the problems created by globalization and related developments some options that are likely to receive congressional consideration

concept of globalization globalization is widely and somewhat loosely used term intended to describe the recent and rapid process of intercontinental economic social and political integration this worldwide integration allows people to communicate travel and invest internationally and helps companies market their products widely acquire capital and human and material resources more efficiently share advanced technology and enjoy economies of scale while many benefit from globalization others are hurt economically some cultures may be harmed and local environments may suffer globalization in conjunction with range of other developments and policies produces both benefits and risks affecting us national security for broader view of economic globalization its history controversies and

personnel and construction have been significantly greater than the decline in rd see crs report rl30447 defense budget for fy2001 by mary tyszkiewicz and stephen daggettthe factors that are most often credited with driving globalization are the rapid advances in electronic information and transportation systems the end of the cold war with the attendant collapse of communism and the inherent urge of many people to trade travel and spread information the concurrent spread of democracy and free markets makes politically possible that which has become physically and economically possible warfare trade protectionism economic recession or disease can slow globalization even if as many authors contend globalization is an inevitable development numerous policy decisions will affect the us ability to exploit its benefits and avoid some of its pitfalls discussion of some of the many policy options congress may consider can be found on the last two pages of this report related phenomena some authors link range of defenserelated developments to globalization in explaining causes of the current security situation and arguing for certain remedies even though these other developments are not directly related to multinat ional integration while they affect us national security and have occurred largely since the end of the cold war many such phenomena derive from us policy decisions rather than from globalization per including these developments in the discussion may aid ones understanding of trends in us national security but it may obfuscate the issue of globalization frequently linked phenomena include1 deep cuts in us defense investment since the end of the cold war2 increased pentagon purchasing of offtheshelf civilian items civilianization of us defense research and development shift of emphasis in military rd from longterm to nearterm rapid consolidation of defense industries increased military purchases of sophisticated information technologies increased importance of economic factors in us arms sales defense department transition to electronic business operating systems increasingly vulnerable personnel security and export control systems

the board reports that the effects of globalization are inseparable from those of the increased use of the commercial sector p 11uncertainty over us ability to maintain military superiority through technology these phenomena have benefits and risks of their own separate from those of globalization it may be useful to try to maintain these distinctions when examining policies to respond to the effects of globalization implications for us national security the effects of globalization and related factors on national security are mixed they provide benefits and opportunities as well as problems and risks some observers believe globalization has reduced the risks of war among interdependent states made the us military more efficient and technologically sophisticated but also more vulnerable to nuclear biological and chemical nbc weapons missiles and information warfare and more dependent on civilian industries including foreign companies that have little direct stake in us security based on these developments the us military appears to be increasingly linked to international companies technologies and threats but even though us military involvement and influence are widespread some authors believe military globalism is in period of decline having peaked in the two world wars and the extensive competition between east and west during the cold war this military deglobalization has profound effect on us national security the united states longer needs to prepare for total war with soviet behemoth but has the option of reshaping its armed forces to deter or defeat less powerful regional forces prevent the use and spread of nbc weapons counter international terrorists and defend against information warfare3 positive implications recent report by the national intelligen ce council concluded that economic globalization would contribute to international political stability by increasing economic interdependence and helping the spread of democracy4 according to the defense science board task force on globalization and security globalization and dods increased use of civilian businesses have numerous actual and potential benefits5 huge gains in military capability achieved through rapid insertion of leading edge commercial technology and comparable gains in efficiency through use of commercial services increased pace of modernization by reducing system acquisition cycle potentially lowered costs of systems upgrades and operational supporthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31018crs4 6defense science board final report pp iiivi 726 7according to the dsb the vulnerabilities of current heavy slow shortrange us general purpose forces are compounded by declining defense rd investments which have severely depressed us militarytechnological innovation p vi see footnote 2 for trends in defense rd 8the risk is reportedly compounded by an illconfigured personnel security system which over classifies information emphasizes physical access control and inadequate ly monitors continuedenhanced dod efficiency and effectiveness improved sharing of the fiscal burden of development and production among allies better innovation and industrial efficiencies increased politicalmilitary cohesion and promoted interoperability the first four of these benefits appear to be more closely associated with dods increased use of the us civil sector and civilian business methods than with inexorable globalization per additional benefits accrue to the us military from its exploitation of some of the same technological advances that have facilitated globalization for instance the us development of longrange precision guided munitions and advanced communications and navigation systems have greatly reduced us casualties while giving us forces the ability to coordinate the operations of its forces and support units collect information on its enemy and inflict heavy enemy losses the diffusion of the english language western culture and western concepts probably improves the ability of us forces and allies to communicate and operate worldwide risks or negative implications the primary risks of globalization identified by the defense science board are as follows6 globalizations most significant manifestation is the irresistible leveling effect it is having on the international militarytechnological environment in which dod must compete commercial technology including spacerelated surveillance sensor signal processing simulation and telecommunications technology is nearly universally available using new technology adversaries could exploit current us weaknesses in power projection disrupting deployment preparations denying access to the theater degrading us force capabilities in the theater raising the costs of us intervention and eroding us military dominance7 extensive use of the internet places most of dods digital activities and information within the cyberreach of any and all who want to rapidly gather intelligence on the united states andor who wish us harm also dods everincreasing reliance on commercial software often developed offshore andor by software engineers who owe little if any allegiance to the united sates is likely to amplify dod vulnerability to information operations8httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31018crs5 8continued personnel and unclassified but critical information dsb p iv 9the defense science board concludes so long as the established security mechanisms are in place the risks of unauthorized disclosure can be mitigated if imperfectly p v see note 13 10global trends 2015 p 40 11more specifically the action was triggered by us embargo of french agricultural products in response to an eu refusal to import us meat from cattle treated with hormonesforeignowned firms or potentially any individual operating in the united states may transfer sensitive technology to hostile power open channels of communication trade and travel facilitate such transfers9 us defense industrial capabilities could be eroded if foreign firms buy us firms and relocate facilities overseas us government influence in weapon system design could decrease if consolidations lead to few large companies serving many nations arms sales may harm national political or security objectives because of increasing influence of economic considerations these risks are each closely associated with the global spread of dualuse technology and foreign participation in us defense industry except that the commercialization of foreign arms sales is probably more driven by the end of the cold war reduced us military procurement industrys profit motivation dods desire to reduce unit acquisition costs through longer production runs and the lack of international consensus on security threats and export controls reduced controls on the export of dualuse technologies and globalized trade may facilitate the proliferation of nuclear biological and chemical weapons and missile delivery systems which will be destabilizing and increase the risk of miscalculation and conflict that produces high casualties10 lack of caution in exporting conventional weapons and dualuse technology may also help regional powers build military capabili ties that could be destabilizing and harmful to us security particularly if transfer decisions are based increasingly on business concerns rather than us security interests in the 1980s many congressmen were concerned the united states was exporting too much technology to iraq in the last several years numerous congressmen have criticized us technology exports to china because of the implications for national security direct threat to local security if not national security is generated by adverse public reaction to certain aspects and perceptions of globalization to some globalization smacks of cultural imperialism josé bové and four of his colleagues in peasants confederation destroyed mcdonalds restaurant in france in protest against capitalist globalization11 large groups demonstrated against globalization at the world trade organization meeting in seattle in november 1999 the world bankimf meetings in washington dc in april 2000 and in

seattle demonstration was particularly disorderly these demonstrations can lead to riots and could be exploited by terrorist groups some riots in the united states have been very destructive but none in recent history were taken over by revolutionary groups or threatened national integrity governments have also attempted to defend their countries from foreign cultural and economic invasion many have tried to curb the influence of american music motion pictures television printed material alcoholic beverages and even clothing china relented after its cultural revolution but some islamic countries remain adamant france tries to protect its language resistance to the presence of american troops in strategically located countries is another security challenge somewhat related to globalization the increased involvement of multinational companies in the us defense sector suggests broader risk some of these companies are positioned to exert great deal of influence on us policies through lobbying and election campaign contributions the views of these companies regarding issues such as force structure acquisition policy research export controls and sanctions could be based more on multinational profit considerations than on fundamental notions of us security12 if these effects of globalization continue the us government may become less able to use industry to influence foreign countries and industry may be more able to use the us government to support its commercial interests without consensus on clear security threat the national intelligence council predicts the united states will have difficulty drawing on its economic prowess to advance its foreign policy agenda13 on the other hand some authors contend globalization is not significantly weakening sovereignty or state control these observers believe that even though national corporations national currencies and national citizenship may have eroded states still maintain their physical borders and the governments of economically advanced countries are more heavily involved in national economies than they were 50 years ago14 others note that campaign finance reforms currently being considered in congress may moderate corporate influence on government policies options to maximize benefits and minimize problems because globalization is sometimes said to be fact not choice or policy option it can be used to argue the futility of certain government actions or to justifyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31018crs7 15defense science board pp xii and 48 increasing foreign arms sales and

group iv 1999 final report premises for policy maintaining military superiority in the 21st centuryinaction but policy choices clearly play role in the way globalization affects security the defense science board suggests the united states should maintain its military dominance in the face of global technology leveling primarily by strengthening essential us military capabilities in its view modernization efforts should rely on the exploitation of commercial products and services while continuing to protect essential defense technology particularly system integration capabilities from compromise and hostile exploitation the country should deemphasize technology protection as means of preserving dominance the board suggests dod should identify and mitigate its vulnerabilities arising from its use of commercial software and the globalization of information technology fixing responsibilities for information systems integrity in the acquisition process and in operations to aid in determining which technologies are widely available and therefore difficult to control and in identifying potential foreign sources of useful information the board recommended that dod maintain global database of militarily relevant technologies and capabilities in its report the board also recommends measures to facilitate transnational particularly transatlantic defense industrial collaboration and integration it says dod should be open to crossborder defense industrial linkages that enhance us security interoperability with potential coalition partners and competition in defense markets the us government in the boards view should also facilitate defense exports and foreign direct investment in the us defense sector15 it also recommended less emphasis on personnel security clearances and the classification of large amounts of information focusing instead on the securityrelated behavior of people in sensitive positions the needtoknow and the protection of particularly sensitive information and information systems whether they are classified or not16 the dod strategic studies group did not disagree with the boards recommendations and added detailed suggestions for enhancing information and personnel security17 the center for strategic and budgetary assessments has proposed somewhat different approach for reforming the newly consolidated defense industry so that it can respond to emerging challenges and uncertainty created by technology diffusion and globalization of the defense industrial base us defense industries should probably according to the center maintain the skilled design teams and computerassisted processes for architecture integration creating wide variety of products and systems of systems the industries should also maintain the ability to apply available technology to military systems quickly so that the military can shape its acquisitions to developing needs and avoid large quantities of unneeded equipment in case

against the denial of offshore globalized industrial support18 the center made additional suggestions for maintaining the strength and innovative capabilities of the defense sector as it is further consolidated and globalized and as competition within the defense budget grows the defense department should identify the areas of technology in which research and development will be critical and efficient rd should be focused more on science and the technology of several new weapons systems rather than on the expensive engineering and manufacturing development to modify older systems defense firms should be encouraged to use independent research and development ird funds to pursue new innovative capabilities19 to help the financial health of defense industries the center suggested dod consider sharing cost savings that industries realize through greater efficiencies and also increasing progress payments in the early phases of the development cycle to help maintain skilled workforce at boeing and lockheed martin the center suggested dod might extend production of the fa18ef and the f16 block 60 to cover the gap until joint strike fighters are being produced and might press the development of unmanned combat air vehicles they believe that multiyear procurement contracts would add greater stability and predictabi lity to military production increasing commonality of systems and subsystems using more offthe shelf technology reducing underused production facilities and sharing the savings with industry could also benefit the health of the us defense sector in the view of the center20 number of diverse options for addressing the effects of globalization in addition to those suggested by the defense science board include maintaining backup communications fire control and information systems and developing systems that are less susceptibl to jamming intercept and alteration negotiating arms control and nonproliferation agreements to win international cooperation in observing norms in the development testing deployment use or transfer of particular weapons and technologies maintaining core alliances with great regional powers preserving and building military relationships with friendly second tier military powers and avoiding military competition with other great regional powers21httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31018crs9 22ibid p 60 61 23strategic studies group

adversarial countries30 and allowed foreign ownership of us defense industries while there is divergence on the nature of globalization and its effects on security there is even greater divergence on proper policies to manage globalization what is good for large multinational corporation may or may not be good for us national security it is widely held that it is beneficial to us security to help the economic modernization of even our adversaries because that may lead to political liberalization and international responsibility however few would suggest we help adversaries modernize their military capabilities congress may wish to examine carefully policies proposed in the name of globalization for their security implications as well as business and political implicationshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31018
