from mike hulme mhulmeueaacuk to pritchard norah norahpritchardmetofficecom subject re ipcc wg2 ar4 draft outlines wgii outline chapters 2 and 13 date mon jun 2 134907 2003 dear osvaldo and martin it is very difficult to make considered input into this process at such short notice i received the emails wednesday afternoon just before being away from the office for 48 hours i also am not fully aware of the process into which this is fitting and it is the first time i have seen the wgii outline i do however make some comments on the following the wgii outline chapter 2 on data etc chapter 13 on critical damage etc wgii outline key questions there is in analytical terms very little difference between the 2nd and 4th key question you pose the impacts under unmitigated cc q2 are not in any fundamental way different from the impacts under mitigated cc q4 2degc warming for example will give broadly the same impacts whether this occurs because of strong cc policy intervention or whether it occurs because of low carbon development paths what matters more for impacts is the rate of cc and what matters more for how important those impacts are is the development path pursued i think this distinction between mitigated and unmitigated cc is tenuous and unhelpful this has bearing on the later discussions about stabilisation where stabilisation is usually assumed to be indeed often synonymous with the result of mitigative action actually quasi stabilisation at different levels can occur in world with relatively little direct cc mitigation policy the progression through the sections follows rather linear and reductionist model observed impacts future impacts adaptationregions i would have liked to have seen an early opening chapter on the nature of the dynamic relationship between climate and society before we even start talking about climate change this being able to bring out notions of vulnerability and adaptation both fundamental to put on the table before we start thinking about future climate change and how important it is this could also point out that critical damage is already being caused by climate and climate variability under your structure the observed impacts section ii should surely parallel the later future impacts section iii in terms of sectorsthemes there are only 4 themes in section ii yet 6 different themes in section iii why for example is nothing said about observed impacts on urban infrastructure or on coasts the asymmetry between these section subthemes is itself perhaps revealing it seems odd that adaptation is to be addressed in all the thematic chapters in section iii as well as in separate later chapter on adaptation this situation is ripe for overlap and redundancy our understanding of adaptation in any case should be brought in right at the beginning see above the avoiding critical damage chapter suffers from the same problem identified above what matters is whether and how such exceedance rates can be identified not whether they result from either mitigated or an unmitigated scenario this academic distinction cannot be sustained in the real world the regional section is in danger of repeating the mistake in the tar again leading to dispersion of effort and redundancy my suggestion would be not to assess all new regional knowledge again very turgid but instead to produce much more streamlined section focusing on few regionallocal case studies that illustrate sharply many of the integrating themes introduced earlier vulnerability adaptation criticality impacts deliberately seek to be selective and not comprehensive i also do not see how the wgii chapters will be coordinated with the 5 crosscutting papers identified here again there seems much scope for duplicitous effort and redundancy or even contradiction and since the crosscutting papers are really the interesting and useful ones this suggests to that the old traditional wg structure of ipcc is now deeply flawed as i have said more than once before in public chapter 2 assumptions etc first question to raise is what is wgi doing in this regard i cannot comment sensibly without knowing how wgi will tackle questions of scenarios and future projections in section 23 4th bullet how relevant really are these stabilisation scenarios mitigation at the very least ipcc must clear up this issue about whether stabilisation is shorthand for mitigation as implied here this is potentially misleading since stabilisation can occur in many different worlds by means all of them worlds with strong cc mitigation policies continuation of this thinking means reality is being forced to accommodate the arbitrary thinking of the unfccc rather than unfccc being forced to take account of reality also in this bullet is impacts of extreme climate events why are impacts being looked at here surely this is totally misplaced what is important are scenarios of whatever origin and methodology that embed within them changes in the character of extreme weather and how we describe such changes we should not separate this out as separate issue surely section 24 the second appearance confuses much of this material appears earlier in 23 thus characterisations of future conditions is what 23 is about and also the projected changes in key drivers is what the scenarios part of 23 is all about do you mean to differentiate between methodology 23 and outcomes 24b and as always you will run into the problem of summarising what scenarios actually are assumed in this report is there to be an ipcc 4ar standard scenarios that all should use i suspect not resolving this problem gets to the heart of the structural problem with ipcc different people will use different assumptions chapter 13 critical damage this outline was almost unintelligible to for example having read the opening aims and scope statement several times i an still not clear about the approach this chapter is taking sections 132 and 133 are also extremely unclear as is section 134 i think someone needs to do some clearer thinking about this chapter before sending it out for people to comment on i have my own views on this but at such short notice and without knowing the agreed ipcc process im not going to write the chapter outline for you inter alia the chapter should address the following different paradigms for defining critical will vary by sector culture etc distinction between external pronounced definitions of critical and internal experiencedperceived definitions relationship between adaptive capacity and critical rates of change dependence of critical thresholds on sector and spatial scale reversibility or not of critical damage and if the use of critical is euphemism for dangerous then it is not very subtle people will see through this what is the difference between critical and dangerous professor mike hulme tyndall centre at 1432 28052003 0100 you wrote dear mike we are now developing chapter outlines for the fourth assessment report of the ipcc and we write to ask if you will help us in this task enclosed is onepage outline of the proposed chapter on assumptions data and scenarios which we would like you to adjust and expand but not to more than one and half pages in all please the overall list of proposed topics to be covered in the assessment is also attached we would like to make the next revision to the outline in few days so could you please return your outline to norah pritchard ipccwg2metofficecom at the wgii techical support unit at the uk met offices hadley centre not later than 2nd june the process of designing the fourth assessment and selecting authors is different from previously this time the authors will not be nominated by governments and then selected until after the outline has been approved by ipcc plenary this november the outlines are there fore being widely commented on between now and midseptember when they will be finalised we consider your input at this time to be most important we appreciate that you are busy but urge that you give few minutes to this crucial task in another message we will be writing for your suggestions regarding other experts to consult in the fields of assumptions data and scenarios we look forward to hearing from you with thanks and kind regards osvaldo canziani and mart in parry cochairs ipcc working group ii vulnerability impacts
