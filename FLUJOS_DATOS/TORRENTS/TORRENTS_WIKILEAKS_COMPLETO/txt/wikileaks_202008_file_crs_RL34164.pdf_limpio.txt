vulnerable to si gnificant improper payments to estimate the amount of overp ayments or underpayments and to report to congress on steps being take n to reduce such payments in may 2003 the office of management and budget omb issued guidance to agencies on the implementation of the ipia which was revised and incorporated into omb circular a123 as appendix c in august 2006 ombs guidance while consistent with some provisions of the ipia has been criticized on several counts whereas the statute requires agencies to report to congress on all programs with more than 10 million in estimated imprope r payments omb added an additional threshold such that agencies must only report on programs w ith improper payments that exceed both 10 million and 25 of to tal program paymen ts critics have identified number of examples of pr ograms with improper payments over 10 million that are not reported to congress because they do not also meet the 25 threshold in the 2006 update of its guidan ce omb stated that it may determine on casebycase basis that some programs ar to be subject to annual performance and accountability report requireme nts even if they do not meet the 25 threshold ombs guidance has also been criticized for permitting agencies to exempt some programs from the ipias annual requi rement for risk assessment under the act every program and activity is to be reviewed each year ombs guidance however now allows agencies to review program once every three years if it has been deemed lowrisk critics say this runs counter to the language and intent of the ipia and that it leaves open the possibility that improper payments might go undetected during the exemption period for fy2007 omb reported governmentwid error rate of 35 this figure does not cover an estimated 16 of

significant erroneous payments defined as annual erroneous payments in the program exceeding both 25 of the program payments and 10 million second agencies were to termine an annual estimated amount of erroneous payments made in those pr ograms and activities found susceptible to significant errors this calculation was to be based on sta tistical random sample sufficiently large to yield an estimate with 90 percent confidence interval within 5 precision the third step was to deter mine why the particular programs were at risk and then put in place plan to reduce the erroneous payments the last step was agency reporting to the president via omb and congress on the estimates of the annual amount of erroneous pa yments in its programs and activities and on progress in reducing them revision of omb circular a123 in the summer of 2006 omb issued new appendix to omb circular a1237 updating the guidance in m0313 appendix c titled requirements for effective measurement and remediation of improper payments8 contained two parts the first addressed ipia reporting and the second recovery auditing9 it began with new language expanding and clarifying the definition of an improper payment an improper payment is any payment that should not have been made or that was made in an incorrect amount under statutory contractual administrative or other legally applicab requirements incorrect amounts are overpayments and underpayments includi ng inappropriate denials of payment or services an improper payment includes any payment that was made to an ineligible recipient or for an ineligible service duplicate payments payments for services not received and payments that are for the incorrect amount in addition when an agencys review is unable to discern whether payment was proper as result of insufficient or lack of documentation this payment must also be considered in error10 other noteworthy features in the update included provisions for alternative sampling methodologies repor ting requirements for certain low risk programs and guidance for federal agencies that fund st ateadministered programs the revision also contained best

receives green rating if it meets the first four criteria but not the fifth and sixth it is rated yellow and if an agency fails to meet any one of the first four criteria it is rated red the criteria an agency must meet to get to green in the eip initiative include the following have risk assessment in place that identifies all programs that are at significant risk of improper payments have an ombapproved plan for measuring improper payments on an annual basis and meet milest ones established in the plan have an ombapproved correctiv action plan that includes reduction targets be in

receiving green increased from zero to five and the number of agencies receiving red declined from 10 to two the first agency to attain green was the depar tment of housing and urban development hud on the june 2005 scorecard joined th next quarter by the department of labor the only agency to receive red grad throughout the period depicted was the department of the treasury further examination of the data in figure 1 however discloses more complicated picture fo r example the first three quarters in fy2007 had the same totals for the red two yellow nine and green four grades yet there were noteworthy changes from the march to j une 2007 ratings hhs advanced from red to yellow while dhs slipped from yellow back to red with respect to the most recent scorecards depicted in figure 1 the grades recorded for june 30 2007 and septembe r 30 2007 were identical as were the grades for december 31 2007 and march 31 2008 during the last four quarters hud slipped from green to yellow for december 2007 and march 2008 but had returned to green by june 30 2008 the only other change during this period was the movement of sba from yellow to green one might arguably suggest that many of the agencies 8 out of 15 are experiencing some difficulty in progressing from yellow to green in the scorecards the up and down arrows in figure 1 indicate change in grade from the previous quarter during the 15 quarters covered there were 19 instances where an agencys grade changed from one quarter to the next most of the changes 16 reflect an improvement in rating w ith the national science foundation nsf jumping from red to green in the final quarter of 2005 hence the double arrows on the other hand there were four instances when an agencys grade was lowered from one quarter to the next the department of veterans affairs va received four yellows followed by four greens and then slipped back to yellow for the last three quarters the small business administration sba started with red advanced to yellow for four quarters and then to green for three quarters but slipped back to yellow for the three quarters before retu rning to green the dhs went from four reds to six yellows and then for the last five quarters entered in the chart regressed back to red in addition to the current status grades provided in figure 1 omb since 2005 also has given the agencies gr ade for progress

quarters ending december 31 2005 and march 31 2006 all agencies included in the scorecard received green except for the department of the treasury17 for the next six quarters either two three or four agencies received yellow grade but th group of agencies not receiving green varied somewhat from quarter to quarter by june 30 2007 there was just one yellow treasury but for the first time an agen cy dhs received red grade for progress in implementation in the septembe r 2007 scorecard dhs had moved back up to green the only yellow was for treasury the same ratings 14 green and 1 yellow appeared in the december 2007 scorecard by march 2008 two more agencies education and dhs were back in the yellow category and the scorecard for june 30 2008 remained unchanged from the previous quarter it is not clear that how useful scorecard ratings are as indicators of agency results in eliminating impr oper payments while ombs standards for success overlap with ipia objectives the scorecard ratings themselves do not appear to be tightly linked to improper payments rate s or amounts the department of labor dol for example improved from yellow rating at the start of fy2005 to green by the end of that fiscal year ev though its error rate increased during that time18 similarly the department of h ousing and urban development hud received green rating in each quart er of fy2006 despite reporting nearly 15 billion in improper payments that year19 under the present scorecard grading system then an agency may receive the highest ra ting even when its error rate increases or when the dollar value of its improper payments reaches into the billions as discussed in more deta il below an apparent increase in error rate or total amount of improper payments due an agency may actually reflect

number of major programs are among those lacking estimates including the state child health insurance program schip temporary assistance for needy families tanf and medicare prescription drug benefit part d in the 2008 report omb noted th at delays in reporting error measurement in remaining programs occur because man stateadministered programs are subject to complex regulatory guidelines that n eed to be followed before conducting error measurements for example agencies need to receive feedback from program recipients about viable alternatives for m easuring error consequently development of national and statistically valid erro r measurement can take months and even years to complete26 until all these programs have estimates however the full extent of the improper paymen ts problem will remain unknown continuing concerns reporting threshold there has been criticism of ombs definition of significant emphasis added improper payments in addition to th 10 million threshold in estimated

questioning the 25 minimum threshold likewise according to news ar ticle senators charles grassley and max baucus then the chairman and ranking minority member of the senate finance committee stated in january 9 2004 letter to then omb director joshua bolten that omb should not have established th 25 threshold and should have simply required that agencies report all programs generating estimated improper payments of more than 10 million the senators re portedly observed that by adding the 25 threshold the improper payments figures that will eventually be reported to the public will look better and feel be tter than they really are27 according to gao the 25 threshold c ould mask the extent of the improper payments problem in 2006 report reviewing agency pars from fy2005 gao identified many examples of agency programs with estimated improper payments over 10 million that were not included in the agencys improper payments estimate because they did not meet the 25 threshold28 for example gao said that the department of education did not report on three programs that each had estimated improper payments exceeding 10 million 155 million in total b ecause in each case those payments represented less than 25 of program outlays29 if the 25 criterion were applied to large programs gao conc luded billions of dollars in improper payments could go unreported30 omb has defended the 25 threshold stating it was established to ensure that agencies were focusing their resources on programs with the highest levels of risk for improper payments31 as noted above revised ipia guidance issued by omb in 2006 as appendix c to circular a123 addresse d this issue to some extent language in the updated version stated explicitly that omb could require large program with relatively high annual outlays but that failed to meet the 25 criteria to be considered as high risk and included in the agencys annual ipia reporting such determination however would be done by omb

advised omb that the provision to perform risk assessm ents every 3 years for those programs not deemed risksusceptible was inconsistent with the ipia requirement for agencies to review all programs and activities annually33 ombs exemption from the ipias annua l review requirement might exacerbate the consequences of inaccurate risk assessments agencies are still refining their procedures for identifying risksusceptible programs in some cases improvements in risk assessment methods have resulted in programs being designated as risk susceptible that previously had been c onsidered lowrisk the department of agriculture usda for example enha nced its risk assessment methodology in fy2006 and as consequence it determined that four programs were susceptible to significant improper payments that year which had been considered lowrisk the previous year34 usda reported that those four programs had tota l outlays of 128 billion and had issued combined 804 million in improper payments35 while omb praised the agency for identifying previously undetected improper payments usda could have claimed om bs annual review exemption for the four programs after determining they were lowrisk in

credited back to the original appropriation or deposited in the treasury as miscellaneous receipts if the appropriation is longer available ombs guidance on recovery auditing requires agencies to

for gao and daniel werfel acting controller testified for omb45 mr williams indicated that his tes timony was based on gao report sent to the subcommittee the previous week 46 and that despite the improvements to date challenges continue with respect to ipia implementation mr williams outlined five specific problems one issue is the comprehensiveness of agencies risk assessments despite the ipia requireme nt for an annual review of all agency programs that may be susceptible to significant improper payments the review of 2007 pars by gao indicated that not all agencies reported conducting risk assessments some agencies reported that they did not conduct risk assessment of all their programs since omb guidance allows agency programs deemed not risk susceptible to conduct risk assessm ent generally every three years47 second problem according to gao rela tes to the inclusiveness of improper payment estimates gao found th at estimates have not been developed for all of the programs identified as risksusceptib for improper payments the 55 b illion improper payment estimate for fy2007 di d not cover 14 programs with fy2007 outlays totaling approximate ly 170 billion third challe nge cited by gao involves ipia noncompliance issues few audito rs reported on ipia compliance problems as part of their audits of an agency s fy2007 financial statements according to gao these noncomp liance issues related to the key requirements of the act including risk assessments sampling methodologies imple menting corrective actions recovering improper paymen ts and inadequa documentation48 another omission in some of the agency reports involved the absence of discussion on possible statutory or regulatory barriers impeding agencies ability to reduce improper payments the fifth problem relates to management challenges in the design or implementation of necessary internal controls which are critical in efforts to identify improper payments and prevent them in the future

senate continuedprograms that are measured each year second agencies are moving forward toward closing all reporting gaps so that the full extent of governmentwide improper payments will be known within few years third after an agency has identified and reported payment errors it is able to implement corrective actions and reduce those errors in subsequent years mr we rfel in reviewing these trends stated that after four years of ipia imp lementation agencies genera lly have the tools in place to ensure that all high risk activities are identified and measured agencies do not however currently have the full complement of tools they need to eliminate improper payments49 mr werfel then suggested three strategies to address this deficiency first maximize the impact of program integrity dollars in other words concentrate efforts on the higher risk larger dollar amount programs nine programs account for 90 of the fy2 007 govern mentwide improper payment total second address challenges in eligibility verification such errors accounted for about 80 of total improper payment errors in fy2007 th ird mr werfel suppor ted enactment of specific program reforms recommended by the administration most recently being reproposed in the presidents fy2009 budget50 there has not been an oversight hearing focused exclusively on the ipia in the house during the 110th congress on june 3 2008 however the subcommittee on government management or ganization and procuremen t held hearing titled oversight of federal financial management51 testimony provided by omb reviewed the status of financial reporting governmentwide as well as at the agency level mr werfel then referred to other improvement initiatives including reducing improper payments he praised congress fo r

ip ia to expand and strengthen ongoing efforts to identify reduce and rec over improper payments due the federal government for example the threshhold fo r agency heads to identify programs as susceptible to significant improper paym ents would be broadened creating the likelihood that more agencies would have to report on additional programs while the floor for program expenditures subject to recovery auditing would be lowered expanded reporting requirement s regarding corrective acti on to be taken would be placed on the agencies and omb agency inspectors general would be newly tasked with the responsibility of preparing annua l compliance reports and these would be included with the annual fi nancial statements timetiered approach for remediation of an agencys noncompliance status would be established ranging from submission of corrective action plan to congress to mandatory submission of reauthorization proposals which if not approved by congress would trigger freeze in level of authorizations s 2583 as reported also would allow the omb director to establish pilot programs on compliance enforcement to test potential accountability mechanisms along with incentiv or penalties to ensure statutory compliance with law and ultimately elimination of improper payments in the house companion bill h r 5467 was in troduced on fe bruary 14 2008 but further action has
