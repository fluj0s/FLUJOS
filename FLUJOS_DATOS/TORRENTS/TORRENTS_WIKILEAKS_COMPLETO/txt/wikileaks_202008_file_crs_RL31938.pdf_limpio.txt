goals of the tel ecommunications act of 1996 p l 104104 is to promote competition in the locale xchange telephone market the 1996 act attempts to foster this competition by among other provisions requiring that the local monopoly infrastructure be opened up to competitors the federal communications commission fcc has been tasked with implementing series of rulemakings to achieve this goal in the seven years since the acts passage policy makers have continued to bate the extent to which this goal has been realized although the local telephone market d experienced limited competitive entry in selected high end urbanized business ma rkets since the 1980s the birth of local exchange competition can be traced to larg degree to changes that have occurred since the implementation of the market opening provisions contained in the 1996 act the major players involved in this tr ansition are the incumbent local exchange carriers or ilecs who control but have been required to provide access to the legacy network and wide range of entities known as compe titive local exchange carriers or clecs who through thes market opening provisions have been encouraged to compete with the ilecs for market share the ilecs or established carriers are composed of exchange carriers that are the historical holders of th franchise to provide exchan ge service local transport and switching services within designated service territory those who compete with the incumbents or clecs enter the market in any one or any combination of three major ways through resale of the ilecs retail services through the use of unbundled network elements or through the building of their own facilities ilecs continue to dominate the local ex change market in terms of both revenue share 874 percent and number of access lin 886 percent but clecs have been steadily making inroads the clec industry has overall experienced steady increase in both real and absolute terms in industry revenues and access line market share despite this overall increase the level of competition has entered markets both in terms of service sector and geogra phy to varying degrees in general high volume business markets have benefitted more from competitive entry as have more densely populated markets competition in residential and sma ll business markets and in geographic markets outside of major metropolitan areas while increasing generally tends to be less robust ilecs continue to dominate in the residential market the growth of competition has been uneven with some individual markets experiencing high levels of competitive try and others experiencing next to none in the seven years since the passage of the 1996 telecommunications act competition has grown but perhaps at sl ower pace than some envisioned the entrance of competition in the local exchange market however continues to be work in progress that remains subject to economic legal and regulatory forces this report will be update d as events

wireline exchange telephone market the impact of the wireless sector goes beyond the scope of this reportlocal telephone competition brief overview one of the central goals of th telecommunications act of 19961 is to promote competition in the local exchange market market that according to federal communications commission fcc statistic s generated reve nues of 1278 billion in 2001 the 1996 act attempts to foster this competition by among other provisions requiring that the local monopoly infrastructure be opened up to competitors the federal communica tions commission fcc in conjunction with the 50 state public utility commissions has been tasked with implementing series of rulemakings to achieve this goal in the seven years since the acts passage policy makers have continued to debate the extent to which this goal has been realized this report analyzes the status of competitiv entry in the local exchange telephone market2 market structure the local exchange market has beg the transition from regulated monopoly to less regulated competitive market stru cture this transition while still in its early stages compared to other telecommunications sectors has been made possible due to combination of technological regulatory and legal actions the local exchange market has experienced limited competitive entry in selected high end urbanized business markets since the 1980s however the birth of local exchange competition can be traced to large degree to changes that have occurred since the implementation of the market openi ng provisions contained in the 1996 telecommunications act th major players involved in this transition are the incumbent local exchange carriers or ilecs who control but have been required to provide access to the legacy network and wide range of entities known as competitive local exchange carriers or clecs who through these market opening provisions have been encouraged to co mpete with the ilecs for market share incumbent local exchange carriers ilecs the local or exchange telephone service market is dominated by the incumbent local exchange carriers or ilecs these ilecs or established carrier s are composed of exchange carriers that are the historical holders of the franchise to provide exchange service local transmission and switching services within designated service territory they arehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31938crs2 3 although often called the local loop this infrastructure actually consists of switches transport facilities between switches and the ubiquitous grid of local loops that connect subscribers to the ilecs switches 4 for additional financial information see the companys web s ite at www alltelcomthe owners of the legacy monopoly in frastructure known as the local loop3 there are approximately 1300 companies fined as ilecs ranging in size from small rural telephone cooperatives with as few as 100 access lines to customers to large holding companies offering service to tens of millions of customers ilecs can be further divided into two sub categories the regional bell operating companies rbocs and the independents the rbocs are the remainder of the legacy bell systems 22 operating companies and were created as resu lt of the 1984 att divestiture at the time of divestiture the 22 operating companies were broken up into 7 regional companies called rbocs due to series of merger s and acquisitions and c onsolidations of the initial seven rbocs four bellsouth corp sbc communications inc qwest communications international inc and verizon communications inc remain rbocs dominate the local exchange market in terms of both access lines and revenue those ilecs that historically ar not part of nd have developed independently of the bell system are called the independent carriers these independents which make up the remaining 1300 ilecs ar not affiliated with the bell companies and range from diversified telecommunications companies such as alltel corp with 2001 year re venues of almost 8 billion4 to small rural telephone cooperatives they serve territories that cover approximately half of the united states in terms of land mass but are substantially smaller than the rbocs in terms of revenue and access lines although the independent ilecs do service some suburban and urban areas in c ontrast to the rbocs they ve more rural footprint the independent ilecs also differ in terms of regulatory requirements in that they tend to be subject to less regulatory overs ight and because of their presence in more rural markets are not as likely to face competition competitive local exchange carriers clecs those who compete with the ilecs for local exchange serv ice market share are known as competitive local exchange carriers or clecs clecs span wide range of entities and own none part or all of their f acilities clecs can also vary in size from multi billion dollar companies that may earn only small fraction of their revenues from local exchange service to small niche providers that earn all of their revenue from such services some clecs are comprised of newly formed entities that have entered the market to provide telecommunications serv ices established long distance carriers have tended to become clecs by deploying their own facilities to serve selected business customers and leasing ilec facilities to serve residential customers while still other clecs such as cable television companies and electric utilities have entered the telecommunications market as the result of diversification and arehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31938crs3 5 additional competitors include municipally owned telecommunications systems and the more recent introduction of internet telephony services offered through broadband connection 6 analysts economists give fcc pe ssimistic outlook on telecom health communications daily october 8 2002 p1 7 ebitda earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortiz ation does not indicate profitability on net basis but is commonly used measure indicating financial healthmodifying or using their existing infrastructure to provide telecommunications services 5 technically the clec classification is bestowed upon an entity based on the market circumstances in which it competes broadly stated clec is an entity that is competing with the incumbent provider for market share so the clec designation is marketspecific one that changes with market circumstances for example the rboc verizon when providing exchange rvice in its home territory of new york would be classified as an il ec however if verizon we re to provide local exchange service in texas market not included in its assigned service territory it would be classified as clec in that specific market similarly if an independent ilec chose to provide exchange service outside its assigned ilec service territory it too would be classified as clec in that outofterritory market however when industry analysts refer to the clec sector they are generally referring to new entities competing with the rbocs and independent ilecs the recent significant decline in the number of clecs and the financial hardship experienced by the clec sector has caused some concern regarding this market segment today it is estimated th at there are approximately 80100 clecs in operation in contrast to the estima ted 300 at the end of 1999 although any number of factors can combine to contribute to an individual clecs decline number of investment analysts and economis ts cited an overly optimistic outlook for customer demand the financial burdens associated with the rapid buildout of costly infrastructure and an unsettled regulato ry climate coupled with an overall weak economy as some factors contributing to this decline6 despite this environment however clec market share has continued to grow in terms of both revenue and access lines see market share overview below the report progress report on the clec industry released in october 2002 by the association for local telecommunications services alts an association representing facilities based clecs provides an optimis tic outlook for this market segment this report which compiled statistics on the 18 largest publicly traded clecs states that the financial health of these companies is positive that is as group they showed positive ebitda7 for the first 6 months of 2002 for the first time in history and two within that gr oup have generated net income furthermore the report states capital remains available with clecs attracting more than 1 billion in investments over the first 9 m onths of 2002 indications are the report claims that the clec industry is stab ilized and is poised to revive in 2003 followup report the state of local competition 2003 issued by alts in april 2003 confirms the midyear findings of its october 2002 report the april 2003 report which compiled endofyear data for 21 publically traded clecs

technologies such as voice over internet prot ocol or voip to transmit voice conversations 10 according to fcc data cable companies repr esent 1 percent of market share in terms of switched access lines see market share overview below 11 comcast wont expand telephony next year executives cite financial regulatory hurdles telecommunications repor ts december 15 2003 p 3results consistent with the october 2002 re port eighteen of the 21 clecs improved their ebitda over the previous year with 13 posting positive ebitda in 2002 the april 2003 report concluded that the financial condition of the clecs as whole has stabilized although it is still qu ite tenuous the reports also note that clec growth while affected by the overa ll economic health of the nation is also dependent on sufficient and timely access to ilec networks and the enforcement of existing rules to ensure that markets re main open and friendly to competition the reports also stress the need for policy make rs and regulators to provide reasonable certainty so that clecs can attract capital investment from financial markets8 cable television entry into telephony the cable television industry has expanded its service offerings beyond its original video programming to include among other products the delivery of facilitiesbased circuit switched voice telephone service to both reside ntial and business customers9 although cable delivered telephone service claims small percentage 1 percent10 of market share cable system operators have the potential to become significant players in the voice market according to the national cable and telecommunications association ncta leading industry trade group cable companies offer both residential and business voice service in over 30 cities and 15 states across the country and as of yearend 2002 cable companies served pproximately 25 milli on residential local voice customers att broadband the nations largest cable multiple system operator had more than half of the cable i ndustry total w ith 12 million residential subscribers in 10 states at the end of the fourth quarter 2001 however the november 2002 sale of these cable assets to comcast cable is anticipated to have negative impact at least for the short term on voice telephony expansion plans according to comcast executives deployment of telephone servi ces faces financial regulatory and technological hurdles and will not be cu rrent priority comcast president brian roberts stated that comcast plans to fo cus on the implementation and expansion of videoondemand for 2003 and that the cable industry should be focusing its resources on enhanced video rvices instead of telephony to combat the threat that direct broadcast satellite dbs rvice is posing for the industry11 despite the shift in focus by comcast other cable television companies are continuing to pursue telephony as part of their service offerings mix cox communications the fifth largest cable multiple system operator with 63 million subscribers has made commitment to use its infrastructure to further expand its presence in the local voice telephony market cox had more than 516000 residential telephone subscribers

with total telephony subscribership increasing to 718420 at yearend 2002 representing yearoveryear growth of 58 percent coxs lephony revenues were 3442 million for 2002 despite this trend however telephony revenues remain small portion of coxs 50 billion 2002 revenue stream13 while the provision of voice service has become an increasing factor in the revenue strategy of some of the large cable multiple system operators it has not as of now been embraced to the same gree by the cable industry as whole according to the ncta the cable television industry is more focused on the deployment of highspeed internet access digital video and other new services 14 as result cable industry market share in the provision of local telephony while growing still remains small with cable ci rcuit switched reside ntial telephony revenue estimated to be 118 billion for 2002 in contrast total cable industry revenue is estimated at 4815 billion for 200215 methods of competitive entry the 1996 act allows clecs to enter the ma rket in any one or any combination of three major ways through resale of retail ilec services through the use of ilecs unbundled network elements or thr ough the building of their own facilities resale under the resale model competitors resell the ilecs retail services which the ilecs are required to make available to the reseller at wholesale rates resellers market these services at retail prices to end users little or investment in facilities infrastructure is needed on the part of the competitive entrant while this eliminates major obstacle expensive start up costs which can be significant deterrent to entry the competitor is tota lly dependent on the incumbent to reach its customer base it cannot modify the serv ice offering and its cost structure is dominated by the ilec retail price resale is often categorized as the first stage of competitive entry method by which competitor can enter market to build subscriber base nonetheless resale represents significant if declining portion of market share and some carriers have developed permanent market niche as resellers unbundled network elements the use of unbundled network elements unes refers to the method of gaining market access through the use of selected components or elements of th incumbent carriers network16 under this scenariohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31938crs6 16 continued available those elements of their network without whic h clecs would be impaired in their ability to offer local service 17 the fcc requires that prices for unes must be based on forward looking cost methodology know as telric total ement long run incremental cost telric is based on forward looking methodology u nder telric the cost of the elements is not based on the ilecs historical costs for its facilities but on the costs that would be incurred if the network were built using todays technology competitor may have part or most of the infrastructure needed to provide service but fills in the pieces it is lacking eg switch to complete access to the end user the competitor leases these network parts or elements from the ilec at costbased rates17 the competitor is dependent to va rying degree on the incumbent to reach its subscriber base an outgrowth of th is method is the use of the une platform unep the unep developed to help facilitate comp etition consists of fully assembled package of network elements c onsisting of the loop local switching and shared transport made readily available for lease by the competitor the unep enables the competitor to provide end to end local exchange service facilities based under the facilities based method the competitor owns its own facilities independent of the incumben ts infrastructure the facilitiesbased carrier does not need to access the incumbents network to reach its customer base facilitiesbased competitors ar often found in high volume areas serving end users with substantial telecommunications need s necessary conditions to justify the investment in such costly infrastructure typically their customers are located on or in very close proximity to the clecs fiber optic ring network some policy makers view facilitiesbased competition as the most desirable form of entry citing among other positives increased economic growth in jobs and innovation that result from the deployment of new infrastructure furthermore they state facilities based competition decreases the sharing of infrastructure thereby minimizing the need for government intervention the ability to use unes and the unep in particular they state discour ages investment in new infrastructure on behalf of both the ilec and the clec duplication of telecommunications infrastructure is also seen as positive byproduct in light of heightened national security and emergency planning concerns while acknowledging these benefits others claim that resale and unbundling are important try methods that promote competition particularly in markets such as the residential market that are less likely to attract competitive entry furthermore they claim the use of resale and unbundling w ill accelerate the development of f acilitiesbased co mpetition as it allows clecs to penetrate markets nd develop their own customer base subsequently providing the scale economics needed to justify construction of new facilities also they claim the sharing of facilities while providing customer choice does not necessitate the disruption of the rightsofway httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31938crs7 figure 1 local exchange market revenues 2001 percentage market sharemarket share overview in the telecommunications sector market share and subsequently the status of local service competition is often examined based on two factors revenue share and number of access lines ilecs continue to dominate the local exchange market in terms of both factors according to fcccompiled data but clecs have been steadily making inroads revenues local exchange market revenues according to fcccompiled data totaled 1278 billion in 2001 with the il ecs continuing to hold the lions share of these revenues the regional be ll operating companies rbocs revenue represented 941 billion or 736 percent of total 2001 market share the independent ilecs had 176 billion or 138 percent of market share revenues giving the ilecs as whole 874 percen t of local exchange revenues the clecs represented 126 percent of 2001 market sh are or 161 billion of revenues see figure 1 while the ilecs and in particular the rbocs continue to dominate the local exchange market in terms of revenues the 2001 clec market share experienced an almost 3 percentage point increase over its 9 percent share for 2000 this clec increase came at the expense of the rbocs that while keeping their 2001 revenues unchanged at 941 billion st 44 percent from its 78 percent 2000 market share the rbocs also lost mark et share to the independent ilecs whosehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31938crs8 18

to fcc data for 1999 clec revenues were more than 5 billion an increase of 60 percent over 1998 accounting for almost 5 percent of local service revenue market share the lack of consistent and

telephone lines in particular stateshare increased 08 percent from its year 2000 market share of 13 percent18 the revenue market share trends experienced in 2001 and 2000 that is of clec growth in revenue in real terms as well as in market share appear to be consistent with prior years following the enactment of the 1996 act19 access lines in addition to revenues mark et share can also be determined based on the number of local telephone or switc hed access lines in service to end user customers while some customers are more lucrative than others in terms of revenue generated the ability to compete in the local exchange market is based to significant degree on access to the custom er base and its potential revenues as in the case of revenue market share fcc access line data 20 show that in terms of raw numbers ilecs continue to dominate however despite this dominance clec access line share continues to grow but most recently at slower pace analysis of fcc collected access line data as of june 30 200221 reveals the following market trends of the 189 million total switched access lines in service clecs accounted for 114 percent or 216 million percent of mark et share has increased steadily for the clecs since december 1999 when they claimed 43 percent of switched access lines however the pace of growth has slowed with 10 percent rate of increase for the first half of

large business institutional and government custom ers source data from federal communications commission fcc data collected by state and zip code reveals that competition is increasing nationwide as of june 2002 at least one clec was serving customers in 67 percent of the nations zip codes w ith 93 percent of us households residing in these zip codes also at least one clec operates access lines in all 50 states the district of columbia and puerto rico and in 14 stat ten or more cl ecs reported serving local service customers in general however the most populous states tend to contain the largest number of clec lines with the three most populous states california texas and new york ranki ng third second and first respectively in terms of clec access lines texas 36 per cent florida 27 percent and new york 25 percent had at least 25 percent of zip codes served by 10 or more clecs compared to 6 percent of zip codes nati onwide however when comparing clec lines as percentage of total access lines within state some of the less populous states such as rhode island and nebraska report higher percentage than many populous ones conclusion in the seven years since the passage of the 1996 telecommunications act competition has grown but perhaps at slow er pace than some envisioned in the local exchange market in terms of local exchange revenue share and access lines the incumbent local exchange carriers ilecs continue to dominate the overall market with the regional bell operating companies rbocs holding the lions share of both competitive local exchange carriers clecs however havehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31938crs11 continued to steadily increase their market share in terms of both indicators and competition is spreading nationwide despite this overall increase the level of competition both in terms of service sector and geography varies in general high volume business markets have benefitted more from competitive entry as have more densely populated markets competition in residential and sma ll business markets and in geographic markets outside of major metropolitan areas while increasing generally tends to be less robust ilecs continue to dominate in the residential market the growth of competition has been uneven with some individual markets experiencing high levels of competitive try and others experiencing next to none in terms of infrastructure the ilecs continue to dominate as result of their ownership of the legacy infrastructure nd especially the local loop while the total number of clec access lines that ar facilitiesbased is increasing their percentage of the mix has decreased sligh tly although the use of resale has dropped significantly many clecs continue to be dependent on the ilecs for market access clecs most common method of entry is the use of unes with the unep increasing in popularity clec dependence on the ilec infrastructure is seen by some as natural transition to promote co mpetition while others feel it thwarts the development of true competition the recent financial turmoil experienced in the clec market has resulted in significant decline in the number of clec s in operation but some feel that in the long run this will be positive factor resu lting in fewer but st ronger competitors despite this decline in numbers the clec industry has overall experienced steady increase in both real and absolute terms in industry revenues and access line market share the entrance of competition in the local exchange market however continues to be work in progress that remains subject to economic legal and regulatory forces
