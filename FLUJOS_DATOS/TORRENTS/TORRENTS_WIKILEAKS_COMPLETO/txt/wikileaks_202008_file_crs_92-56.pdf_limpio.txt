in schenck v united states 249 us 47 52 1919 9 simon schuster supra note 1 at 118 119 10 id at 119 11 id at 120121the first amendment the first amendment to the constitution provides in pertinent part that congress shall make law abridging the freedom of speech or of the press and it equally limits the states5 any law that limits speech on the basis of its content including law that imposes financial burden on speakers because of the content of their speech is presumptively unconstitutional6 to overcome this presumption of unconstitutionality the state must show that its regulation is necessary to serve compelling state interest and is narrowly drawn to achieve that end7 thus states compelling interest in maintaining public safety might allow it to prohibit falsely shouting fire in theatre if it did not at the same time restrict speech in manner beyond what was necessary to maintain public safety8 the supreme court decision the supreme court found that the new york statute served two compelling interests ensuring that victims of crime are compensated by those who harm them and ensuring that criminals do not profit from their crimes9 the court found that the state however had compelling interest in ensuring that criminals do not profit from storytelling about their crimes the new york state crime victims board cannot explain why the state should have any greater interest in compensating victims from the proceeds of such storytelling than from any of the criminals other assets10 in short justice oconnor wrote for the court the state has compelling interest in compensating victims from the fruits of the crime but little if any interest in limiting such compensation to the proceeds of the wrongdoers speech about the crime we must therefore determine whether the of sam law is narrowly tailored to advance the former not the latter objective11 the court in this last sentence seems to be asking whether the statute is underinclusive in that it applies only to speech it might appear that the court had already answered the question in its previous sentence when it said that the state has little if any interest in limiting such compensation to the proceeds of the wrongdoers speech about the crime but the court did not think it had as it saidhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs9256crs3 12 id at 122 n the court uses an asterisk instead of number presumably because this is the only footnote in the opinion 13 id at 121 italics in original citations omitted 14 id 15 id at 123 16 see note 12 supra elsewhere in the opinion that it need not decide whether the of sam law is underinclusive 12 in any case the court at this point begins to address not whether the statute is underinclusive in applying only to speech but whether the statute is overinclusive in applying to too much speech ie in applying to speech to which it need not apply in order to advance its compelling interests it concludes that it is here are three comments it makes on this subject as mean of ensuring that victims are compensated from the proceeds of crime the of sam law is significantly overinclusive the statute applies to works on any subject provided that they express the authors thoughts or recollections about his crime however tangentially or incidentally in addition the statutes broad definition of person convicted of crime enables the board to escrow the income of any author who admits in his work to having committed crime whether or not the author was ever actually accused or convicted13 had the of sam law been in effect at the time and place of publication it would have escrowed payment for such works as the autobiography of malcolm x which describes crimes committed by the civil rights leader before he became public figure civil disobedience in which thoreau acknowledges his refusal to pay taxes and recalls his experience in jail and even the confessions of saint augustine in which the author laments my past foulness and the carnal corruptions of my soul one instance of which involved the theft of pears from neighboring vineyard14 should prominent figure write his autobiography at the end of his career and include in an early chapter brief recollection of having stolen in new york nearly worthless item as youthful prank the board would control his entire income from the book for five years and would make that income available to all of the authors creditors despite the fact that the statute of limitations for this minor incident had long since run that the of sam law can produce such an outcome indicates that the statute is to say the least not narrowly tailored to achieve the states objective of compensating crime victims from the profits of crime15 after these comments on the statutes overinclusiveness in applying to too much speech the court appears to conclude that the statute is underinclusive in applying only to speech though it has said that it need not decide whether it is underinclusive as well as overinclusive16 it writeshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs9256crs4 17 id 18 id at 123124 19 18 usc 3681a 20 the crime victims fund exists apart from the of sam statute and receives funds from sources other than criminals publication contracts it is established at 42 usc 10601we conclude simply that in the of sam law new york has singled out speech on particular subject for financial burden that it places on other speech and other income the states interest in compensating victims from the fruits of crime is compelling one but the of sam law is not narrowly tailored to advance that objective17 although the courts precise holding seems uncertain it appears reasonable to conclude that the court considered the statute to be both underinclusive and overinclusive justice blackmun in concurring opinion attempted to clarify writing in full i am in general agreement with what the court says in its opinion i think however that the new york statute is underinclusive as well as overinclusive and that we should say so most other states have similar legislation and deserve from this court all the guidance it can render in this very sensitive area18 this is important because it suggests that the statute was both underinclusive in not applying to assets other than those derived from the exercise of first amendment rights and was overinclusive for its potential application to works like saint augustines confessions the federal statute the federal of sam statute 18 usc 3681 applies to convictions under 18 usc 794 which makes it federal crime to gather or deliver defense information to aid foreign government and to convictions for federal crimes resulting in physical harm to an individual thus unlike the new york statute the federal statute is limited to convictions and is limited to specified types of crimes apart from this the federal statute is similar to the new york statute in relevant respects like the new york statute it applies to contracts relating to depiction of crime in any medium and to contracts for an expression of the defendants thoughts opinions or emotions regarding such crime19 proceeds from such contracts are retained in escrow in the crime victims fund in the treasury and for five years are used for victim compensation fines imposed by federal court and the defendants legal representa tion remaining amounts may be paid into the crime victims fund in the treasury20 like the new york statute the federal statute is limited to proceeds received for activities protected by the first amendment therefore there seems little doubt that it also is unconstitutionally underinclusive is it also unconstitutionally overinclusivehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs9256crs5 21 section 13 of title 18 us code provides that whoever in place within the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the united states which includes some federal property within state 18 usc 73 is guilty of an act or omission which although not otherwise federal crime is crime in the jurisdiction where the place is situated shall be guilty of like offense and subject to like punishment in other words federal law incorporates state law under such circumstances 22eg 18 usc 3556 in addition the federal racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act rico imposes forfeiture of any property constituting or derived from any proceeds which the person obtained directly or indirectly from racketeering activity 18 usc 1963a3 23 united states v obrien 391 us 367 383 1968unlike the new york statute it would not apply to saint augustines theft of pears as his crime today would not violate the espionage statute or result in physical harm to an individual assuming it would violate federal law however the federal statute would apply to prominent figure who wrote his autobiography at the end of his career and included in an early chapter brief recollection of conviction for having committed federal crime in which he caused physical harm to an individual this might be relatively minor federal crime such as traffic violation on federal land21 although the federal statute is not as overinclusive as the new york statute it nevertheless would apply in situations where it would not seem likely to advance the federal interest in depriving criminals of the profits of their crimes and in using these funds to compensate victims consequently like the new york statute it apparently would be unconstitutionally overinclusive as well as underinclusive constitutional of sam statute to be constitutional of sam statute apparently would have to avoid both underinclusiveness and overinclusiveness we discuss these issues in turn underinclusiveness of sam statute could attempt to avoid underinclusiveness by applying to criminals assets beyond those derived from speech about his crime it might cover all his income derived from his crime which would include in addition to income from writing or speaking about the crime income derived directly from the crime such as stolen money income from investments of stolen money or income derived from the sale of stolen property or it might apply not only to all income derived from crime but to all an individuals income while in prison or even to all his assets including those legally acquired prior to the commission of the crime we will consider possible constitutional problems with both these possibilities of sam statute that covered all income derived from crime arguably would have the purpose and effect primarily of limiting speech this is because non speech income derived from crime may already to large extent be seized under federal statutes such as those that provide for fines or restitution22 statutes purpose however is unlikely to raise first amendment problem as the supreme court has said that it will not strike down an otherwise constitutional statute on the basis of an alleged illicit legislative motive23 but the effect on speech of of sam statute that covered all income derived from crime would raise firsthttpwikileaksorgwikicrs9256crs6 24 id at 377 25 ward v rock against racism 491 us 781 798799 1989 the court was referring here to time place or manner regulations but it treats these the same as incidental restrictions see clark v community for creative nonviolence 468 us 288 298 1984 ward makes clear that although both the strict scrutiny imposed on contentbased restrictions and the test for time place and manner and incidental restrictions require narrow tailoring the same degree of tailoring is not required under the two under the time place or manner and incidental restrictions test leastrestrict ivealternative analysis is wholly out of place id at 798799 n6 amendment question this is because even if the statute were not aimed at speech it would still have an incidental effect on speech the supreme court however uses less stringent standard to assess the constitutionality of incidental restrictions on speech than to assess the constitutionality of contentbased restrictions on speech in the case of incidental restrictions rather than requiring that the regulation constitute the least restrictive means to serve compelling governmental interest it is sufficient if it furthers an important or substantial governmental interest if the governmental interest is unrelated to the suppression of free expression and if the incidental restriction on alleged first amendment freedom is greater than is essential to the furtherance of that interest24 subsequent to this statement the court made clear that though it had said that an incidental restriction must be greater than is essential to further substantial government interest an incidental restriction need not be the least restrictive or least intrusive means of furthering the interest rather the restriction must be narrowly tailored and the requirement of narrow tailoring is satisfied so long as the regulation promotes substantial governmental interest that would be achieved less effectively absent the regulation25 applying the incidental restrictions test it appears that if as the court said in simon schuster the state has compelling interest in depriving criminals of the profits of their crimes and in using these funds to compensate victims then it ipso facto would also have substantial interest in furthering these interests the question then would be whether these interests would be achieved less effectively absent the regulation but absent the regulation these interests would arguably not be as effectively achieved because the criminal would be permitted to retain his income from speech therefore of sam statute that applied to all income derived from crime would appear not to have the underinclusiveness problem that the court found the new york statute to have it would still however have the overinclusiveness problem which we discuss below continuing to examine underinclusiveness however we must consider possible constitutional problems with of sam statute that applied not only to all income derived from crime but to all an individuals income while in prison or even to all his assets including those legally acquired prior to the commission of the crime such statute would apparently have to be limited to individuals convicted of crime as there would be due process problems with taking property from person accused buthttpwikileaksorgwikicrs9256crs7 26 this is not to say that there are due process problems under of sam statute that applied only to income derived from crime with taking property of person not convicted of crime the supreme court did not address the issue in its decision 27 see eg harmelin v michigan 501 us 957 1991 in which majority of the justices found that the cruel and unusual punishments clause has proportionality requirement but different majority held that mandatory life in prison without parole for possession of more than 650 grams of cocaine does not violate the clause 28 ward supra note 25 at 799not convicted of crime26 further for the government to take assets unrelated to crime and in excess of the amount needed to compensate victims of the crime would in effect be to impose punishment in addition to the criminals sentence therefore it might be unconstitutional in particular cases if the forfeiture it imposed were so disproportionate to the crime as to constitute an excessive fine or cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the eighth amendment27 overinclusiveness even if of sam statute applied to all income speech and nonspeech and was thereby not underinclusive it would still apparently have to be narrowly tailored so as not to apply to writings such as saint augustines confessions and thereby not burden substantially more speech than is necessary to further the governments legitimate interests28 this raises the question what specific types of writings or speech must be excluded because their inclusion would not advance these governmental interests the court did not answer this question explicitly in passage quoted above the court expressed disapproval of the reach of the new york statute in two respects the statute applies to works on any subject provided that they express the authors thoughts or recollections about his crime however tangentially or incidentally in addition the statutes broad definition of person convicted of crime enables the board to escrow the income of any author who admits in his work to having committed crime whether or not the author was ever actually accused or convicted in the first sentence of this quotation the court seems to imply that works containing an authors merely tangential or incidental recollection of his crime must be excluded suppose however that prominent figure published an autobiography that contained brief description of crime he had committed but that the crime was particularly lurid and not publicly known before revelation of the crime even tangentially might greatly increase sales of the autobiography and could constitute profiting from the crime in just the manner that it is in the governments interest to prevent consequently one apparently cannot conclude that of sam statute must necessarily exclude from its coverage all works with merely tangential or incidental descriptions of their authors crime in the second sentence of the above quotation the court seems to imply that works containing an authors discussion of crime he committed but for which he was never actually accused or convicted must be excluded while such works mayhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs9256crs8 29 the court also mentions an amicus brief containing sobering bibliography listing hundreds of works by american prisoners and exprisoners many of which contain descriptions of the crimes for which the authors were incarcerated including works by such authors as emma goldman and martin luther king jr 501 us at 121122 the court adds three other persons arrested or convicted of crimes whose autobiographies would be subject to the statute sir walter raleigh jesse jackson and bertrand russell include those with merely brief recollections of youthful pranks they may also include those with confessions of serious crimes of significant public interest that would sell precisely because of such interest consequently one cannot conclude that of sam statute must necessarily exclude from its coverage all works about crimes for which the author was never accused or convicted as also quoted above the court gave examples of specific books that it implied may not be covered by of sam statute29 the court apparently believed that coverage of these books would not advance the governmental interest in depriving criminals of the profits of their crimes and in using these funds to compensate victims the court did not explain however what these books have in common or why it apparently believed that their coverage would not advance the stated governmental interest that the books may all be considered classics or great literature or contain important messages would not appear to entitle them to additional constitutional protection to make any of these factors criterion of constitutional protection would be to discriminate on the basis of content which is permissible only to serve compelling governmental interest in any event most literary classics were not deemed such at the time of publication and it would be futile for statute to exclude those works that in the future will be deemed literary classics furthermore even if one could know which books would become literary classics the fact that book is considered literary classic does not entail that its inclusion in of sam statute would not advance the stated governmental interests if of sam himself had written book about the murders he committed it is possible that his book might have had great literary merit yet depriving him of his profits and paying them to his victims families would seem less in the governments interest another factor that the books on the courts list may have in common is that their authors may not have written them with the intention of profiting from their crimes rather they may have intended to convey moral or political message or to create work of art however an authors motivation would seem immaterial to whether the statute advanced the states interest in depriving criminals of the profits of their crimes and in using these funds to compensate victims the states interest would be advanced anytime book by criminal about his crime made profit further an authors having lesser motivations such as greed would not reduce the first amendment protection to which his speech is entitled one factor that the books do not have in common is that the crimes they discuss were minor or political as the autobiography of malcolm x describes violent crimes that the author committed for political motive another that they do not have in common is that they all discussed crimes that had been committed many years beforehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs9256crs9 30 see note 25 supra 31 simon schuster supra note 1 at 122 n 32 it would also eliminate any possible eighth amendment problem see note 27 supra thoreaus civil disobedienc concerned an adult crime refusal to pay taxes his discussion of which incidentally was not tangential aspect of civil disobedience in short it does not seem possible to single out any feature common to the books on the courts list that must be excluded from of sam statute in order for the statute to avoid being found overinclusive the governments interest could be advanced by seizing the profits of book even if its description of its authors crimes was tangential or incidental even if the author had never been accused or convicted of the crime even if the crime had occurred many years before or was relatively minor crime even if the book had literary merit and even if the author had not written it with the intention of profiting from his crime now defender of of sam statute that was not limited to speech might argue that if it is not possible to single out any feature common to the books on the courts list that must be excluded from of sam statute in order for the statute to avoid being found overinclusive then this means that the statute may include these books as substantial governmental interest would be achieved less effectively absent the regulation30 but this would be overlook the courts explicit statement that the new york statute was overinclusive for including these books31 there is limitation that might be placed in of sam statute that might increase the chances of its being found constitutional it would be to limit the use of the criminals income or assets to compensating the victims of his crime and returning to the criminal any funds that remained both the new york statute and the federal of sam statute provide for funds that are not used to compensate victims of the crime to be used for other purposes in its decision the court notes this about the new york statute but does not mention it in its analysis of the statutes constitutionality therefore one cannot conclude that the court found this aspect of the statute objectionable under the first amendment nevertheless this aspect of the statute although it furthers the governmental interest in depriving criminal of the fruits of his crime does not further the governmental interest in compensating victims consequently to remove this aspect and allow the criminal to recover any amounts not claimed by victims might increase the chances of of sam statutes being found constitutional32 of course to narrow statute in this manner would make difference if the court were to find the statute unconstitutional for any of the other reasons discussed above developments since simon schuster after simon schuster several states revised their of sam statutes in an effort to make them constitutional we will note those of california maryland new york and pennsylvaniahttpwikileaksorgwikicrs9256crs10 33 california civil code 2225 34 keenan v superior court 2002 wl 243394 calfeb 21 2002 35 md ann code art 27 854californias presimon schuster statute had applied only to proceeds relating to the story of felony for which convicted felon was convicted since 1994 it has been applied also to profits which it defines as all income from anything sold or transferred including any right the value of which is enhanced by the notoriety gained from the commission of felony for which convicted felon was convicted33 in 2000 it was extended further to apply with limited exceptions to profiteers of the felony ie any persons who derive income by selling memorabilia property rights or things for values enhanced by their felonyrelated notoriety in 2002 the california supreme court ruled the statute unconstitutional34 the california court found that the california statute contains the fundamental defect identified in simon schuster it reaches beyond criminals profits from the crime or its exploitation to reach all income from the criminals speech or expression on any theme or subject if the story of the crime is included though the california statute unlike the new york law applies only to persons actually convicted of felonies and states an exemption for mere passing mention of the felony as in footnote or bibliography these differences do not cure the california statutes constitutional flaw by any reasonable construction the california statute is still calculated to confiscate all income from wide range of protected expressive works by convicted felons on wide variety of subjects and themes simply because those works include substantial accounts of prior felonies marylands of sam statute amended several times after simon schuster requires submission to the attorney general copy of any notoriety of crimes contract and payment to the attorney general of any moneys or consideration received pursuant to such contract notoriety of crimes contract is defined as contract with the defendant or representative or assignee of the defendant with respect to i the reenactment of crime by way of movie book magazine article tape recording phonograph record radio or television presentation or live entertainment of any kind ii the expression of the defendant s thoughts feelings opinions or emotions regarding crime involving or causing personal injury death or property loss as direct result of the crime or iii the payment or exchange of any money or other consideration or the proceeds or profits that directly or indirectly result from crime sentence or the notoriety of crime or sentence35 in curran v price this statute was challenged as unconstitutional but the maryland court of appeals avoided the question by deciding that the statute does not require defendant to submit to the attorne general suspected notoriety ofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs9256crs11 36 638 a2d 93 md 1994 37 ny executive law 632a 38 673 nys2d 8711998 39 42 pacsa 8312crimes contract which is what was at issue in the case36 this was because to require submission of contracted that was merely suspected of being notoriety of crimes contract would implicate the defendants constitutional privilege against self incrimination new york amende d its of sam statute to apply to any profits from the crime which it defines to include i any property obtained through or income generated from the commission of crime of which the defendant was convicted ii any property obtained by or income generated from the sale conversion or exchange of proceeds of crime including any gain realized by such sale conversion or exchange and iii any property which the defendant obtained or income generated as result of having committed the crime 37 the new york statute defines crime as any felony defined in the penal law or any other chapter of the consolidated laws of the state in new york state crime victims board v tjm productions inc the state sought to enforce the law against several entities and individuals associated with the writing and publication of the book underboss which recounts the life of defendant salvatore gravano former member of the gambino crime family 38 the complaint alleged that gravano had been convicted of racketeering charges pursuant to the federal racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations rico law thus gravanos conviction was for crimes which are not defined in the penal law of this state the court concluded the complai nt fails to state cause of action under the of sam law therefore there is need for this court to determine whether the of sam law passes constitutional muster courts should not address constitutional issues when decision can be reached on other grounds pennsylvanias of sam statute now applies to any profit from crime the definition of which is identical to new yorks definition of profits from the crime quoted above39 conclusion as justice blackmun complained in his concurring opinion the court in simon schuster did not provide legislatures with all the guidance that it might have provided as to the constitutionality of of sam statutes that are different from the new york statute it struck down what apparently may be inferred from the decision with some confidence is that of sam statute to be constitutional must to avoidhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs9256crs12 underinclusiveness encompass criminals income or assets beyond those derived from writing or speech in addition to avoid overinclusiveness it must not apply to works whose coverage by the statute would not advance the legitimate governmental objective of compensating victims with the fruits of crime fashioning of sam statute that is not overinclusive would be difficult because the supreme court rather than specifying category of publications that would not advance legitimate governmental interests offered list of books and hypothetical books describing their authors crimes that appear to have other feature in common beyond their fame or potential fame consequently even if statute excluded works with any apparently relevant feature of any of the books the court listed it is impossible to predict whether the exclusion of additional books not containing any of these features might be required by the court in short although the court did not foreclose the possibility of constitutional of sam statute the possibility of such statute and the form such statute would take remain extremely speculative
