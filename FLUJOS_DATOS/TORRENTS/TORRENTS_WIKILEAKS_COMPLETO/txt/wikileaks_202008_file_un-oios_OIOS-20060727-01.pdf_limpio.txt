obtain sums of money under contracts with the united nations not properly due and owing to them aiding and abetting an offence 18 under the concept of aiding and abetti ng the offence is committed by another in order to aid and abet crime it is necessary that an individual associate himself in some way with the crime and that he participated in the crime by doing some act to help make the crime

relationship between the kohlis and mr bahel is signi ficant and discussed herein oios procurement task force redacted and strictly confidential ____________________________________________________________________________________________________________ 11it staffing contract 38 the first contract addressed in this report is the contract on behalf of dpko for communications and information tec hnology staffing the contract was awarded to the subject company in early 2000 39 the issues addressed in this report in connection with this staffing contract include the failure to pay full subsistence allowance the failure to disclose subcontracting agreements to the organisa tion and the failure to provide required benefits to contract staff the discussi on will also focus on the ability of pd to have identified the issues and prevente d much of the problems which arose lastly the report will cover mr bahel s involvement in the staffing contract at that time mr bahel was chief of fi eld procurement and at times acted as officer in charge of procurement 40 in 1998 the organisation established number of new peacekeeping missions and dpko was in need of engineering and it manpower suppor t in several of them as such dpko sought contract for it manpower and in the fall of 1999 the subject company submitted proposal for and ultimately obtained contract from the organisation for the provision of communications and information technology technicians it staffing contract pdco049000 the it staffing contract was requisitioned at the request of the department of peacekeeping operations dpko field ad ministration and logistic division hereinafter fald 41 the evolution of the contract and the issues which emerged during the course of its execution follows on 29 july 1999 fald submitted to pd draft request for proposal rfp for staffing s upport for various field missions fald sought one year contract wher the would order technicians for period between three months and one year on 13 october 1999 pd issued the rfp and sent it to registered vendor s six vendors submitted proposals in november 1999 fald performed technica l evaluations of the proposals and deemed five to be compliant fald sought to utilize more than one vendor and sought to award multiple contract s based upon concern that it have qualified staff for prompt deployment to th field missions as well as that it have steady supply of able and qualif ied workers from which to choose 42 in memorandum dated 26 november 1999 to mr bahel rudy sanchez chief of fald represented that after review of sample curriculum vitae cvs of prospective workers provided by vendor s fald recommended the award of contracts to two lowest bidders in each category of technicians sought mr sanchez reasoned that this approach would provide the ability of the missions to draw on second supp lier if the first vendor is incapable of adequate performance or there was an insufficient quantity of workers oios procurement task force redacted and strictly confidential ____________________________________________________________________________________________________________ 1243 on 30 november 1999 mr bahel deni ed falds request stating that reasoning put forth for awarding two c ontracts for each category are not only extraneous to the technical issues but to the rfp itself assuring fald that adequate safeguard had been already in corporated into the rfp mr bahel indicated his intention to proceed with the presentation of the case to the hcc based on the commercial evaluation 44 on 6 december 1999 hocine medili th director of fald issued memorandum to andrew toh chief of information management services branch reiterating falds position that the lowest two bidders in each category be granted an award while acknowledging the ability of the performance bond to protect the commerc ial aspects of the contract fald expressed view that pd failed to address the concerns raised by fald 45 nevertheless in his memo to fald of 10 december 1999 mr bahel offered assurances that prompt action would be taken to ensure sufficient number of qualified staff in the event that such needs arose based upon such assurances fald agreed to utilize one vendor in its memo of 5 january 2000 fald confirmed mr bahels re presentations on the basis of this understanding fald submitted to pd its projected re quirement for staffing support for one year period in furtherance of the exp ected presentation of the matter to the headquarters committee on contracts hcc 46 on 8 february 2000 pd recommended th award of threeyear systems contract for the it staffing support and pd presented the case to the hcc the official minutes of the hcc meeti ng demonstrate that pd and fald recommended the award of the contract valued at 7858764 to the subject company on the basis of lowest cost proposal 47 the record further shows that during th deliberations the hcc questioned the ability of the subject company to provi the services it offered and sought assurances that the subject comp any was sound company the hcc expressed concern that th selection was premised so lely upon that the subject company offered the lowest cost to the organisation as di scussed herein the concerns expressed by the committee pr oved to be well founded when issues with mission subsistence allowance msa payments employee driving ability and delays with deployment of personnel arose in the fall 2000 48 furthermore the hcc commented on the issue of subsistence payments to workers noting that the needs sa feguards that minimum labour standards are met the hcc also expressed cern about payments going directly to the company and dsa costs taking note of the falds contention that the arrangement of this scope had not occurred in any other mission the committee recommended that pd confer with the office of legal affairs ola to address personnel issues humanitarian conc erns and administrative issues oios procurement task force redacted and strictly confidential ____________________________________________________________________________________________________________ 13 49 at the time the case was presented to the hcc it is now evident that the hcc was not made aware of the fact that msa related issues arose in the course of implementation of the ircon contract which were known to the organisation including pd and the hcc was not advise d of pds intention to structure the new systems contract along the same term s as the one in place with ircon mr bahel participated in the execution of the ircon contract and had to have been aware of such problems 50 it is now evident that the hcc members we re not informed of falds desire to award the contract to two vendors and the procurement departments opposition to it fald shares some responsibility fo r the failure to raise this issue in the hcc meeting as it clearly should have b een done it is important to note however that after operati onal problems with the s ubject company emerged similar requests by fald in oct ober 2000 and january 2001 to bring in additional vendors to meet the operationa l requirements of the missions were again denied by pd 51 despite its reservations the committee r ecommended the award of the contract to the subject company in the to tal nottoexceed amount of 7858764 the lowest cost acceptable proposal the c ontract with the subject company was extended and ultimately the organisation paid the subject company more than 27 million for providing it staffing support to the organisations peacekeeping missions as later expl ained the subject company passed on most of these funds to gti who signifi cantly shortchanged the contract staff 52 three days later pd recei ved an expedited approval from the hcc secretariat and on 15 february 2000 letter of award under sanj ay bahels signature was sent to the subject company office in india on 23 march 2000 mr bahel forwarded to bruce rashkow director of general legal division draft of the contract and supporting documents requesting an expeditious review in light of falds urgent requirement for the subject companys consultants in unmik 53 in the same memorandum mr bahel reminded ola that the draft the subject company contract was tail ored along the lines of the ircon contract mr bahel however failed to advise ola of the problems which arose during the execution of the ircon contract namely that the disbursement amounts of msa to the personnel in the fi eld was problematic issue subsistence allowance to the contract staff 54 an important provision in the subject company contract was the provision addressing the subsistence allowance for the contract staff the contract oios procurement task force redacted and strictly confidential ____________________________________________________________________________________________________________ 14provided that subsistence must be paid to the contract staff at rate equivalent to that paid to employees in the ssions this amount was significant portion of the man day rate the organisa tion paid to the contractor for each worker supplied to the missions as discussed more full below this constituted approximately half of the amount paid by the organisation to the contractor per worker per month the contract provided article 13 subsistence of contractors personnel the contractor shall be re sponsible for making suitable arrangements for the general we lfare including food and lodging of the personnel the shall reimburse the contractor in respect of each of the personnel an amount equal to the equivalent food and accommodation components of the mission subsistence allowance msa or daily subsistence allowance dsa as the case may be herein referred to as subsistence amount 55 this provision was designe d to achieve the same function as the mission subsistence allowance msa and the daily subsistence allowance dsa provided to international staff serving in the mission in which staffing support is performed by such personnel the contract required that the living expense amounts shall be payable at the lower of the two ra tes applicable to such mission the combined payment for each worker per month was between 8000 and 9400 approximately half of which was intended to cover the msa portion of the contract 56 ola later found the provision to be clear and unambiguous requiring the contractor to pay its staff at the rate regardless of the costs for subsistence borne by the subject company the pr ovision is clear and does not leave room for interpretation there is also further provision in the contract that would suggest that subsistence amounts are not payable at the established contract rate in the event they prove to be materially higher than the actual costs incurred by the subject company 57 further the contract provided for s ubsistence allowance to the subject company staff to be paid to the contr actor only the original text of this section however had offered flexibility and had permitted the chief administrative officer in the mission c ao at hisher disc retion to provide subsistence facilities to the subject company employees in lieu of the msa payment nevertheless subsequent change s to the contract in january 2001 at the insistence of the vendor removed that flexibility after january 2001 article 131 read as follows oios procurement task force redacted and strictly confidential ____________________________________________________________________________________________________________ 15the contractor shall be re sponsible for making suitable arrangements for the general we lfare including food and lodging of the personnel the shall pay the contractor in respect of each personnel an amount in account of the living expenses of such personnel such amount he reinafter the living expense amount it is expressly understood between the parties that the living expense amounts shall be payable to the contractor only the applicable living expense amounts shall be included in the c ontractors invoices emphasis added 58 another significant provision of the cont ract was the prohibition against further subcontractual agreements without notice to and c onsent of the organisation the general conditions of contr act paragraph 50 appended to the contract provided that in the event that contractor requires the services of subcontractors the contractor shall obtain the prior written approval and clearance of the united nations for all subcontractors the approval of the united nations of subcontractor shall not relieve the contractor of any of its obligations under this contract th terms of any subcontract shall be subject to and conform with the provisions of this contract 2 the execution of the contract 59 problems quickly emerged in the execution of the contract and the two key components of the contract namely the failure to disclose subcontracts and the requirement for msa payments to be made to the contract staff were violated near the inception of its execution 60 technicians first began to arrive in late august 2000 the deployment of technicians was complicated in part by the failure of some to pass the driving test despite requirement in the contract that the staff have mandatory valid drivers license as of 1 february 2001 the subject company fell short of the required staff providing just 101 of the re quired 170 technicians requested 61 almost immediately upon deployment to th field contract em ployees began to complain that they were not receiving th subsistence allowance the failure to provide subsistence funds resulted in th inability of workers in many cases to 2 the general terms are appended to all contracts graph 60 provides that the contractor warrants that official of the united nations has received or w ill be offered by the contractor any direct or indirect benefit arising from this contract or the award thereof the contractor agrees th at breach of this provision is breach of an essential term of this contract oios procurement task force redacted and strictly confidential ____________________________________________________________________________________________________________ 16pay their hotel bills or buy food most notably it is now evident as discussed in detail below that there was an inte ntional failure to pr ovide the technicians with subsistence allowance as required under the contract 62 for example on 19 september 2000 petition by several of the contract staff was submitted to the subject companys chairman and managing director in new delhi gs chauhan raising the i ssue and requesting payment of msa to the contract staff in the letter th petitioner mr v ijendra pal bansal represented that the mission itself had adva nced contract staff sums of money to allow the contract employees to pay their hotel bills and food expenses3 the contract staff requested that the pay th em directly as re sult of the failure by the subject company to make these paym ents as required under the contract instead of paying the contract staff th position of the company was that missions were violating the cont ract by paying workers directly figure 1 63 complaints from the subject company s technicians about the lack of subsistence allowance were quickly pres ented to administrative staff in the missions particularly monuc includi ng the chief communication officer the complaints also quickly reached headquarters in particular the director of fald and s upervisory officials in th pd by october 2000 by late october early november 2000 seni or managers in the pd were made aware of the issues and th eir participation in rectifying the situation was sought by fald and monucs resident audito r who was looking into the issues 3 letter to gs chauhan through mp singh subject company coordinator 19 september 2000 oios procurement

inly very serious however we feel that th ey are unfounded mr singh assured that the matter would be thoroughly investigated 4 65 however the ptf investigation has re vealed that the c ontract staff was continuously deprived of msa allowance and that sincere effort was made by those acting on behalf of the subj ect company to remedy the situation 66 on 9 october 2000 mr roy joblin co mmunication

subject company s representative n singh falsely represented to the organisation that contract staff was being paid full subsistence allowance on 11 oct ober 2000 mr n singh wrote to mr sachdeva claiming that the failure to pay the contract staff in unmil was result of mistake in banking transact ion which caused delay in receipt of their allowance he represented to mr sachdeva that senior executive ub singh was travelling to m onuc to investigate the matter and assured that contract staff was being paid figure 4 oios procurement task force redacted and strictly confidential

tried to allay the organisations concerns and falsely represented to mr sachdeva that its personnel were government employees however mr chauhan failed to acknowledge that the contract had been subcontracted by th subject company to gti privately held entity as such the contract staff was in fact not government of india employees and the contract between the contract staff and the subcontractors did not provide for the benefits which mr chauhan assured in his correspondence existed further mr ch auhan falsely represented that the company was bound to pay and in fact did pay the workers the required subsistence allowance 77 on 6 november 2000 sanjaya bahel the then officerincharge of the procurement division wrote to mr phel an the chief of fald and represented that he had received confirmation from the contractor the subject company that sufficiently convinced him that msa payments were being made mr bahel stated that in light of that fact fald may wish to inform its

representations of the subject company which the investigation has proved to be false when asked by the ptf investigators why he did not take ny action against the vendor mr bahel responded that he is not an investigat or and that repr esentations that payments were being made should be accep ted and not assumed to be untrue while mr bahel may not have been re quired to conduct an investigation nevertheless the failure to consider evidence from fellow staff which contradicts assertions he accepted as true is inappropriate mr bahel should have caused an investigation to be launched and

mr toh criticized the auditor and asserted that the auditors conclusion that the failure to pay msa and to disclose subcontracting amounted to breach of the subject companys obligations under the

with repr esentatives of the subject company both here in new york and in their headquarters in new dehli there have been several meetings between the ptf and the subj ect company representatives and the subject company has acknowledged so responsibility for the severe problems in the it staffing contract th subject company lays principal blame for the transgressions however upon nanak kohli and

improperly in connection with their representation of the firm with the and exceeded their authority impr operly utilizing the subject company letterhead and more riously failing to provide

of the failure of gti to comply with the obligations under the contract including the failure of gti to pay the contract staffs insurance as required 116 it is evident that such failure to pay the amounts due and owing under the contract constitutes material breach of the contract while the subject company reports that they were unaware of gtis failure to pay full msa to the contract staff the company does not deny that such failure occurred the subject company representatives were aler ted to the fact that that there was official correspondence from senior th subject company officials to the organisation representing that in fact msa was being paid to th contract staff the subject company asserts that it underwent significant management change in 2003 and many of the senior officers were replaced the subject company argues that they are now di fferent much improved company which has fully disassociated itself from mr nanak kohli and mr nishan kohli whom they term as unethical the subject company also asserts that the company had few employees who acted improperly but that the company as whole is sound staff member 2s response 117 the ptf contacted staff member 2 about these matters and hi s interaction with these companies and the events describe d above staff member 2 informed the ptf that essentially he could not reme mber anything about these issues the ptf views this statement as highly spicious based upon staff member 2s deep involvement in this case over at least 2 month period between october and november 2000 and that 76 calls were placed by staff member 2 to mr kohlis residence in virginia mr bahels response 118 mr bahel claims essentially that his actions were vetted through ola and that he alone was not in position to influence the process further he asserts that the selection of the subject comp any saved the organisation money5 5 mr bahel told ptf investigators that agreeing to the changes to the contract which compelled payments to the subject company directly procurement division acted in the best interests of the organisation averting possible law suit from the vendor over the r ecall of staff who failed the drivers test the text of the rfp did not specify the need to pass drivers test the adopted amendment required the vendor to undertake all reasonable measures to ensure that the personnel conform and abide by all written and oral rules and regulations to pass the drivers test and obtain drivers permit other changes included the increase of the deployment period for the subject company personnel to 30 days and uns agreement not to offer employment to staff perf orming work on the contract until after six months from the demobilization date from the mission the ptf finds it difficult to understand how these concessions

and was responsible for presenting the facts at times mr bahel either omitted material information misrepresented information or failed to provide the requisitioners position on important issu further ola had role in many of the significant issues 120 equally meritless is mr bahels reli ance upon the position of ola that the dispute over the allegations that the cont ractor was failing to pay its contract staff was matter between the contractor and its employees while ola did express this view the opinion is premised upon in part the fa ilure of proof that msa was not being paid ola based on representations by mr bahel and pd that the subject company had denied the failure to pay msa concluded that the allegations were unproven this fact affected olas analysis 121 it should be noted however that ola s view that any dispute was purely contractual matter between the contractor and its staff is difficult to understand in light of the well established principles of contract law that fraud in the inducement or execution of contract vitia tes the contract in the first instance further the organisation should have b een concerned about the conditions of employment of the contract staff its re putation as well as the loss of funds ptfs evaluation 122 throughout the execution of the contract with the subject company scheme existed to deprive the contract staff of sums of money due and owing to them this scheme enriched nanak kohli and nishan kohli gti and enkay associates to the detriment not only of the contract staff but of the organisation as well mr bahel assisted nanak and nishan kohli in acting in their interests when issues arose nd challenges were made by fald and contract staff and suppressing the c oncerns of the requisitioner fald 123 the subject company nanak kohli and nish an kohli violated the terms of the contract with the organisation by failin g to advise the organisation of the utilization of other subcont ractors explaining the na ture of the use of these other entities and failing to seek approval from the organisation for the assignments the use of these tities facilitated the scheme msa payments with the subject comp any the ircon contract

access to the books and records of the contractor the pd bears some responsibility for taking the subject companys representations at face value and mr toh and mr bahels challenges to the auditors and

engineering section dpko stated that dissatisfacti on with the subject companys performance was widely know n and frequently discussed amongst dpko staff according to staff member 3 he was aware at the time the subject company contract had problems and want ed to avoid similar issues with the engineering manpower contract particularly troubling to him was the fact that the had been paying living expense subsistence monies to the subject company which the subject company had pparently failed to pass on to their workers further according to staff member 3 mr bahel never informed him that nishan kohli represented both the subject company and thunderbird according to staff member 3 this woul d have been an important fact given what he had heard about the perf ormance of the subject company 143 staff member 3 has informed ptf th at he had growing concerns that thunderbird was incapable of performing sa tisfactorily and that he had learned that thunderbird had not submitted the financial statements as required by the rfp staff member 3 stated that if these facts were tr ue thunderbird should have been disqualified from the process staff member 3 further stated that mr bahel assured him that the pd could approach this vendor thunderbird and obtain all the necessary information staff member 3 stated that it appeared to him that mr bahel was trying to keep thunderbird in the running while at the same time waiting for their financial statements and other information to be submitted 144 on 27 august 2002 mr bahel held meeti ng in his office with staff member 4 and staff member 3 to inform them the pd would be recommending the award of this contract to thunde rbird according to these witnesses mr bahel also explained that thunderbird was consid ered limited liability

thunderbird to perform on the following day mr bahel telephoned staff member 3 to remind him to send the requested email which he did staff member 3 stated that he recalle d one of the letter of

without this reference this awar d would not have gone to the hcc 145 number of witnesses have informed the ptf that thunderbird and the subject companys representatives nanak kohli and nishan kohli frequently visited the pd and were often in mr bahels ffice according to staff member 5 former assistant to mr bahel she wa s introduced at one point in 2002 to an older indian gentleman whom she unde rstood was from the subject company sometimes accompanied by younger indian male but could not remember their names staff member 5 said it seemed to her to be improper for procurement official to be meeting with vendor as often as they did especially without other vendors or their re presentatives being present 146 on 4 september 2002 mr bahel the sectio n chief rather than the procurement officer who was absent presented th case before the hcc and recommended the award of the contract to thu nderbird although present for the hcc presentation staff member 4 stated that she never spoke but took contemporaneous notes the official h cc minutes reflect staff member 3 as saying on behalf of dpko that he f ound unequivocally that thunderbird was capable of meeting the uns requireme nts however staff member 3 has informed ptf investigators that not withstanding his general support for thunderbird at the time he never used the term unequivocally in the hcc presentation nor held such strong view it is also clear that staff member 3 left midway through the presentation as he had another pressing appointment 147 the hcc minutes did reflect concerns on the part of some of the hcc members with thunderbirds financial soundness and capability to perform the committee stated that as thunderbird wa s newly registered entity with the organisation pd as matter of due dili gence conducted detailed review of thunderbirds proposal it is evident that the hcc relied upon representations that due diligence of the company was conducted based upon the facts learned thereafter and during the course of this investigation ptf considers insufficient inquiry was made into the bona fides of the company 148 it is also clear that expedited approv for the award was sought the ptf has interviewed numerous witnesses involve d in the process and one has accepted responsibility for seeking the expe dited approval including either the case officer or mr bahel however it is clear that either the procurement officer or supervisor must make the request of the hcc in the first instance ptf investigators have identified an email dated 28 april 2003 from joao marcedo the secretary of hc c which confirms this f act mr marcedo stated as matter of policy we only provide expedited approvals with written or verbal request from pd it is not uncommon that after the deliberation of particular item the procurement officers might make verbal request for an expedited approval that we oios procurement task force redacted and strictly confidential ____________________________________________________________________________________________________________ 58have accommodated without insisting for written request our records indicate that the procuremen t officers present for that item at the meeting were mr bahel and staff member 4 149 staff member 4 has denied requesti ng expedited approval position which seems credible in light of her repeated concerns about the company at the time staff member 4 also said th at she never spoke to the hcc meeting and that mr bahel spoke on behalf of the pd throughout the entire presentation both staff member 6 and procurement officer sta ff member 7 who had become involved in this matter peripherally after the hcc meeting denied making the request the file also reflects an email from christian saunders the then chief of the procurement department to ms redfer n dated 28 april 2003 stating that i also spoke with both sanjay and walter w ho inform that they did not request rubber stamp approval 150 mr bahel told ptf investigators that he first learned of the expedited approval from ms redfern on or about 10 sept ember 2002 prior to his departure on extended leave mr bahel said he never questioned ms redfern regarding the need or justification for expedited approval in this case even though he was her supervisor and was wellacquainted with the facts of the case as he personally presented the matter before the hcc mr bahels response lacks credibility the ptf has interviewed various witnesses examined numerous emails and documents which contradict mr bahel s statement that he learned of the expedited approval from ms redfern fu rther to the extent that mr bahels bahel assertion that ms redfern asked for the expedited approval and learned of it from her is not credible in light of the facts and reasonable inferences to be drawn therefrom mr bahel was the in dividual who pressed on behalf of thunderbird for the contract 151 in the first instance the need for exped ited approval is questionable in light of the fact that an ex tension of the contract in plac at the time was also sought and granted in addition thunderbird had yet to provide audited financial statements and the hcc had direct ed that thunderbird produce these documents in four weeks in fact it took nishan kohli more th an eight weeks to ultimately provide the documents further the current contractor was being extended for an additional eight weeks 152 the hcc minutes reflect other troubling f acts originally mr etsell in his submission of the statement of work sow of 8 april 2002 had requested contract to be established for an initial period of one year with the option to extend the same for two additional periods of one year each however review of the hcc minutes and the hcc award recommendation cover page reflect handwritten change in the aw ard from one year to three years with the option of extending up to two additional years staff member 4 confirms the handwriting is mr bahels she also contends th at mr bahel was responsible for replacing oios procurement task force redacted and strictly confidential

asgdm reviews the hcc minutes and expresses his concurrence through signing the hcc cover page while the minutes of the hcc meeting were pending and not yet finalized one page form had been issued by the hcc granting expedited approval for both the continuation of the current contract and for its replacement by thunderbird 154 after the hcc presentation on 10 september 2002 mr bahel who was scheduled to leave new york on annual leave convened meeting with staff member 4 and staff member 7 prior to his departure in this meeting mr bahel instructed them to notify thunde rbird of the recommendation to award the contract to them according to st aff member 7 he under stood that he was not able to provide letter of intent loi to thunderb ird but was able to give verbal notification of the hccs action based upon the document issued by the hcc staff member 7s understanding that this action was permissible was based upon the fact that his supervisor mr bahel directed him to do it as well as his own understand ing of the rules at the time according to staff member 4 mr bahel further instructed them upon receipt of the hcc minutes confirming that additional requirements had been imposed by the committee they should begin to prepare an awar d letter to thunderbird 155 at the direction of mr ba hel staff member 7 did in fact notify mr nishan kohli that the hcc had recommended th at the contract be awarded to thunderbird and that thunderbird would lik ely receive the contract staff member 7 asserts that he further notified mr kohli th at pd could not issue an loi prior to receiving the approved hc c minutes and formal award of the contract 156 staff member 7 concedes that he provided notice to nishan kohli at the express direction of mr bahel after the hcc had i ssued notice of expedited approval according to staff member 7 mr bahel ft instructions to await copy of the approval in his inbox in the procurement office further according to staff member 7 mr bahel told staff member 7 that he would be out of the office and requested that staff member 7 shoul d retrieve the docu ment and notify the vendor of the likely award staff member 7 acknowledges that he followed the direction and in the c ourse of contact with mr kohli he provided the notification 157 in preparing the ultimate contract for the award according to staff member 4 mr bahel further

concede that the the subject company contract was to be us ed as model in preparation for the thunderbird contract 158 however as set forth above the the s ubject company contract was found to be deficient and ambiguous in material re spects the effect of this provision resulted in the ability of the contractor to receive payments intended for the contract staff directly w ithout providing proof that th amounts had been paid 159 staff member 3 told investigators he di d not want to have morale problem with the contract employees and therefor sought mr bahels assurance that the workers would receive the full subsistence payment according to staff member 3 mr bahel told him that if t hunderbird failed to pay the subsistence to its workers he would call in th performance bond and pay the employees directly 160 in early september 2002 staff member 3 says he met with nishan kohli thunderbirds representative at the request of mr bahel staff member 3 was suspicious and concerned about meeting with vendor prior to any official announcement of the contract award as result of this concern staff member 3 urged his assistant gaynor cote to attend the meeting with him and take notes at the meeting according to staff member 3 mr kohli stated that he was the lowest bidder and understood he would be receivi ng the contract staff member 3 expressed to ptf investigat ors that he was surprised by this statement because he did not realize this information was publicly known according to staff member 3 nishan kohli further gave notice of his plans to travel to the congo to m eet with some of the current ircon employees according to staff member 3 he told mr kohli in uncertain terms that mr kohli was absolutely forbidden to do this because it would be very disruptive to the

through the chief of the inform ation technology services division itsd mr eduardo blinder who became involved in the process by the request of mr bahel recommended adding toshiba sony fujitsu and nec to the list in subsequent ex change of emails between pd and the requisitioner cits and itsd cits tinued to assert that they sought only the three major bra nds of computers to void inferior products laptops from questionable manuf acturers clones and home built computers ultimately however cits agreed that they were amenable to expanding the field to include other major brands of computer manufacturers who were recognized indus try leaders as result on 24 april 2002 the case officer mr ca brera issued bid amendment notification to the vendors correcting the anticipated quantity of the

finally manchester technologies offering fujitsu model on 30 may 2002 mr cabrera notified cresta that the company needed to resubmit the specifications for the toshiba model they were offering as the table of compliance with the bid technical terms was absent and spec ification pages from crestas submission were contrary to the prope r format nevertheless mr cabrera allowed cresta to resubmit the pages 175 in its response cresta informed pd that toshiba was discontinuing the pentium iii model offered in its origin submission but that they would upgrade the model proposed to pentium iv and provide the upgraded model to the organisation at extra cost cr informed pd that because of the discontinuation of the pentium iii model they therefore could not provide the anticipated quantity of

was determined to be compliant and the initiation of the rebidding exercise in the interim period email correspondence confirms that dpko found cresta to be technically compliant even after the offer of an upgrade mr cabrera was further in the midst of preparing the pr esentation to the hcc figure 32 177 procurement department officials in cluding staff member 7 and mr bahel concede that at this

reached the officials in cresta responsible for the submission and the representative who interacted with the organisation in connection with this contract the official remember ed the event well and informed ptf investigators that he was told by mr ca brera that the bid was being cancelled and that they wanted to do it as th ey didnt want to have another model because of maintenance issues he be lieved they was reference to mr cabreras supervisor since the official asserted that he spoke with the dpko official who indicated to him that dpko was satisfied with crestas renewed offer 178 further dpko official i nvolved in the process has in formed the ptf that in conversations first with mr cabrera and mr streb and then later with mr bahel in this interim period it was repr esented to him that pd had expressed view that there was an i ssue with crestas s ubmission according to the official both mr cabrera and mr bahe l suggested rebid because of technicality while the official objected he was told by both mr cabrera and mr bahel that because the matter is commercial one it is within the exclusive prerogative of pd to cancel the bid on th basis of commercial noncompliance the ptf finds that based on these circumstances this act was improper 179 the assertions by the dpko official ppear to be corroborated by statements made by the vendor cresta that the motivating entity to cancel the bid was officials in the procurement department the explanation attributed to pd that there were commercial issues with crestas bid is not persuasive dpko had found cresta to be compliant and the firm was the lowest bidder fact confirmed by the dpko official and an email uncovered by the ptf furthermore it was conveyed to the cresta official that the procurement department was preparing presentation to the hcc oios procurement task force redacted and strictly confidential ____________________________________________________________________________________________________________ 67 figure 33 180 it is further clear that the cancellation of bid must be approved by supervisor in pd fact that mr bahel concedes therefore reasonable and logical inference to be drawn from the undisputed facts compels the conclusion that mr bahel was involved in the process to can cel the bid and held responsibility for the cancellation there is evidence br ought to the attention of the ptf justifying the cancellation during his in terview mr bahel could not provide an explanation therefore based upon th above the ptf finds that mr bahel was remiss in his responsibilities an d violated the procurement rules 181 it is clear that new invitation to bi d itb was issued in early july the supplemental itb ultimately limited the so licitation to the three brands of computers originally requested by cits 182 the itb was based upon the upgraded speci fications the pentium iv model ten companies responded and two companies the subject company and danoffice were the most competitive both offering the same compaq model the subject company offered the lowest price followed by danoffice of the initial bidders the subject company wa s the only company to propose lower price for the computer model it offered all other vendors raised their prices from the initial bid although cres ta offered compaq brand and the second lowest bid the model it was offeri ng was inferior to the models offered by the subject company and danoffice and was in fact determined by cits to be noncompliant oios procurement task force redacted and strictly confidential ____________________________________________________________________________________________________________ 68

of the matter to the hcc officials questioned the basis for limiting the bidd ing exercise to the three specified brands and intimated that the pd violated rules and regulations by the use of brand names in its itb email co mmunication after the event describes circumstance in which dpko officials are questioned about the limitation of the resolicitation to the three preferred bra nds the hcc stated that were it not for the imminent loss of funds the committee would have recommended that rebidding exercise be conducted inviting all brands of laptops that met the uns requirement nevertheless the pr oposed contract award to the subject company was ultimately approved and signe d it also should be noted that mr blinder chaired the hcc meeting it appears mr blinder suffered from conflict serving as the chai r as well as having involve ment in the process on behalf of the requisitioner 184 the impropriety of the cancellation of the first bid and the invitation for vendors to resubmit further bids in light of the cancellation allowed the other vendors second opportunity to bid on the ptop contract as set forth above the rebidding exercise is questionable in light of the fact that cresta was held to be technically compliant by dpko and offered the lowest bid on that basis it appears that they should have been awarded the contract in the absence of objection by the requisitioner fact th at both staff member 7 and mr bahel now concede neverthe less the conclusion of the ptf is that mr bahel cancelled the bid he was the pd offici involved in the matter who had the authority to do it and past practice suggests that such decision could only come from supervisor staff member 7 did not have the seniority or position to authorize that act 185 absent clear

4805 190 according to cits officials interviewe d by the ptf investigators this rating should have disqualified the subject co mpany however according to several cits staff members mr bahel asked them to speak with cogent and the subject company and to reevaluate th subject companys bid and make the the subject company proposal compliant according to these witnesses the reason given by mr bahel to conduct such reevaluation was that the subject company submitted bid that was significantly lower in cost that the remaining bids mr bahel recently confirmed to ptf investigators that he held this position at the time the flagrant disregard to defer to the experts and not take into account the severe lack of technical acceptability is not justified it is evident that mr bahel exceeded his authority by this action 191 at the same time while cits staff memb ers stated that mr bahel had initiated the meetings with the subject company the presentation to the hcc signed by mr bahel read that cits had requeste d to meet with cogent and the subject company witnesses interviewed by ptf i nvestigators have informed that mr bahels statements in this regard were fa lse cits staff member with whom ptf investigators spoke has confirmed mr bahels statement in fact all who oios procurement task force redacted and strictly confidential ____________________________________________________________________________________________________________ 70have been interviewed stated that mr ba hel forced the issue and insisted that cits discuss the evaluations with the subject company further there is evidence of direction to re evaluate the other bidders or to include them later in the process 192 in the interview with ptf investigators mr bahel has stated that the other bidders were not invited as cogent nd the subject company were the lowest bidders mr bahel defende d his decision and conceded that he had challenged the technical evaluation by cits because the price difference was so dramatic mr bahel stated that he believed that substantial savings to the organisation could have been achieved if the subj ect companys proposal had been made compliant 193 mr bahels reasoning appears shallow sure ly there is more to the analysis of the qualification of vendor than mere cost such narrow reasoning calls into question the need for technical evaluati on in the first instance and appears to render the reasoned opinion of the xperts unnecessary further in consideration of his association with the representatives of the subject company discussed more fully below the validity of his reasoning is even more questionable 194 the next year cits sought solicitati ons for new digital trunking radio systems contract for its missions in monuc and untaet an expression of interest was posted by pd on its website in early may and rfp 86 followed by the end of may forty vendors registered with the pd were invited to submit their proposals by 7 july 2000 by the bidopening deadline proposals were received from cicci the subject co mpany motorola ericsson and cogent thirty days later cits found all five submissions to be technically non compliant 195 the vendors noncompliance however turned out to be erroneous and mistake on the part of the requisitioner in subsequent disc ussions between pd and dpko it was agreed that the syst ems offered by the bidders with the exception of cicci were representative of the technology then available in the market and that the specification reques ted by cits may have been too high in the face of an immediate operationa l requirement mr bahel proposed to request the original bidders to submit best and final offer bafo on 8 august 2000 case officer grace monteliba issued request for bafo to the subject company motorola ericson and cogent with on opening date of 10 august 2000 196 again ptf faced challenges in reconstr ucting the facts and circumstances of the case due to lack of the condition of the procurement file consequently the ptf has had to rely on the memory of procurement officers involved whereas the investigation discovered draft and final presentation to the hcc of 10 oios procurement task force redacted and strictly confidential ____________________________________________________________________________________________________________ 71august 2000 prepared by the case offi cer and signed by mr bahel ptf investigators have not been able to locate any documents supporting bafo quotes submitted by the companies other than the price matrix prepared by pd for the presentation to the hcc 197 while the case was assigned to staff member 8 the hcc minutes reflect the presence of messrs bahel and staff mber 9 only interviews with the pd officials failed to reveal the reasons for the absence of the buyer in the presentation or the identity of the actual presenter of the case to the hcc neither staff member 9 nor staff memb er 8 could recall the reasons for her absence the review of personnel records has shown that staff member 8 was in the office during the dates in question 198 mr bahel told ptf that he could have complemented the junior procurement officer but would have never suppl emented him or her in the hcc presentation in response to the question regarding the discount offered by the subject company following its submissi on of bafo mr bahel confirmed to ptf investigators he contacted the vendor in the presence of another officer the purpose of the contact was to try to obtain another reduction in price from the vendor moreover mr bahe l asserted this price nego tiation was done in full compliance with the procurement manual and in light of the fact that the subject company was then already the lowest bidder 199 the hcc criticized mr bahel for approaching the vendor for second time without its specific instruction neve rtheless the hcc r ecommended the award of 3year fixed price systems contr act to the subject company based on the record before it the ptf cannot concl ude that contacting the vendor second time before the hcc deliberation was in and of itself improper mr bahels personal relationship with the kohlis 200 the investigation reveals that mr bahe ls relationship with the kohlis runs deep and dates back to the 1980s mr bahel acknowledged that he met nanak kohli at gathering associated with an indian civic organisation in washington dc when he was stat ioned there at the indian embassy 6 further search of mr bahels computer rev eals wedding invitation list from the list it appears that mr bahel invited na nak kohli and nishan kohli to his sons wedding in india in june 2002 at the sa time the kohlis were acting on behalf of vendors performing contr actual services for the 6 according to his personnel file bahel was employed by the indian government in washington dc between 1980 and 1984 oios procurement task force redacted and strictly confidential ____________________________________________________________________________________________________________ 72201 mr bahel acknowledged sporadic contact with the kohlis but represented to investigators in april 2006 that he had not spoken with the koh lis in 18 months the ptf has proven this ssertion to be false 202 further numerous witnesses have desc ribed circumstances in which nishan kohli was frequent visitor to the procurement department and to mr bahels office at times when the kohlis were acting on behalf of companys efforts to do business with the organisa tion witnesses stat that the kohlis would visit mr bahel in his office more than once month multiple witnesses have indicated that the frequency of such visits was improper the new york condominium units 203 most significantly however the kohlis provided mr bahel with tangible and intangible benefits during the relevant time period including the purchase and lease of two expensive new york condom inium apartments on behalf of mr bahel prior to may 2003 sanjaya bahel was residing at 300 east 34 street in new york in may 2003 acumen international new york based company incorporated by nishan kohli sought to purchase two condominium apartment units at 240 east 47 th street units 17e and 17f acumen internationals incorporation papers bore nishan kohlis accountants addre ss at the time and reflect that the company was incor porated in 2002 according to representative of the th owner of the east 47th street units nanak and nishan kohli viewed the apartment prior to purchase as did sanjaya bahel the owner volunteered it was evident to him that the purchase of the units was to allow bahel to occupy them 204 indeed the information regarding pplicant form which accompanied the purchase application submitted to the condominium board reflected that mr sanjaya bahel and mrs neera bahel were the prospective im mediate occupants of the units perhaps most significantly the form requested the purchaser to identify the nature of the relationship between the occupant and the prospective owner to which mr bahel is listed by nishan kohli as business consultant figure 34 205 representative of the company that owned the property informed ptf investigators that the kohlis made it clear to him that they intended to oios procurement task force redacted and strictly confidential ____________________________________________________________________________________________________________ 73immediately provide the units to mr bahel for him to occupy the representative used the name bahel even before ptf investigators asked the identity of the individual 206 it is clear from the documentation and th owners description of the individual that the intended occupant was mr bahel indeed photocopy of mr bahels drivers license is contained in the pplication file th investigation has revealed that neither nanak nor nishan kohli sought to occupy or in fact lived in these condominium units it is evident that the individuals intended at the inception of the transaction to occupy th units were mr bahel and his family 207 incredibly fees associated with the occupancy of the units were paid by acumen from the thunderbird indus tries bank account in virginia figure 35 208 according to the representative from ammar nv the entity which owned the property these fees were for the purposes of providing revenue for the condominium board and were required whenever tenants or owners moved in or out of the apartment in the represen tatives experience these fees were typically paid by the individua ls occupying the units and we re nonrefundable 209 when asked about the circumstances of his occupancy of these units mr bahel failed to provide any of the aforemen tioned information rather mr bahel stated to investigators th at he did not know the owne r of the unit and that he negotiated for both the lease and ultimate purchase of the property with oios procurement task force redacted and strictly confidential ____________________________________________________________________________________________________________ 74lawyer and when pressed further he st ated that he understo od the lawyer to be acting on behalf of mortgage compa ny mr bahel was asked several times whether he knew the owner of the units however mr bahel never mentioned acumen or the kohlis bahel asserted further that he paid 5000 month in rent for both of the units and maintained an understanding with the lawyer that he could purchase the units for set amount at later date in effect mr bahel asserted that leasepurchase agr eement was codified in separate correspondence however mr bahel s failed to produce any documentation to support these assertions despite repeated requests of the ptf to produce the information and records reflecting th lease payments based upon such failure to cooperate the false assertions made by mr bahel and the facts and circumstances of this case there is rious question whether mr bahel paid any rent at all 210 even assuming for moment that these assertions are accurate it is evident that mr bahel nonetheless received substantia l benefit from the kohlis the lease of these premises for mere 5000 per month was well below the then prevailing rates in fact the previous owner has pr ovided documentation to the ptf that he rented the units in 200001 for 8600 per month figure 36 211 further bahel was provided the units di rectly and was not required to compete with any prospective lessees or purchasers contrary to his assertion that his learned of the availability of the pr operty through an advertisement it is clear that he was involved in the koh lis purchase from the inception and even viewed the apartments prior to the purch ase by mr kohli in addition real estate professionals have informed the ptf that lease purchase agreement in 2003 with fixed purchase price at future date in time is substantial benefit to the purchaser real estate values were increasing rapidly at the time and certainly had the potential to increase substantially over two year period oios procurement task force redacted and strictly confidential ____________________________________________________________________________________________________________ 75212 bahel ultimately purchased the units from the kohlis in may 2005 the properties were not listed with broke r for sale and were not advertised again in connection with the purchase mr bahel claimed that he did not know the owner and dealt with the lawyer for the mortgage company however this assertion is false review of the computer mr bahel utilized at the time reflects that he accessed document about acumen and the kohlis further nishan kohlis name appears on the origin deeds filed in may 2005 as does an address of 600 ne 36 street ph11 miam i florida mr bahels name is prominently identified as the grantee further the investigation has revealed that the real property at the florida address is owned by hend shuaib who is believed to be nishan kohlis wife the investigation has further revealed that nishan kohli and hend shuaib own singl family residence together as well as business hn projects llc both located at 3820 stuart avenue miami florida it is unclear what busin ess this corporation engages in figure 37 213 according to the real estate deed the purchase price for these units together was 1500000 mr bahel presented records which he claimed supported his contention that he personally made down payment of 135000 towards the purchase price his unfcu bank account statements reflect 135000 withdrawal in may 2005 mr bahel claims that his sons provided the remainder of the down payment ho wever mr bahel has not provided supporting documentation for this contenti on the investigation has revealed that mr bahel secured tw separate mortgages in may 2005 from the unfcu in the amounts of 495000 and 375000 resp ectively proof has not been provided concerning the source of th remaining 495000 difference between oios procurement task force redacted and strictly confidential ____________________________________________________________________________________________________________ 76the combined mortgage amounts bahels down payment and remaining balance mr bahel contends that this amount was provided by his sons 214 mr bahels claim that he was unaware of the owner of the property is further undermined by other investigative efforts of the ptf forensic examination of mr bahels computer reveals that on 12 july 2005 mr bahel accessed the new york city property records system and researched the property deeds for his residence at this time the kohli name appeared on the deed subsequent deed which removed mr kohli s name was filed on 29 july 2005 215 regardless of the bona fides of mr bahe ls contentions it is clear that the kohlis provided tangible benefit to mr bahel which he not only failed to disclose but intentionally made false stat ements to ptf investigators about these transactions certainly an adverse inference can be drawn that mr bahel knew his actions were improper and the repres entations were an attempt to disguise the true circumstances of these transactions this transaction is not only direct violation of several rules of the orga nisation but it also constitutes evidence that mr bahel participated in the effo rts by nanak and nishan kohli to achieve contracts 216 according to several dpko officials who attended function with nishan kohli in late 2000 in brindisi nishan koh li stated words to the effect that he had procurement officer in his pocket and could achieve any contract he wanted bahels sons wedding 217 staff
