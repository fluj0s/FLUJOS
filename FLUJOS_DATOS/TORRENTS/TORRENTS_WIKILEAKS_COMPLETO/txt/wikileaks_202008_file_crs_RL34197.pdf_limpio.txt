oversight of the executive branch the review monitoring and s upervision of the imp lementation of public policy the first several congresses inaugu rated such important oversight techniques as special investigations reporting require ments resolutions of inquiry and use of the appropriations process to review ex ecutive activity contemporary developments moreover have increased the legislatures capacity and capabilities to check on and check the executive public laws and congressional rules have measurably enhanced congresss implied power under the constitution to conduct oversight1 congressional oversight of the executive is designed to fulfill number of important purposes and goals to ensure executive compliance with legislative intent to improve the efficiency effectiveness and economy of gove rnmental operations to evaluate program performance to prevent executive encroachment on legislative powers and prerogatives to investigate alleged instances of poor administration arbitrary and capricious behavior abuse waste fraud and dishonesty to assess agency or officials ability to manage and carry out program objectives to assess the need for new federal legislation to review and determine federal financial priorities to protect individual rights and liberties and to inform the public as to the manner in which its government is perfor ming its public duties among others2 legislative oversight is most co mmonly conducted through congressional budget authorization appropriati ons confirmation and investigative processes and in rare instances through impeachment but the adversarial often confrontational and sometimes high profile nature of congressional investigations sets it apart from the more routine accommodative facets of the oversight process experienced in authorization appropriations or confirmation exercise s while all aspects of legislative oversight share the common goals of informing congress so as to best accomplish its tasks of developing legisl ation monitoring the implementation of public policy and of disclosing to the pub lic how its government is performing the inquisitorial process also sustains and vindicates

law and practice the nature nd contours of congressional prerogatives necessary to maintain the integrity of the legislative role in that constitutional scheme congresss power of inquiry extends to all executive departments agencies and establishments in equal measure over time however congressional probes of the department of justice dep artment or doj have prove d to be amongst the most contentious stemming from the presumptive sensitivity of its principal law enforcement mission often inquiries have been met with claims of improper political interference with discretionary deliberative prosecutorial processes accompanied by refusals to supply intern documents or testimony sought by jurisdictional committees based on assertions of constitutional and common law privileges or general statutory exemptions from disclosure but the notion of and need for protection of the internal deliberative processes of agency policymaking heightened sensitivity to premature disc losures of decisionmaking involving law enforcement investigations civil and criminal prosecutions or security matters is not unique to the doj though the degree of da ytoday involvement there with such matters may be greater an indepth examination of the nature scope and resolution of such past investigative confrontations with the doj appears useful for informing future committees determining whether to undertake similar probes of doj or other executive agencies as to the scope and limits of their investigative prerogatives and the practical problems of such undertakings review of the historical experience nd legal rulings pertinent to congressional access to information regarding the law forcement activities of the department of justice indicates that in the last 85 ears congress

recognize broad and encompassing power in congress to engage in oversight and investigation that would reach all sources of information necessary for carry ing out its legislative function in the absence of countervailing constitutional privilege or selfimposed statutory restriction upon it s authority congress and its committees have virtually plenary power to compel production of information needed to discharge their legislative functions from executive agencies privat persons and organizations within certain constraints the informati on so obtained may be made public although there is express provision of the constitution that specifically authorizes congress to conduct investiga tions and take testimony for the purposes of performing its legitimate functions num erous decisions of the supreme court have firmly established that the investigatory power of congress is so essential to the legislative function as to be implied from the general vesting of legislative power in congress4 thus in eastland v united states servicemens fund the court explained that the scope of its power of inquiry is as penetrating and far reaching as the potential power to enact and appropriate under the constitution5 in watkins v united states the court described the breadth of the power of inquiry the power of the congress to conduct investigations is i nherent in the legislative process that power is broad it encompasses inquiries concerning the administration of existing laws as well as proposed or possibly needed statutes6 the court went on to emphasize that congresss investigative power is at its peak when the subject is alleged waste fraud abuse or maladministration within government department the investiga tive power it stated comprehends probes into departments of the federal government to expose corruption inefficiency or waste7 the first congresses it tinued held inquiries dealing with suspected corruption or mismanage ment of government officials8 and subsequently in series of decisions the court r ecognized the danger to effective and honest conduct of the government if the legislative power to probe corruption in the executive branch were unduly hampered9 accordingly the court stated it recognizes the power of the congress to inquire into and publicize corruption maladministration or inefficiencies in the agencies of government10 the breadth of jurisdictional committees investigative authority may be seen in the two seminal supreme court decisions emanating from the teapot dome inquiries of the mid1920s both involving directly and indir ectly the departmenthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34197crs5 11 273 us 135 1927 12 273 us at 17778 13 279 us 263 1929 14 id at 290 15 id at 295of justice as part of its investig ation the senate select committee issued subpoena for the testimony of mally s daugherty the brother of the attorney general after daugherty failed to res pond to the subpoena th senate sent its deputy sergeant at arms to take him into custody and bring him before the senate daugherty petitioned in federal court for writ of habeas corpus arguing that the senate in its investigation had exceeded its constitutional powers the case ultimately reached the supreme court wh ere in landmark decision mcgrain v daugherty11 the court upheld the senates authority to investigate charges concerning the department the subject to be investigated was the administration of the department of justice whether its functions were being properly discharged or were being neglected or misdirected and particularly whether the attorney general and his assistants were performing or neglecting their duties in respect of the institution and prosecution of proceedings to puni sh crimes and enforce appropriate remedies against the wrongdoers specific instances of alleged neglect being recited plainly the subject was one on wh ich legislation could be had and would be materially aided by the information which the investigation was calculated to elicit this becomes manifest when it is reflected that the functions of the department of justice the powers and duties of the attorney general and the duties of his assistants are all subject to congressional legislation and that the department is maintained and its activities are carried on under such appropriations as in the judgment of congress are needed from year to year12 the court thus underlined that the depar tment of justice like all other executive departments and agencies is creature of the congress and subject to its plenary legislative and oversight authority in another teapot dome case that reached the supreme court sinclair v united states13 different witness at the congressiona l hearings refused to provide answers and was prosecuted for contempt of congre ss the witness had noted that lawsuit had been commenced between the government and the mammoth oil company and declared i shall reserve any evidence i ma be able to give for those courts and shall respectfully decline to answer any questions propounded by your committee14 the supreme court upheld the witness c onviction for contempt of congress the court considered and rejected in unequivocal terms the witness contention that the pendency of lawsuits provide d an excuse for withholding information neither the laws directing that such lawsuits be instituted nor the lawsuits themselves operated to divest the senate or the committee of power further to investigate the actual administration of the land laws15 the court further explai ned it may be conceded that congress is without authority to compel disclosure for the purpose of aiding the prosecution of pending suits but the author ity of that body directly or through its committees to require pertinent disclosures in aid of its own constitutional power ishttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34197crs6 16 idnot abridged because the information sought to be elicited may also be of use in such suits16 the sinclair ruling inferentially indicates that the departments oftproffered distinction between open and closed cases has little weight illustrative investigations and case law perhaps most instructive and illuminating for present purposes is review of important precedents over the last 85 years regarding oversight of the justice department appe nded to this report are brief summaries of 18 selected congressional investigations from the palmer raids and teapot dome in the 1920s to watergate and through irancontra rock flats corruption in the fbis boston regional office

elsewhere number of these investig ations spawned seminal supreme court rulings that today provide the foundation for the broad congressional power of inquiry all were contentious and invol ved

not all of the cases upon wh ich testimony was offered were closed as one of the committees goals in its questioning was to identify cases in which the statute of limitations had not run out and prosecution was still possible19 the committee also obtained access to department documentation including prosecutorial memoranda on wide range of matters however given the charges of widespread corruption in the department and the imminent resignation of attorney general daugherty it would appear that some of the documents furnished the committee early in the hearings may have been volunteered by the witnesses and not officially provided by th department although attorn ey general daugherty had promised cooperation with the committee and had agreed to provide access to at least the files of closed cases20 such cooperation appa rently had not been forthcoming21 in two instances immediately following daughertys resignation the committee was refused access to confidential bureau of investigation investigative reports pending the appointment of new attorney general who could dvise the president about such production22 though witnesses from the department we re permitted

the investigation of the claim of presidential privilege after committee access to the superfund forcement documents was obtained number of questions about the role of the department during the controversy remained whether the department not epa had made the decision to persuade the president to assert executive privilege whether the department had directed the united states attorney for the district of columbia not to present the contempt certification of burford to the grand jury for prosecution and had made the decision to sue the house and generally whether there was conflict of interest in the departments simultaneously advising the president representing burford investigating alleged executive branch wrongdoing and enforcing the congressional criminal contempt statute these and related questions raised by the departments actions were the subject of an investigation by the house judiciary committee beginning in early 1983 the committee issued final report on its

respects this investig ation proved as contentious as the earlier epa controversy from which it arose in its final report the committee concluded that the department of justice through many of the same senior officials who were most involved in the epa controversy consciously prevented the judiciary committee from obtaining information in the departments possession that was essential to the committees inquiry in to the departments role in that controversy most notably the department deliberately and without advising the committee withheld massive volume of vital handwritten notes and chronologies for over one year these materials which the department knew came within the committees february 1983 document request contained the bulk of the relevant documentary information about the departments activities outlined in this report and provided basis for many of the committees findings39 among the other abuses cited by the co mmittee were the withholding of number of relevant documents until the committee had independently learned of their existence40 as well as materially false and misleading testimony before the committee by the head of the depar tments office of legal counsel41 the committees initial request for documentation was contained in february 1983 letter from its chairman peter rodi to attorney general william french smith the committee requested the departme nt to supply all documents prepared by or in the possession of th department in any way re lating to the withholding of documents that congressional committees have subpoenaed from the epa42

information about the departments apparent conflict of interest in simultaneously advising the ex ecutive branch while being responsible for prosecuting the burford contempt citati on and any instructions given by the department to the united states attorney for the district of columbia not to present the burford contempt to the grand jury at first the department provided only pub licly

natural resources division the civil division the office of legal counsel the office of legislative affairs the office of public affairs and the offices of the attorney general the deputy attorney general and the solicitor general45 in july 1983 the committee chairman wrote to the attorney general requesting copies of 105 documents that committee st aff had identified in its review as particularly important to the committees inquiry46 by may 1984 only few of those documents had been provided to the committee and the chairman again wrote to the attorney general requesting the depa rtments cooperation in the investigation in that letter the chairman advised the attorney general that the committees preliminary investigation had raised serious questi ons of misconduct including potential criminal misconduct in the actions of the department in the withholding of the epa documents47 the committee finally received all of the 105 documents in july 1984 full year after it had initia lly requested access the committee at that time also obtained the written notes and number of other documents that had been earlier withheld48 there was also disagreement about the access that would be provided to department employees for interviews with committee staff the department demanded that it be permitted to have one or more department attorneys present at each interview the committee feared that the presence of department representatives might intimidate the department employees in their interviews and stated that it was willing to permit department representative to be present only if the representative was walledoff from department officials involved with the controversy if the substance of inte rviews was not revealed to subsequent interviewees and if employees could be interviewed w ithout department representative present if so requested th department ultimately agreed to permit the interviews to go forward without its ttorneys present if department employee requested representation the department employed privat counsel for that purpose in all committee staff interviewed 26 current and former department employees including four assistant

avoiding prejudicial pretrial public ity protecting the rights of innocent third parties protecting the identity of confidential in formants preventing disclosure of the governments strategy in anticipated or pending judicial proceedings avoiding the potentially chilling effect on the exercise of prosecutorial discretion by doj attorneys and precluding interference with the presidents constitutional duty to faithfully execute the laws all of which would seriously prejudice law enforcement72 jacksons views were reiterated by attorney general william french smith in 1982 during the

attorney generals acceding to congre ssional investigation demands the attorney general asserted woul d make congress in sense partner in the investigation raising substantial danger that

inflexible positi on but rather statement of principled interest in ensuring the integrity of prosecutorial decisionmaking74 assessment of the departments position 1 concerns with pretrial publicity due process and concurrent investigations as has been recounted previously the supreme court has re peatedly reaffirmed the breadth of congress right to inves tigate the government s conduct of criminal and civil litigation75 the courts have also explicitly held that agencies may not deny congress access to agency documents even in situations where the inquiry may result in the exposure of criminal corruption or maladministration of agency officials the supreme court has noted but surely congressional committee which is engaged in legitimate legislative investigation need not grind to halt whenever responses to its inquiries might potentially be harmful to witness in some distinct proceeding or when crime or wrongdoing is exposed76 the court further explained the suggestion made in dissent that the questions which petitioner refused to answer were outside the power of committee to ask under the due process clause because they touched on matters then pending in judicial proceedings cannot be accepted for several reasons first the reasoning underlying this proposition is that these inquiries constitu ted legislative encroachment on the judicial function but such reasoning can hardly be limited to inquiries that may be germane to existing judicial procee dings it would surely apply as well to inquiries calling for answers that my be us ed to the prejudice of witnesses in any future judicial proceeding if such were the reach of due process it would turn witness privilege against selfincrimi nation into selfoperating restraint on congressional inquiry and would in effect pro obliterate the need for that constitutional protection77 nor does the actual pendency of litigation disable congress from the investigation of facts which have bear ing on that litigation where the information sought is needed to determine what if an legislation should be enacted to prevent further ills78 although several lower cour t decisions have recognized that

indicted by state grand jury citing delaney not suggested that there are any constitutional or legal limitations on congress right to conduct an investigation dur ing the pendency of judicial proceedings instead the cases have suggested approaches such as granting continuance or change of venue to deal with the publicity problem79 for example the court in one of the leading cases delaney v united states entertained doubt that the committee acted lawfully within the constitutional powers of congress duly delegated to it but went on to describe the possible cons equences of concurrent executive and congressional investigations we think that the united states is put to choice in this matter if the united states through its legislative departme nt acting conscientiously pursuant to its conception of the public interest choo ses to hold public hearing inevitably resulting in such damaging publicity prejudicial to person awa iting trial on pending indictment then the united states must accept the consequences that the judicial department charged with the duty of assuring the defendant fair trial before an impartial jury may find it necessary to postpone the trial until by lapse of time the danger of the prejudice may reasonably be thought to have been substantially removed80 the delaney court distinguished the case of congressional hearing generating publicity relating to an individual not under indictment at the time as was delaney such situation may present important di fferences from the instant case in such situation the investigative function of congress has its greatest utility congress is informing itself so that it ma take appropriate legislative action it is informing the executive so that ex isting laws may be enforced and it is informing the public so that democratic processes may be brought to bear to correct any disclosed executive laxity so if as result of such legislative hearing an indictment is eventually proc ured against the public official

hearing and criminal trial have been factors in courts rejecting claims that congressionally generated publicity pr ejudiced defendants82 finally in the context of adjudicatory administrative proceedings courts on occasi on have held that pressures emanating from questioning of agency decisionmakers by members of congress may be sufficient to undermine the impartiality of the proceeding 83

court has rejected the notion that prosecutorial discretion in criminal matters is an inherent or core executive function rather the court noted in morrison v olson 86 sustaining the validity of the appointment and removal conditions for independent counsels under the ethics in government act that the independent c ounsels prosecutorial powers are executive in that they have typically been perform ed by executive branch officials but held that the exercise of prosecutorial discretion is in way central to the functioning of the executive branch87 the court therefore rejected claim that

of columbia circuit rulings that filled important gaps in the law of presidential privilege that had been developed between 1977 and 198395 the nixon and postwatergate cases establ ished the broad contours of the presidential communications privilege under those precedents the privilege which is constitutionally rooted c ould be invoked by the president when asked to produce documents or other materials or information that reflect presidential decisionmaking and deliberations that he be lieves should remain confidential if the president does so the materials become presumptivel privileged the privilege however is qualified not absolute and can be overcome by an adequate showing of need finally while reviewing courts have expressed reluctance to balance executive privilege claims against congressi onal demand for information they have acknowledged they will do so if the po litical branches have tried in g ood faith but failed to reach an accommodation however until the district of columbia circuits 1997 ruling in in re sealed case96 and its 2004 ruling in judicial watch inc v department of justice 97 these judicial decisions had left important gaps in the law of presidential privilege which increasingly became focal points if not the source of interbranch confrontations among the more significant issues left open included whether the president has to have actually seen or been familiar with the disputed matter whether the presidential privilege encompasses documents and inform ation developed by or in the possession of officers and employees in the departments and agencies of the executive branch whether the privilege encompasses all communications with respect to which the president may be interested or is it conf ined to presidential decisionmaking and if so is it limited to any particular type of presidential decisionmaking and precisely what kind of demonstration of need must be shown to justify release of materials

investigation of former ag riculture secretary mike espy when allegations of improprieties by espy surfaced in marc h of 1994 president clinton ordered the white house counsels office to investigate and report to him so he could determine what action if any he should undertak the white hous counsels office prepared report for the president which was publically released on october 11 1994 the president never saw any of the underlying or supporting documents to the report espy had announced his resign ation on october 3 to be effective on december 31 meanwhile the independe nt counsel had been appointed on september 9 and the grand jury issued subpoena for all documents that were accumulated or used in preparation of th report on october 14 three days after the reports issuance the president withheld 84 documents claiming both the executive and deliberative process privileges for all documents motion to compel was resisted on the basis of the claimed privileges and after in camera review the district court quashed the subpoena but in its wr itten opinion did not discuss the documents in any detail and provided analysis of the grand jurys need for the documents the appeals court reversed at the outset the courts opinion car efully distinguishes between the presidential communications privilege nd the deliberative process privilege both the court observed are executive privileges designed to protect the confidentiality of executive branch decisionmaking the deliberative process privilege applies to executive branch officials generally is common law privilege which requires lower threshold of need to be overcome and disappears altogether when there is any reason to believe government misconduct has occurred100 on the other hand the court explai ned the presidential communications privilege is rooted in constitutional paration of powers principles and the presidents unique constitutional role and applies only to direct decisionmaking by the president101 the privilege may be overcome only by substantial showing that the subpoenaed materials likely contai n important evidence and that the evidence is not available with due diligence

turning to the chain of command issue the court held that the presidential communications privilege must cover communications made or received by presidential advisers in the c ourse of preparing advice for the president even if those communications are not made directly to the president the court rested its conclusion on the presidents dependence on presidential advisers and the inability of the deliberative process privilege to provide advisers with adequate freedom from the public spotlight and the need to provide sufficient elbow room for advisers to obtain information from all knowledgeable sources105 thus the privilege will apply both to communications which these advisers solicited and received from others as well as those they authored themselves the privilege must also extend to communications authored or received in response to solicitation by members of presidential advisers staff106 the court however was acutely aware of the dangers to open government that limitless extension of the privilege risk s and carefully cabined its reach by explicitly confining it to white house staff and not staff in the agencies and then only to white house staff that has operational proximity to direct presidential decisionmaking we are aware that such an extension unless carefully circumscribed to accomplish the purposes of the privilege could pose significant risk of expanding to large swath of the executiv branch privilege that is bottomed on recognition of the unique role of the pres ident in order to limit this risk the presidential communications privilege should be construed as narrowly as is consistent with ensuring that th confidentiality of the presidents decisionmaking process is adequately pr otected not every person who plays role in the development of presidential advice matter how remote and removed from the president can qualify for the privilege in particular the privilege should not extend to staff outsi the white house in executive branch agencies instead the privilege shoul d apply only to communications authored or solicited and received by those members of an immediate white house advisors staff who have broad and sign ificant responsibility for investigation and formulating the advice to be given the president on the particular matter to which the communications relate only communications at that level are

government bears the burden of proving that the communications occurre d in conjunction with the process of advising the president107 the appeals courts limitation of the pr esidential communications privilege to direct decisionmaking by the president makes it imperative to identify the type of decisionmaking to which it refers clos reading of the opinion makes it arguable that it is meant to encompass only those functions that form the core of presidential authority involving what the court character ized as quintessential and nondelegable presidential power108 in the case before it the court was specifically referring to the presidents article ii appoin tment and removal power wh ich was the focal point of the advice he sought in the espy matter but it is clear from the context of the opinion that the description was meant to juxtapose appointme nt and removal power in contrast with preside ntial powers and res ponsibilities that can be exercised or performed without the presidents direct involvement pursuant to presidential delegation of authority or statutory framework109 the reference the court uses to illustrate the latter category is the presidents article ii duty to take care that the laws are faithfully executed constitutional direction that the courts have consistently held not to be source of pr esidential power but rather an obligation on the president to see to it that the will of congress is carried out by the executive bureaucracy110 the appeals court then would appear to be confining the parameters of the newly formulated presidential

environmental policy consumer protection workplace safety and labor relations among others would not necessarily be covered of course the presidents role in supervis ing and coordinating but not displacing decisionmaking in the executive branch remains unimpeded but his communications would presumably not be cloaked by constitutional privilege such reading of this critical passage is consonant with the courts view of the source and purpose of the pres idential communications privilege and its expressed need to confine it as narrowly as possible relying on united states v nixon 111 the in re sealed case court identifies the pres idents article ii powers and responsibilities as the constitutional basi s of the presidential communications privilege since the constitution assigns th responsibilities to the president alone arguably the privilege of confidentiality that derives from it also should be the presidents alone112 again relying on nixon the appeals court pinpoints the essential purpose of the privilege tlhe privilege is rooted in the need for confidentiality to ensure that presidential decisionmaking is of the highest caliber informed by honest advice and knowledge c onfidentiality is what ensures the expression of candid objective and ev blunt or harsh opinions and the comprehensive exploration of all policy alternatives before presidential course of action is selected113 the limiting safeguard is that the privilege will apply in those instances where the constitution provides that the president alone must make decision the presidential communications

received by the president or his office are instead protected against disclosure if at all by the deliberative process privilege 118 guided by the analysis of the espy ruling the panel majority emphasized that the solicited and received limitation is necessitated by the principles underlying the presidential communications privilege and recognition of the dangers of expanding it too far119 espy teaches the appeals court explained that the privilege may be invoked only when presidential advi sers in close proximity to the president who have significant responsibility fo r advising him on nondelegable matters requiring direct presidential decisionmaking have solicited and received such documents or communications or the president has received them himself in rejecting the governments argument that the privilege should be applicable to all departmental and agency communications re lated to the deputy attorney generals pardon recommendations for the president the panel majority held that such brightline rule is inconsistent with the nature and principles of the presidential communications privilege as well as the goal of serving the public interest communications never received by the president or his office are unlikely to be revelatory of his deliberations nor is there any reason to fear that the deputy attorney generals candor or the quality of the putys pardon recommendations would be sacrificed if the presidential communications privilege did not apply to internal documents any pardon documents reports or recommendations that the deputy attorney general submits to the office of the president and any direct communications the deputy or the pardon ttorney may have with the white house counsel or other immediate presidential advi sors will remain protected it is only those documents and recommendations of department staff that are not submitted by the deputy attorney general for the president and are not otherwise received by the office of the president that do not fall under the presidential communications privilege120 indeed the judicial watch panel makes it clear that the espy rationale would preclude cabinet department heads fro m being treated as being part of the presidents immediate personal staff or as some unit of the office of the president extension of the presidential communications privilege to the attorney generals

took great pains to explain why espy and the case before it differed from the nixon and postwatergate cases until in re sealed case the privilege had been tied specifically to direct communications of the president with his immediate white house advisors122 the espy court it explained was for the first time confronted with the question whether communications that the presidents closest advisors make in the c ourse of preparing advise for the president which the president never saw should also be covered by the pr esidential privilege the espy courts answer was to espouse limited extension of the privilege down the chain of command beyond the president to his immediate white house advisors only recognizing the need to ensure that the president would receive full and frank advice with regard to his nonde legable appointment and removal powers but was also wary of undermining counter vailing considerations such as openness in government hence the espy court determined that while communications authored or solicited and r eceived by immediate white h ouse advisors in the office of the president could qualify under the pr ivilege communications of staff outside the white house in executive branch agencies that were not solicited and received by such white house advisors could not123 the situation before the judicial watch court tested the espy principles while the presidential decision involved exercise of the president s pardon power was certainly nondelegable core presidenti function the operating officials involved the deputy attorney general and the pardon attorney were deemed to be too remote from the president and his senior white hous advisors to be protected the court conceded that functionally those officials were performing task directly related

circum stances the panel majo rity concluded the lesser protections of the deliberative process privile ge would have to suffice124 4 the claim of deliberative process privilege espy and judicial watch taken together with morrison v olsons holding that prosecution is not core or exclus ive function of the executive and mcgrain v daughertys understanding that congress access to prosecutorial information is founded on its plenary authority to create empower and fund the activities of the department raise serious doubts as to the propriety of the claim to presidential communications privilege in situation involving internal agency deliberative information rather withholding claim based on deliberativ process arguably must be tested as one of the common law privileges available to executive agencies that may be overcome by showing of need by an investigatory body and as espy noted disappears upon reasonable be lief by such investigating body that government misconduct has occurred t hus demonstration of need by jurisdictional committee in most circumstances would appear to be sufficient and plausible showing of fraud waste abuse or maladministrati on would likely be conclusive even before espy courts and committees had cons istently resisted withholding claims of agencies as attempts to establis h species of agency privilege designed to thwart congressional oversight efforts thus it has been pointed out that the claim that internal communications need to be frank and open does not merit special support and that coupling that character ization with the notion that those communications were part of deliberative process will not add any weight to the argument in effect such arguments have been seen as attempting to justify withholding from congress on the same grounds that an agency would use to withhold such documents from citizen re quester under exemption 5 of the freedom of information act foia125 such line of argument is likely to be found to be without s ubstantial basis as has been indicated above congress has vas tly greater powers of investigation than those of citizen foia requesters moreover in the foia itself congress carefully provided that the exemption section is not authority to withhold information from congress126 the dc circuit in murphy v department of the army 127 explained that foia exemptions were basis fo r withholding from congress because of the obvious purpose of the congress to carve out for itself special right of access to privileged information not shared by others congress whether as body through

be contended that the ability of an agency to assert the need for candor to ensure the efficacy of internal deliberations as means of avoiding congressional information mands would severely under mine the oversight process if that were sufficient an agency would be encouraged to disclose only that which supports its positions and withhold that with flaws limitations unwanted implications or other embarrassments oversight would cease to become an investigative exercise of gathering the whole evidence and become little more than setpiece in which an agency decides what to present in controlled show and tell performance moreover every federal official including attorneys could assert the imperative of timidity that congressional oversight by holding up to scrutiny the advice he gives will frighten him away from giving frank opinions or discourage others from asking him for them this argument not surprisingly has failed over the years to persuade legislative bodies to cease oversight indeed when the supreme court discussed the secret law doctrine in nlrb v sears roebuck co129 it addressed why federal officials including those giving legal opinions need not hide behind such fears the probability that an agency employee will be inhibited from freely advising decisionmaker for fear that his advice if adopted will become public is slight first when adopted the reasoning becomes that of agency and becomes its responsibility to defend second agency employees will generally be encouraged rather than discouraged by public knowledge that their policy suggestions have been adopted by the agency moreover the public interest in knowing the reasons for policy actually adopted by an agency supports disclosure130 arguably then chilling effect argument needs to be demonstrated concretely in particular cases or else it would overwhelm inves tigative prerogatives the recent district court ruling in committee on the judiciary v harriet miers et al131 appears to support such limiting stan dard in the face of chilling effect claims miers involved congressional committee cha llenge to presidential assertions that past and present senior advisers to the president are absolutely immune from compelled congressional process when the president invokes executive privilege the executive argued that in such circumstance since the president himself is absolutely immune

necessarily trigger the chillin g effect that the executive predicts senior executive officials often testify be fore congress as normal part of their jobs and forced testimony before congress does not implicate the same concern regarding personal financial exposure as does damages suit significantly the committee concedes that an executive br anch official may assert executive privilege on questionbyquestion basis as appropriate that should serve as an effective check against public disclosure of truly privileged communications thereby mitigating any adverse impact on the quality of advice that the president receives in any event the historical record pr oduced by the comm ittee reveals that senior advisors to the pres ident have often testified before congress subject to various subpoenas dating back to 1973 see auerbach decl 23 thus it would hardly be unprecedented fo r ms miers to appear before congress to testify and assert executive privilege where appropriate still it is noteworthy that in an environment where there is judicial support whatsoever for the executives claim of absolute immunity the historical record also does not reflect the wholesale compulsion by congress of testimony from senior presidential advisors that the executive fears133 concluding observations congress has an established right and judicially recognized prerogative pursuant to its constitutional authority to legislate to r eceive from officers and employees of the agencies and departments of the united states accurate and truthful information regarding the federal programs and policies administered by such employees and agencies as stated by the supreme court legislative body cannot legislate wisely or effectively in the absence of information regarding conditions which the legislation is intended to affect or change134 and thus what observers might characterize as political ga mesmanship must yield according to the courts to the clear public interest of pr oviding the peoples elected representatives in the congress with accurate and truthf ul information upon which to effectively fashion or revise the laws for the nation there is counterva iling right or interest for federal official in an agency or department to in tentionally withhold conceal or prevent the disclosure of truthful public policy information from the united states congress concerning legisla tion affecting the programs and policies administered by that agency when requested by jurisdictional committee of the congress this understanding applies with equal force to the law enforcement

have exercised the full panoply of ove rsight and investigat ory power available to them have consistently gained access to needed information from the department in the form of documents or testimony

over the past two decades rejecting assorted presidential prerogatives that might deny congressiona l access to agency information appear to have buttressed cong ressional oversight authority the supreme courts ruling in morrison v olsen casts significant doubt whether pr osecutorial discretion is core presidential power over which executive priv ilege may be assert ed doubt that has been magnified by the appellate court rulings in espy and judicial watch in those latter decisions assertion of the presidential communications privilege was held to be limited to quinte ssential and nondelegable presid ential power and is confined to communications to advisors in operational proximity with the president those decisions indicate that core powers include only decisions that the president alone can make under the constitution appointment and removal pardoning receiving ambassadors and other public ministers negotiating treaties and exercising powers as commanderinchief espy strongly hinted and judicial watch made clear that the protection of the presidential communi cations privilege extends only to the boundaries of the white house and the ex ecutive office complex and not to the departments and agencies even if the actions there related to core power unless they are solicited and received by close white house advisor or the president himself judicial watch which dealt with pardon doc uments in doj that had not been solicited and received by close wh ite house advisor determined that the need for the presidential communications privilege becomes more attenuated the further away the advisors are from the pres ident which affects the extent to which the contents of the presidents communications can be inferred from predecisional communications135 of

the united states hearings before the senate select committee on investigation of the attorney general vols 13 68th congre ss 1st session 1924 the select committee heard from scores of present and former ttorneys and agents of the department and its bureau of investigation who offered detailed testimony about specific instances of the departments failure to prosecute alleged meritorious cases not all of the cases upon which testimony was offered were closed as one of the committees goals in its questioning was to identify cases in which the statute of limitations had not run out and prosecution was still possible see eg id at 14951503 152930 229596 the committee also obtained access to department documentation including prosecutorial memoranda on wide range of matters however given the charges of widespread corruption in the department and the imminent resignation of attorney general daugherty it would appear that some of the documents furnished the committee early in the hearings may have been volunteered by the witnesses and not officially provided by the department although attorn ey general daugherty had promised cooperation with the co mmittee and had agreed to provide access to at least the files of closed cases id at 1120 such cooperation apparently had not been forthcoming id at 1078 79 in two instances immediately following daughertys resignation the committee was refused access to confidential bureau of investigation investigative reports pending the appointment of new attorney general who could dvise the president about such production id at 101516 and 115960 though witnesses from the department were per mitted to testify about the inves tigations that were the subject of the investigative reports and even to read at the hearings from the investigative reports with the appointment of the new attorney general harlan f stone the committee was granted broad access to department f iles committee chairman smith brookhard remarked that stone is fu rnishing us with all the files we want whereas the former attorney general mr daugherty refused nearly all that we asked id at 2389 for example with the author ization of the new attorney general an accountant with the department who had led an investigati on of fraudulent sales of property by the alien property custodi ans office appeared and produced his confidential reports to the bureau of inve stigation the reports described the factual findings from his investigation and his recommendations for further action and included the names of companies and indivi duals suspected of making false claims the department had not acted on those recommendations though the cases had not been closed id at 14951547 similar investigative report concerning an inquiry into the disappearance of large quantitie s of li quor under the control of the department during the prior administration of president harding was also produced id at 1790 as part of its investigation the sel ect committee issued subpoena for the testimony of mally s daugherty the brother of the attorney general after mally daugherty failed to respond to the subpoena the senate sent its deputy sergeant at arms to take him into custody and bring him before the senate daugherty petitioned in federal court for writ of habeas corpus arguing that the senate in its investigation had exceeded its constitutional powers th case ultimately reached the supreme court where in landmark decision mcgrain v daugherty 273 us 135 1927httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34197crs39 the court upheld the senates authority to investigate these charges concerning the department the subject to be investigated was the administration of the department of justice whether its functions were be ing properly discharged or were being neglected or misdirected and particularly whether the attorney general and his assistants were performing or neglecting their duties in respec t of the institution and prosecution of proceedings to punish crimes and enforce appropriate remedies against the wrongdoers specific instances of alleged neglect being recited plainly the subject was one on wh ich legislation could be had and would be materially aided by the information which the investigation was calculated to elicit 273 us at 177 in another teapot dome case that reached the supreme court sinclair v united states 279 us 263 1929 different witness at the congressional hearings refused to provide answers and was prosecuted fo r contempt of congress the witness had noted that lawsuit had been commen ced between the government and the mammoth oil company and declared i shall reserve any evidence i may be able to give for those courts and shall re spectfully decline to answer any questions propounded by your committee id at 290 the supreme court upheld the witness conviction for contempt of congress the court considered and rejected in unequivocal terms the witnesss contention that the pendency of lawsuits provided an excuse for withholding information neith er the laws directing that such lawsuits be instituted nor the lawsuits themselves operated to divest the senate or the committee of power further to investigate the actual administration of the land laws id at 295 the court further explained it may be conceded that congress is without authority to compel disclosure for the purpose of aiding the prosecution of pending suits but the authority of that body directly or through its committees to require pertinent disclosures in aid of its own constitutional power is not abridged because the information sought to be elicited may also be of use in such suits id at 295 investigations of doj during the 1950s in 1952 special house subcommittee wa s constituted to conduct an inquiry into the administration of

permission to use the notes of the u s attorney in st louis and of one of the grand jurors with all names deleted id the judge also submitted deposition to the subcommittee about the departments interference with the grand jury id at 891931 grand jury curbing extensive testimony was heard about charge that the department had attempted improperly to curb grand jury inquiry in st louis into the

attorneys concerning the grand jury investigation id at 75966137 the subcommittee began its hearings on the handling of the st louis grand jury with statement emphasizing that its interest is merely to ascertain whether or not there was in fact any attempt by the department of justice to influence the grand jury in its investigation id at 754 and that the members of the subcommittee and counsel are aware of the rule of strict secrecy surroundi ng the proceedings of any grand jury mindful of that our ques tioning will not touch upon any specific case or evidence that may have been presented to the grand jury id the subcommittees questions to the grand jurors focused on fforts by department attorneys to prevent them from conducting thorough investiga tion and on whether the grand jury had been pressured by those attorneys to i ssue report absolving the government of impropriety in its handling of tax fraud cases id at 766808 similar questions were asked of the present and former partment attorneys who testified id at 808894 10641117 12561318 and at one point the subcommittee asked for and an assistant u s attorney provided the name s of certain witne sses who had appeared before the grand jury id at 811 later that same year the subcommittee examined similar charges of interference by the department with another grand jury which had been investigating communist infiltration of the united nations the subcommittee received testimony from number of gra nd jurors and department attorneys including then criminal division attorney roy cohn id at 16531812 the subcommittees chief counsel again cautioned that the sanctity of the grand jury as process of american justice must be protected at all costs and stated that the subcommittee was seeking information solely relating to attempts to delay or otherwise influence the grand jurors deliber ations not which would reveal the actual testimony of witnesses appearing before them id at

in the department particularly in the tax division as resu lt of the replacement of mcgrath by james p mcgranery and the administrations c oncern about these reports of corruption the subcommittee observed new and refresh ing attitude of c ooperation which soon appeared at all levels in the department of justice doj investigation report at 69 the subcommittee declared that its work has been limited only by the capacity of its staff to digest the sheer volume of available fact and documentary evidence relating to the departments work everyt hing that has been requested has been furnished including file materials and administrative memoranda which had previously been withheld id for example in investigating charges that the department was often dilatory in its handling of routine cases the subco mmittee staff undertook detailed analysis of number of cases in which delay was lleged to have occurred to demonstrate publicly the nature of this problem the subcommittee chose procurement fraud case that had been recently closed and conducted public file review of the case at subcommittee hearing attorneys from the department at the hearing went document by document through the departments file in the case doj investigative hearings 82nd congress at 8959 64 the subc ommittee was granted access to all of the documentation collected in the case with the exception of confidential fbi reports which the subcommittee had agreed not to seek however certain communications from the fbi to the department concer ning the prosecution of the case were provided id at 897 3 new york city police brutality during the 83rd congress the subcommittee turned to allegations that the criminal division had entered into an agreement with the new york city police department not to prosecute instances of police brutality by new york police officers that might be violations of federal civil rights statutes the subcommittee stated that its purpose was not to inquire into the mer its of particular cases only to ascertain whether such an arrangement had been tered into between the justice department and the new york city police doj inves tigation hearings 83rd congress at 26 justice department witnesses had also been instructed by the attorney general not to discuss the merits of any pending cases id department witnesses included former attorney general several present and former assistant attorneys general as well as other department attorneys and fbi agents id at 25294 the substance of earlier mee tings between department officials and the new york city police commissioner in which this arrangement was allegedly agreed to was probed in depth although questions concerning the merits of specific cases were avoided the subcommittee obtained from these

justice went to wit hhold information from the committee in this investigation is unparallele d in the committees experience consent decree report at xiii with respect to the att consent decree doj unconditionally refused to make available to the subcommittee information from its files of that case the subcommittees chairman initially had written the attorney general requesting that he make available all files in the department of justice relating to the negotiations for and signing of consent decree in this case consent decree hearings at 1674 deputy attorney general william p roge rs asserted two grounds to support the departments refusal to pr ovide the subcommittee with such access first that the files contained information voluntarily submitted by att in the course of consent decree negotiations rogers wrote the subcommittee chairman that were the files made available to your subcommittee this department would violate the confidential nature of settlement negotiations and in the process discourage defendants present and future from entering into such negotiations id at 167475 in later letter the head of the antitrust division victor hansen added that those considerations which require that the department treat on confidential basis communications with defendant during consent decree negotiations also apply to the enforcement of decree id at 3706 the second reason given by rogers for th departments refu sal to provide the subcommittee access to the att files was that they contained memoranda and recommendations prepared by staff of the antitrust division and the essential process of full and flexible exchange mig ht be seriously enda ngered were staff members hampered by the knowledge they mig ht at some later date be forced to explain before congress inte rmediate positions taken id at 1675 rogers stated that this action was being taken in accordance with an earlier directive from the president to the department to that effect which provided because it is essential to efficient and effective administration that employees of the executive branch be in position to be completely candid in advising with each other on official matters and because it is not in the public interest that any of their conversations or communications or any documents or reproductionshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34197crs43 concerning such advice be disclosed you will instruct employees of your department that in all of their appearances before congressional committees not to testify to any such conversations or communications or to produce any such document or reproductions this principle must be maintained regardless of who would be benefitted by such disclosures id the subcommittee in its final report asserted that initially the attorney general refused access to the files of the department of justice primarily in order to prevent disclosure of facts that might prove em barrassing to the partment consent decree report at 42 the subcommittee further concluded that such withholding had materially hampered the committees inves tigation however it may be noted that the subcommittee was ultimately able to obtain much of the material concerning the att consent decree that doj refused to provide directly from att itself id the department was however somewhat more forthcoming in permitting testimony of its attorneys about the att consent decree for example the head of the antitrust division instructed two division attorneys who had dissented from the decision to enter into the att consent d ecree and had been called to testify before the subcommittee that we do not at the pr esent time think it ppropriate to assert any privilege on behalf of the depa rtment with regard to any information within your knowledge which is relevant to the negotiations of the decree in the western electric case consent decree hearings at 3647 these two attorneys later testified about those negotia tions including their reasons for differing with the departments decision to enter into the consent decree id at 371144 cointelpro and related investigations of fbidoj misconduct over the period 19741978 senate nd house committees

because it tends to inhibit prosecutors from proceeding through their normal tasks free from the fear that they may be sec ondguessed with the be nefit of hindsight long after they take actions and make difficult judgements in the course of their duties id at 486 the department nevertheless agreed to this testimony becausehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34197crs47 of their value to you as fact witnesses and because you have assured us that they will be asked to testify solely as to matters of fact within their personal knowledge and not conclusions or ma tters of policy id the most extensive focus of the co mmittees inquiry was on the fbis abscam operation which lasted from early 1978 th rough january 1980 and resulted in the criminal conviction of one senator six mbers of the house of representatives several local officials and others as part of this review the subcommittee was given access to almost all of the confid ential documents generated during the covert stage of the undercover operation known as abscam id at v in all the committee reviewed more than 20000 pages of abscam documents as well as video and audio tapes and tape transcripts id at 9 provided under the terms of an elaborate access agreement negotiated with the department pursuant to the agreement the subcommittee was provided copies of confidential abscam materials other than grand jury materials barred from disclosure under rule 6e of the fe deral of criminal procedure without court order and certain prosecutorial memoranda from the abscam cases under the agreement the department was also pe rmitted to withhold from the committee documents that might compromise ongoing investigations or reveal sensitive sources or investigative techniques though the depa rtment was required to scribe each such document withheld explain the basis of the deni and give the committee an opportunity to propose conditions under which the docum ents might be provided the committee further agreed to pledge of confid entiality under which it was permitted to use and publicly disclose info rmation derived from the c onfidential documents and to state that the information came from department files but was prohibited from publicly identifying the specific documents from which the information was obtained all confidential docum ents were kept in s ecure room with access limited to the committees members its two couns and several designated document custodians see generally id at v 47284 later doj agreed to permit access to those materials by other committee attorneys as well in

that were withheld as well as from documents prepared or compiled by th departments office of professional responsibility as part of an internal i nvestigation of possi ble misconduct in the abscam operations and prosecutions id at v under the general framework established by this agreement there was considerable give and take between the committee and the department as to the degree of access that would be provided to specific documents for example the committees counsel had sought access to re port prepared in the criminal division on fbi undercover operations abscam h earings at 514 the committees chairman had also written the attorney general requesting access to that report abscam report at 485 an agreement was reached wh ereby the report could be examined by committee members or counsel at the depar tment and notes taken on its contents but it could neither be copied or removed from the department id at 494 committee counsel utilized this procedure but the co mmittee termined that such limited access made it impractical for its members to personally review the report and thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34197crs48 committees chairman again wrote the attorney general asking for release of copy id at 498 the department ultimately agreed to provide copy of the report to each member of the committee with the unders tanding that the report would not be disseminated beyond the members of th committee and its counsel additional copies would be made and th copies provided by the partment would be returned at the conclusion of the committees work id at 501 finally the

agency ever to have been so cited by house of congress it also resulted in the filing of an unprecedented gal action by the department in the name of the united states against the house of representatives and number of its officials to obtain judicial declaration that burford had acted lawfully in refusing to comply with the subpoena ultimately the lawsuit was dismissed us v house of representatives 557 f supp 150 ddc 1983 the documents we re provided to congress and the contempt citation was dropped however number of ques tions about the role of the department during the contr oversy remained whether the department not epa had made the decision to persuade the president to assert executive privilege whether the department had directed the united states attorney for the district of columbia not to present the contempt certification of burford to the grand jury for prosecutionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34197crs49 and had made the decision to sue the h ouse and generally whether there was conflict of interest in the departments simultaneously advising the president representing burford investigating lleged executive branch wrongdoing and enforcing the congressional criminal contempt statute these and related questions raised by the departments actions were th subject of an investigation by the house judiciary committee beginning in early 1983 the committee issued final report on its investigation in december 1985 see repor t of the house comm on the judiciary on investigation of the role of the depa rtment of justice in the withholding of environmental

all of the documentation and other information it sought from the department in many respects this investig ation proved as contentious as the earlier epa controversy from which it arose in its final report the committee concluded that the department of justice through many of the same senior officials who were most involved in the epa controversy consciously prevented the judiciary committee from obtaining information in the departments possession that was essential to the committees inquiry in to the departments role in that controversy most notably the department deliberately and without advising the committee withheld massive volume of vital handwritten notes and chronologies for over one year these materials which the department knew came within the committees february 1983 document request contained the bulk of the relevant documentary information about the departments activities outlined in this report and provided basis for many of the committees findings epa withholding report at 1163 see also 123438 among the other abuses cited by the committee were the withholding of number of other rele vant documents until the committee had independently learned of their existence id at 1164 as well as materially false and misleading testimony before the committee by the head of the departments office of legal counsel id at 116465 11911231 the committees initial request for documentation was contained in february 1983 letter from its chairman peter rodi to attorney general william french smith the committee requested the departme nt to supply all documents prepared by or in the possession of th department in any way re lating to the withholding of documents that congressional committees have subpoenaed from the epa id at 1167 118283 the letter also specifically requested among other things narrative description of the activities of each division or other unit of the department relating to the withholding of the epa mate rials information about the departments apparent conflict of interest in simultaneously advising the executive branch while being responsible for prosecuting the burford contempt citation and any instructions given by the department to the united states attorney for the district of columbia not to present the burford contempt to the grand jury at first the department provided only pub licly available documents in response to this and other document requests of the committee id at 1184 however after series of meetings between committee staff and senior department officials anhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34197crs50 agreement was reached whereby co mmittee staff were per mitted to review the materials responsive to these requests at the department to determine which documents the committee would need for its

provided to the committee and the chairman again wrote to the attorney general requestin g the departments cooperation in the investigation in that letter the chairman advised the attorney general that the committees preliminary investigation had ra ised serious questions of misconduct including potential criminal misconduct in the actions of the department in the withholding of the epa documents id at 1172 the committee finally received all of the 105 documents in july 1984 full ear after it had initia lly requested access the committee at that time also obtained the written notes and number of other documents that had been earlier withheld id at 1173 there was also disagreement about the access that would be provided to department employees for interviews with committee staff the department demanded that it be permitted to have one or more department attorneys present at each interview the committee feared that the presence of department representatives might intimidate the department employees in their interviews and stated that it was willing to permit department representative to be present only if the representative was walledoff from department officials involved with the controversy if the substance of inte rviews was not revealed to subsequent interviewees and if employees could be interviewed w ithout department representative present if so requested th department ultimately agreed to permit the interviews to go forward without its ttorneys present if department employee requested representation the department employed privat counsel for that purpose in all committee staff interviewed 26 current and former department employees including four assistant attorney generals under this agreement id at 117476 partly as result of these interviews as well as from information in the handwritten notes that had been initially withheld the committee concluded that it also required access to criminal division doc uments concerning the origins of the criminal investigation of former epa assistant administrator rita lavelle in order to determine if the department had considered instituting the investigation to obstruct the committees inquiry the committee also requested information about the departments earlier withholding of the handwritten notes and other documents to determine whether department officials had deliberately withheld the documents in an attempt to obstruct th committees investigation id at 117677 126364 the department at first refused to provide the committee with documents relating to its lavelle

chairman wrote the attorney general and objected that the department was denying the committee access even though claim of executive privilege had been asserted id at 1266 the chairman also maintained that in this case of course claim of executive privilege could lie because of the interest of the committee in determining whether the docum ents contain evidence of misconduct by executive branch officials id with respect to the documents relating to the departments handling of the committee i nquiry the chairman demanded that the department prepare detailed index of the withheld documents including the title date and length of each document its author and all who had seen it summary of its contents an explanation of why it was being withheld and certification that the department intended to recommend to th president the assertion of executive privilege as to each withheld document and that each document contained evidence of misconduct id at 126869 with respect to the lavelle

prejudice the pending or anticipated litigation by the independent counsel the irancontra committees dis puted that contention require d the furnishing of all justice department documents and

socalled meese inqui ry the team led by attorney general meese which looked into the national security council nsc staff in late november 1987 the irancontra committees concluded that this inquiry had the effect of forwarning the nsc staff to shre d their records and fix upon an agreed false story and by the meese t eams methods the last vital opportunity to uncover the obscured aspects of the
