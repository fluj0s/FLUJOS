appropriate analysis analysts and lawmakers view many financial businesses as having an important role in the us economy receiving protection for their individual account holders against loss should the firms fail such protections exist both to protect the individuals from risks they probably could not discern for themselves and to protect the economy against the effects of financial panics if failures occur panics the attendant collapses of wealth and severe consequences for the economy occurred before congress created federal deposit insurance in 1934 until the enactment of the emergency economic stabilization act eesa of 2008 government policy protected customers of depository institutions banks thrift institutions and credit unions in full for accounts up to 10000 and up to 250000 for retirement accounts but the enactment of eesa on september 23 2008 immediately raised the maximum deposit insurance to 250000 leaving retirement accounts at 250000 until december 31 2009 other institutions such as insurance companies securities brokerdealers and many pension funds receive government or governmentsponsored guarantees on specified accounts crs2 this report provides sidebyside summary of the major features of financial institutions customer protection systems reflecting safetynet provisions legislated over time usually in reaction to specific collapses besides these explicit guarantees regulatory bodies can attempt the rescue of failing financial enterprises using many tools authorized by laws and regulations and often acting in the background such tools include liquidity lending arranging memoranda of understanding issuing cease and desist orders against risky practices and arranging mergers of weak entities into stronger institutions if the entire financial economy seems threatened by pending collapse of either sizeable financial institution that is too large to fail or many financial businesses collectively the federal reserve fed can step in as the lender of last resort to avert serious adverse consequences for the economy eg use of the feds liberal bank liquidity policy immediately after the 911 attacks and currently the subprime meltdown led to failures of institutions once believed to be too large to fail bear stearns fannie mae freddie mac and aig all of which were or are being assisted by the federal government moreover congress may have to provide emergency funding when parts of the federal safety net are under severe pressure the cleanup of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s and early 1990s for example required appropriated funds plus new deposit insurance fund and regulator more recent example is the emergency economic httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21987 stabilization act of 2008 that provided 700 billion to purchase distressed assets such as mortgagebacked securities and to make direct capital investments in troubled financial institutions an important conceptual distinction between support structures is who ultimately pays for the protection lawmakers originally created federal deposit insurance in user fee model of insurance in which the government owned and operated each insurance system and charged member banks for its use following the banking failures of the late 20th century legislation moved deposit protection part way toward an alternative mutual model in which the burden of financing the system falls more clearly on the banking industry mutual institutions are owned by their customers such as saving associations depositors and insurance companies policyholders as result some analysts now claim that the banking industry owns the deposit insurance funds in mutual mode in reality the federal government still owns and operates them that is so because in all depository institution cases the ultimate guarantor is the economic power of the federal government history has shown that deposit guarantees short of the federal level have universally been inadequate to prevent panics runs and severe economic damage when called upon1 industrysponsored and statelevel programs have contained the collapses of their covered entities only if the damages have been small credit union share insurance in contrast more nearly follows the mutual model likewise state insurance company guaranty and federallysponsored securities investor protection arrangements follow the mutual model the troubled pension benefit arrangement however remains in user fee mode the following tabulation lists the major elements and components of these safety nets table 1 outlines the support structures for accounts at depository institutions table 2 does the same for the nondepository supports readers may obtain further analysis of each system via the websites of the administering

program on october 23 2008 in the midst of the current financial crisis the federal deposit insurance corporation announced its temporary liquidity guarantee program to help unfreeze the us short term credit markets at the time financial institutions were not lending to each other especially in the commercial paper market which was almost completely frozen the twopart program temporarily guarantees all new senior unsecured debt and fully guarantees funds in certain noninterest bearing accounts at fdicinsured institutions issued between october 14 2008 and june 30 2009 with guarantees expiring later than june 30 2012 the fdic expects these guarantees would restore the necessary confidence for investors to begin investing in obligations of depository institutions evidence suggests that these shotterm markets are slowly returning to normal after the tlg program was implemented the second part of the fdics tlg program is to guarantee 100 of noninterest bearing transaction accounts held in insured depository institutions until december 31 crs6 2009 this addresses the concern that many small business accounts such as payroll accounts frequently exceed the current maximum deposit insurance limit of 250000 the tlg program is being paid for by additional fees placed on depository institutions that use these guarantees not taxpayers2 financial guarantors monoline insurance companies financial guarantors are insurance companies that insure the credit quality of securities that banks securities firms insurance companies among others hold as assets even though state insurance regulators have sole authority to supervise them3 financial guarantors safety and soundness may have critical impact on the safety and soundness of all financial businesses including federal regulated banks4 the failure of one or more financial guarantors could possible bring about other financial business failures because credit rated securities backed by guarantors insurance on for example national banks books would be downgraded requiring the banks to add capital if the bank is unable to acquire the necessary capital the bank could suffer losses or even fail due to the falling prices of its insured assets which might longer cover its liabilities including deposits httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21987 financial guarantors provide insurance against credit defaults of securities specifically they focus on insuring the timely payment of principal and interest on securities including municipal bonds assetbacked securities and collateralized debt obligations cdos the guarantors insurance raises the credit rating of the underlying securities which in turn lowers the interest costs to the issuer and makes the securities more attractive to wider range of investors the nine new york monoline insurance companies insure 25 trillion of domestic and international debt an increasing part of this debt was cdos backed by subprime residential mortgagebacked securities such debt led to losses for these monoline companies because these securities were being sold at substantial discounts the growing possibility of more losses caused the rating agencies to lower the treble ratings of several of these financial insurance companies the treble credit rating is required for the guarantors to offer treble credit ratings on securities issuers offer because some guarantors were downgraded the securities they insured are being downgraded as well which means that banks securities firms and insurance companies among others holding these downgraded assets must increase their capital as the price of these assets falls new york state insurance regulators and the us treasury are seeking ways to help these financial guarantors get recapitalized 2 thecla fabian fdic board
