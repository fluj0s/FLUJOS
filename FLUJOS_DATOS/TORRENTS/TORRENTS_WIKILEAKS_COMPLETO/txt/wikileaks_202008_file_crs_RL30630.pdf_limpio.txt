current status and emerging policy issues summary precision agriculture pa is suite of information technologies that can support farmbased and sitespecific crop management system in agricultural production pa is not single technology or farming system but rather cluster of different techniques pa uses advanced information technologies to identify and to evaluate temporal and spatial variation in cropland rather than apply inputs of production eg fertilizers pesticides seed or water uniformly across field grower using pa techniques can apply inputs more efficiently based on the biophysical variability of different areas of field proponents argue that pa can increase the yield potential of farm while reducing the costs from inefficiently applying inputs further by applying fertilizers and pesticides in more efficient amounts proponents argue that farmers would reduce the environmental effects of overapplication because pa is in the early stages of adoption however these benefits have been difficult to measure to date returns to investment in pa have also been mixed according to available research questions persist about the appropriate scale of analysis and measurement needed to validly assess the potential benefits of pa adopters of pa to date have disproportionately been larger corn soybean and wheat produce rs which may be partly attributable to the early commercial availability of pa technology such as yield monitors for these crops but hard evidence has emerged that pa technologies are sizebiased or cropspecific pa appears to offer the greatest future potential benefits where variety of inputs are used and input costs are high subfield spatial andor temporal variability is high and adverse environmental effects especially on water resources must be reduced several bills have been introduced in recent congresses to increase support for public research on pa development several public and landgrant universities have also initiated new programs in pa technology and development additional research and development are supported by the agricultural research service in contrast to many previous us technological innovations in agriculture however pa is currently being developed and promoted largely by private companies further diffusion of pa technologies could raise several public policy concerns that the congress may wish to address these include questions about the role of public research education and extension services future effects on the organization of production intellectual property issues associated with ownership and control of the

agricultural statistics service farm computer usage access ownership and use by state and us 1997 and 1999 precision agriculture and sitespecific management current status and emerging policy issues1 introduction over the past decade information technologies have fundamentally transformed many industrial areas these technologies undergirding advanced telecommunications data acquisitio n and information processing and commerce have become core elements for many contemporary production and marketing processes not only have they permitted the modification of existing activities they have also become the catalyst for fundamentally redesigning production processes and for creating original products and processes the manufacturing and service sectors already have seen significant changes to their production processes through information technologies while the agricultural sector has benefitted less agricultures reliance on information technology however is beginning to change rapidly with many promised benefits according to proponents rapid technological change always has been central characteristic of us agriculture2 growing competitive pressures stemming from international agricultural markets improving yields and new environmental concerns lead farmers to seek and adopt technological innovations the emergence of new technologies in conjunction with new demands on the agriculture sector from range of interest groups are setting the broad context for further changes in us agriculture along with changes in the structure of agricultural production eg increased contractual arrangements greater concentration in some sectors changing government policies and regulations an increased acceptance and reliance on information technologies by farmers is also altering us agricultural production expectations that farmers would rapidly adopt computers for example are now beginning to be realized in 1999 computers were owned or leased by approximately 40 of us growers up from 31 in 19973 the predominant use initially was for financial applications ie bookkeeping business management in 1999 29 of us farms had internet access compared to 13 in 1997 farms with sales greater than 250000 per year which are considered to be commercial or fulltime farms hadhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30630crs2 double the rate of computer ownership business management use and internet access relative to farms with sales of less than 250000 per year farms with sales greater than 250000 also account for the great majority of total us agricultural output so that the bulk of agricultural output today is likely from farms using computers in some aspect of their operation growth in adoption of information technology for the agricultural sector as whole is now consistent with other sectors approximately 3 per year the largest impact of computers in agriculture until recently has been in the support industries but producers are increasingly finding potential benefits from computer technologies including precision agriculture precision agriculture pa also called sitespecific crop production prescription farming and soilspecific crop management refers to suite of technologies that use sensing and georeferencing innovations to apply more precise inputs based on fields biophysical variability the objective of pa techniques is to quantify and manage the spatial and temporal variability existing in virtually every field this is accomplished by remote sensing technology by local sensors or by using the integrated data in geographic information system gis as the basis for identifying particular management zones that may require different amounts or types of inputs how farmer might use pa growers might typically adopt pa system using gis software to permit growers to capture store manipulate analyze and display wide variety of data referenced to the specific points on the earths surface determined by the global positioning system gps or other remote sensing technology growers can then add data on other attributes of fields variability eg soil moisture pest densities weather soil compaction to the gis to create multilayered fieldspecific information system for guiding management decisions for more precise application of inputs by variable rate technologies vrt producers first determine the variability within their fields by relating crop production andor soil attribute data collected over several growing seasons to geographic coordinates using gps monitor mounted on combine while crop yield data are insufficient in and of themselves to understand the actual source of field variability when they are joined to digital soil maps farmers have two significant layers of information about field variability that can be integrated into the gis and supplemented by other layers of agronomic data as needed growers use the gis to guide their vrt to continually adjust input applications as they operate their equipment based on the biophysical variability of the various zones they have identified in their fields see the glossary on pages 14 and 15 for definitions of selected terms associated with pa the goals of pa are increased yields and reduced costs with fewer negative environmental effects from inefficient input application pa seems to offer the greatest potential benefits where inputs are varied and cost is high field variability is high highvalued crops are grown and environmental effects especially to water resources must be reduced pa is foremost subfield management system that can specify rules for guiding input application based on past current or expected conditions pa may potentially do for agriculture what justintime production andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30630crs3 4 the department of defense recently made its gps signal accurate to 20 meters farmers who do not need greater accuracy than this will longer have to buy differential correction public provided national differential gps network is also expanding and should make the gps signal more widely available in the future as this network expands into new regions continuedshipment tracking technologies have essentially done for manufacturing managing temporal and spatial variability in the production process for more efficient decisions private companies have dominated pas technical development to date in contrast basic agricultural technological research has predominantl been public undertaking this difference may suggest changing role between public and private sectors in agricultural innovation for example the increasing importance for the role of professional crop specialists in pa could presage change in the traditional role of extension personnel and the need for computer knowledge and skilled data analysis suggests potential new demands on agricultural education and extension creating sitespecific gis databases through service contracts with input suppliers also raises issues about ownership and control of these databases pa also may contribute to new contractual arrangements through proprietary ownership of agricultu ral input systems eg pa data could become new part of existing proprietary seedherbicide packages this could have implications for current farm structure given pas potential environmental benefits there is precedent for public role in research that has little likely commercial benefits and is therefore less likely to be assumed by the private sector eg sensor development for environmental monitoring socioeconomic factors in adoption and use of pa technological costs and development trends farmers face significant start up costs before they can exploit the potential of pa to achieve longterm advantages much of the capital and labor costs of pa are in acquiring equipment and developing baseline data set these costs include yield monitoring crop scouting and soil testing over multiple growing seasons and learning how to use remote sensing technology gis data and vrt individuals may either buy this technology directly and learn how to use it or they may contract for various services with vendors including independent crop consultants and input suppliers most adopting farmers will likely purchase some hardware and develop some expertise and contract for other support services some illustrative equipment and service costs might include the following yield monitor for corn wheat or soybeans could cost 4000 7000 soil sampling has been estimated at 37 per acre considerably more if samples are deeper or taken more frequently and in smaller grids truckmounted computer system and gis software could add 3000 to the cost of pa system service costs including soil sampling yield monitoring crop scouting gps receiver and in some regions satellite signal subscription4 vrt controllers and fertilizer application additionalhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30630crs4 4 continued farmers who need more precise spatial accuracy may longer have to purchase satellite subscription fee 5 national research council precision agriculture in the 21st century geospatial and information technologies in crop management national academy of science press washington dc april 1997 6 weather is critical and largely uncontrollable variable that can alter the outcomes of pa system under the best of circumstances weather data nonetheless can become an important layer of information in giscost over uniform application rates have been estimated at 1326 for grower and 2501450 for dealer on per acre basis5 weather services international private vendor currently charges 57 per acre to subscribe to their basic weather service and 10 20 to obtain their integrated weather data packages6 digital soil maps based on grid sampling are generally expensive to acquire and some soil attribute data may require periodic updating soil grid sampling could become high annual expense but different sampling densities based on indicators such as yield monitoring data or soil attributes can reduce the costs of sampling where little variability exists or where information about variability of particular area in the field is of little benefit for example one of the most efficient uses for yield maps is to identify those areas where yields are significantly lower than the field average often the production problems in these areas can be readily identified and corrected leading to increased future revenue other sensorbased applications sometimes referred to as onthego sensing or local sensors are also becoming an important part of pa technology sensor mounted on machine or truck senses the field condition eg soil ph nitrogen content pest population soil compaction an onboard computer sends the data through an algorithm and realtime signal goes to vrt applicator also mounted on the machine to deliver precise application of fertilizer or pesticide soil nutrient sensors optical plant sensors pest population sensors and soil property sensors are currently in use research on other sensors is underway eg moisture density sensors and plant disease sensors accurately synchronizing sensor measurement with the desired input application however has proved somewhat problematic to date for example bulk spreader moving at 25 mph passes over approximately 37 feet each second making optimal accuracy difficult to achieve remote sensing technology is yet another technical development in pa for growers who need it remote sensing either from airplane or satellite platforms permits improved spatial temporal and spectral resolution compared to other sensing devices such as onthego sensors or grid sampling this technology could be very beneficial for decisions regarding irrigation pest and disease control etc that have to be made during the growing season also the potential for this technology to determine the cause size and location of subfield variation in plant vigor is increasing with developments in the new hyperspectral sensors some work is underway to develop sensors that detect nitrogen deficiency and water stress such data will improve the efficiency of professional crop scouts who can quickly find lowhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30630crs5 vigorstressed areas within large fields timely delivery of this information over the internet is now also possible research continues to improve yield monitors and vrt yield monitor is often the first piece of equipment pa growers acquire yield monitors allow producers to map yield variability these maps can then be used to assess changing production practices accurate measurement can be difficult as calibration can be challenge the fastest growing area of yield monitoring technology is currently in grainharvesting combines although there is research underway on monitors for other crops such as cotton root crops and fruits lack of yield monitors for highvalue crops eg fruits and vegetables is possibly barrier to adoption of pa techniques for some operations given the limits of current sensing calibration and the absence of universal standard of yield measurement the available grain sensing systems must be calibrated for each type of grain and for each type of machine finally relatively wide variety of commercially available vrt exists for liquid and dry chemical application for planting and for manure spreading most of these systems rely on electronically controlled hydraulic systems precision irrigation technologies are also beginning to be developed in drip and centerpivot irrigation systems again accuracy of application can be lower than desirable especially in systems that do not have the capacity to anticipate rate changes as the vrt moves across field or in the case of precision irrigation to control water application involving large number of nozzles pa technologies are evolving rapidly there is however little standardization of measurement among manufacturers companies are designing and developing their own equipment and proprietary software systems ongoing research is likely to establish what works better and at what cost in particular production areas and with particular crop systems producers who adopt pa are likely to encounter relatively steep learning curve with many of the gis software packages especially in collecting data that can be analyzed and translated into useful information for changing management practices in the field according to anecdotal information in the farm press and on various web sites learning costs can be expected to fall as adoption of pa spreads as equipment becomes more standardized as equipment calibration becomes more reliable and as research supports the value of different techniques and different data comprising particular giss socioecono mic aspects in adoption and diffusion of pa growers anticipated return on investment in pa technologies will most likely govern the decision to adopt pa techniques increased yields andor reduced input costs could generate significant net revenue gains to an individual farmer the more input intensive crops eg sugar beets vegetables potatoes cotton generally are more highly valued on per acre basis this suggests that growers planting these crops might see the greatest incentives to adopt pa techniques especially if they could reduce the costs of expensive inputs most adopters to date however appear to grow lowvalue bulk commodities eg corn soybeans and wheat which may be partly due to the early development of yield monitors for these crops researchers are studying the profitability of pa one of the more detailed economic reviews of pa adoption to date examined phosphate and potassiumhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30630crs6 7 lowenbergdeboer j and sm swinton economics of

survey results adoption rate of sitespecific crop management technologies among us corn growers modern agriculture 1 7fall 1998fertilizer applications on wheat potatoes and corn7 the authors concluded that when all costs were included including education and training pa was rarely profitable for the farm operations studied if other more costly inputs eg pesticides seed could be applied on sitespecific basis however the likelihood of profitability could increase although another study showed that profit actually decreased with an increase in the variability of input requirements8 if pa is adopted by more producers costs of training and education and the technologies themselves are likely to decrease finally at least one study has shown that variable rate application may not be the key factor in pa profitability9 rather this study showed that it could be profitable in some cases to use pa to determine the optimal uniform input application information on the adoption of pa is fragmentary and unsystematic adoption however is likely to vary across crops farming systems and geography because pa is not single technology or farming system each combinatio n of gis data and technologies has its own array of costs and benefits in comprehensive study of 950 corn growers in 16 states pa adopters tended to be younger fulltime operators better educated and currently using computers for business management than non adopters10 adopters also had less diverse operations higher debttoasset ratio and operated larger and more profitable farms total acres farmed acres harvested asset values return on equity and net income each were between 15 to 3 times larger for adopting farms over half the adopting farms had annual sales of 250000 or more less than 20 of nonadopting farms were of that size this suggests that pa may be used in higher percentage of total agricultural production than percentage of farms data cited earlier might indicate over half the adopters were in indiana illinois and iowa and overwhelmingly specialized in cash grain production two thirds of the nonadopters were located in the other 13 states in the study suggesting some geographic concentration in current adoption patterns socioeconomic models of adoption patterns suggest that farmers positioned to realize the greatest returns will more readily adopt new technolo gies this might mean that farmers who are currently not highly efficient in their management of inputs would find early adoption of pa most beneficial yet farmers who have adopted pa or who might be expected to adopt it in the future appear to be those who already use relatively sophisticated approach to input application and who would in comparison to less efficiently managed operations possibly realize fewer initial profit advantageshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30630crs7 11 bmps were implemented as requirements of the 1977 amendments to the clean water act 12 tweeten l the structure of

several studies of technological adoption have also noted the importance of the compatibility of an innovation with current practices that is the innovation complements existing practices rather than wholly replaces them at least over the short term adoption of pa for subfield management is refinement of good wholefield management since 1977 agricultural research and extension services have promoted best management practices bmps to growers for improved profitability and improved environmental practices eg soil conservation pesticide recordkeeping11 soil testing and crop scouting both longstanding bmps are also central to the success of pa adding smallarea soil grid sampling and integrating other data into gis for example are perhaps smaller incremental steps for growers already using bmps than for farmers who have not adopted bmps or who use bmps inconsistently some research has indicated that large farms have adopted bmps significantly more often than small farms12 growers who have never soil tested or never crop scouted might be expected to see in pa uniquely attractive set of practices that could in time significantly improve their operational efficiency over current practice13 yet these growers appear less likely to have adopted pa techniques to date and given the importance of prior bmp adoption may only slowly adopt pa in the future in statistical test of differences between pa adopters and nonadopters with respect to nutrient soil testing and crop scouting pa adopters had significantly higher levels of use with these bmps than did nonadopters14 differences in management and technical skills as well as initial costs of bmp adoption might help explain why some growers have adopted bmps and others have not these indicators suggest that adoption and diffusion of pa techniques may not be as straightforward as existing adoption models of agricultural technology might predict and further attest to the sitespecificity in growers decisions to adopt pa techniques for their cropland wouldbe adopters desiring to contract for pa services have found that vendors of these services are concentrated in potentially highdemand areas ie areas where large commercial operations predominate pa is also more likely to attract farmers who are already comfortable with computers and are not daunted by the information complexities of pa as the technology matures and as the socioeconomic profile of pas potential returns on investment become clearer however more growers are likely to consider at least some of the pa technologies either through direct purchase or perhaps more likely through contracting for pa services from private suppliers especially with growth in the private supply of pa expertise15 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30630crs8 15 continued qualifying to become certified crop consultants program administered by the american society of agronomy private consultants are likely to become an important means by which pa knowledge is transmitted 16 some studies of western sugar beet production have indicated that pa holds substantial promise in improving the efficiency of nitrogen application adding more nitrogen increases yield but lowers beet quality pa potentially offers the technical capacity to optimize the application for yield and quality 17 sommer je ra hoppe rc green and pj korb structural and financial characteristics of us farms 1995 20th annual family farm report to congress aib 746 ersusda december 1998individual farm returns on pa investment will vary by the management skills of operators by the biophysical properties of each field and by the interactive effects of altering various inputs based on the sitespecific database the limited data on economic returns showing mixed results is perhaps not unexpected given the difficulty of maintaining any consistency of the system between comparative sites even side byside farm comparisons reveal significant biophysical variability between fields and potential profitability of pa is highly correlated with the biophysical variability of the setting to which it is applied research could be located that has examined the economics of pa for an agroecological region for single production system or across all dimensions of production system16 the economic research available is based disproportionate ly on large operations with relatively lowvalued crops and inexpensive inputs variables that are perhaps less conducive to producing significant profit advantages under pa system research is currently underway on other production systems eg cotton fruits and vegetables forestry that will clarify the picture on returns on pa investment changes that might attract other growers to invest in pa include cooperative arrangements to share technology or training equipment leasing and standardization of pa technology the rate of adoption does not appear to be uniform among crop systems either farm press reports and regional agricultural meetings suggest that many adopters of yield monitors have been corn wheat and soybean growers trade press reports information reveal that adopters also include some florida tomato growers california vegetable grape and orange growers arkansas cotton growers massachusetts cranberry growers and northwestern foresters the variety of adoption rates among different crops may suggest the importance of examining pa adoption rates from cropspecific perspective or that the crop is less important than other variables in the decision to adopt for example some pa practitioners have stated that producers are using pa information to document yields on rented farmland which may be useful for negotiating new leases and equitably dividing up crop production on crop sharing arrangements pa also may be used for loan applications proving yield history for crop insurance and documenting losses for crop insurance purposes usda data indicate that among the computer users noted above about 64000 farms about

spatial and temporal variability of environmental quality new york wiley press 1997continuation of the initial phase of the adoption process18 it is however reasonable to regard pa as an extension of mechanization and an elaboration of existing chemicalbased agricultural practices two technological systems that researchers regard as encompassing significant scale economies and that have contributed to changes in farm size and the industrialization of the farm sector19 in that sense pa may be regarded more as an evolutionary technology reinforcing certain existing agricultural practices rather than as revolutionary one that holds the potential to radically alter existing production practices given its character as sitespecific set of practices pa in contrast to many earlier agricultural technologies seems likely to develop as customized systems specific to each producers operation even as the basic technologies become more standardized the particular pa package for each farm will be based on the biophysical variables that are being addressed the biophysical variability of cropland makes it likely that different farms will find different combinations of data in gis most useful soil map based on small area sampling for example is likely to provide more useful information to grower whose soil variability is high throughout field than it would to grower whose soils are more uniform similarly farm with more varied topography may find digital elevation modeling dem very useful while for another grower with level fields such information would add little or benefit to crop management decisions environmental aspects of precision agriculture pa is used within field boundaries but environmental issues in agriculture transcend these boundaries ecological and health implications of using chemical fertilizers soil fumigants herbicides and insecticides in large amounts are central targets of environmental reform farmers increasingly find themselves under pressure to improve their output efficiency while reducing the adverse environmental effects of necessary inputs proponents of pa have strongly emphasized its potential to significantly reduce these effects others however doubt that pa techniques can address many of the key factors that produce negative environmental outcomes20 there is little convincing evidence to date for either position fieldlevel studies do suggest that more accurate calibration of inputs can reduce overfertilization and excessive use of pesticides at the farm level to the extent that such reduction improves the environmental

to fall legally under the tmdl program as recent federal district court case in california continuedwatershed or regional scales may produce better evidence than fieldlevel studies about the environmental effects of pa but these studies will have to wait for wide spread adoption of pa moreover because environmental problems are not evenly distributed where pa is widely adopted becomes central to its potential success for reducing them it is possible that pa could produce less environmental improvement in commercialscale agriculture than individual field tests indicate growers who find they can reduce certain inputs could be offset by other growers who learn they are underfertilizing or using suboptimal levels of pesticides and decide to increase their inputs in assessing pas future potential for improving environmental quality the scale at which one examines pa becomes significant producers are motivated primarily by considerations of their own actions and their own costs those concerned primarily with what pa potentially offers in terms of environmental improvements are concerned with agricultural producers as an aggregate reduction in agricultures impact on water resources through more efficient application of fertilizers and improved drainage management could potentially become significant environmental benefit of pa controlling nonpoint runoff from us farms is considered to be the most significant water quality need according to epas nationwide survey21 water quality impairment from cropland sediment alone has been estimated to cause between 2 and 8 billion per year in damages across the country22 farms and ranches however have been largely exempt from most regulations governing water air and land that other industrial sectors must adhere to the

impaired waters including those impaired by nonpoint source pollution within the next 813 years recent agreement between epa and usda has extended this time to 15 years23 there is some uncertainty whether agricultural operations other than large confined animal enterprises legally fall under the tmdl requirement if it is determined that they do pa could potentially play significant role in

been based on the combination of voluntary participation and incentives to attract participants including various technical assistance and costsharing arrangements idling agricultural acreage has also been policy measure for reducing adverse environmental effects while limiting supplies of commodities however pesticide registration drainage for wetland modification protection of endangered species and pollution from large confinedanimal operations are four areas where some agricultural practices have been regulated25 pa has potential value for reducing the need for regulation in some situations by documentingmonitoring pesticide and fertilizer use and by identifying environmentally sensitive areas where reduced inputs may be appropriate each of these measures could play significant role in the development of sitespecific control programs where runoff is shown to be source of noncompli ance under the tmdl requirement noted above with heightened environmental awareness and increasing urbansuburban development also encroaching onto rural agricultural areas more farmers are likely to find themselves under public pressure to reduce the environmental effects of agricultural production especially those that adversely affect the quality of their neighbors lives and its impact on water resources the national research council also has recently recommended development of national strategy to combat nitrogen and phosphorus pollution in coastal waters after its research showed that synthetic fertilizers have contributed to more than 50 of the doubling of nitrogen and phosphorus pollution from 1960199026 there is evidence based on contingencyvaluation methods suggesting that in shifting from logic of maximizing output to one of reducing inputs farmers would accept some

uniform reduction in the use of inputs as noted above however growers may be willing to accept some tradeoffs in total output in return for reduction in adverse environmental impact research on this

purdue university of georgia oregon state university of minnesota university of arizona texas am university of missouri and north carolina state in 1996 the cooperative state research education and extension service csrees reported funding about 9 million to parelated research at land grant universities the coastal plain experiment station in georgia received 34 million between 1991 and 1993 to construct the national environmentally soundhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30630crs13 production agriculture laboratory where pa is major element of the research program the agricultural research service ars also invested 44 million in pa related research in 15 locations in 1995 according to the ars budget office the agency spent 204 million on pa from 1996 through 1999 for 2000 it has allocated 77 million for parelated research in addition the ars subtropical research laboratory in weslaco texas is the site of resource 21 project designed to launch four solarpowered satellites for remote sensing that will support pa this publicprivate venture is being developed under usda cooperative research and development agreement crada involving six partners and the ars other federal agencies conducting research and develop ment with pa applications include the department of energy eg idaho engineering laboratory and the national aeronautical and space administration eg landsat commercial remote sensing program at stennis space center it also should be noted that the us department of defense has quite unintentionally probably had the largest federal investment in pa with its launching and maintenance of the 24 earthorbiting satellites that comprise the gps congressional interest congressional interest in pa involves several issues including the role of public research and education pas potential effects on us farm structure and questions of data ownership and control role of public research and education inasmuch as pa is evolving largely under private auspices potential roles for the landgrant universities are unclear if pa is truly new paradigm for agricultural production as some observers believe the traditional role of extension agronomy for example may not be as wellsuited for the managerial demands that pa places on the grower as extension was for many previous agricultural innovations in addition some observers believe that the landgrant institutions are not wellequipped to provide the highly skilled data analysis that will be needed by farmers several landgrant universities however have begun research programs in pa see the list of websites in the bibliography and the university of californiadavis now offers minor in pa in its department of biological and agricultural engineering an increase in the number of private crop consultants in pa either as independent contractors or as employees of agroinput firms also may suggest changes in the traditional role of landgrant university research and extension more private crop consultants could make public education and extension programs for pa redundant on the other hand some farmers may perceive crop consultants with ties to agroinput firms to be less than objective in some of their managerial recommendations and may consider the perceived neutrality of landgrant extension agents and university researchers to be valuable asset landgrant researchers could help guide future pa developments regionally specific socioeconomic and environmental analyses will be necessary to gauge the potential of pa as it becomes more widely used these usually have been publiclysupported areas of research by landgrant scientists and extension personnel traditional models of agricultural research and extension services may not be adequate to some of the challenges of pa which is based on sitespecifichttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30630crs14 28 monsanto corporation currently developing pa technologies charges technology fee for the use of its roundup ready soybeans and bt corn proprietary genetically engineered seed this is new way of profiting from agricultural technology proprietary ownership of continuedcharacteristics most agricultural research by contrast generalizes from representative sample or experimental data to larger population extension personnel apply the validated research results to individual cases that model may be less useful to pa analysis than it was for earlier agricultural innovations grower needs to interpret the data from pa system so that the information can be used to make fieldlevel management decisions growers need to know how to integrate the information for precision application decisions when series of field characteristics eg soil quality disease pests weather assumes particular configuration traditional research and extension systems do not provide for this level of precision interpretation some landgrant education and training programs may opt out of providing pa extension education letting private crop consultants take over this role whereas others might opt to change their education and training programs to better reflect the specificity of parelated knowledge several midwestern 2year colleges have new pa education and training programs that could help provide publicly supported extension services to pa adopters graduates of these and other pa programs at 2year colleges in collaboration with traditional extension services might become significant public source of regional expertise in pa pas effects on farm structure some observers argue that smaller farms could gain from pa because they are often operated under tighter labor constraints where automation might enhance field monitoring capabilities especially if the operator is parttime producer other observers argue that net benefits of pa are greater for large farms and that the compara tive advantages of small farms for focusing on individual highvalue plants could be lost when larger producers gain an ability to do the same as discussed above there is evidence that pa exhibits bias favoring larger producers although profile of early adopters does suggest that the majority are large wellfinanced commercial operations if tendency toward scale bias does exist it could be like many technical innovations in agriculture that research has shown to have contributed to increasing the gap between large commercial operations and smaller operations given existing differences in computer and information management skills between typical large operators and smaller ones noted above pas data complexities could further widen this divide absence of viable public involvement in pa could have the effect of making it more likely that large farms benefit more from pa the private sector is more likely to put its major resources eg data analysis services vrt services in those areas where their returns are likely to be the highest that will probably mean for the near term in areas such as the northern central corn belt where nitrogen herbicides and phosphorus applications can be most significantly affected other effects on farm structure are also possible creation of proprietary seed chemicalpa packages for example also could conceivably increase costs to farmers or create conditions where contract farming arrangements become more common28 while larger better capitalized growers may find such contractualhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30630crs15 28 continued pa databases could confer similar advantages to firm 29 welsh rick the industrial reorganization of us agriculture an overview and background report policy studies report 6 henry wallace institute for alternative agriculture 1996arrangements attractive smaller farm operations that do not enter into these arrangements could be at disadvantage some research discussed above also suggests that older or less educated farmers may find the informatio n volume and computeruse skills that pa requires significant barrier this does not mean that pa necessarily forces older less educated farmers out of farming only that it may be an additional factor either separating them further from more financially successful growers or expediting their decision to exit farming limitedresource farmers including minority farmers most with annual gross sales under 25000 may also find the costs to adopt pa techniques prohibitive previous technological changes have contributed to changes in the structure of us agriculture socioeconomic research on pa will provide clearer picture of its potential for accelerating such change should new contracting arrangements develop between farmers and proprietary owners of farm inputs for example research on the dynamics of this process could better inform policy makers who wish to respond expanded efforts in public education for developing computer skills including bringing educational opportunities to farms could enhance the possibilities of smaller farmers adopting pa techniques existing funding mechanisms through csrees and ars may provide means for supporting regional research and extension should the demand for pa arise in areas unlikely to be serviced by private companies pa is developing in the context of number of significant changes affecting agriculture and the rural sector more generally29 given the adoption patterns observed for pa to date smaller operations especially those located in areas not dominated by larger commercial operations may find that their opportunities to participate in pa are limited the implications of underserving certain areas with pa services might become part of broader examination of changes in the structure of agriculture and the role of public policies in responding to these changes if for example the private sectors domination of pa development is part of more fundamental change in the way future agricultural innovation might progress how public policy might respond could become significant issue before congress data ownership and control arguably the most valuable commodity generated by pa is the data acquired to create sitespecific recommendations about particular fields with the large amount of data that will be collected intellectual property issues may emerge about data ownership storage access disposal and protection currently public institutions have more fully developed systems of privacy protecti on and disclosure than does the private sector increased contract production with proprietary control over production inputs and outputs and potential private sector domination of pa data systems could create conflict over who owns farmgenerated data and who may have or grant access to it growers groups have expressed some concern that without appropriate safeguards pa data could provide the means for monitoring farmers operation either by state agencies for compliancehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30630crs16 30 for more information on the legal basis of database protection see crs report 98902 intellectual property protection for noncreative databases 31 databases are protected as content industry within the information industry and are defined in article 2 as collections of other materials such as texts sounds images numbers facts or data world intellectual property organization draft treaty on intellectual property in respect of databases

2338 in steven wolf ed privatization of information and agricultural industrialization soil and water conservation society crc press 1998or by private firms for the creation of proprietary products moreover depending on how data controls develop information collected by contractor could be copyrighted or protected under trade secrets and sold to others even without the farmers permission farmers have expressed concern about being able to exert right over the intellectual property in some form databases such as those created for pa presumably could be protected under copyright law 17 usc 102 protection is granted by copyright law irrespective of the form or medium in which the data are embodied if the database exhibits original creative expression through the selection arrangement or coordination of the data elements copyright protection subsists in these facets of the database30 international law on intellectual property rights in databases is emerging that could conceivably impinge on issues of ownership and use of databases created for pa31 the traditional landgrant approach to research involved developing basic knowledge and technology at university and agricultural experiment stations and then disseminating it to farmers through the extension services with pa the farm itself becomes the source of valuable knowledge because this knowledge is valuable there is an incentive to convert it to intellectual property especially if the creator of the knowled ge is private firm the landgrant systems orientation was toward the creation of generalized knowledge pa is directed at the creation of information that is contextspecificdecisionfocused knowledge32 with pa technologies farmers can acquire data about their own operations bypassing the need to adapt agricultural experiment station research to their own operations this shift in how agricultural information is generated and used and the potential for someone other than the farmer owning and using the sitespecific knowledge may create intellectual property issues for agriculture that are similar to ones that the manufacturing and service sectors have addressed the 106th congress is currently considering legislation on intellectual property concerns in databases hr 354 collections of information antipiracy act would amend title 17 of the us code to provide broad copyright protection to databases and the facts that generate them last reported action on the bill was its discharge by the committee on commerce and placement on the union calendar calendar 212 on october 8 1999 although this bill does not directly address the sitespecific databases that would be created through pa techniques it would seem to offer additional protection to the creator of the database if the creator of the database is for example an employee of any agricultural business and not the grower it is unclearhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30630crs17 where ownership and use rights might lie because the source of the facts presumably protected is farmers cropland it is unclear whether the protection would lie with the facts in the database or the facts associated with the growers land on which the database is developed hr 1858 the consumer and investor access to information act is designed to promote electronic commerce by improving consumer access to electronic databases last reported action on the bill was its discharge by the committee on judiciary and placement on the union calendar calendar 213 on october 8 1999 it is narrower bill than hr 354 in that it would extend copyright protection to the databases but not to the facts in them as in hr 354 the kinds of databases created under pa are not specifically identified in the bill and there may be differences between pa databases and those that these bills are designed to protect if congress wishes to specify that farmers own and control sitespecific pa databases regardless of whether they are created by the farmer or by someone contracted by the farmer bill language might be added as noted above public institutions generally have stronger privacy rules than the private sector central storage and control over the data in public institution eg data warehousing at landgrant institution for example might provide mechanism to increase farmer control with appropriate protections eg owner identification such an arrangement might also provide publicly accessible database of regional adopters of pa techniques that would be useful to landgrant and other researchers as well as to extension personnel other public and publicprivate roles in pa enhancing potential societywide benefits such as improved environmental quality may be an appropriate public sector responsibility most sensor research in the private sector for example is currently targeted toward crop production and quality sensor development targeted to environmental measuring eg pesticide residue pollution loading indicator species detection holds potential benefits for society more generally if promoting adoption and diffusion of pa for its environmental potential becomes desirable different policies for agricultural production may give farmers different incentive to adopt farmers currently have little incentive to deal with most environmental externalities of agricultural production thus new technologies like pa that hold some promise for amelioratin g environmental effects may not be valued by producers as highly as having changes to policy that increase that value however policy incentives encouraging growers to raise its importance in their production decisions as is occurring for other industries may enhance their interest in adopting pa to reduce some of the adverse environmental impacts of contemporary agricultural production for example if buying and selling pollution credits already adopted in few areas of environmental regulation was authorized for agriculture that policy measure could rely on pa data to document crop herbicide and fertilizer applications in addition the environmental quality incentives program eqip might be used for costsharing the adoption of pa techniques where significant environmental improvement was possiblehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30630crs18 33 from more information see crs issue brief 10045 broadband internet access background and issuesrural areas generally have less of the advanced informat ion technology infrastructure that pa requires and incentives to meet these needs may be insufficient for private companies the cost of making differential correction of the gps signals varies depending on the location of reception towers some areas of the us receive this correction from public sources such as the us coast guard system individuals in other areas must purchase the differential correction from private vendors recently however the department of defense ended its selective availability sa of the gps signal which made the signal less accurate for civilian use and made it accurate for civilian use to approximately 20 meters additionally most rural areas lag in access to the effective communication systems and highspeed data connectivity that will become increasingly significant for adoption of pa these technologies include an advanced telephone system called digital subscrib er line dsl cable modem technology satellite technology and landbased wireless technologies33 the private sector may be less likely to invest in highspeed data connectivity in rural dispersed markets than in more urban or suburban areas where the cost to serve each user would be less the lack of broadband connectivity may also act as deterrent to some pa service providers conversely the availability of broadband connectivity may make those locations more attractive to some private providers of pa services changing pubic attitudes and an environmentally oriented marketplace may increase pressure on the agricultural sector to improve its environmental performance this has been happening in confinedanimal feeding operations but pressure to redesign some other agricultural systems is growing number of policy questions could arise if this pressure continued to grow for example could taxation be linked with environmental performance in revenue neutral ways for the agricultural sector could pa techniques play role in reducing environmental regulation and in switching to performancebased measures could research on coordinating pa with environmental policy facilitate this switch would increased public funding for basic research on parelated subjects be appropriate would publicprivate collaboration on precompetitiv pa research and development eg environmental sensors on new environmental performance incentives and on other marketbased mechanisms be appropriate for example might advances in remote sensing technology become useful tools in regulatory compliance for environmental quality conclusion research in the public and private sectors is currently developing and assessing pa technologies and documenting the benefits and costs of adopting pa in particular areas and for particular crops research on pas economic returns on its potential to reduce adverse environmental effects and on its adoption profile is hardly conclusive as results from parelated research are evaluated over the next few years proponents will probably be in much stronger position to advocate pas benefits small but active presence for pa in several landgrant universities and within ars may help to better define potential benefits of pa and clarify when where and to what degree these benefits may be achieved httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30630crs19 34 the emphasis in performancebased policies eg marketbased controls information management systems is on achieving measurable environmental results with flexible innovative policy tools versus prescriptive regulatory policy approach that tells company or community how to manage pollution problem see howes j d john and ra minard jr resolving the paradox of environmental protection issues in science and technology 144 summer 1998the private sector is likely to continue its research into many parelated areas especially those that offer market and profit potential including improving sensors to more precisely monitor crop production and crop quality characteristics standardizing and refining the calibration of vrt designing and developing new pa equipment for highervalue crops simplifying gis data acquisition and interpretation and refining remote sensing technologies the national research council report on pa see bibliography also noted the lack of what it called decision support systems research to quantify the complex relationship between the quantity of an input and yields within changing biophysical environment in growers field the basic knowledge to link precise data and precise recommendations is significant gap while traditional research and extension information models do not appear to provide well for pa interpretation at this point the area of decision support research may not be attractive to the private sector suggesting role for public research and extension private sector firms seem convinced that larger commercial growers in bulk commodities will continue to find adoption of some pa techniques or contracting for some pa services valuable growers in other crop systems as well as perhaps in livestock and rangeland management systems will likely draw from this experience to help make their own decisions on adoption especially if the technologies become less expensive if training and support are provided if early onfarm data collection and analysis suggests that an operation is good candidate for pa and if producers see their neighbors and friends adopting pa over the longer term agronomy experts generally believe that pa seems likely to develop viable presence in agriculture concentrated in some regions and for some crops pa seems likely to take many forms with some growers adopting individual techniques of pa and others adopting highly sophisticated pa systems large commercial operators younger on average with strong computer and technical skills seem likely to remain the modal pa adopters as further research on the economic and agronomic benefits emerge some farmers will continue to adopt and others will decide against it database ownership control and privacy concerns may cause some producers to bypass pa until these questions can be satisfactorily answered several broad issues could become the focus of congressional review including 1 intellectual property issues in pa databases 2 pas role in moving from regulationbased to performancebased environmental policy for agriculture34 and 3 pas role in the larger context of the changing industria l structure of us agriculture pa will increasingly become part of the technological fabric of changes and pressures facing farmers distributing its costs and benefits varyingly across the agricultural sector pa seems unlikely however to be single cause of anyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30630crs20 significant shift in agricultural productions dominant
