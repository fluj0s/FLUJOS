after receiving commen ts from about 6000 individuals public agencies and organizations2 the regulatory provisions on discipline were controversial especially those aspects re lating to short term

more detailed discussion of the 1997 statutory and regulatory changes as well as more recent proposed changes it is important to briefly examine the hi story of ideas discipline provisions4 history of ideas discipline procedures the manner in which children with disabilities can be disciplined may seem quite complex but the logic involved is mu ch more apparent when ideas history is examined idea was originally enacted in 1975 as the education for all handicapped children act pl 94142 th primary motive for its enactment was the fact that children with disabilities often faile d to receive an education or received an inappropriate education5 this lack of education ga ve rise to numerous judicial decisions notably parc v state of pennsylvania 343 fsupp 279 edpa 1972 and mills v board of education of the district of columbia 348 fsupp 866 ddc 1972 these decisions found cons titutional infirmities with the lack of education for children with disabilities when the states were providing education for children without disabilities as result the states were under considerable pressure to provide such services and they lobbied congress to assist them in enacting pl 94142 congress provided gr ants to the states to help pay for education for children with disabilities and also delineated specific requirements the states must follow in order to receive th federal funds these requirements did not contain discipline provision per but rather contained re quirement that if there is dispute between the school and the pare nts of child with disability the child stays put in his or her current educa tional placement until the dispute is resolved using the due process procedur set forth in the statute the concept of stay put was placed in the statute to help eliminat the then common discriminatory practice of expelling children with disabilities fro m school revised stay put provision remains as law in the current version of ideahttpwikileaksorgwikicrs9842crs3 6 484 us 305

years in 1988 the question of whether there was an implied exception to the stay put rule was presented to the supreme court in honig v doe 484 us 305 1988 honig involved emotionally disturbed children one of w hom had choked another student with sufficient force to leave abrasions on the childs neck and w ho had kicked out window while he was being escorted to the principals office the other child in the honig case had been involved in stealing extorting money and making lewd comments the school had sought expulsion but the supreme court di sagreed finding that congress very much meant to strip schools of the unilateral authority they had traditionally employed to exclude disabled students particularly emotionally disturbed students from school6 however the court observed that this holding did not leave educators hamstrungwhere student poses an immedi ate threat to the safety of others officials may temporarily suspend him or her for up to 10 school daysand in those cases in which the parents of truly dangerous child adamantly refuse to permit any change in placement the 10day respite gives school officials an opportunity to invoke the aid of the courts under sec tion 1415e2 which empowers courts to grant any appropriate relief7 this statement about the sc hools right to seek judicial relief has come to be know as honig injunction the supreme courts interpretation of idea in honig did not quell all concerns about discipline and children with disa bilities in 1994 congress amended ideas stay put provision to give schools the unilate ral authority to remove child with disability to an interim alternative educa tional setting if the child was determined to have brought firearm to school this pr ovision was expanded upon in the idea amendments of 1997 to include wea pons not just firearms and drugs the department of education had so received numerous questions from schools about discipline and in 1995 i ssued memorandum discussing numerous discipline issues including the use of manifestation determinations8 if school sought to suspend or expel child with disability for more than ten days the school must first make manifestation determina tion determination concerning whether the students misconduct was rela ted to his or her disability if the behavior was not related to the disability the school could suspend or expel for more than ten days but must continue to provide ducation services if the be havior was related to the disability the school must give notice of any recommended change in placement and if the parent objected the parent c ould invoke the stay put provision the department found that honig injunctions court orders to change the placement of child with disability were proper when school believed that maintaining the child in his or her current placement was substantially likely to result in injury to the student or others the concept of manifestation determination was placed in statutory language by pl 10517 similarl the new statutory language continues the regulatory interpretation that educa tional services cannot cease for children with disabilities even if they have been suspended or expelledhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs9842crs4 9 srept 10517 105th cong 1st sess 28 1997 hrept 10595 105th cong 1st sess 108 1997discipline provisions in the idea amendments of 1997 with the preceding background in mind the specific changes made by pl 105 17 will now be examined first however it should be emphasized that much of what congress intended to do was to codify exis ting law that was found in the regulations case law and policy guidance the changes that were made were among the most contentious in long and controversia l reauthorization the house and senate reports described the changes in general the committee recognizes that sc hool safety is important to educators and parents there has been considerable debate and concern about both if and how those few children with disabilities who affect the school safety of peers teachers and themselves may be disciplin ed when they engage in behavior that jeopardizes such safety in addition the committee is aware of the perception of lack of parity when making decisi ons about disciplining children with and without disabilities who violate the same school rule or code of conduct by adding new section 615k to idea the committee has attempted to strike careful balance between the leas duty to ensure that school environments are safe and conducive to learning fo r all children including children with disabilities and the leas continuing ob ligation to ensure that children with disabilities receive free appropriate public education thus drawing on testimony experience and common sense the committee has placed specific and comprehensive guidelines on the matter of disciplining childre n with disabilities in this section9 generally child with disability is not immune from disciplinary procedures however these procedures are not identical to those for children without disabilities if child with disability commits an action that would be subject to discipline school personnel have veral options these include suspension for up to ten days placement in an interim alternativ education setting for up to forty five days for situations invol ving weapons or drugs and asking hearing officer to order child be placed in an interim alternative educational setting for up to forty five days if it is demonstrated that the child is substantially likely to injure himself or others in his current placement conducting manifesta tion determination re view to determine whether there is link between the childs disability and the misbehavior if the childs behavi or is not manifestation of disability long term disciplinary action such as expulsion may occur except that educational services may not ceasehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs9842crs5 10 34 cfr 300520a1 11 34 cfr 300121d2 12 34 cfr

practice the supreme court in honig v doe supra had allowed tenda suspensions under the prior law however the new statutory language does not state whether the ten days are ten days for the school year or ten consecutive days and this became point of controversy in the proposed regulations the final regulations responded to this criticism with compromise school pe rsonnel may order the removal of child with disability from the childs current placement for not more than ten consecutive school days for an violation of school rules to th extent that th same removal would be applied to ch ildren without disabilities10 in addition the school may remove child with disability for peri ods of not more than ten consecutive school days in the same school year for other incidents of misconduct as long as these removals do not constitute change in placement as described in 300519b section 300519b states that change in pl acement occurs if the child is subjected to series of removals that constitute pattern because they cumulate to more than 10 school days in school year and because of factors such as the length of each removal the total amount of time the child is removed and the proximity of the removals to one another for suspensions after suspensions for the first ten days of the school year the final regulations state that schools must pr ovide services to the extent necessary to enable the child to appropriately progress in the general curriculum and meet the childs iep individualized educational placement goals11 if the child is removed for not more than ten consecutive days and there is not change in placement the school personnel make the termination of which services are necessary12 if there is change in placement certain obligations are

efforts to minimize the risk of harm in the childs current placement determine that the interim lternative educational setting has been selected so as to enable the child to continue to participate in

department of education regulations reiterate the continuedthe behavior that led to the disciplinary ac tion so that the behavior does not reoccur19 manifestation dete rmination review as was noted previously the concep t of manifestation determination originated in policy interpretations of id ea by the department of education the theory is that when behavior even inappropriate behavior is caused by disability the response of school must be different that when the beha vior is not related to the disability pl 10517 codifies this requi rement by mandating th at determination regarding the relationship between childs disability and his or her behavior must be made by the iep team in certain circ umstances these circumstances as specified in the statute are when school personnel c ontemplate ordering change in placement for disciplinary reasons to an interim alternative educational setting for not more than fortyfive days when hearing officer c ontemplates ordering change in placement for disciplinary reasons or if disciplin ary action involving change in placement of more than ten days is contemplated for child with disability who has engaged in any other behavior that has violat ed schools rule or conduct of conduct20 if the childs behavior is related to his or her disability the school may review the childs placement and if necessary in itiate change in the childs placement the school also has the option of suspending the child for ten school days or less and seeking honig injunction if the childs behavior is not related to his or her disability the relevant disciplinary procedures that are applicab to children wit hout disabilities may be applied to the child in the same manner in which they would be applied to children without disabilities except that free appr opriate public educa tion must be made available to the child even if he or she is expelled or suspended parents have right to request hearing if they disagree with the determination that the childs behavior was not manifestation of the childs disability or with any decision concerning placement in these cases there shall be an expedited hearing21 in order to find that childs behavior was not related to his or her disability the iep team must consider all relevant information and must make three determinations first the iep team must find that in rela tion to the behavior in question the childs iep and placement were appropriate and the special education services and behavior intervention strategies were provided according to the childs iep and placement second the iep team must find that the ch ilds disability did not impair the childs ability to understand the impact and conse quences of the behavior subject to disciplinary action finally the iep team must find that the childs disability did not impair the ability of the child to control the behavior subject to the disciplinary action22httpwikileaksorgwikicrs9842crs8 22 continued statutory language regarding

several judicial decisions and the fourth circu it court of appeals found that the plain language of idea did not condition the receipt of idea funds on the continued provision of educational services to expelled children with disabilities and that in order for congress to place conditions on the states receipt of federal funds congress must do so clearly and unambiguously30 the clear signal sent to congress by the courts was that if congress wanted to avoid judicial c ontroversies and impose requirement that educati onal services cannot cease for children with disabilities it should amend the statute to do so c ongress responded by adding the qualifying phrase to the fape requirement in pl 10517 indicating that fape extends to children with disabilities who have been suspended or expelled the department of educati ons final regulations addr essed the meaning of the new fape language when read in connec tion with the rule on ten day suspensions the final regulations interpreted the statute as not requiring serv ices during the first ten days child is removed from school31 but for subsequent suspensions schools are required to provide certain services32 children who are not yet eligib for special education and related services one of the situations congress sought to address during the reauthorization concerned children who were the subject of disciplinary ac tion and who alleged after the action occurred that they were disabled and thus entitled to the protections of idea33 pl 10517 allows such child to ssert the protections of idea if the local educational agency had knowledge that the child was child with disability before the behavior that precipitated the disciplinary action occurred the law specifically states that the lea is deemed to have such knowledge if the parent of the child has expressed concern in writing unless the parent is illiterate or has disability that prevents such expression to personnel of the agency that the child is in need of special education and re lated services the behavior or performance of the child demonstrates the need for such serviceshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs9842crs10 34 section 615k8a and b 35 34 cfr 300527b4 36 see

were casual hallway comments in the final regulations the department of education stated that this concern had to be expressed to the director of special education or to other pe rsonnel in accordance with the agencys established child find or speci education referral system35 law enforcement and judicial entities prior judicial decisions also gave rise to the issue of when children with disabilities could be referred to law enforcement officials36 pl 10517 specifically states that nothing in part b of idea sh all be construed to prohibit an agency from reporting crime committed by child with disability to appropriate authorities or to prevent state law enforcement and judicial authorities from exercising their responsibilities37 transfer of discip linary information the idea amendments of 1997 also provi for the transfer of disciplinary information on child with disability since it was felt that there was an increased possibility of violence when local school system was not adequately informed about the childs past the amendm ents specifically allowed state at its discretion to require local educational agency to include statement of any current or previous disciplinary actions that have been taken against child with disability in the records of the child the statement can in clude description of the behavior the child engaged in description of the disc iplinary action taken nd other information that is relevant to the safety of the child and other individuals this information can be transmitted to the same extent that such information would be

eligible for special education and related services and who has engaged in behavior that violated any rule or code of conduct of the local educational agency may seek the protections of idea if the local educational agency had knowledge that the child was child with disability before the behavior that precipitated the disciplinary action occurred the current law sets forth certain situati ons where local educational agency shall be deemed to have knowledge that child is child with disability the house and senate bills contain simila r provisions however the house bill requires the teacher or school personnel to expre ss concern in writing about th behavior or performance of the child to the director of special education or other pe rsonnel while the senate bill requires that the teacher or school pe rsonnel express concer n about pattern of behavior demonstrated by the child to th director of special education or other administrative personnel the senate bill but not the h
