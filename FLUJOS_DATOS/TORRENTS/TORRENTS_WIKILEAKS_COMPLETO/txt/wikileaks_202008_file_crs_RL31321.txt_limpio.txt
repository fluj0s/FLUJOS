on welfare march 7 2002 linda levine specialist in labor economics domestic social policy division congressional research service the library of congress the economic status of noncustodial fathers of children on welfare summary since its creation in the 1996 welfare reform law goal of the temporary assistance for needy families tanf block grant has been to end the dependence of poor families on government the means chiefly used to achieve the objective has been to encourage adult beneficiaries primarily single mothers to obtain jobs second means the promotion of marriage thus far has received less emphasis and fewer funds more attention also has been directed toward achieving the tanf programs goal of reducing welfare dependency than toward its objectives related to family structure reducing the incidence of outofwedlock births and the formation or maintenance of twoparent families in light of the substantial decline in tanfs caseload due to poor mothers having successfully obtained jobs the familyrelated elements of the tanf program could well be the subject of discussion during its reauthorization this year one reason that has been offered for the shift up to the 1990s in the structure of families with children toward being headed by women is that the stereotypical noncustodial father is not good candidate for marriage on economic grounds ie he cannot consistently provide paycheck adequate for sustaining family the labor market deficiencies that form the popular image of nonresident fathers also mean they might be unable to make the child support payments that would help to achieve tanfs objective of decreasing welfare dependency in order to fashion appropriate policies aimed at noncustodial fathers however one would want to know whether the anecdotal portrait is accurate or whether they are diverse group with some currently capable of financially supporting children living apart from them and others currently able to contribute little if anything to the economic wellbeing of their children residing elsewhere far more is known about the characteristics of welfare mothers than about those of the fathers of their children in part because of the difficulty entailed in identifying the latter the few recently available studies have shortcomings eg small samples drawn from one or few geographic areas or proxies for the men of interest with this caveat in mind the following tentative picture emerges of noncustodial fathers of children receiving welfare benefits they often are unmarried relatively young and disproportionately black large minority do not have high school diploma which could partly account for their weak performance in the labor market eg less than fullyear employment and high unemployment rate the possession of criminal records and their comparatively poor health also likely create problems for them in getting or keeping jobs nonresident fathers of poor children tend to be poor as well although their earnings could grow subsequent to the time of childbirth looking at nonresident fathers in general the vast majority are not poor and are not living in families with povertylevel income although the great majority of nonresident fathers who make child support payments are not poor not all nonpoor nonresident fathers contribute to the financial wellbeing of their offspring despite the comparatively disadvantaged circumstances of poor nonresident fathers it appears that slight majority provide economic support to their children living apart from them contents tanf and family

status of noncustodial fathers of children on welfare since its creation in the 1996 welfare reform law goal of the temporary assistance for needy families tanf block grant has been to end the dependence of poor families on government the means chiefly used to achieve the objective has been to encourage adult beneficiaries primarily single mothers to obtain jobs there is widespread agreement that the fortuitous coincidence of robust economy and the imposition of work requirement on custodial parents in tanf families brought about substantial reduction in the programs caseload whether the jobs that former tanf recipients typically have obtained can make their families totally selfsufficient and whether they will be able to keep those jobs during period of slowed economic growth is less universally agreed upon tanf and family structure the tanf law specifies means other than work to attain the goal of ending welfare dependency namely marriage the encouragement of marriage could help to achieve second objective of the tanf program reducing the incidence of outof wedlock births third statutory goal also relates to family structure the formation as well as the maintenance of twoparent families these families include the traditional husbandwife combination and separated divorced or nevermarried parents whether they are cohabiting or living apart states thus have designed initiatives to encourage nonresident parents1 typically fathers to become more actively involved in their childrens lives to provide these fathers with employment services and to offer both parents social services eg family counseling thus far in tanfs existence less emphasis and fewer funds have gone toward changing family structure than toward reducing welfare dependency by promoting work2 the familyrelated elements of the tanf program could well be the subject of discussion during its reauthorization in 2002 1 the terms noncustodial and nonresident fathers are used interchangeably in this report 2 crs report rl31170 welfare reform tanf provisions related to marriage and two parent families by gene falk and jill tauber note fatherhood initiatives may be funded from nontanf sources for more information see crs report rl31025 fatherhood initiatives connecting fathers to their children by carmen solomonfears crs2 one reason that has been offered for the shift up to the 1990s in the structure of families with children under age 18 toward being headed by women3 is that the stereotypical noncustodial father is not good candidate for marriage on economic grounds in other words he cannot consistently provide paycheck that his partner considers adequate for sustaining family4 research suggests that improving the employment prospects of noncustodial fathers whose children receive welfare would contribute to the attainment of tanfs family formation goal5 and that greater father involvement in the lives of their nonmarital children might help to raise the mens earnings level6 the low earnings capacity and unstable work history that forms the popular image of nonresident fathers also is offered as an explanation for their sometime failure to pay child support while some noncustodial fathers likely are financially able to provide child support in part or in full and thereby to help achieve tanfs objective of reduced dependence on government the labor market deficiencies ascribed to other eg poor noncustodial fathers calls into question their ability to so for these reasons some policymakers have argued that the reauthorization of tanf offers an opportunity for government to place more emphasis on assisting the latter group of nonresident fathers with children on welfare eg by increasing their access to job placement and training services given the likely interest among members of congress in noncustodial fathers whose children are tanf beneficiaries this report attempts to provide an accurate statistical portrait of these men shortcomings in the available data make the 3 according to the us bureau of the census americas families and living arrangements march 2000 current population reports series p20537 and earlier reports motheronly families accounted for 63 of families with children under age 18 in 1950 82 in 1960 103 in 1970 176 in 1980 204 in 1990 and 219 in 2000 it appears from the annual data for the 1990s that the share of families headed by mothers may have stabilized at slightly more than onefifth 4 edin kathryn few good men why poor mothers dont marry or remarry the american prospect

prworas fourth goal family formation in fragile families center for research on child wellbeing working paper 0023ff recent employment of their childrens fathers greatly increased the odds that unwed lowincome mothers would form some sort of family unit however the poor job prospects of some single fathers appears to be just one factor that has contributed to the change in the nations family structure others include the effect of welfare and of child support policies according to wendy siglerushton and irwin garfinkel welfare child support and labor markets are they related to father involvement center for research on child wellbeing working paper 0118 most analyses estimate the impact on marriage of each of the three variables to be small neither the labor market opportunities of men or women nor welfare or child support policies has changed enough to fully account for the large changes in us family structure researchers may yet demonstrate however that taken together changes in all these factors explain large proportion of the change 6 lerman robert and elaine sorensen father involvement with their nonmarital children patterns determinants and effects on their earnings marriage and family review v 29 23 2000 crs3 development of such portrait difficult although nonresident fathers are identified in some large nationwide surveys evidence strongly indicates that nonresident fathers are underrepresented because they fail to report themselves as such7 they disproportionately belong to population groups that are undercounted in the decennial census eg young black men8 and the surveys themselves exclude the institutionalized population eg persons living in prisons or in military barracks some researchers have estimated the number of misclassified undercounted and uncounted nonresident fathers to better approximate the total size of the group and then inferred the socioeconomic characteristics of those missed to develop clearer picture of all noncustodial fathers9 unfortunately the figures available from nationally representative surveys typically pertain to nonresident fathers regardless of whether their children receive benefits through the tanf program or its predecessor the aid to families with dependent children program afdc based on the principle of assortative mating ie the inclination of individuals to select like partners in terms of schooling raceethnicity age and other characteristics analysts who utilize these surveys have sometimes equated young lowincome or unwed fathers with noncustodial fathers of children on welfare10 data specifically on noncustodial fathers whose children receive public assistance are scanty and they too have shortcomings including derivation from very small samples in addition statistics on these men sometimes are gathered by questioning custodial mothers who might have limited contact with and knowledge about their childrens fathers in those cases in which the fathers are respondents the results may not be generalizable to all nonresident fathers of children receiving welfare because only noncustodial fathers who live in few geographic areas who are in training programs or who are identified through paternity establishment procedures are queried nonetheless the following picture of these fathers emerges from the best latest available data sources 7 in response to questions in various surveys men less often say they fathered children living elsewhere than women say they have children at home whose fathers live elsewhere 8 the census counts of subpopulations are used to calculate survey weights 9 see for example garfinkel irwin with sara s mclanahan and thomas l hanson patchwork portrait of nonresident fathers in garfinkel irwin with sara s

for research on child wellbeing working paper 9831 crs4 statistical picture demographic characteristics the assumption that the characteristics of noncustodial fathers of children on welfare are similar to those of their partners appears to be valid in number of respects majority of the fathers eligible for the parents fair share demonstration ie underemployed or unemployed noncustodial fathers who had child support orders in place but were not making timely payments for children receiving afdc benefits were unmarried relatively young and disproportionately black or hispanic11 the noncustodial fathers of afdc children display number of demographic characteristics that likely make it difficult for them to obtain job particularly good job almost onehalf of the men in the demonstrations control group ie those not provided services did not have high school diploma or general equivalency diploma ged which puts them at great disadvantage as educational attainment and the unemployment rate are inversely related12 moreover the average earnings of male workers in 2000 who did not have high school diploma or ged was 21639 or just twothirds the earnings of male high school graduates 32020 and the opportunity for relatively lowskilled men to obtain comparatively highpaying jobs has dwindled over time13 almost 7 out of 10 of the fair share demonstration fathers also reported that they had at some time been convicted of criminal offense as shown in table 1 large minority had recently been arrested the possession of criminal records might further contribute to the employment problems of noncustodial fathers as firms could well be reluctant to hire former inmates in addition time spent in jail might erode the skills of these men and might lessen their time spent accumulating the kind of work experience that leads to higher earnings 11 martinez john m and cynthia miller working and earning the impact of parents fair share on lowincome fathers employment manpower demonstration research corporation october 2000 hereafter cited as martinez and miller working and earning note the parents fair share demonstration ran from march 1994 to june 1996 and was conducted in seven urban areas across the united states through job training and placement services among other things the demonstration was meant to raise the earnings and child support payments of unemployed noncustodial parents usually fathers with children receiving afdc benefits and to increase the mens involvement in their childrens lives 12 in 2001 according to the us bureau of labor statistics men in the civilian noninstitutional population age 25 or over who lacked high school degree or the equivalent had an unemployment rate of 65 just by obtaining high school degree alone the share of men in the labor force without jobs dropped to 43 the unemployment rate fell still further for men with associates degrees 31 male college graduates had an unemployment rate of just 22 in

demonstration research corporation october 2000 note the data relate to 261 of the fathers and largely were based on their responses to the noncustodial parent survey which was administered 12 months after random assignment to the treatment or control group the survey covered random sample of fathers at each of the seven sites who entered the demonstration between october 1995 and february 1996 and had response rate of 78 another factor that might hurt the job prospects of noncustodial fathers with children receiving welfare concerns the stability of their living arrangements it appears that they often move from one place to another sometimes they are homeless see table 1 their lack of permanent address could make it difficult for prospective employers to contact them and could make them feel uncomfortable about even applying for jobs frequent moves also could reduce the fathers chance of developing social networks that might inform them of job openings where friends are employed14 employment status despite possessing demographic characteristics that could impede their ability to get and keep job 70 of demonstration fathers responded that they worked in the year after assignment

of young men in the civilian noninstitutional population who were employed in the mid 14 martinez and miller working and earning 15 the discrepancy between the two sources could exist because survey respondents might fail to remember brief periods of employment or because fathers might underreport employment if they thought their answers would affect child support collection efforts crs7 1990s 76316 one explanation for this perhaps unexpected result is that the strength of the 1990s economic expansion could have enabled some of these men to overcome longstanding labor market handicaps and obtain jobs just as happened with many of their partners who had been on the afdc rolls there appears to be positive relationship between noncustodial fathers employment status educational attainment and economic support for his offspring among the young fathers of nonmarital children in the afdc program in three cities camden and newark new jersey and the south side of chicago whose employment status was known to their partners those with jobs were significantly more likely to provide monetary support in addition the higher the fathers educational attainment the greater the likelihood he gave financial support possibly the higher paying jobs that fathers with additional years of schooling typically are able to obtain led them to conclude that they could afford to maintain their own standard of living and make support payments the researchers estimated that if all the young unmarried fathers of afdc children in their analysis had completed high school and were employed instead of lacking high school degree and job the share that provided monetary support for their offspring would have been substantially larger ie 40 rather than 19 if all the fathers had graduated from high school but nonetheless lacked jobs their probability of providing financial support rose to much lesser extent ie to 24 from 1917 another analysis which similarly estimated that the likelihood of noncustodial fathers making child support payments plummets if they did not work at all also found that the number of weeks worked increases the probability of nonresident fathers paying child support18 16 calculated by crs for 1634 year old males from us bureau of labor statistics data for 1995 17 rangarajan anu and philip gleason young unwed fathers of afdc children do they provide

unless indicated otherwise the sample size 261 sample size for this response 180 b sample size for this response 46 crs9 despite the previously mentioned similarity in employment rates the work experience of nonresident fathers could differ from those of other young men noncustodial fathers might for example move from one shortterm job to another or experience lengthy spells of unemployment between jobs indeed unmarried fathers of recently born children who had jobs during 12month period in the late 1990s did not work consistently they averaged just 385 weeks of employment according to data from seven of the cities in the fragile families and child wellbeing study19 interestingly as shown in table 3 the number of weeks worked on average by cohabiting fathers was significantly more than those of fathers who were romantically involved with their partners but living apart from them and their children 396 and 363 weeks respectively however married fathers who were interviewed as comparison group had even steadier employment than cohabiting fathers 463 and 396 weeks respectively the relationship between marriage and employment stability might mean that men who wed possess labor market characteristics superior to those of other men or that marriage itself has positive independent effect on those who wed eg provides motivation20 many of the noncustodial fathers of afdc children in the parents fair share demonstration who were not working at the time of the survey said they were looking for jobs 639 as shown in table 2 of those who were not searching for jobs almost half reported being unable to work either because they were illdisabled 247 or because they were in jail 239 the fragile families study found that unmarried fathers of newborns were twice as likely as married fathers of newborns to have physical or psychological conditions that interfered with their ability to work which could partly explain the fewer weeks worked by unwed fathers21 19 rich lauren

minority 375 earned just 5000 or less see table 2 similar share of unmarried fathers of newborns in the fragile families study who were employed during the late 1990s earned less than 9000 see table 3 the average earnings of the unwed fathers in the fragile families study were almost twice as high at 16258 as those of demonstration fathers assigned to the control group part of the disparity could be due to differences between the two surveys samples 46 of the partners of unmarried fathers in the fragile families study received public assistance compared to all those in the parents fair share demonstration and 44 of the unwed fathers in the fragile families study were cohabiting with their partners while 25 of demonstration fathers were living with partners or spouses table 3 employment

to lesser degree but nonetheless doubled going from an average of 10161 to 20576 in the 7 years after paternity action22 because the study omitted noncustodial fathers who did not file tax returns eg the more economically disadvantaged and because it is limited to one state the fathers income growth patterns could differ from results based upon more representative sample indeed another analysis based upon nationally representative sample of youths found that the earnings of unwed fathers stagnated over 4year period those 22 phillips elizabeth and irwin garfinkel income growth among nonresident fathers evidence from wisconsin demography may 1993 v 30 2 crs12 young unwed fathers who married during the 4year period experienced marked increase in earnings however which suggests that there may be something about unwed fatherhood status per that hampers earnings growth23 earnings based solely on the participation of noncustodial fathers in the formal economy also could understate their economic circumstances as sizeable minority 278 reported in the fragile families study that they also worked in the underground economy24 work in the informal economy raised the average earnings of unwed fathers who worked in both sectors by 20 to 19416 3293 earned in the informal sector 16122 in the formal sector while some might interpret this finding to mean that nonresident fathers are able to pay additional child support others might conclude that the considerable share who work in the underground economy reflects their precarious economic situation the researcher estimated that fathers with less than high school education who drink substantial quantity of alcohol and who report any drug use are more likely than other fathers to work in the underground economy which they might do to compensate for the difficulty they have getting and keeping jobs in the formal sector25 earningsincome estimates from several studies of noncustodial fathers fall between 11071 and 26441 in 1998 dollars the studies covered nonresident fathers of afdc children young nonresident fathers divorcedseparated nonresident fathers and all nonresident fathers as reported in small samples covering one area or in nationally representative surveys the average annual earnings of the fathers in these 15 studies were 1753326 the range of earningsincome within the population of nonresident fathers highlights the diversity of the group and suggests the use of only its poorest members as proxy for those whose children are dependent on government assistance in short poor children have poor fathers27 although studies may have found that the average earningsincome of noncustodial fathers typically exceeds the poverty level and thus they could conceivably be candidates for marriage or they could afford to pay child support at least some of these fathers appear to have too few funds to adequately sustain themselves based on crs analysis of data from the 1999 round of the national survey of americas families which is nationally representative sample of the civilian 23 lerman and ooms young unwed fathers 24 the analysis broadly defined the underground economy to cover legal quasilegal

add to more than 100 because hispanics can be of any race c thirtyfive or more hours per week among employed noncustodial fathers the average annual earnings of poor men were 4221 while those of nonpoor men were 34967 in 1998 partial explanation for the lower average earnings of poor as against nonpoor nonresident fathers is that the former more often are employed in typically lowwage occupations eg as laborers in addition poor nonresident fathers generally work fewer weeks in year compared to nonpoor fathers ie an average of 299 versus 486 weeks respectively in 1998 they also are more frequently employed parttime compared to nonpoor fathers ie 360 and 35 respectively worked fewer than 35 hours per week in 1998 the less than fullyear fulltime employment pattern that is more typical of poor than nonpoor noncustodial fathers might be partly related to health status 271 of poor as opposed to 99 of nonpoor nonresident fathers reported having health condition that limited the kind or amount of work they could perform and among poor noncustodial fathers who were not working or not seeking work 611 said they were illdisabled and unable to work while this was true for just 41 of their nonpoor counterparts limiting the analysis to members of the labor force ie those working or seeking work the unemployment rate of poor nonresident fathers was 204 in 1999 or almost five times the rate of the nonpoor group 44 this is in part crs16 reflection of the typically lower educational attainment of poor noncustodial fathers and the inverse relationship between schooling level and unemployment30 according to the crs analysis most nonresident fathers who contributed financially to their children under age 18 who were living apart from them were not poor 831 despite the labor market handicaps reported by poor noncustodial fathers 567 provided economic support alternatively 433 of fathers who were impoverished based on their personal earnings did not make child support payments although many more nonpoor than poor nonresident fathers provided financial support 178 of the nonpoor group did not contribute to the financial wellbeing of their children who were living away from them it is numbers like these that have prompted some observers 1 to distinguish between noncustodial fathers labeling some deadbeats and others deadbroke or turnips as in youcantgetblood fromaturnip and 2 to recommend that the two groups be the focus of different policies in order to reduce the welfare dependency of their former partners and offspring31 30 see footnote 12 31 mincy
