consistently expressed its grave concern over the humanitarian consequences and legal implications of the practice by the united states us authorities of holding persons in undisclosed deten tion in the context of the fight against terrorism1in particular the icrc has under scored the risk of illtreatment the lack of contact with the outside world as result of being held incommunicado the lack of legal framework and the direct effects of such treatment and conditions on the persons held in undisclosed detention and on their families the icrcmade its first written interventions to the us authorities in 2002 request ing information on the whereabouts of persons allegedly held under us authority in the context of the fight against terrorism since then it has made regular written and oral interventions to the us authorities on the issue of undisclosed detention see annex 2 in particular the icrc transmitted two reports on undisclosed detention on 18 november 2004 and 18april 2006 respectively which consolidated the information previously transmitted2and included more recent allegations of undisclosed locations hidden detainees and third country detention both reports annexed nonexhaustive nominal list of persons allegedly held in undisclosed detention by the us authorities3 despite repeated requests at various levels of the us government usg the icrc has not received response to most of these written interventions the main written response by the us authorities is the note verbale of 8june 2005 which responds to three earlier written interventions4the us authorities have never responded to the two icrc consolidated reports on 6september 2006 president bush publicly announced that fourteen high value detainees had been transferred from the high value detainee program run by the central intelligence agency hereafter cia detention program to the custody of the depart ment of defense in guantanamo bay internment facility hereafter guantanamo the fourteen detainees hereafter the fourteen were reportedly held in the ciadeten tion program from the time of their arrest or shortly thereafter until their arrival in guantanamo5throughout their time in cia custodywhich ranges from 16months to almost four and half yearsthese persons were held in undisclosed detention prior to this public announcement the icrc had never been informed by the us authorities of the existence of the cia detention program nor of the presence in us custody of the fourteen this is despite the fact that thirteen of the fourteen had been included in the abovementioned icrc written requests to the us authorities concern ing undisclosed detention the first of which were made in january 20036the remaining detainee was not known to the icrc the icrc was granted access to the fourteen in guantanamo and met with each of them in private for the first time from 6to 11october 2006 the icrc regards the confirmation of the present whereabouts of the fourteen by the us authorities and the subsequent access granted to the icrc as positive steps however it deplores the fact that these persons wer eheld in undisclosed detention 3during prolonged period by the us authorities and the conditions of detention and treatment to which they were subjected during that time it is also gravely concerned by the lack of information provided to the icrc regarding their fate despite regular and repeated requests the icrc recognizes the right of the us authorities to take measures to address legitimate security concerns including the detention and interrogation of individuals suspected of posing threat to national security however the icrc believes that the us can achieve these objectives while respecting its obligations and historical commit ment to respect international law the aim of the present report is to provide description of the treatment and mate rial conditions of detention of the fourteen during the period they were held in the cia detention program as reported to the icrc during its private interviews with these persons section one reports in detail the main elements of the cia detention pro gram including arrest and transfers incommunicado detention and other conditions and treatment in particular during the initial stages of interrogation section two out lines the conditions of detention and treatment in the later stages section three siders the provision of health care and the role of medical staff during the entire period of undisclosed detention section four details the legal aspects related to undisclosed detention section five discusses the issue of the persons other than the fourteen who passed through the cia detention program and finally section six addresses the issue of future use of the cia detention program aseparate icrc report has been transmitted to the department of defense regarding the material conditions and treatment of the fourteen since their arrival in guantanamo7 1main elements of the cia detention program following the transfer of the fourteen from cia custody to the custody of the depar t ment of defense in guantanamo in september 2006 the icrc met with each of these persons in private fr om 6to 11october and fr om 4to 14december 2006 the infor ma tion provided in this r eport isbased on the information gathered during those interviews to the extent that each detainee agreed for it to be transmitted to the authorities the fourteen who are identified individually below described being subjected in particular during the early stages of their detention lasting from some days up to sev eral months to harsh regime employing combination of physical and psychological illtreatment with the aim of obtaining compliance and extracting information this regime began soon after arrest and included transfers of detainees to multiple locations maintenance of the detainees in continuous solitar yconfinement and incommunicado detention throughout the entire period of their undisclosed detention and the infliction of further illtreatment through the use of various methods either individually or in combination in addition to the deprivation of other basic material requirements 45it is essential to proper understanding of this report that all of the elements of treat ment and material conditions of detention individually outlined below be considered as forming whole as each constitutes an integral part of the situation of the detainees in the cia detention program in addition to the information contained in the following section it is also necessary to consider the prolonged duration of the detention the conditions of detention and treatment in the later stages of detention and the role of health personnel and in particular the lack of legal framework governing the undisclosed detention of the fourteen when understood in their totality the undisclosed detention regime to which these persons wer esubjected becomes all the more disturbing the icrc wishes to underscore that the consistency of the detailed allegations provided separately by each of the fourteen adds particular weight to the information provided below the general ter milltreatment has been used throughout the following section how ever it should in way be understood as minimising the severity of the conditions and treatment to which the detainees were subjected indeed as outlined in section 4below and as concluded by this report the icrc clearly considers that the allegations of the four teen include descriptions of treatment and interrogation techniquessingly or in combina tionthat amounted to torture andor cruel inhuman or degrading treatment 2 arrest and transfer the following fourteen persons are referred to in this report in

wer earrested in four different countries in each case they were reportedly arrested by the national police or security forces of the country in which they were arrestedin some cases us agents were present at the time of arrest all fourteen were detained in the country of arrest for periods ranging from few days up to one month before their first transfer to third country reportedly afghanistan see below and from there on to other countries interrogation in the country of arrest was conducted by us agents in nearly all cases in two cases however detainees reported having been inter rogated by the national authorities either alone or jointly with us agents mr abdel rahim hussein abdul nashiri was allegedly interrogated for the first month after arrest by dubai agents and one detainee who did not wish his name to be transmitted to the authorities was allegedly interrogated by both pakistani and us agents during their subsequent detention outlined below detainees sometimes reported the presence of nonus personnel believed to be personnel of the countr yin which they were held even though the overall control of the facility appeared to remain under the control of theus authorities throughout their detention the fourteen were moved from one place to another and were allegedly kept in several different places of detention probably in several dif ferent countries the number of locations reported by the detainees varied however ranged from three to ten locations prior to their arrival in guantanamo in september 2006 the transfer procedure was fairly standardised in most cases the detainee would be photographed both clothed and naked prior to and again after transfer body cavity check rectal examination would be carried out and some detainees alleged that asuppository the type and the effect of such suppositories was unknown by the detainees was also administered at that moment the detainee would be made to wear diaper and dressed in tracksuit earphones would be placed over his ears through which music would sometimes be played he would be blindfolded with at least cloth tied around the head and black goggles in addition some detainees alleged that cotton wool was also taped over their eyes prior to the blindfold and goggles being applied mr abu zubaydah alleged that during one transfer operation the blindfold was tied ver ytightly resulting in wounds to his nose and ears he does not know how long the transfer took but prior to the transfer he repor ted being told by his detaining authorities that he would be going on jour ney that would last twentyfour to thirty hours the detainee would be shackled by hands and feet and transported to the airport by road and loaded onto plane he would usually be transported in reclined sitting position with his hands shackled in front the journey times obviously varied consid erably and ranged from one hour to over twentyfour to thirty hours the detainee was not allowed to go to the toilet and if necessary was obliged to urinate or defecate into the diaper on some occasions the detainees wer etranspor ted lying flat on the floor of the plane andor with their hands cuffed behind their backs when transported in this position the detainees complained of severe pain and discomfort in addition to causing sever ephysical pain these transfers to unknown locations and unpredictable conditions of detention and treatment placed mental strain on the 6fourteen increasing their sense of disorientation and isolation the ability of the detaining authority to transfer persons over apparently significant distances to secret locations in foreign countries acutely increased the detainees feeling of futility and helplessness making them more vulnerable to the methods of illtreatment described below the icrc was informed by the us authorities that the practice of transfers was linked specifically to issues that included national security and logistics as opposed to being an integral par tof the program for example to maintain compliance however in practice these transfers increased the vulnerability of the fourteen to their interroga tion and was performed in manner goggles earmuffs use of diapers strapped to stretchers sometimes rough handling that was intrusive and humiliating and that challenged the dignity of the persons concer ned as their detention was specifically designed to cut of fcontact with the outside world and emphasise feeling of disorientation and isolation some of the time periods referred to in the report are approximate estimates made by the detainees concerned for the same reasons the detainees were usually unaware of their exact location beyond the first place of detention in the country of arrest and the second country of detention which was identified by all fourteen as being afghanistan this report will not enter into conjecture by referring to possible countries or locations of places of detention beyond the first and second countries of detention which are named and will refer where necessary to subsequent places of detention by their position in the sequence for the detainee concerned eg third place of detention fourth place of detention the icrc is confident that the concerned authorities will be able to iden tify from their r ecords which place of detention is being referred to and the relevant period of detention moreover the icrc notes that four detainees believed that they had pr eviously been held in guantanamo for periods ranging from one week to one year during 20034 they r eported recognising this location upon r eturntherein september 2006 as each had been allowed outdoors on daily basis during their earlier time there the icrc has been assured by dod that it was given full notification of and access to all persons held in guantanamo during its regular detention visits the icrc is cerned if the allegations ar econfir med it had in fact been denied access to these per sons during the period in which they wer edetained there 12continuous solitary confinement and incommunicado detention throughout the entir eperiod during which they were held in the cia detention pro gramwhich ranged from sixteen months up to almost four and half years and which for eleven of the fourteen was over three yearsthe detainees were kept in tinuous solitar yconfinement8and incommunicado detention they had knowledge of where they were being held contact with persons other than their interrogators 7orguards even their guards were usually masked and other than the absolute mini mum did not communicate in any way with the detainees none had any reallet alone regularcontact with other persons detained other than occasionally for the purposes ofinquiry when they were confronted with another detainee none had any contact with legal representation the fourteen had access to news from the outside world apart from in the later stages of their detention when some of them occasionally received printouts of sports news from the internet and one reported receiving newspapers none of the fourteen had any contact with their families either in written form or through family visits or telephone calls they were therefore unable to inform their families of their fate as such the fourteen had become missing persons in any text such situation given its prolonged duration is clearly cause of extreme distress for both the detainees and families concerned and itself constitutes form of illtreatment in addition the detainees were denied access to an independent third party in order toensure accountability there is need for procedure of notification to families and of notification and access to detained persons under defined modalities for third party such as the icrc that this was not practiced to the knowledge of the icrc nei ther for the fourteen nor for any other detainee who passed through the ciadetention program is matter of serious concern 13other methods of illtreatment as noted above the fourteen wer esubjected to an extremely harsh detention regime characterised by illtreatment the initial period of interrogation lasting from few days up to several months was the harshest wher ecompliance was secur ed by the infliction of various forms of physical and psychological illtreatment this appear ed to be followed by r ewar dbased interrogation approach with gradually improving conditions of detention albeit r einfor ced by the threat of r eturning to for mer methods the methods of illtreatment alleged to have been used include the following suffocation by water poured over cloth placed over the nose and mouth alleged by three of the fourteen prolonged stress standing position naked held with the arms extended and chained above the head as alleged by ten of the fourteen for periods from two or three days continuously and for up to two or three months intermittently during which period toilet access was sometimes denied resulting in allegations from four detainees that they had to defecate and urinate over themselves beatings by use of collar held around the detainees neck and used to force fully bang the head and body against the wall alleged by six of the fourteen beating and kicking including slapping punching kicking to the body and face alleged by nine of the fourteen 8confinement in box to severely restrict movement alleged in the case of one detainee prolonged nudity alleged by eleven of the fourteen during detention interroga tion and illtreatment this enforced nudity lasted for periods ranging from sev eral weeks to several months sleep deprivation was alleged by eleven of the fourteen through days of interro gation through use of forced stress positions standing or sitting cold water and use of repetitive loud noise or music one detainee was kept sitting on chair for prolonged periods of time exposure to cold temperature was alleged by most of the fourteen especially via cold cells and interrogation rooms and for seven of them by the use of cold water poured over the body or as alleged by three of the detainees held around the body by means of plastic sheet to create an immersion bath with just the head out of the water prolonged shackling of hands andor feet was alleged by many of the fourteen threats of illtreatment to the detainee andor his family alleged by nine of the fourteen forced shaving of the head and beard alleged by two of the fourteen deprivationrestricted provision of solid food from 3days to 1month after arrest alleged by eight of the fourteen in addition the fourteen were subjected for longer periods to deprivation of access to open air exercise appropriate hygiene facilities and basic items in relation to interr ogation and restricted access to the koran linked with interrogation see section 14other aspects of the detention regime the following section provides various examples of each of the methods of ill treatment alleged to have been used on the fourteen during their time in ciadetention the examples provided ar eonly samples to illustrate each particular method and are not in any way meant to be r epresentation of all of the allegations r ecorded for the purposes of clarity in this r eport each method of illtreatment mentioned below has been detailed separately however each specific method was in fact applied incombination with other methods either simultaneously or in succession not all of these methods wer eused on all detainees9except in one case namely that of mr abu zubaydah against whom all of the methods outlined below wer eallegedly used in order to provide as complete and accurate picture as possible some excerpts from the interviews conducted with some of the fourteen as recorded by the icrc are attached in annex 1 the information contained in the following section was reported to the icrc by twelve of the fourteen two detainees did not report allegations of the other methods of illtreatment outlined in section 13these two detainees were nevertheless sub jected to illtreatment in the form of continuous solitary confinement and incommuni cado detention 913suffocation by water three of the fourteen alleged that they were repeatedly subjected to suffocation by water they were mr abu zubaydah mr khaled shaik mohammed and mr nashiri in each case the person to be suffocated was strapped to tilting bed and cloth was placed over the face covering the nose and mouth water was then poured contin uously onto the cloth saturating it and blocking off any air so that the person could notbreathe this form of suffocation induced feeling of panic and the acute impres sion that the person was about to die in at least one case this was accompanied by incontinence of the urine at point chosen by the interrogator the cloth was removed and the bed was rotated into headup and vertical position so that the person was left hanging by the straps used to secure him to the bed the procedure was repeated at least twice if not more often during single interrogation session moreover this repetitive suffocation was inflicted on the detainees during subsequent sessions the above procedure is the socalled water boarding technique in all three cases this caused considerable pain particularly for mr abu zubaydah who had undergone surgery just three months earlier he stated that he vomited on several occasions during this procedure mr abu zubaydah described the suffocation method of illtreatment used in his thirdplace of detention as follows i was put on what looked like hospital bed and strapped down very tightly with belts black cloth was then placed over my face and the interrogators used mineral water bottle to pour water on the cloth so that i could notbreathe after few minutes the cloth was removed and the bed was rotated into an upright position the pressure of the straps on my wounds caused severe pain i vomited the bed was then again lowered to horizontal position and the same tor ture carried out with the black cloth over my face and water poured on from bottle on this occasion my head was in more backward downwards position and the water was poured on for longer time i struggled without success to breathe i thought i was going to die i lost control of my urine since then i still lose control of my urine when under stress the suffocation procedure was applied during five ses sions of illtreatment that took place during an approximately oneweek intense period of interrogation allegedly in afghanistan in 2002 during each session apart from one the suffocation technique was applied once or twice on one occasion it was applied three times mr khaled shaik mohammed gave the following description of this method of ill treatment used in his thir dplace of detention i would be strapped to special bed which can be rotated into vertical position cloth would be placed over my face water was then poured onto the cloth by one of the guards so that i could not breathe this obviously could only be done for one or two minutes at time the cloth was then removed and the bed was put into vertical position the whole process was then repeated during about 1hour the procedure was applied during five different ses sions during the first month of interrogation in his third place of detention he also 10said that injuries to his ankles and wrists occurred during the suffocation as he strug gled in the panic of not being able to breathe as during other forms of illtreatment he was always kept naked during the suffocation female interrogators were also present during this form of illtreatment again increasing the humiliation aspect mr khaled shaik mohammed described device attached to one of his fingers the reading of which was checked regularly by person he assumed to be doctor from the descrip tion this appears to have been pulse oxymeter medical device for measuring the saturation of oxygen in the blood also see sect 3health provision and the role of medical staf f 132 prolonged stress standing ten of the fourteen alleged that they were subjected to prolonged stress standing posi tions during which their wrists were shackled to bar or hook in the ceiling above the head for periods ranging from two or three days continuously and for up to two or three months intermittently all those detainees who reported being held in this posi tion were allegedly kept naked throughout the use of this form of illtreatment for example mr khaled shaik mohammed alleged that apart from the time when he was taken for interrogation he was shackled in the prolonged stress standing posi tion for one month in his third place of detention he estimates he was interrogated for approximately eight hours each day at the start of the month gradually declining to four hours each day at the end of the month mr ramzi binalshib alleged that he was shackled in this position for two to thr ee days in afghanistan his second place of detention and for seven days in his fourth mr nashiri for at least two days in afghanistan and again for several days in his third place of detention mr majid khan for three days in afghanistan and seven days in his thirdplace of detention mr bin attash for two weeks with two or three shor tbreaks wher ehe could lie down in afghanistan and for several days in his fourth place of detention mr bin lep for seven days in afghanistan and mr hambali for four to five days blindfolded with type of sack over his head while still detained in thailand mr bin attash commented that during the two weeks he was shackled in the pro longed stress standing position with his hands chained above his head his artificial leg was sometimes removed by the interrogators to increase the stress and fatigue of the position one detainee who did not wish his name to be transmitted to the authorities alleged that he was shackled in this position for two to three months seven days of prolonged stress standing followed by two days able to sit or lie down while being held in this position some of the detainees wer eallowed to defecate in abucket guard would come to release their hands from the bar or hook in the ceiling so that they could sit on the bucket none of them however were allowed to clean themselves after wards others were made to wear garment that resembled diaper this was the case for mr bin attash in his fourth place of detention however 11he commented that on several occasions the diaper was not replaced so he had to uri nate and defecate on himself while shackled in the prolonged stress standing position indeed in addition to mr bin attash thr ee other detainees specified that they had to defecate and urinate on themselves and remain standing in their own bodily fluids of these only mr bin lep agreed that his name be transmitted to the authorities many of the detainees who alleged that they had undergone this form of ill treatment commented that their legs and ankles swelled as result of the continual forced standing with their hands shackled above their head they also noted that while being held in this position they wer echecked frequently by us health personnel although this position prevented most detainees from sleeping three of the detainees stated that they did fall asleep once or mor ewhile shackled in this position these include mr khaled shaik mohammed and mr bin attash the third did not wish his name to be transmitted to the authorities when they did fall asleep held in this position the whole weight of their bodies was effectively suspended from the shackled wrists transmitting the strain through the arms to the shoulders 133 beating by use of collar six of the fourteen alleged that an improvised thick collar or neck roll was placed around their necks and used by their interrogators to slam them against the walls for example mr abu zubaydah commented that when the collar was first used on him in his third place of detention he was slammed directly against hard concrete wall he was then placed in tall box for several hours see section 135 confinement in boxes after he was taken out of the box he noticed that sheet of plywood had been placed against the wall the collar was then used to slam him against the plywood sheet he thought that the plywood was in order to absorb some of the impact so as to avoid the risk of physical injury mr abu zubaydah also believed that his interr oga tion was for mof experimentation with various interrogation techniques indeed some forms of illtreatment were allegedly used against him that were not reported to have been used on other detainees he claimed that he was told by one of the inter rogators that he was one of the first to receive these interrogation techniques mr bin attash alleged that during interrogation in afghanistan n adaily basis during the first two weeks collar was looped around my neck and then used to slam against the walls of the interrogation room it was also placed around my neck when being taken out of my cell for interrogation and was used to lead along the corridor it was also used to slam against the walls of the corridor during such movements mr khaled shaik mohammed alleged that in his thir dplace of detention thick plastic collar would be placed around my neck so that it could then be held at the two ends by guard who would use it to slam repeatedly against the wall 12134 beating and kicking nine of the fourteen alleged that they had been subjected to daily beatings during the initial period involving repeated slapping punching and less often kicking to the body and face as well as detainee having his head banged against solid object these beatings lasted up to half an hour and were repeated throughout the day and again on subsequent days they took place during periods ranging from one week up to two to three months for example one detainee who did not wish his name to be transmitted to the authorities alleged that in kabul the treatment got worse i was punched and slapped in the face and on the back to the extent that i was bleeding while having rope round my neck and being tied to pillar my head was banged against the pillar repeatedly the interrogators then allegedly took picture of the detainee to show to another suspect in order to threaten the same treatment to that person see section 1310 threats mrkhaled shaik mohammed alleged that on daily basis during the first month of interrogation in his third place of detention if i was perceived not to be cooperating iwould be placed against wall and subjected to punches and slaps in the body head and face mr bin attash alleged that every day for the first two weeks in afghanistan i was subjected to slaps to the face and punches to the body during interrogation this was done by one interrogator wearing gloves he was then replaced by second inter rogator who was more friendly and pretended that he could save from the first interrogator one detainee who did not wish his name to be transmitted to the authorities said that during the early days of the interrogation in kabul i was often subjected to punches and slaps to the face by the interrogator two afghan guards held by the shoulders during the beatings 135 confinement in box one of the fourteen reported that confinement inside boxes was used as form of ill treatment mr abu zubaydah alleged that during an intense period of his interroga tion in afghanistan in 2002 he was held in boxes that had been specially designed to constrain his movement one of the boxes was tall and narrow and the other was shorter forcing him to crouch down mr abu zubaydah stated that as it was not high enough even to sit upright i had to crouch down it was very difficult because of my wounds the stress on my legs held in this position meant that my wounds both in the leg and stomach became very painful i think this occurred about three months after my last operation he went on to say that cover was placed over the boxes while he was inside making it hot and difficult to breathe the combination of sweat pressure and friction from the slight movement possible to try to find comfortable 13position meant that the wound on his leg began to reopen and started to bleed he does not know how long he remained in the small box he says that he thinks he may have slept or fainted the boxes were used repeatedly during period of approxi mately one week in conjunction with other forms of illtreatment such as suffocation by water beatings and use of the collar to slam him against the wall sleep deprivation loud music and deprivation of solid food during this period between sessions of ill treatment he was made to sit on the floor with black hood over his head until the next session began 136 prolonged nudity the most common method of illtreatment noted during the interviews with the four teen was the use of nudity eleven of the fourteen alleged that they were subjected to extended periods of nudity during detention and interrogation ranging from several weeks continuously up to several months intermittently for example mr bin attash alleged that he was kept naked for two weeks in afghanistan followed by one month of being clothed however after being trans ferred to his next place of detention he was allegedly again kept naked for another one month mr hambali alleged that he was kept naked for four to five days while still detained in thailand and was then held for one week naked in afghanistan he was then pro vided with clothes which were again removed after one week after which he remained naked for another month befor eclothes wer efinally pr ovided mr abu zubaydah alleged that after spending several weeks in hospital following arrest he was transferred to afghanistan wher ehe remained naked during inter roga tion for between one and half to two months he was then examined by woman he assumed to be doctor who allegedly asked why he was still being kept naked clothes weregiven to him the next day however the following day these clothes wer ethen cut of fhis body and he was again kept naked clothes wer esubsequently provided or removed according to how cooperative he was perceived by his interr ogators mr khaled shaik mohammed alleged that he was kept naked for one month in afghanistan mr majid khan alleged that he was kept naked for three days in afghanistan and for seven days in his thir dplace of detention mr bin lep alleged that he was kept naked for three to four days while still detained in thailand followed by nine days naked in afghanistan one of the detainees who did not wish his name to be transmitted to the authorities alleged that while detained in afghanistan he was kept naked for two to three months with clothes being provided approximately every seven days for two day period and then being again removed most of the detainees commented that the provision of clothes was determined by how cooperative they wer eperceived by the interrogators 14137 sleep deprivation and use of loud music eleven of the fourteen alleged that they were deprived of sleep during the initial inter rogation phase from seven days continuously to intermittent sleep deprivation that continued up to two or three months after arrest sleep was deprived in various ways and therefore overlaps with some of the other forms of illtreatment described in this section from the use of loud repetitive noise or music to long interrogation sessions to prolonged stress standing to spraying with cold water for example mr abu zubaydah alleged that while detained in afghanistan i was kept sitting on chair shackled by hands and feet for two to three weeks during this time i developed blisters on the underside of my legs due to the constant sitting iwas only allowed to get up from the chair to go to the toilet which consisted of bucket he alleged that he was constantly deprived of sleep during this period if i started to fall asleep guard would come and spray water in my face he said the cell was kept very cold by the use of airconditioning and very loud shouting music was constantly playing on an approximately fifteen minute repeat loop twentyfour hours day sometimes the music stopped and was replaced by loud hissing or crackling noise one detainee who did not wish his name to be transmitted to the authorities alleged that loud music played for twentyfour hours day throughout the one year period he believed he was held in afghanistan he reported that during the last month it changed to sounds of wind waves and bir ds 138 exposure to cold temperaturecold water detainees frequently r eported that they wer eheld for their initial months of detention in cells which were kept extremely cold usually at the same time as being kept forcibly naked the actual interrogation room was also often reported to be kept cold requests for clothing or for blankets went unanswered for example mr abu zubay dahalleged that his cell was excessively cold throughout the nine months he spent in afghanistan seven of the fourteen r eported that they were also subjected to dousing with cold water during interrogation sessions in four cases the water was allegedly thrown or poured onto the detainee with buckets or hosepipe while held in stress standing position with their arms shackled above their head for prolonged periods several thought that this was in order to clean away the faeces which had run down their legs when they defecated while held in the prolonged stress standing position see section 132 prolonged stress standing in three cases cold water was also poured over the detainee while he was lying on plastic sheet raised at the edges by guards to contain the water around his body creating an immersion bath with just the head exposed in one case detainee was strapped to tilting bed and cold water was poured over his body while he was threatened with water boarding although that procedure was not actually carried out on that individual 15for example one detainee who did not wish his name to be transmitted to the authorities alleged that during his detention in afghanistan his interrogators threw cold water on with buckets during the early days of the interrogation mr ramzi binalshib alleged that he was splashed with cold water from hose during interro gation in his fourth place of detention and that in his eighth place of detention he was restrained on bed unable to move for one month february 2005 and subjected to cold airconditioning during that period another detainee who did not wish his name to be transmitted to the authorities alleged that when i was taken for interrogation i would first be splashed with cold water by the guards while still in the cell in the prolonged stress standing position im not sur eif this was to clean or as part of the interrogation processor both i was then blindfolded and walked the fifteen minutes to another room separate from the interrogation room where i was made to lie on plastic sheet which was then raised at the edges cold water was then poured onto using kettle or hose for between fifteen and thirty minutes i was still blindfolded my interrogator told that woman was also present during the cold water treatment i think i heard female voice on at least one occasion he alleged that this was repeated on an almost daily basis with breaks of two days approximately once week during two to three months while he was detained in afghanistan mr bin attash described the following from his detention in afghanistan on daily basis during the first two weeks i was made to lie on plastic sheet placed on the floor which would then be lifted at the edges cold water was then poured onto my body with buckets they did not have hosepipe to fill the sheet more easily this jail was not so well equipped for tor ture he was kept enveloped within the sheet with the cold water for several minutes in his next place of detention he was allegedly doused ever yday during the month of july 2003 with cold water from hosepipe he commented that in this place of detention they wer erather mor esophisticated than in afghanistan because they had hosepipe with which to pour water over 139 prolonged use of handcuffs and shackles many of the detainees alleged that they wer ekept for long periods continuously shack led andor handcuffed for example mr khaled shaik mohammed was allegedly kept continuously shackled even when inside his cell for nineteen months one detainee who did not wish his name to be transmitted to the authorities alleged that he was kept for four and half months continuously handcuffed and seven months with the ankles continuously shackled while detained in kabul in 20034 on two occasions his shackles had to be cut of fhis ankles as the locking mechanism and ceased to function allegedly due to rust mr bin attash alleged that he was kept permanently handcuffed and shackled throughout his first six months of detention during the four months he was held in his third place of detention when not kept in the prolonged stress standing position his 16ankle shackles were allegedly kept attached by one meter long chain to pin fixed in the corner of the room where he was held 1310 threats nine of the fourteen alleged that they had been subjected to threats of illtreatment seven of these cases took the for mof verbal threat including of illtreatment in the formof water boarding electric shocks infection with hivsodomy of the detainee and the arrest and rape of his family torture being brought close to death and of an interrogation process to which rules applied the other two threats were made by visual means namely of illtreatment which would make the detainee resem ble codetainee through use of photo of codetainee showing physical signs of ill treatment and of return to past methods of illtreatment through displaying during interrogation neck collar previously used for illtreatment in all cases the threats were made to induce cooperation with the interrogation for example mr khaled shaik mohammed alleged that in his third place of deten tion one of his interrogators stated that the greenlight had been received from wash ington to give him hard time and that although they would not let him die he would be brought to the verge of death and back again mr abu zubaydeh alleged that in his third place of detention he was told by one of the interrogators that he was one of the first to receive these interrogation tech niques so rules applied mr hambali alleged that in his thir dplace of detention he was threatened with return to previous methods of illtreatment namely having his head slammed against the wall by use of collar see section 133 beatings by use of collar by his inter rogators showing him the collar during interrogation sessions similarly mr khaled shaik mohammed stated that the collar previously used had been placed on the table infront of him during interrogation sessions in his thir dplace of detention mr nashiri alleged that in his thir dplace of detention he was threatened with sodomy and with the arrest and rape of his family 1311 forced sha ving two of the fourteen alleged that their heads and beards were forcibly shaved mr abu zubaydah alleged that his head and beard were shaved during the transfer to afghanistan mr ramzi binalshib alleged that in his eighth place of detention first his head was shaved and then some days later his beard was also shaved off he was particularly dis tressed by the fact that the people who shaved him allegedly deliberately left some spots and spaces in order to make him look and feel particularly undignified and abused 171312 deprivationrestricted provision of solid food eight of the fourteen alleged that they were deprived of solid food for periods ranging from three days to one month this was often followed by period when the provision of food was restricted and allegedly used as an incentive for cooperation two other detainees alleged that whilst they were not totally deprived of solid food food was provided intermittently or provided in restricted amounts for example mr abu zubaydah alleged that in afghanistan during the initial period of two to three weeks while kept constantly sitting on chair he was not pro vided with any solid food but was provided with ensure nutrient drink and water after about two to three weeks he began to receive solid food rice to eat on daily once day basis approximately one month later during resumption of intense questioning he was again deprived of food for approximately one week and only given ensure and water mr binalshib alleged that during period of three weeks in his fourth place of detention he was deprived of solid food for three to four weeks and only provided with ensur eand water one detainee who did not wish his name to be transmitted to the authorities alleged that during the initial two to three months of his detention in afghanistan although not totally deprived of solid food he was given just one meal ever ytwo to three days later this increased to one meal day until the last month in that place of detention when he finally received three meals day he believes he was detained in afghanistan for approximately one year mr bin attash alleged that he was not provided with any solid food during the first two weeks of his detention in afghanistan only ensur eand water being provided during that period during the third week the ensure continued but he was also given one solid meal day this consisted of either bread and gravy or rice and potatoes he was held in afghanistan for three weeks in his next place of detention food was adequately pr ovided mr khaled shaik mohammed alleged that during the first month in his third place of detention he was not provided with any solid food apart from on two occasions as rewar dfor perceived cooperation drink of ensure was provided once every four hours if he refused to drink then his mouth was forced open by guard and the ensure was poured down his throat after about one month solid food began to be provided twice day mr majid khan alleged that he did not receive any solid food for seven days in afghanistan one detainee who did not wish his name to be transmitted to the authorities alleged that during the one week he was held in his first place of detention he was not provided with any food and was only given ensure and water to drink after arriving in where he believes was kabul he was kept another two days without food after which he was provided with meals irregularly for the next two months after which meals were pro vided on regular basis 18mr bin lep alleged that he was not provided with any solid food until twelve days after his arrest mr hambali alleged that throughout his four to five days of detention in thailand where he was allegedly held in us custody he was not provided with any solid food during the two months he was detained in afghanistan he received solid food irregu larly sometimes twice day and sometimes only once in two to three days ensure was provided throughout to supplement the lack of solid food 14further elements of the detention regime the conditions of detention under which the fourteen were held particularly during the earlier period of their detention formed an integral part of the interrogation process as well as an integral part of the overall treatment to which they were sub jected as part of the ciadetention program this report has already drawn attention to certain aspects associated with basic conditions of detention which were clearly manipulated in order to exert pressure on the detainees concerned in particular the use of continuous solitary confinement and incommunicado detention lack of contact with family members and third parties prolonged nudity deprivationrestricted provision of solid food and prolonged shackling have already been described above the situation was further exacerbated by the following aspects of the detention regime deprivation of access to the open air deprivation of exer cise deprivation of appropriate hygiene facilities and basic items in pursuance of interrogation restricted access to the koran linked with interr ogation these aspects cannot be considered individually but must be understood as form ing par tof the whole picture as such they also for mpartof the illtreatment to which the fourteen were subjected little or access to open air was granted to the fourteen throughout their deten tion period for most their arrival in guantanamo was the first time they had been allowed outdoors at all since their arrest apart from during transfer from one place of detention to another two detainees said they were taken outdoors twice during their periods of detention in afghanistan and only four detainees claimed that they received regular outdoor period during any par tof their detention these four believed that they were previously detained in guantanamo for periods ranging from one week to one year during 20034 during this time they were allowed to go outdoors on daily basis apar tfrom these few exceptions none of the fourteen received any access to open air throughout their period in the cia detention program 19access to exer cisewas also severely limited particularly during the early months and years of detention for the detainees arrested during 2002 and 2003 according to many of the detainees it was after several months or years of detention that the author ities constructed or provided such facilities for example mr bin attash was kept for approximately two and half years without any possibility to exercise outside his cell apart from one month period in his fifth place of detention which was equipped with agymexercise area mr hambali was allegedly detained for nine months before he was provided with any possibility to exercise outside of his cell mr khaled shaik mohammed was allegedly held for nineteen months before he was provided with access to small gym located outside his cell in his fifth place of detention basic materials such as toothbrushes toothpaste soap towels toilet paper clothes under wear blankets and mattress were not provided at all during the initial detention period in some instances lasting several months the timing of initial provision and continued supply of all these items was allegedly linked with compliance and coopera tion on the part of the detainee even after being provided these basic items allegedly were sometimes removed in order to apply pressure for purposes of interrogation in the early phase of interrogation from few days to several weeks access to shower was totally denied and toilet as mentioned above was either provided in the form of bucket or not provided at allin which case those detainees shackled in the prolonged stress standing position had to urinate and defecate on themselves and remain standing in their own bodily fluids for periods of several days see section 132 prolonged stress standing during the initial stages of detention particularly during the most intense interro gation phase the fourteen wer enot provided with access to the koran the cultural and religious significance of this lack of access added significant psychological pres sureto the detainees later usually about two months after arrest korans wer epro vided and the direction of mecca was indicated detainees alleged however that throughout their detention period the timing of the prayer schedule was inaccurate several detainees alleged that on occasion their korans along with other items were removed according to the needs of the interrogation for example mr bin attash was provided with koran in his thir dplace of detention approximately two months after arrest he was able to keep the koran for one month it was then removed as the inter rogation again became harsher and was finally returned to him one month later mr khaled shaik mohammed alleged that he was not allowed to pray until approximately one month after his arrest he was provided with koran in april 2003 approxi mately six weeks after arrest it was confiscated on four occasions during his stay in his third place detention mr hambali was provided with koran about four days after his arrival in his third place of detention approximately two months after arrest he stated that few days later the air conditioning was made ver ycold and ever ything was removed from my cell including the koran i was only left with tshirt and shorts 202conditions of detention in later stages the icrc notes that conditions of detention and treatment following the initial period during which the methods described above were used gradually improved the timing for the implementation of these improvements varied for each detainee and appears linked to the needs of the interrogation the introduction of improvements appears to mark the transition from the phase where compliance was obtained by force to what resembled more incentivebased approach see section 13for exam ples of approximate timeframes following the initial stages of interrogation described above all detainees were provided with clean clothes on weekly basis were gradually provided with solid food three times per day although some complaints of quality and quantity lasted through out and were provided with books in english or their mother tongue and magazines in the latter stages of detention usually six to eight months after arrest all fourteen were provided with toilet facilities in their cells to which they had unlimited access some also had unlimited access to washbasins and all were able to shower either on weekly basis or more often after period which varied between several months to two and half years following the arrest all detainees were allowed to move from their cells to closed indoor area in which they were able to use exercise machines also in the latter stages of detention the cell temperature was usually maintained at aproper level in the final place of detention prior to their arrival in guantanamo some detainees were able to watch film on weekly basis andor use portable dvd player although each of these aspects represents an improvement in the situation in which the fourteen were held such improvements must be understood against the earlier backgr ound of sever eilltreatment and ongoing threats of such treatment continuous solitary confinement and incommunicado detention ongoing transfers and the lack of legal framework governing their detention 3health provision and the role of medical staff during the course of their detention detainees described three principal roles for health personnel whom they encountered firstly there was direct role in monitoring the ongoing illtreatment which in some instances involved the health personnel directly participating while certain methods were used secondly there was role in perfor ming medical check just prior to and just after each transfer finally there was the provision of healthcare to treat both the direct consequences of illtreatment detailed in previous sections and to treat any natural ailments that arose during the prolonged periods of detention throughout the course of the initial phase of the detention the icrc received alle gations that health personnel were directly involved in monitoring the health effects of illtreatment in some cases it was alleged that based on their assessments health 21personnel gave instructions to interrogators to continue to adjust or to stop particu lar methods as with other personnel within the detention facilities the health person nel did not identify themselves but the detainees presumed from their presence and function that they were either physicians or psychologists10 for certain methods notably suffocation by water the health personnel were allegedly directly participating in the infliction of the illtreatment in one case it was alleged that health personnel actively monitored detainees oxygen saturation using what from the description of the detainee of device placed over the finger appeared to be pulse oxymeter for example mr khaled shaik mohammed alleged that on several occasions the suffocation method was stopped on the intervention of health person who was present in the room each time this procedure was used other detainees who wer eshackled in stress standing position for prolonged peri ods in their cells wer emonitored by health personnel who in some instances recom mended stopping the method of illtreatment or recommended its continuation but with adjustments for example mr bin attash the detainee has had rightsided below knee amputation alleged that while being held in form of stress standing posi tion with his arms shackled above his head and his feet touching the floor had his lower leg measured on daily basis with tape measure by person he assumed to be adoctor for signs of swelling the health person finally ordered that he be allowed to sit on the floor albeit with his arms still shackled above his head mr hambali alleged that after period of the same form of prolonged stress standing health person intervened to prevent further use of the method but told him that i look after your body only because we need you for information as well as the monitoring of specific methods of illtreatment other health person nel were alleged to have directly participated in the interrogation process one detainee who did not wish his name to be transmitted to the authorities alleged that health person threatened that medical car ewould be conditional upon cooperation with the interr ogators the second alleged role of the health personnel was to per form amedical check prior to and after each transfer from one detention location to another the purpose and results of this medical examination appear not to have been divulged to the detainees the thir dalleged role was to provide medical care to detainees either for injuries resulting directly from the various forms of illtreatment employed or treatment for common ailments that arose throughout the course of the detention with regard to this third role when such medical treatment was necessary it appears from the descriptions given that the care was appropriate and satisfactory in two specific cases detainees indicated that exceptional lengths were taken to provide veryhigh standards of medical intervention medical ethics are based on number of principles11which include the principle of beneficence medical practitioner should act in the best interest of the patientsalus aegroti suprema lex nonmalefiance first do harmprimum non nocere and dig nity the patient and the person treating the patient have the right to dignity these 22principles guide any relationship between medical doctor and person whom he or she is relating to as medical doctor there are accepted roles for health professionals working in recognised official places of detention such as police stations and prisons wherein the health professionals have the health care and best interests of the detainee as their primary consideration12 to this end when person enters an official detention facility or system medical assessment of their medical status is required in order to meet their current and ongo ing health needs in the case of normal lawful interrogation physician may be asked to provide medical opinion within the usual bounds of medical confidential ity as to whether existing mental or physical health problems would preclude the individual from being questioned secondly physician may rightly be requested to provide medical treatment to person suffering medical emergency during question ing this accepted role of the physician or any other health professional clearly does not extend to ruling on the permissibility or not of any form of physical or psycholog ical illtreatment the physician and any other health professionals are expressly pro hibited from using their scientific knowledge and skills to facilitate such practices in any way on the contrary the role of the physician and any other health professional involved in the care of detainees is explicitly to protect them from such illtreatment and there can be exceptional circumstances invoked to excuse this obligation13 with the exceptions detailed in the above paragraph any interrogation process that requires health professional to either pronounce on the subjects fitness to withstand such procedure or which requires health professional to monitor the actual proce dure must have inherent health risks as such the interrogation process is contrary to international law and the participation of health personnel in such process is trary to international standards of medical ethics in the case of the alleged participa tion of health personnel in the detention and interrogation of the fourteen detainees their primar ypurpose appears to have been to serve the interrogation process and not the patient in so doing the health personnel have condoned and participated in ill treatment 4legal aspects in relation to undisclosed detention as described in the following paragraphs it is basic tenet of international law that any person deprived of liberty must be registered and held in an officially recognized place of detention international humanitarian law ihl applicable to international armed conflicts contains numerous provisions and provides extensive requirements concerning the registration of persons deprived of their liberty icrc visits to places of detention and the transmission of information related to such persons to inter alia their next of kin14the entire system of detention provided for by the geneva conventions of 1949 in which the icrc plays super visor yrole is based on the idea that detainees must be registered and held in officially recognised places of detention while under 23the geneva conventions icrc access to certain detainees may be restricted for rea sons of imperative military necessity such restriction should be of temporary and exceptional nature only15 customary rules of ihl and human rights soft law instruments contain similar explicit provisions on the obligation of registration of detainees and the prohibition of unacknowledged detention as well as provisions on contacts with family applicable in situations of noninternational armed conflicts and other situations of violence16all of the abovementioned rules aim at preventing inter alia enfor ced disappearance which is prohibited under international law including customary ihl as far as ihl is cerned the phenomenon of enforced disappearance violates or risks violating range of customar yrules most notably the prohibition of arbitrary deprivation of liberty and the prohibition of torture andor other cruel inhuman or degrading treatment cid17 in the icrc sview the fourteen were placed outside the protection of the law dur ing the time they spent in cia custody indeed one of the main effects of the transfers was to place the fourteen in secret detention facilities in unspecified locations in number of different countries outside the reach of any judicial or administrative sys tem as such they were for instance apparently both precluded from knowing the reasons for their detention and denied access to any mechanism capable of independ ently reviewing the lawfulness of their detention they were also denied contact with their families including any information to the families of their detention the totality of the circumstances in which the fourteen were held effectively amounted to an arbi trary deprivation of liberty and enforced disappearance in contravention of interna tional law18 as regards conditions of detention and treatment of the fourteen the effects of their being in undisclosed detention were severe and multifaceted as the present report shows the absence of scrutiny by any independent entityincluding the icrc inevitably creates conditions conducive to excesses that would not otherwise be per mitted persons held in undisclosed detention ar eespecially vulnerable to being subjected to illtreatment indeed the allegations of the fourteen include descriptions of treatment and interrogation techniquessingly or in combinationthat amounted to tor tureandor cruel inhuman or degrading tr eatment in that r egard the icrc wishes to remind the us authorities that international law absolutely prohibits cid and torture torture is defined by the 1984 convention against torture as any act by which severe pain or suffering whether physical or mental is intentionally inflicted on person for such purposes as obtaining from him or third person information or confession punishing him for an act he or third person has committed or is suspected of having committed or intimidating or coercing him or third person or for any reason based on discrimination of any kind when such pain or suffering is inflicted by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of public official or other person acting in an official capacity19in particular the provisions of common article 3to the geneva conventions which reflects elementar yconsiderations of humanity stipulate that persons taking active part in the hostilities shall in all circumstances be treated humanely and that cruel 24treatment and torture outrages upon personal dignity in particular humiliating and degrading treatment are prohibited at any time and in any place whatsoever 5fate of other persons who passed through the cia detention program during his speech of 6september 2006 president bush also stated that the cia deten tion program held limited number of persons at given time and that number of other persons had also been detained by the cia in the context of the fight against ter rorism president bush added that many of them have been returned to their home countries for prosecution or detention by their governments once the us authorities had determined that they had little or intelligence value in subsequent discussions with various us government departments it was again stated to the icrc that the majority if not all other detainees who went through this program have been transferred to their countries of origin itis the icrcs understanding that these transfers are all subject to formal agree ments between the usg and the respective countries which include inter alia assur ances of humane treatment on the part of the countries of origin the icrc has number of legal and operational concerns about this practice in particular the icrc regrets that the usg has not informed the icrc of the countries of destination so that the icrc can seek access from the relevant authorities in order to monitor human treatment and to ensure communication with their families in light of the conditions of detention and treatment of the fourteen during the period they were held in the cia detention program as reported above the icrc remains gravely concerned by the fact that significant number of other persons have passed through this detention program and may have been subjected to similar if not the same conditions and treatment the icrc has not received any clarification of the fate of these persons and has ther eforenot been able to seek access to them following their r eported transfer to their home countries consequently it has not been able to assess the detention regime experienced by these persons whilst in cia custody nor to assess whether they ar ecurrently assured humane treatment by the detaining authori ties in their respective countries of origin nor whether they have been given the possi bility of reestablishing contact with their families the icrc welcomes the fact that it has been able to begin discussions with the cia on this question it considers the issue to be humanitarian priority and anticipates continuation of the discussions aimed at resolving this question 6future use of the cia detention program accor ding to information provided to the icrc by the us authorities persons were held in the cia detention program as of october 2006 nevertheless in his 25speech of 6september 2006 president bush made clear that the cia detention pro gram had not been discontinued and could again be used in the future the icrc is concerned by the maintenance or resumption of any type of undis closed detention particularly in view of the information described in the body of this report including the legal aspects it urges the us authorities to end the practice of undisclosed detention without prejudice to this position the icrc requests that should persons never theless be held in the cia detention program in the future it be notified of their deten tion and be granted access to conduct its traditional visits to the persons detained in addition it urges the authorities to ensure that conditions of detention and treatment arehumane20finally the icrc wishes to remind the cia that persons whose contin ued detention is deemed necessar yfor imperative reasons of security should be afforded an independent and impartial review of deprivation of liberty that appropri ately addresses their status review processes should enable the internees to challenge the reasons for their continued internment by application of appropriate procedural safeguards21 conclusion all of the fourteen were subjected to process of ongoing transfers to places of deten tion in unknown locations and continuous solitary confinement and incommunicado detention throughout the entire period of their detention the fourteen were placed outside the protection of the law during the time they spent in the cia detention pro gram the totality of the circumstances in which they were held effectively amounted to an arbitrar ydeprivation of liberty and enforced disappearance in contravention of international law moreover and in addition to the continuous solitar yconfinement and incommuni cado detention which itself was for mof illtreatment twelve of the fourteen alleged that they wer esubjected to systematic physical andor psychological illtr eatment this was consequence of both the treatment and the material conditions which formed par tof the interrogation regime as well as the overall detention regime this regime was clearly designed to undermine human dignity and to create sense of futil ity by inducing in many cases sever ephysical and mental pain and suffering with the aim of obtaining compliance and extracting information resulting in exhaustion depersonalisation and dehumanisation the allegations of illtreatment of the detainees indicate that in many cases the illtreatment to which they were subjected while held in the cia program either singly or in combination constituted torture in addition many other elements of the ill treatment either singly or in combination constituted cruel inhuman or degrading treatment the alleged participation of health personnel in the interrogation process and either directly or indirectly in the infliction of illtreatment constituted gross breach 26of medical ethics and in some cases amounted to participation in torture andor cruel inhuman or degrading treatment in light of the above the icrc remains gravely concerned by the fate of the other persons previously held in the cia detention program who remain unaccounted for it continues to request that the relevant us authorities provide clarification concerning the fate of all persons for whom it has information the icrc also remains gravely concerned about the announcement by president bush that the us authorities intend to continue the practice of undisclosed detention by holding persons arrested in the context of the fight against terrorism in the cia detention program in the future the icrc urges the us authorities to end the practice of undisclosed detention and to ensur ethat all persons detained in the context of the fight against terrorism are held in conformity with the rules and principles of international law without prejudice to its position on undisclosed detention the icrc requests that should persons nevertheless be held in the cia detention program in the future it be notified of their detention and granted access to these detainees moreover it urges the us authorities to provide the icrc with notification and access to all detainees held under us authority in the context of the fight against terrorism such access of purely humanitarian nature should not be seen as inconsistent with any legitimate security concerns of the us authorities in relation to the concerned detainees to this end the icrc recommends the following that the us authorities take all measures to eliminate abusive conditions of detention and treatment in all places of detention under their authority that all persons detained in the context of the fight against terrorism be treated humanely at all times that all persons detained in the context of the fight against terrorism be permit ted to communicate with family members within reasonable time that all persons detained in the context of the fight against terrorism be held in legal framework af fording all fundamental guarantees that the icrc be notified of all arrests carried out by the us authorities or by thirdcountr yauthorities acting on behalf of or in cooperation with the us authorities in the context of the fight against ter rorism that the icrc be granted access to all persons held under us authority in the context of the fight against terrorism that the us authorities investigate all allegations of illtreatment and take steps to punish the perpetrators where appropriate and to prevent such abuses from happening again that the us authorities infor mthe icrc of the identities of the other persons who have passed through the cia detention program the country to which they have been returned and any other relevant details to allow the icrc to seek access to these persons 27the icrc trusts that the information in the present report will provide useful tool for the relevant us authorities to take the necessary measures to ensure that all persons deprived of liberty in the context of the fight against terrorism are treated in accor dance with the provisions of international law and internationally recognised stan dards the icrc looks forward to continue its dialogue with the us authorities on this issue annex 1 the following examples of excerpts from some of the interviews conducted with the fourteen are in way meant to represent the entirety of any one those interviews orto be representative of all of the interviews carried out these excerpts are repro duced verbatim they are presented only to illustrate how the various alleged methods of illtreatment described in section 1of the report were reportedly used in combina tion with each other i abu zubaydeh reported the following regarding his detention in afghanistan were he was held for approximately nine months from may 2002 to february 2003 he had previously been held in hospital for what he believes were several weeks and had several operations to severe gunshot injuries sustained at the time of arrest i woke up naked strapped to bed in ver ywhite room the room measured approximately 4m x4m the room had three solid walls with the fourth wall consist ing of metal bars separating it from larger room i am not sur ehow long i r emained in the bed after some time i think it was several days but can t remember exactly i was transferred to chair wher iwas kept shackled by hands and feet for what i think was the next 2to 3weeks during this time i developed blisters on the underside of my legs due to the constant sitting i was only allowed to get up from the chair to go the toilet which consisted of bucket water for cleaning myself was provided in plastic bottle iwas given solid food during the first two or three weeks while sitting on the chair iwas only given ensure and water to drink at first the ensure made vomit but this became less with time the cell and room were airconditioned and were very cold very loud shouting type music was constantly playing it kept repeating about every fifteen minutes twentyfour hours day sometimes the music stopped and was replaced by loud hissing or crackling noise the guards were american but wore masks to conceal their faces my interroga tors did not wear masks during this first two to three week period i was questioned for about one to two hours each day american interrogators would come to the room and speak to 28through the bars of the cell during the questioning the music was switched off but was then put back on again afterwards i could not sleep at all for the first two to three weeks if i started to fall asleep one of the guards would come and spray water in my face after about two or three weeks i began to receive food rice to eat on daily basis they gave it once day i could eat with my hand but i was not allowed to wash it was also around this time that i was allowed to lie on the floor i remained naked and in shackles but i could sleep little it went on like this for about another one and half months during the first few days doctor came and gave an injection i was told it was an antibiotic after about one and half to two months i was examined by female doctor who asked why i was still naked my measurements were taken and the next day iwas provided with orange clothes to wear this was followed however by more threats that worse was to follow indeed the next day guards came into my cell they told to stand up and raise my arms above my head they then cut the clothes off of so that i was again naked and put back on the chair for several days i tried to sleep on the chair but was again kept awake by the guards spraying water in my face when my interrogators had the impression that i was cooperating and providing the information they required the clothes were given back to when they felt i was being less cooperative the clothes were again removed and i was again put back on the chair this was repeated several times eventually i dont remember after how long i was allowed to have mattress and was given towel to use as sheet to cover myself with while sleeping i was allowed some tissue paper to use when going to toilet on the bucket there then followed period of about one month with questioning during this period i was given food rice and beans on daily basis varying between once or twice day they also continued to give ensur eto drink my cell was still ver ycold and the loud music longer played but ther ewas constant loud hissing or crack ling noise which played twentyfour hours day itried to block out the noise by put ting tissue in my ears therethen followed period of about one month with questioning then about two and half or three months after i arrived in this place the interrogation began again but with mor eintensity than before then the real torturing started two black wooden boxes wer ebrought into the room outside my cell one was tall slightly higher than and narrow measuring perhaps in area 1m x075mand 2min height the other was shorter perhaps only 1m in height i was taken out of my cell and one of the interrogators wrapped towel around my neck they then used it to swing around and smash repeatedly against the hard walls of the room i was also repeat edly slapped in the face as i was still shackled the pushing and pulling around meant that the shackles pulled painfully on my ankles iwas then put into the tall back box for what i think was about one and half to two hours the box was totally black on the inside as well as the outside it had bucket inside to use as toilet and had water to drink provided in bottle they put 29cloth or cover over the outside of the box to cut out the light and restrict my air supply it was difficult to breathe when i was let out of the box i saw that one of the walls of the room had been covered with plywood sheeting from now on it was against this wall that i was then smashed with the towel around my neck i think that the plywood was put there to provide some absorption of the impact of my body the interrogators realized that smashing against the hard wall would probably quickly result in phys ical injury during these torture sessions many guards were present plus two interrogators who did the actual beating still asking questions while the main interrogator left to return after the beating was over after the beating i was then placed in the small box they placed cloth or cover over the box to cut out all light and restrict my air supply as it was not high enough even to sit upright i had to crouch down it was very diffi cult because of my wounds the stress on my legs held in this position meant my wounds both in the leg and stomach became very painful i think this occurred about 3months after my last operation it was always cold in the room but when the cover was placed over the box it made it hot and sweaty inside the wound on my leg began to open and started to bleed i dont know how long i remained in the small box i think i may have slept or maybe fainted iwas then dragged from the small box unable to walk properly and put on what looked like hospital bed and strapped down very tightly with belts black cloth was then placed over my face and the interrogators used mineral water bottle to pour water on the cloth so that i could not breathe after few minutes the cloth was removed and the bed was rotated into an upright position the pressure of the straps on my wounds was ver ypainful i vomited the bed was then again lowered to hor izontal position and the same torture carried out again with the black cloth over my face and water poured on from bottle on this occasion my head was in mor eback ward downwards position and the water was poured on for longer time i struggled against the straps trying to breathe but it was hopeless i thought i was going to die i lost control of my urine since then i still lose control of my urine when under str ess iwas then placed again in the tall box while i was inside the box loud music was played again and somebody kept banging repeatedly on the box from the outside i tried to sit down on the floor but because of the small space the bucket with urine tipped over and spilt over i remained in the box for several hours maybe overnight i was then taken out and again towel was wrapped around my neck and i was smashed into the wall with the plywood covering and repeatedly slapped in the face by the same two interrogators as before iwas then made to sit on the floor with black hood over my head until the next session of torture began the room was always kept very cold this went on for approximately one week during this time the whole pr ocedure was repeated five times on each occasion apart from one i was suffocated once or twice and was put in the vertical position on the bed in between on one occasion the suffocation was repeated three times i vomited each time i was put in the vertical posi tion between the suffocation 30during that week i was not given any solid food i was only given ensure to drink my head and beard were shaved everyday icollapsed and lost consciousness on several occasions eventually the torture was stopped by the intervention of the doctor iwas told during this period that i was one of the first to receive these interrogation techniques so rules applied it felt like they were experimenting and trying out techniques to be used later on other people at the end of this period two women and man came to interrogate i was still naked and because of this i refused to answer any questions so they again repeatedly slapped in the face and smashed against the wall using the towel around my neck the following day i was given towel to wear around my waist but i was still verycold then little by little things started to get better i was again given rice to eat then my mattress was returned i was allowed to clean my cell the tall box was removed but the short one remained in the room outside my cell i think as deliberate reminder as to what my interrogators were capable of one week after the end of torture i was given pair of green shorts and top to wear the food also improved with the addi tion of beans and fruit iwas provided with water and allowed to wash inside the cell however the loud noise continued throughout the nine months i spent in that place i was never given any outdoor time ii walid bin attash reported the following regarding his detention in afghanistan wher ehe was held for approximately three weeks from midmay to the start of june 2003 and in his subsequent place of detention where he was held from june to october 2003 on arrival at the place of detention in afghanistan i was stripped naked i r emained naked for the next two weeks i was put in cell measuring appr oximately 1m x2m i was kept in standing position feet flat on the floor but with my arms above my head and fixed with handcuffs and chain to metal bar running across the width of the cell the cell was dark with light artificial or natural during the first two weeks i did not receive any food i was only given ensure and water to drink guar dwould come and hold the bottle for while i drank during the third week the ensure continued but i was also provided with one meal each day this consisted of either gravy and bread or rice and potatoes the toilet consisted of bucket in the cell which was removed once day i was not allowed to clean myself after using the bucket loud music was playing twentyfour hours each day through out the three weeks i was held ther after some time of being held in this position my stump began to hurt so i removed my artificial leg to relieve the pain of course my one good leg then began to ache and soon started to give way so that i was left hanging with all my weight on my wrists i shouted for help but at first nobody came finally after about one hour guard came 31and my artificial leg was given back to and i was again placed in the standing posi tion with my hands above my head after that the interrogators sometimes deliberately removed my artificial leg in order to add extra stress to the position for the first two weeks i was held in this position apart for two or three times when i was allowed to lie down but i cannot remember for how long usually throughout the interrogation the methods they used were specifically designed not to leave marks however when i was in this position the cuffs cut into my wrists and made wounds when this happened the doctor would be called for interrogation i was blindfolded and removed from the cell and taken to another room every day for the first two weeks i was subjected to slaps to my face and punches to my body during the interrogation this was done by one interrogator wear ing gloves he was then replaced by second interrogator who was more friendly and pretended that he could save from the first interrogator also on daily basis during the first two weeks collar was looped around my neck and then used to slam against the walls of the interrogation room it was also placed around my neck when being taken out of my cell for interrogation and was used to lead along the corridor it was also used to slam against the walls of the corridor during such movements also on daily basis during the first two weeks i was made to lie on plastic sheet placed on the floor which would then be lifted at the edges cold water was then poured onto my body with buckets they did not have hosepipe to fill the sheet more easily this jail was not so well equipped for torture i would be kept wrapped inside the sheet with the cold water for several minutes i would then be taken for interr ogation to separate room at the end of the interrogation i would be placed under hot lights to dry out thoroughly and warm up this was sometimes done during the interr ogation the interrogators threatened to infect with hiv i was given at least two injec tions by the doctor during this period but i have idea what they wer efor female interrogators wer ealso present which i found highly humiliating in my naked state the female interrogators did not take part in physical illtreatment after about two weeks the tor turestopped i was given some clothes tracksuit to wear and was longer kept in the standing position with my hands above my head i was still shackled by my ankles but was allowed to sit or lie down in my cell i was also provided with blanket after approximately three weeks in afghanistan i was transferred to another place iwas blindfolded and earphones were placed over my ears i was transported in sit ting position shackled by the ankles and by the wrists with my hands in front of my body i think that the flight lasted probably more than eight hours on this occasion the transfer was done using militar yplane if i shifted my position too much during the journey somebody hit by hand on the head iarrived in the next place of detention during june 2003 ithink i was detained undergr ound as i had to walk down some stairs in order to reach the cell my blindfold was then removed the cell was about 4m x 5m i was kept chained by my ankle 32shackles to pin fixed in the floor for the first month here i was not subjected to any torture iwas not allowed to shower meals were provided three times day in addition to ensure and multivitamins toilet consisted of bucket in the cell which was removed everyday loud music was playing twentyfour hours each day i was provided with styrofoam mattress after about one month the torture began again i was stripped naked and remained naked throughout the month of july also during this time i was again kept for several days in standing position with my arms above my head and fixed with handcuffs and achain to metal ring in the ceiling my lower leg was examined on daily basis by doctor using tape measur efor signs of swelling i do not remember for exactly how many days i was kept standing but i think it was about ten days the doctor finally ordered that i be allowed to sit on the floor i was still kept with my arms extended above my head this was very painful on my back during the standing i was made to wear diaper however on some occasions the diaper was not replaced and so i had to urinate and defecate over myself i was washed down with cold water everyday in this place of detention they were rather more sophisticated than in afghanistan because they had hosepipe with which to pour the water over after having been washed down with cold water in my cell i was taken for interrogation on one occa sion i heard sounds of person being tortured next door in this place of detention female interrogators were again present while i was naked one of them was particu larly aggressive in her questioning he would not go further into detail on this sub ject however i was not subjected to any more beatings iii khaled shaik mohammed reported the following regarding his transfer to and detention in afghanistan wher ehe was held for three days at the star tof march 2003 and in his subsequent place of detention wher ehe was held fr om 06march to 22september 2003 during the transfer from pakistan to afghanistan my eyes wer ecovered with cloth tied around my head and with cloth bag pulled over it suppositor ywas inser ted into my rectum i was not told what the suppositor ywas for iwas dressed in shalwar kameez shackled hands and feet and put sitting in vehicle for the journey to the air port i was then put in sitting position on plane the transfer was ok with par ticular problems to report the flight was short only about 1hour iarrived at night the transfer from the plane to the place of detention took about 1520 minutes dur ing my time in this place of detention i could hear planes taking off and landing i think the place was bagram after arrival my clothes wer ecut off of the bag and blindfold were removed and photographs were taken of naked i remained naked throughout the three days istayed in this place of detention iwas checked by doctor and asked about my medical history itold the doctor about the pain i was still suffering from the beating in pakistan during the two days 33he was detained at rawlapindi he was questioned by cia agent who allegedly punched him several times in the stomach chest and face the same agent reportedly threw him on the floor and trod on his face three times he was not allowed to sleep during his detention in pakistan iwas then placed in cell about 2m x4m naked where i was kept in standing position with my hands cuffed and chained to bar above my head my feet were flat on the floor at first i was questioned for about one hour with other forms of ill treatment after about one hour i was taken to another room where i was made to stand on tiptoes for about two hours during questioning approximately thirteen per sons were in the room these included the head interrogator man and two female interrogators plus about ten muscle guys wearing masks i think they were all ameri cans from time to time one of the muscle guys would punch in the chest and stom ach this was repeated during two nights also during this period i was on four occasions taken to separate room away from the main interrogation room here cold water from buckets was thrown onto for about forty minutes not constantly as it took time to refill the buckets after which i would be taken back to the interrogation room on one occasion during the interrogation i was offered water to drink when i refused i was again taken to another room where i was made to lie of the floor with three persons holding down tube was inserted into my anus and water poured inside afterwards i wanted to go to the toilet as i had feeling as if i had diarrhoea toilet access was provided until four hours later when i was given bucket to use whenever i was returned to my cell i was always kept in the standing position with my hands cuffed and chained to bar above my head on one occasion i was taken to another cell and was allowed to sleep for little while i think for only about one hour befor ebeing r eturned to my cell standing naked with my hands shackled above my head music was always playing in the corridor outside my cell but it was not ver yloud for toilet bucket was provided inside the cell guar dcame and lowered my hands to allow to use it however iwas not allowed to clean myself afterwards and was immediately again r eturned to the former position iwas not allowed to pray icould not bathe or wash i was not provided with any time outdoors some afghani style bread was given to on some occasions as reward for when they thought i was cooperating after three days in afghanistan i was dressed in tracksuit my eyes were covered with cloth tied around my head cloth bag was then pulled over my head head phones were placed over my earsplaying music but not too loud i was transported about ten minutes by vehicle and then placed in plane sitting leaning back with my hands and ankles shackled in high chair ifell asleep the first proper sleep in over five days i therefore dont know how long the journey lasted on arrival the transfer from the airport to the next place of detention took about one hour iwas transported sitting on the floor of vehicle i could see at one point that there was snow on the ground everybody was wearing black with masks and 34army boots like planetx people i think the country was poland i think this because on one occasion water bottle was brought to without the label removed it had email address ending in pl the centralheating system was an old style one that i would expect only to see in countries of the former communist system after arrival my clothes were again cut off of the bag and blindfold were removed and photographs were again taken of naked i was put in cell with cam eras where i was later informed by an interrogator that i was monitored 24hours day by doctor psychologist and interrogator i think the cell was underground i had togo down steps to get to it it was about 3m x4mwith wooden walls it was here that the most intense interrogation occurred led by three experienced cia interrogators all over 65years old and all strong and well trained there were the emirs although of course they never revealed their own names i gave them names by which i could refer to them all beginning with abu i think that abu captain was of south american origin whereas abu hanan was perhaps of moroccan origin and abu white was of eastern european descent as the interrogation again resumed i was told by one of the emirs that they had received the greenlight from washington to give him hard time they never used the word torture and never referred to physical pressure only to hard time iwas never threatened with death in fact i was told that they would not allow to die but that i would be brought to the verge of death and back again apart from when i was taken for interrogation to another room i was kept for one month in the cell in standing position with my hands cuffed and shackled above my head and my feet cuffed and shackled to point in the floor of course during this month i fell asleep on some occasions while still being held in this position this resulted in all my weight being applied to the handcuffs around my wrists resulting in open and bleeding wounds the cuffs around my ankles also created open bleeding wounds scars consistent with this allegation wer evisible on both wrists as well as on both ankles both my feet became ver yswollen after one month of almost continual standing initially i was interrogated for approximately eight hours each day this gradually became less until after one month it was about four hours each day for the interrogation i was taken to separate room the number of people pr esent varied greatly from one day to another other interrogators including women were also sometimes present along with the emirs doctor was also usually present if i was perceived not to be cooperating i would be put against wall and punched and slapped in the body head and face thick flexible plastic collar would also be placed around my neck so that it could then be held at the two ends by guard who would use it to slam repeatedly against the wall the beatings were combined with the use of cold water which was poured over using hosepipe the beatings and use of cold water occurred on daily basis during the first month in addition i was also subjected to waterboarding on five occasions all of which occurr ed during that first month i would be strapped to special bed which could be rotated into vertical position cloth would be placed over my face cold water 35from bottle that had been kept in fridge was then poured onto the cloth by one of the guards so that i could not breathe this obviously could only be done for one or two minutes at time the cloth was then removed and the bed was put into vertical position the whole process was then repeated during about one hour injuries to my ankles and wrists also occurred during the waterboarding as i struggled in the panic of not being able to breathe female interrogators were also present during this form of illtreatment and doctor was always present standing out of sight behind the head of bed but i saw him when he came to fix clip to my finger which was connected to machine i think it was to measur my pulse and oxygen content in my blood so they could take to breaking point after each session of torture i was put into cell where i was allowed to lie on the floor and could sleep for few minutes however due to shackles on my ankles and wrists i was never able to sleep ver ywell the harshest period of the interrogation was just prior to the end of the first month the beatings became worse and i had cold water directed at from hosepipe by guards while i was still in my cell the worst day was when i was beaten for about half an hour by one of the interrogators my head was banged against the wall so hard that it started to bleed cold water was poured over my head this was then repeated with other interrogators finally i was taken for session of water boarding the torture on that day was finally stopped by the intervention of the doctor i was allowed to sleep for about one hour and then put back in my cell standing with my hands shackled above my head music was playing 24hoursday in the corridors but not very loud i was allowed to pray after about one month koran was given in april 2003 it was confiscated on four occasions during my stay in that place of detention the toilet consisted of bucket in the cell which i could use on request but i was not allowed to clean myself after toilet during the first month i was allowed to shower twice during the first month after these two showers i was allowed to sleep for little while on the floor of my cell befor ebeing r eturned to the standing position with hands cuffed above my head during the first month i was not provided with any food apar tfrom on two occasions as r ewar dfor perceived cooperation i was given ensure to drink ever y4 hours if i refused to drink then my mouth was forced open by the guar dand it was poured down my throat by force at my request the ensure was later provided little warmed i was weighed every day during the first month this was done on weekly basis later at the time of arrest i weighed 78kg after one month in detention i weighed 60kg iwasnt given any clothes for the first month artificial light was on 24hours day but i never saw sunlight i was never taken outdoors after about one month i was moved to another cell i was given clothes to wear i was longer kept in standing position i was only shackled by the ankles i could shower once week the interrogation became less harsh more physical assault but threats along the lines of we will take you to another r oom or by having the plastic collar put on the table in front of during the questioning i was provided 3637with styrofoam mattress they started to give food twice day to begin with the it consisted only of rice and beans later after june 2003 ibegan to receive some meals with sardines canned meat and bread buns the guards would sometimes bring the food already bitten and would handle roughly when they took to the shower these things improved after i complained to one of the emirs on june 4th i was moved to third cell this move occurred after i complained about the constant music that was still being played outside my cell the new cell was acage like structure built inside an underground room i preferred it as there was music and as it was cage structure instead of solid walls the ventilation was better iwas again kept shackled by the feet but not the wrists water was provided in two bottles one for drinking one for the toilet toilet paper was provided toilet still sisted of bucket inside the cell it was removed on daily basis during the harshest period of my interrogation i gave lot of false information in order to satisfy what i believed the interrogators wished to hear in order to make the illtreatment stop i later told the interrogators that their methods were stupid and counterproductive im sure that the false information i was forced to invent in order tomake the illtreatment stop wasted lot of their time and led to several false red alerts being placed in the us notes 1the icrc has defined undisclosed detention
