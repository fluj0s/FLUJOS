federal funds to the states to assist them in providing an education for children with disabilities as condition for the receipt of these funds idea contains requirements on the provision of services and detailed due process procedures in 1997 congress amended idea in the most comprehensive and controversial reauthorization since ideas original enactment in 1975 one of the most contentious issues addressed in the 1997 legislation related to the disciplinary procedures applicable to children with disabilities idea was originally enacted in 1975 because children with disabilities often failed to receive an education or received an inappropriate education this lack of education led to numerous judicial decisions including parc v state of pennsylvania1 and mills v board of education of the district of columbia2 which found constitutional infirmities with the lack of education for children with disabilities when the states were providinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20947crs2 3 for detailed

lobbied congress to assist them3 congress responded with the grant program still contained in idea but also delineated specific requirements that the states must follow in order to receive these federal funds the statute provided that if there was dispute between the school and the parents of the child with disability the child must stay put in his or her current educational placement until the dispute is resolved revised stay put provision remains in idea issues relating to children with disabilities who exhibit violent or inappropriate behavior have been raised for years and in 1988 the question of whether there was an implied exception to the stay put provision was presented to the supreme court in honig v doe4 although the supreme court did not find such an implied exception it did find that ten day suspension was allowable and that schools could seek judicial relief when the parents of truly dangerous child refuse to permit change in placement in 1994 congress amended ideas stay put provision to give schools unilateral authority to remove child with disability to an interim alternative educational setting if the child was determined to have brought firearm to school in 1997 congress made significant changes to idea in pl 10517 and attempted to strike careful balance between the leas local education agency duty to ensure that school environments are safe and conducive to learning for all children including children with disabilities and the leas continuing obligation to ensure that children with disabilities receive free appropriate public education 5 this current law does not immunize child with disability from disciplinary procedures but these procedures may not be identical to those for children without disabilities in brief if child with disability commits an action that would be subject to discipline school personnel have the following options suspendi ng the child for up to ten days with educational services provided conducting manifestation determination review to determine whether there is link between the childs disability and the misbehavior if the childs behavior is not manifestation of disability long term disciplinary action such as expulsion may occur except that educational services may not cease if the childs behavior is manifestatio n of the childs disability the school may review the childs placement and if appropriate initiate change in placement placing the child in an interim alternative education setting for up to forty five days which can be renewed for situations involving weapons or drugs

they are unable to reach agreement with students parents and they feel that the new statutory provisions are not sufficient6 amendment to hr 1 107th congress the child left behind act of 2001 representative norwood sponsored an amendment to hr 1which he described as allowing special needs students to be disciplined under the same policy as nonspecial needs students in the exact same situation7 essentially the amendment would eliminate the mandated provision of educational services to children with disabilities who have been suspend ed or expelled for actions involving drugs weapons or aggravated assault or battery in state that does not require educational services in that situation for children without disabilities more specifically the amendment would add section 5155 to the elementary and secondary education act of 1965 providing that states receiving funds under the act shall require each local education agency lea to have in effect policy allowing school personnel to discipline child with disability in the same manner as child without disability is disciplined if the child with disability 1 carries or possesses weapon to or at school on school premises or to or at school function 2 knowingly possesses or uses illegal drugs or sells or solicits the sale of controlled substance at school on school premises or at school function or 3 commits an aggravated assault or battery at school on school premises or at school function the disciplinary action may include expulsion or suspension and school personnel may modify the disciplinary action on case by case basis the child with disability who is disciplined may also assert defense that the carrying of weapon or the use sale or solicitation of an illegal drug was unintentional or innocent if the child with disability is suspended or expelled he or she is not entitled to receive educational services although the lea may choose to provide educational or mental health services if such services are provided they do not have to be at any particular level and their location is at the discretion of the lea the amendment also contains definitions of controlled substance illegal drug and weapon the rationale advanced for the amendment by representative norwood was that current federal law requires schools to have two different discipline policies one for children with disabilities and one for children without disabilities and that this created ahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20947crs4 8 id 9 id 10 id at h2584 see also statement of rep barr 11 id at h2583 12 id system of preferential treatment for children with disabilities8 representative graves also spoke on behalf of the amendment arguing that creating safe learning environment must be top priority for our schools unfortunately the discipline provisions of idea make it impossible for educators to address the needs of all students in the classroom9 similarly representative wicker stated there is hidden agenda here there is attempt to deny disabled students the ability to be educated it is simply matter of safety in schools and order in schools and discipline in schools10 several members spoke in opposition to the amendment representative miller observed that sometimes children with disabilities need to be treated differently because of their disabilities and that if the educational services for child with disability are stopped it is very difficult for the child to catch up he also emphasized that under current law child with disability has to receive educational services but that he or she does not have to receive them in the school11 representative kildee also opposed the amendment he observed noting the example of child in oregon who had been suspended and then went on shooting rampage that removing troubled children with disabilities from school without educational services will lead only to additional juvenile crime12 representative scott further elaborated on this argument he stated that hearings on youth crime had shown there was strong link between dropping out of school and subsequent crime with even higher correlations for children with disabilities and that putting such children on the streets was danger to the public idea amendment to s 1 107th congress the better education for students and teachers act the senate amendment like the house amendment would implement uniform disciplinary policies regarding the discipline of children with disabilities in certain circumstances the senate amendment is not limited to specific disciplinary situations like those involving weapons but amends idea by adding new subsection relating to uniform policies on discipline when the behavior at issue is not manifestation of the childs disabilities providing for certain procedural protections and providing for alternative placements of children with disabilities in certain situations senator sessions offered the senate amendment which would add new subsection to idea relating to uniform disciplinary policies the amendment provides that notwithstanding any other provision of idea sea state educational agency or lea may establish and implement uniform policies regarding discipline and order applicable to all children in order to ensure the safety of such children and an appropriate educational atmosphere this broad grant of authority is limited in situations where the behavior in question is manifestation of the childs disability in that situation the child with disability who is removed from his or her regular education placement shall receive

public education which may be provided in an alternative educational setting the manifestation determination is to be made later than ten school days after the school personnel decide to remove the child with disability from the childs regular educational placeme nt if the behavior is determined not to be manifestation of the childs behavior the same disciplinary procedures may apply to the child as are applied to children without disabilities the sessions amendment also contains provision relating to procedural safeguards this section provides school personnel with the discretion to consider all germane factors in each individual case and modify disciplinary action on casebycase basis the child with disability may assert defense that the alleged act was unintentional or innocent if the parents or the lea disagree with manifestation determination the parents or the agency may request review of the determination through the current idea procedures for an impartial due process hearing during the course of the review the child with disability shall receive free appropriate public education which may be provided in an alternative educational placement the last section of the sessions amendment allows lea at the written request of parent to transfer child with disability to any accredited school that is specifically designed to serve children with disabilities is selected by the childs parents agrees to accept the child and carries out program that the sea or lea determine will benefit the child certain idea funds shall follow the child to this new placement senator sessions read from number of letters from educators and students recounting situations where children with disabilities were disrupting classrooms and not receiving appropriate discipline and described his amendment during senate debate as modest attempt at improving the situation if child is disabled child and their misbehavior is not connected to their disability then they can and i think should be treated like any other child in the school13 in colloquy with senator kennedy senator sessions affirmed that if the behavior that led to the disciplinary action was result of the childs disability alterative educational services are available to that child senator sessions also indicated that if the behavior problem is not related to the disability the child with disability would be treated like child without disability14 senator allen argued in support of the sessions amendment that it would properly return the ability to the local schools and principals to establish and implement uniform discipline policies applicable to all children in our states and school districts15 senator kennedy expressed concern about the provision of the amendment allowing for the placement of child with disability in school designed to serve children with disabilities resulting in loss of quality educational experiences16 similarly senator harkin argued that the amendment would segregate children with disabilities noting that if the behavior is manifestation of the childs disability the childs free appropriate public education may be provided in an alternative educational setting he observed that unlikehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20947crs6 17 id at s6205 18 147 cong rec s62456246 daily ed june 14 2001current law there would be inquiry as to whether or not the child with disability was provided adequate supportive services finally senator harkin argued that there was data indicating that children with disabilities were causing discipline problems in schools17 senator kennedy also argued that there was data to support the contention that ideas requirements made imposing school discipline onerous several senators opposed the sessions amendment because they felt it should be more carefully examined during the next reauthorization of idea18
