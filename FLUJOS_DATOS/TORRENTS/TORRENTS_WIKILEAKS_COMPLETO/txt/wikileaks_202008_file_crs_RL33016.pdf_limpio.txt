detonates nuclear explosive device or engages in activities related to acquiring or manufacturing nuclear weapons among other things4 the united states created the nsg voluntary nuclear export regime

international relations committee hearing on september 8 2005 congressman jim leach stated i dont know any member of congress that doesnt want to have warming of relations with the government of india i also dont know many members of congress who are pushing for the precise commitment that the administration has made15 congressman leach suggested instead that us support for permanent seat for india on the united nations security counc il might have been more appropriate gesture other observers outside of congress have questioned whether us energy assistance should focus on expanding nuclear power in contrast to other energy alternatives henry sokolsk i of the nonproliferation po licy education center has argued that indian energy needs might be better met through free market allocation including improved efficiency he asserts that nuclear power is the least leveraged of indias options to meet indias energy needs given that it currently provides only 27 of installed electrical capacity16 indias projections of its nuclear energy needs are predicated on an estimated annual gr owth rate of 8 which some observers believe may be unrealistic17 one wellknown indian commentator brahma chellaney argued in the international herald tribune that the premise that india should meet its rapidly expanding ener gy needs through importing nuclear power reactors was flawed chellaney argued that better approach for india would be to secure cleancoal and rene wable energy technologies18 the senate foreign rela tions committees november 2 2005 hearing sought among other things to

statement before the house international relations committee november 16 2005 indias potential importance for vital us geopolitical objectives in asia hedge against rising chinaimpact on us nonproliferation policies the administration has characterized civ il nuclear cooperation with india as win for nonproliferation because it would bring india into the nonproliferation mainstream in short the administrati on is proposing that india should be courted as an ally in us nonproliferation policy rather than continue as target of us nonproliferation policy according to this reasoning india should become an ally for three reasons past polic ies have not worked india has relatively good nonproliferation record anyway and indi could be useful ally in the nonproliferation regime some observers however are concer ned that india may not support us nonproliferation policies sufficiently to wa rrant nuclear cooper ation particularly where the united states faces its greatest nuclear proliferation threat iran for example at the september 8 house international relations committee hearing several members of congre ss questioned whether the ited states had obtained assurances from india of its support on iran before it issued the july 18 joint statement iran two factors may present challenges to indian support for us policies toward iran first india has growing strategic relationship with iran not limited to its interest in proposed 74 billi on 2800kmlong gas pipeline between iran pakistan and india second india s strong tradition of foreign policy independence as longtime leader of the nonaligned movement nam states and as vigorous opponent of the di scriminatory nature of the nuclear nonproliferation treaty20 one witness before the house international relations committee hearing on november 16 2005 suggested that opposition from the united states on the gas pipeline project is considered to be interference with indias autonomy in foreign relations as we ll as disregard for its security and energy needs21 on irans nuclear program indian offi cials have stated they do not support nuclear weapons option for tehran howeve r they did not agree with

nuclear commerce because of its status outside the npt some observers believe this is good thing and shows that the policy works others believe that new paradigm is needed fo r india because it will not join the npt as nonnuclear weapon state one observer argued in 2005 law review journal that india could join the npt as nonnuclear weapon state and not give up its nuclear weapons primarily because the npt defi nes nuclear weapon states but does not define nonnuclear weapon states and becau the treaty does not expressly prohibit nonnuclear weapon states from possessing nuclear weapons just from acquiring manufacturing receiving transfers of or c ontrol of nuclear weapons and not to seek or receive any assistance in manufacturing nuclear weapons43 however that approach would require india to stop produc ing fissile material for nuclear weapons and place all nuclear material except that which is in its nuclear weapons under iaea safeguards the npt is basically twoway bargai n nonnuclearweapon states under the npt give up the option of developing nucl ear weapons in exchange for the promise of peaceful nuclear cooperation nuclear weapon states under the treaty commit to eventual disarmament india as state outside the npt is bound by neither of these commitments some observers may see the offer of nuclear cooperation previously reserved for states under th npt with

ensure that peaceful nuclear cooperation was not indirectly assisting or encouragin g indias nuclear weapons program the proliferation shocks of the 1990s when the iraqi and north korean clandestine nuclear weapons programs surf aced led to the strengthening of the npt and export control regimes at the 1995 npt review and extension conference npt parties affirmed the nsgs decision to require fullscope safeguards for nuclear exports supporting the principle that nonnpt parties should not be eligible for the same kinds of assistance as npt parties in good standing at the 2000 conference npt parties again supported that principle according to the us ambassador to the conference at that time reinforcement of this guideline is important given some who have questioned whether this principle should be relaxed for india and pakistan which have not accepted fullscope iaea sa feguards the answer from npt parties is clearly no44 in the past 10 years virtually all states agreed to strengthen the nonproliferation regime sacrificing some sovereignty by allowing additional intrusive inspections under the additional protocol in the wake of revelations in 2004 about pakistani scientist aq khans nuclear black mark et sales nonnuclear weapon states under the npt are also being asked to consider further restrictions on their sovereignty by voluntarily restricting their access to nsitive

on nuclear testin g working towards conclusion of multilateral fissile material cutoff treaty nontransfer of enrichment and reprocessing technologies securing nuc lear materials and technology through export control and harmonisation with mtcr and nsg guidelines48 india has had selfimposed nuclear test moratorium for years although supporters of this agreement note that this agreement would bind india bilaterally to honoring that pledge if the nsg used similar criterion in approving exports it could further strengthen that pledge india has supported fmct negotiations for years despite continuing to produce fiss ile material for use in nuclear weapons since the pace of fmct negotiations has b een glacial support for negotiations could allow india to continue produc ing fissile

nuclear states as synonymous with nuclear weapon states prime minister singh told the parliament in august 2006 that the july statement did not refer to india as nuclear weapons state because that has particular connotation in the npt but it explicitly acknowledged the existence of indias military nuclear facilities it also meant that india would not attract fullscope safeguards such as those applied to nonnuclear weapon states that are signatories to the npt and th ere would be curbs on continuation of indias nuclear weapon related activities in these important respects india would be

noting that even before the npt entered into force nego tiators recognized that state outside the treaty could preserve its domestic uranium sources for possible weapons program as long as it agreed to accept iaea safeguards on the items it imported in the late 1960s however congress was more concerned about ensuring that the united states could supply its allies outside the treaty such as japan and germany with nuclear fuel according to mason willrichs history of the npt as long as india does not become part to the nonproliferation treaty it can continue to import from the parties nuclear materials and equipment subject to safeguards for use in its civil nuclear pow er program this would free its indigenous resources particularly its limited uraniu m supply for possible concentration

cannot produce sufficient fuel for both its nuclear weapons program nd its projected civil nuclear program panel of nuclear expert s concluded in 2006 that indias production of weapon grade plutonium is currently constrained by the competing demands of indias nuclearpower reactors for its limited domestic supply of natural uranium if india could import fuel for its civilian nuclear reactors it could use more domestic uranium for the pr oduction of weapon materials64 acknowledging the countrys uranium limitati ons indias leading nuclear strategist k subrahmanyam suggested december 12 2005 in the times of india that new delhi should use imported nuclear fuel to pr eserve its domestic uranium reserves for nuclear weapons given indias uranium ore crunch and the need to build up our minimum credible nuclear deterrent arsenal as fast as possible it is to indias advantage to categorize as many power reactors as po ssible as civilian ones to be refueled by imported uranium and conserve our native uranium fuel for weapongrade plutonium production65 proponents of usindian nuclear coope ration have made several arguments regarding the article i issue none of these claims however refute the fact that indias access to the international uraniu m market will result in more indigenous indian uranium available for weapons b ecause it will not be consumed by new delhis newly safeguarded

in the limit of its indigenous resources and capabilities secretary rice made similar argument during an april 5 2006 house international relations committee hearing but these arguments do not address the constraints india faces in pursuing its ci vilian and military nucl ear programs using only indigenous uranium the npas also addresses new delhis intentions regarding its future nuclear arsenal first the statement says that washington has evidence indicating that india plans to use additional domestic ur anium reserves in its nuclear weapons programs as consequence of implemen ting the nuclear cooperation agreement second the npas argues that new delhi has posture of nuclear restraint citing indias stated nofirstuse nuclear w eapon policy and need for only credible minimum deterrent india however has never defined what it means by such deterrent saran stated durin g an april 2006 television inte rview that there is responsibility on part of india to d eclare what its minimum deterrent is67 moreover new delhis intentions are irrelevant to determining us compliance with its article i obligations furthermore the npas appears to argue that the agreement may reduce indias potential to produce additional fissile material for wea pons because the additional indigenous indian reactors placed under safe guards will longer be available for this purpose however the statement char acterizes the reactors potential to serve this purpose as theoretical and as not ed above india is not obligated to place future reactors under safeguards the state department report submitted with the agreement notes that iaea safeguards will prevent india from using its civil nuclear facilities for its nuclear weapons program it also describes the wa ys in which us export control policies prevent exported us dualuse nuclear technologies from being used for military purposes68 in the view of many nonproliferation anal ysts the key to ensuring that civilian nuclear cooperation does not assist india s weapons program is to insist on new delhi halting its fissile mate rial production for weapons that would narrow the area of concern to technology transfer to th weapons and delivery systems themselves rather than fissile material production in reactors enrichment facilities and reprocessing plants among others he nry sokolski suggested in the wall street journal that if we want

the senate foreign relations co mmittee september 18 that new delhi stands by it s initial plan to br ing its facilities under safeguards by 2014 indias implementation document noted that facilities were excluded from the civilian list if they were located in larger hub of strategic significance even if the facilities themselves were not normally engaged in activities of strategic significance calling into question whether the plan really will result in separation of civilian and military facilities moreover the plan stated that electricity grid connectivity is not relevant to the separati on exercise and that grid c onnectivity would be necessary irrespective of whether the r eactor concerned is civilian or not civilian this means that military reactors will continue to provide civilian electricity another question that arises is whethe r india in the absence of fullscope safeguards can provide sufficient confiden ce that us peaceful nuclear technology will not be diverted to nuclear weapons purposes as many believe it was in 197472 in response to question for the record submitted by senator lugar on april 5 2006 on whether exports of nuclear material or reactors from

into account india s past commitments eg use of purportedly peaceful nuclear reactors like cirus to produce plutonium for nuclear weapons and the impact on its nuclear weapons progra m eg capping indias fissile material production the separation plan may not appear credible to those observers who interpreted credible to mean that all pow er reactors that supplied electricity would be declared civilian because they have ci vilian use the separation plan also may not appear credible secretary rice has st ressed however that more reactors under safeguards means more transparency more physical security better nuclear safety and therefore increased safety for the united states76 even so some observers may argue that types of facilities safeguarded are critical in assessing whether the plan is defensible from nonprolifera tion standpoint for example in terms of preventing terrorist access to fissile material safe guarding facilities like reprocessing and enrichment plants and breeder reactors could be viewed as providing significant nonproliferation benefit because the materials produced by these plants are few steps closer to potential use in bomb in addition safeguards on enrichment reprocessing plants and breeder react ors would support the 2002 us national strategy to combat weapons of mass destruction in which the united states pledged to continue to discourage the worldwide accumulation of separated plutonium and to minimize the use of highlyenriched uranium77 indiaiaea discussions domestic opposition78 after the united states and india concluded the nuclear

requirements for entry into force have been met elbaradei also explained that since new delhi has committed to place additional reactors under safeguards concluding an um brella agreement was more efficient than negotiating different agreements for each facility according to the safeguards agreement india is to provide the iaea with declaration of its nuclear facilities based on new delhis sovereign decision to place voluntarily its civilian nuclear facilitie s under agency safeguards in phased manner india will implement this provision in twostep process first new delhi will provide list of nuclear facilities that it inte nds to place under safeguards in the future on july 25 india provided to the iaea document copy of new delhis 2006 separation plan containi ng list of its nuclear facilities87 the iaea anticipates that these facilities will be those listed in indias declaration later new delhi will notify the iaea when specific facilities are to be safeguarded those facilities will be placed on an annex to the agreement the iaea expects to begin safeguarding new f acilities in 2009 india will also have to notify the agency of imported items that are required to be safeguarded these will not be listed in the annex state department official said that th indias submission of this plan does not constitute submission of the declaration required by the safeguards agreement but does satisfy pl 109401s requirement regarding ne w delhis declaration88 india is not required to submit its iaea declaration until the safeguards agreement enters into force indias placement of nuclear facilities under safeguards appears to be contingent on its conclusion of nuclear supply agreem ents with other countries anil kakodkar chairman of indias atomic energy commission said in july 20 interview that indias identification of any facility as civilian is conditional on that fac ility benefitting from full civil nuclear c ooperation with other countries89 some observers have ex pressed concerns about the agreements preamble which contains language suggesting that india could withdraw nuclear facilities or fuel from safeguards if new delhi so choos for example th preamble states that india may take corrective measures to ensure uninterrupted operation of its civilian nuclear reactors in the event of disruption of foreign fuel supplies new delhi has not defined

indias concurrence to accept agency safeguards is support for an indian effort to develop strategic reserve of nuclear fuel to guard against any disruption of supply over the lifetime of indias reactors new delhi may want such stockpile to he dge against cutoff of fuel supplies in the event that for example india tests nuclear weapon however elbaradei stated august 1 that the agreements specific termination clauses override any general clauses in the agreement additionally the state department stated in january 2008 respons to questions for the record submitted by the house committee on foreign affairs that new delhi has expressed its view that for purposes of implementing the usindia agreement iaea safeguards can and should be regarded as being in perpetuity91 it is also worth noting that if india were to terminate iaea safeguards on us nuclear exports r special nuclear material produced from or with such exports section 123 1 of the aea requires that fallback safeguards be maintained on those exports the nuclear coope ration agreement states that safeguards will be maintained with respec t to all nuclear materials and equipment transferred pursuant to this agreement nd with respect to all special fissionable material used in or produced through the use of such nuclear materials and equipment so long as the material or equipment remains under the jurisdiction or control of the cooperating party the state department noted that if iaea safeguards fail to be applied the two countries must enter into arrangements for alternative measures to fulfill the above requirement92 the departments january respons also stated that it would not be consistent with the proposed agr eement text for corrective measures to detract from the applicability of safeguards to

incorporated the suggestions of supporting nsg members96 after revising that draft following consultations with new delhi washington submitted it to germany the current nsg chair in early august97 the second version did not contain any additional restrictions on india indee d it weakened one section of the 2006 draft which stated that nsg members could engage in nuclear trade with new delhi if the participating government intending to make the transfer is satisfied that india continues to fully meet all of its nonpr oliferation and safegu ards commitments the new draft stated only that participating governments shall maintain contact and consult through regular channels on matters connected with the implementation of the guidelines taking into account relevant international comm itments and bilateral agreements with india the nsg considered the new draft decision during an august 2122 extraordinary plenary meeting and decided during similar meeting held september 46 to exempt india from some of its export guidelines this decision means that members decisions to export previously restricted nuclear items to india are now governed by individual governments policies98 although several countries advocated that certain conditions such as an explicit ban on the transfer of enrichment and repr ocessing technology as well as provision that nuclear supplies to india would end if new delhi were to test nuclear weapon be placed on an exemption for india the final language contains such explicit conditions99 instead it states that the exemption is based on indian commitments and actions which are essen tially the same as the requi rements in pl 109401 the nsg statement also notes that the india has agreed to continue its unilateral moratorium on nuclear

during septem ber 18 2008 senate foreign relations committee hearing berman explained september 26 that he chose to support hr 7081 partly because secretary rice made personal commitment to him that

of the 1978 nuclear n onproliferation act which used legislative vetoes in the form of concurrent resolutions of disapproval in 1985 following the supreme courts chadha decision invalidating the use of legislative vetoes the export administration amendments ac t created separate approval process for exempted agreements which this part of secti on 123 d is referring to that called for joint resolution of approval thus fails to disappr ove could be interpreted as approves in the form of joint resolution of approval 122 in light of the chadha decision passing concurrent resolution could invite legal challenge although this is not provided fo r in the aea congress could choose to pass joint resolution of disapproval or bill stating in substance it did not approve 123 section 128 b 3 refers to resolution of disapproval and this would likely be joint resolution of disapproval in light of the chadha decision 124 section 128 b 2 refers to concurrent resolution in light of the chadha

president must determine that failure to approve an export would be seriously prejudicial to the achievement of us nonproliferation objectives or otherwise jeopardize the common defense and security the president would submit his executive order along with detailed assessment and other documen tation to congress for 60 da ys of continuous session after 60 days of continuous session the export

of exports by notifying the c ongress that the state has adopted fullscope safeguards or that the state has made significant progress toward fullscope safeguards or that us foreign policy interests dictate reconsideration such determination would become effective unless congress disagrees with the presidents determination124httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33016crs36 125 section 129 specified that the

the united states and the iaea to provide for enhanced information access and inspection tools for iaea inspectors as they inspect us nuclear and other facilities under the us voluntary safeguards agreement the house and senate version of the hr 5682 were remarkably similar with four differences127 the senate version contained an additional requirement for the president to execute his waiver authority an amendment introduced by senator harkin and adopted by unanimous consent th at the president determine that india is fully and actively participating in us and international efforts to dissuade sanction and contain iran for its nuclear program this provision was changed to reporting requirement in the conference report the senate version also had two unique sections related to the c

statement he noted that the act will strengthen the strategic relationship between the united states and india128 with respect to particular provisions president bush stated that the executive branch would construe two sections of the bill as advisory only policy statements in section 103 and the restriction contained in sec tion 104 d 2 on transferring items to india that would not meet nsg guidelines on the first the president cited the constitutions commitment to the presidency of the au thority to conduct the nations foreign affairs on the second the president rais ed the question of whether the provision unconstitutionally delega ted legislative power to an international body in other words the president was questioning wh ether congress were ceding authority to approve us exports to the nsg howeve r us officials including secretary of state rice have formally told congress multiple times that the united states government would abide by nsg guidelines the presidents signing statement also noted that the executive branch would constr ue provisions of th act that mandate regulate or prohibit submission of inform ation to the congress an international organization or the public such as sections 104 109 261 271 272 273 274 and 275 in manner consistent with the pres idents constitutional authority to protect and control information that could impair foreign relations national security the deliberative processes of the executive or the performance of the executives constitutional duties this seems to suggest that the executive branch might limit the scope of reporting required by congress in those sections not just on national security grounds but to protect executive branch processes or performance the implications of the approach outlined in this signing statement will not be clear until the executive branch produces or does not produce as the case may be required reports issues for congress the nuclear cooperation agreement the agreement

to waive the termination of nuclear exportsapplicable us law129 some members of congress ve expressed concern that it may be inconsistent with parts of pl 109401 for example hres 711 which was referred to the house committee on foreign affairs october 4 2007 states that it is the sense of the house of representativ that the bush administration should not propose changes to nsg guidelines til it has resolved all differences of interpretation of the agreement with new delhi and answered all outstanding questions raised by congress regarding pparent inconsistencie s between the nuclear cooperation agreement and pl 109401 nongovernmental experts have also raised questions about severa l aspects of the agreement arguing that they may be inconsistent with pl 109401130 sensitive nuclear technology despite restrictions in pl 109401 regarding us exports of equipment ma terial or technology related to uranium enrichment spent fuel reprocessing or heavy water production the agreement states that sensitive nuclear technology heavy water production technology sensitive nuclear facilities heavy water production facilities and major critical components of such facilities may be transferred under this agreement pursuant to an amendment to this agreement however the agreement also states that transfers of dualus items that could be used in enrichment reprocessing or h eavy water production f acilities will be subject to the parties respective applicable laws regulations and license policies such transfers would therefore be subject to th same restrictions described in pl 109 401 any other transfers of such technolog would require changes to existing us law the state department has said that washington does not intend to negotiate an amendment to the agreement131 furthermore as matter of policy the united states does not transfer dualuse items for use in sensitive nuclear facilities and will not assist india in the design c onstruction or operati on of sensitive nuclear technologies through the transfer of dualuse items whether under the 123 agreement or outside the agreement according to the state department132 nuclear testingright of return pl 109401 does not exempt the agreement from future cutoff in exports if india tests nuclear explosive device again133 however the agreement does not exp licitly mention us responses to such test of such device instead the agreement states that either party shall have thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33016crs40 right to terminate this agreement prior to its expiration on one years written notice to the other party that is the agreement does not limit the grounds upon which the agreement may be terminated similarly the agreement provides that the party seeking termination has the right to cease further cooperati on under this agreement if it determines that mutually acceptable resolution of outstanding issues s not been possible or cannot be achieved through consultations this provision means that nuclear cooperation under the agreement may be terminated by party during the oneyear notice period for termination of the agreement the agreement also specifies that the two governments are to hold consultations prior to ceasing cooperation or terminating the agreement the united states and india are to take into account whether the circumstances that may lead to termination or cessation resulted from partys serious concern about changed security environment or as response to similar actions by other states which could impact national security this provision suggests that in the event th at india conducts nuc lear explosive test new delhi may argue that the agreement should not be terminated and nuclear cooperation should not cease because geopoliti cal circumstances justified the test however in such cases the us right to terminate and cease cooperation under this provision would not be constrained by the results of the consultations with regard to the us right of retu rn section 123 4 of the aea requires that nuclear cooperation agreements include stipulation that the united states shall have the right to require the return of any nuclear materials and equipment tran sferred pursuant thereto and any special nuclear material produced through the use thereof if the cooperating party detonates nuclear explosive device or terminates or abrogates an agreement providing for iaea safeguards the july agreement states that followi ng the cessation of cooperation under this agreement either party has the right to require the return of any nuclear material equipment nonnuclear material or com ponents transferred under this agreement and any special fissionable material produced through their use however the agreement does not say explicitly that future indian test of nuclear explosive device would allow the united states to exercise its right of return rather it provides for right of return whenever pa rty has given notice of termination of the agreement and has ceased nuclear coope ration which would include but not be limited to the circumstances specified in section 123a4 of the aea the agreement also provides that notice by party that is invoking the right of return shall be delivered to the other party on or before the date of termination of this agreement this means that the right of return cannot be exercised after the one year interval prior to the agreements terminationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33016crs41 134 in february 18 2008 statement saran asse rted that under the 123 agreement india is entitled to build strategic

incorporate assurances regarding fuel supply in the bilateral usindi agreement on peaceful uses of nuclear energy under section 123 of the us aea which would be submitted to the us congress the united states will join india in seeking to negotiate with the iaea an indiaspecific fuel supply agreement the united states will support an indi an effort to develop strategic reserve of nuclear fuel to guard against any disruption of supply over the lifetime of indias reactors if despite these above arrangemen ts disruption of fuel supplies to india occurs the two governments would jointly convene group of friendly supplier countries inc luding countries such as russia france and the united kingdom to pursue such measures as would restore fuel supply to india the last two provisions are particularly controversial because they could potentially provide india way to mitigate the effects of us cessation of nuclear exports in the event that for example india tests nuclear weapon134 indeed indian foreign secretary shyam saran asserted in fe bruary 18 2008 statement that under the 123 agreement india is entitled to build strategic fuel reserve to last the lifetime of such reactors and spokesperson for i ndias ruling congress party indicated that reserve supplies of fuel would enable india to continue operating its reactors even if other countries halted coope ration in response to an indian nuclear test135 pl 109401 contains several provisions that could be in tension with the july agreement for example s ection 103 b 10 addresses th issue of fuel reserve any nuclear power

are suspended or terminated similarly section 102 13 ex presses the sense of cong ress that the united states should not seek to f acilitate or encourage the continuation of nuclear exports to india by any other party if such exports are terminated under united states law however president bushs september 10 message transmitting the agreement to congress characterizes the agreements fuelsupply assurances as political commitments that are not legally bindi ng because the agreement is only framework agreement that does not compel specific nuclear cooperation furthermore according to the state depar tment the disruption of fuel supplies referred to in the agreement refers only to disruptions that may result through fault of indias137 regarding the question of nonus suppliers washington has not sought commitments from any other c ountry to supply fuel to india the united states would be compelled to encourage transfers of nuclear fuel to india by other nsg members if supply disruptions occur thr ough fault of indias own according to the state department138 however these assurances are not meant to insulate india against the consequences of nuc lear explosive test or violation of nonproliferation commitments indeed ch us commitments would longer apply if the united states were to terminate the agreem ent in response to an indian nuclear test with respect to fuel reserves the agreement does not define what it means to support an indian effort to develop stra tegic reserve furt hermore the state department suggests that the united states may not supply india with fuel reserve sufficient for the lifetime of indias react ors though the departments 2008 responses to questions for the record do not sp ecify the size of any such reserve139 pl 110369 key provisions as
