6510c14 shspec68 briefing to review auditors there are three key data that go out in an org and therefore are essential to be known by the department of review that lrh hasnt been able to teach tech qual or orgs you will hit them in review because one else will have gotten them 1 high ta is overrun there is other reason for high ta reviews problem is to find what was overrun and how it was overrun when someone comes in who has never been audited and who has never been near another therapy or practice and whose ta is at 50 he has still been overrun on something you just have your work cut out for you in finding it dont throw away the datum the way everyone else has using this datum you are likely to find some interesting things say someone went release on christianity at age six or on exercise at age twenty and then went on past that point doing it some more releases dont only happen in scientology it is likely to be some wisdom or therapy that released him they are all failed technologies all past wisdoms may have had technologies that have been alterised and lost we almost went that route by not recognizing the state of release and the phenomenon of the fn what has been overrun is not necessarily what the pc was running when the ta went high you might have overrun some earlier release it may for instance be restimulation of an earlier overrun communication release the pc could have been problems release and gotten keyed in again on ruds question if the hgc or field auditor didnt repair it by asking as first question what was overrun they would never solve it they would get the wrong overrun you must find what exactly the release was on which or what one was it get the right when and the right what and the ta will blow down and the needle will float youve got to rehab the right release to get the high ta down there could be other overruns on the case too but there is one that is making the high ta get that and the rehab tech will get it to fn quickly or less quickly 2 rollercoaster case has an sp in the vicinity the anatomy of the pts is that of problem postulatecounterpostulate the persons purpose postulate has been or is being suppressed counterpostulate there is other source of rollercoaster an sp gives the pts problem when the pc rollercoasters he has run into postulatecounterpostulate situation since his last gain pts really does make trouble for the auditor the org and himself ethics exists to get tech in if it is ever used to throw tech out it is being used suppressively search and discovery is used to find the suppressions that person has had in life the s and d question is 1 whats been your main purpose in life 2 who opposed it this often makes problems release in minutes with pts or with any problem you want to solve find the source of the counterpostulate man gets solutions to problems he leaves the two opposed postulates in place not knowing the definition of problem and then solves the resulting collision as in dialectical materialism the anatomy of problem gone mad any idea is the product of two forces is the backbone of dialectical materialism to solve problem look over the whole perimeter of counterpostulates and find what is the source of the problem if you handle the problem for the pc often the problem will evaporate for the other person also problems sometimes evaporate in the physical universe when you find the source of the counterpostulate in ethics when you see that the disconnection or the handle causes an enormous problem for the pts or for the other person from whom they are disconnecting you have invariably found the wrong person pts is the manifestation of postulatecounterpostulate find who when where and what you could list what purpose of yours has been thwarted you can get grade i release with this suppressives are now to be ated in review because ethics has flubbed it too much ptss go to ethics after review to have note made of the fact that they ar pts and to get statement made of handle or disconnect pts condition can be caused by suppressive action as well as by suppressive person for instance if you overrun pc past release the pc goes pts to the auditor just as mechanical action selfauditing is potential hidden source of overrun you dont declare the auditor an sp it was suppressive act thats all the definition of pts is connected to suppressive person or action the action could be inadvertent so you find the suppressive person the person may have only been suppressive for five minutes or he may have been suppressive for lifetime someone could be pts and overrun in that case you must get the suppression off and rehab the process suppressive person isnt someone with horns it is someone who has had counterpostulate to the pc person may occasionally commit suppressive acts or he may be habitually suppressive someone who is routinely suppressive in life invalidative of scientology and trying to keep people from getting well is social menace he is the subject of ethics he is the one who gets declared not the auditor who overran process from some inadvertent or stupid mistake when you tell person the right sp it is like locating and indicating bpc you should get blowdown and gis if the pc again rollercoasters youve got another sp so there could be several sps on the case you dont go looking for all of them at the same time but after you find one suppressive look for another one if you found all the sps and suppressive actions in persons lifetime he would be problems release and if he goes release on problems he wont go pts again unless he goes home and starts selfauditing he can overrun himself on selfauditing so be aware of that 3 the source of overts is an earlier misunderstood word the source of the overt is the other key datum that has been missed misunderstood word causes individuation which leads to overts the word that student is arguing with the course supervisor about is later than the one that the student really misunderstood any confusion stupidity or upset in study always stems from misunderstood word earlier than the one he is upset about it is always earlier so the source of the overt is in the formula 1 something is misunderstood 2 the person individuates 3 he commits overts against the misunderstood thing if what the person thought was the misunderstood was the misunderstood the problem would have blown so it is always earlier this datum is the key datum in the area of study and comprehension of existence it regulates persons iq the review action is to look for the earlier area and the earlier word that was misunderstood cf method 1 word clearing you can unburden few words earlier than where you think the misunderstood word is then get the misunderstood just before it you can date the time of the misunderstood you should ask what subject the pc was in person isnt upset with studying it is only misunderstood word it is not case and it is not the environment remember that you are handling fringes on endwords so dont push all the way back into r6 just find what was happening before he hit the thing he doesnt understand so these three data are the only ones that are really important in review 1 high ta overrun 2 rollercoaster pts who is the sp that question is the source of hangups on the track you must find the counterpostulate and the source of the counterpostulate 3 confusion comes from misunderstood word earlier than the one the person is confused about
