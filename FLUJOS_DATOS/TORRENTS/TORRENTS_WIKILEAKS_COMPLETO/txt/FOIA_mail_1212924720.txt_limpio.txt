from michael mann mannmeteopsuedu to phil jones pjonesueaacuk subject request for some additional info date sun 08 jun 2008 073200 0400 replyto mannpsuedu hi phil im continuing to work on your nomination package here in my hotel room in triestethe weather isnt any good if its possible for case to be too strong we may have that here lonnie is also confirmed as supporting letter writer along w kevin ben tom k and jean j 4 of the 5 are already agu fellows which im told is important surprisingly ben is not yet nor am i but david thompson is quite young for one of these im guessing mike wallace and susan solomon might have had something to do w that anyway i wanted to check w you on two things 1 one thing that people sometimes like to know is the maximum value of n where n is the number of papers an individual authoredcoauthored that have more than n citations n40 ie an individual has published at least 40 papers that have each been cited at least 40 times is supposedly an important threshold for admission in the us national academy of sciences im guessing your n is significantly greater than that and it would be nice to cite that if possible would you mind figuring out that number and sendingi think it would be useful is really sealing the case 2 would you mind considering minor revision of your 2 page bibliography in my nomination letter im trying to underscore the diverse areas where youve made major contributions and i think its well known and obvious to many that two of these are instrumental data and paleoclimate reconstructions but it occurs to that it is equally important to stress your work in detection of anthropogenic impacts on climate w both models and observations for example your early nature papers w wigley in 80 and 81 seem to be among the earliest efforts to try to do this though i dont have copies of the papers so cant read them and that seems very much worth highlighting to my suggestion is that you add category on anthropogenic climate signal detection and include this work say 8 or so of the key papers in this area including the two early nature ones w wigley as well as some of your later work w santertettthornehegerlbarnett i realize that most of your work in this area isnt as primary author but i do think it would be helpful to show this side of your research and id like to incorporate that into my nomination letter ie how critical your efforts have been to developments in areas such as da you could still fit this onto 2 pages by making the font smaller for the references 10pt rather than 11 pt while keeping the headings at 11 pt and if necessary you could probably sacrifice few of the surface temperature record references to make space for the additional references also if you happen to have pdfs of the two early wigley papers or even just the text for the abstracts it would be great to have little more detail about those papers so i can appropriately work them into the narrative of my letter thanks for any help mike ps please tell keith i was very sorry he was unable to make it here to trieste i was really looking forward to seeing him as were ed and many others here i hope all is well w his daughter michael mann associate professor director earth system science center essc department of meteorology phone 814 8634075 503 walker building fax 814 8653663 the pennsylvania state university email 1mannpsuedu university park pa 168025013 2httpwwwmetpsuedudeptfacultymannhtm references 1 mailtomannpsuedu 2 httpwwwmetpsuedudeptfacultymannhtm
