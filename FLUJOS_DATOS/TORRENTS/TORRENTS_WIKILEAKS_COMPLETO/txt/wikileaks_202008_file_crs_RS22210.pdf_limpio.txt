bank is defined as having assets less than 1 billion to be adjusted annually by the growth rate of total assets of all federally insured depository institutions key provisions include allowing qualified banks to file shorter version of the quarterly call reports twice per year nonconsecutive quarters providing an exemption from section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act which requires documentation and auditing of internal controls over financial reporting increasing the debttoincome ratio allowable for small bank holding company to pay corporate dividend and still remain eligible for expedited processing processing from 11 to 31 requiring community bank impact analysis when federal banking agency revises or issues regulations of insured depository institutions and establishing seasoned customer ctr exemption which would exempt depository institutions from reporting currency transactions for qualified customers in addition the bill would give banks that do not share customer information the option of sending privacy notices to customers only when the banks privacy policy changes instead of annually as the grammleachbliley act requires 1 the bill would direct regulators to give more leeway for bank borrowers to waive their threeday right of rescission so they might use their loan funds more quickly its benefits above are targeted at banking comp anies forming the

billion in assets have become disadvantaged by many regulations and taxes in their view the smallest institutions and their competitors such as credit unions are exempt from many of these burdens while the largest financial players can comply at lower costs because of efficiencies of scale from larger operational and income bases they state that they are currently caught in the middle so that merger with larger institution2 might be the only alternative to withering away under regulatory and tax burdens regulators seemingly could provide many regulatory relief elements addressed by this measure by using their existing authority for paperw ork reduction and similar streamlining the regulatory flexibility act of 1980 and subsequent laws require all federal regulatory agencies to consider the economic impact of their rules on small entities3 in particular the economic growth and regulatory paperwork reduction act of 1996 requires that federal financial regulatory agencies identify outdated unnecessary or unduly burdensome statutory or regulatory requirements the agencies must then eliminate unnecessary regulations to the appropriate extent the regulator of many community banks the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic has been coordinating this effort 4 thus some proposals in this measure might not require legislative authorization since the growth of the financia l economy with the emergence of trilliondollar banking companies has led many observers to characterize banks of up to 1 billion in assets be considered as small in industry context5 as an example of regulatory rather than legislative change under way the federal banking regulators granted these intermediate small banks some community reinvestment act compliance relief in 20056 proponents of this measure and even more comprehensive statutory regulatory relief for financial businesses however believe that legislation is better mechanism to gain the changes they desire g22g138g161g561g18g155g152g159g146g156g146g152g151g156g561 the communities first act is also fiscal measure as the bill contains series of tax provisions some of these provisions are generally applicable to broad range of taxpayers some are focused on community banks and others apply to subchapter s corporations all of them seemingly would require statutory changes to the internal revenue code of 1986 its generally applicable provisions are more significant in potential cost than its focused provisions perhaps the most important at least from revenue cost perspective is the repeal of the alternative minimum tax for individuals which has been estimated to cost 842 billion over fy2008fy2017 7 second general provision would permanently extend current section 179 expensing for small businesses another provision would allow the deferral of tax on interest earned on certificates of deposit cds held by individuals until the cd matures and lowering the top rate of tax on such interest to the capital gains tax rate currently 15 basically this 2 see crs report rl30516 mergers and consolidation between banking and financial services firms trends and prospects by walter w

general provision permits roth ira accounts for children under the age of 25 fifth provision would allow interest on agricultural loans and home loans in rural areas defined by the secretary of agriculture with population of less than 2500 to be excluded from income the bill also includes an increase in the cap for certain small issue private activity bonds from 10 million to 30 million where there is limited amount of associated capital expenditures8 finally the bill allows certain banks and similar financial institutions to elect to be taxed as partnerships rather than corporations treatment that is generally beneficial because partnerships pay only the individual level tax while corporations pay corporate tax and their shareholders then pay taxes on dividends and capital gains at the individual level the measure contains provisions more narrowly focused on community banks and holding companies for banks with assets of 5 billion or less the bill would allow credit for 20 of tax liability for corporations up to 250000 and an exclusion of 20 of income for subchapter s small corporations that elect to be taxed as partnerships up to 1250000 it would increase these percentages to 50 and double the ceilings for qualified banks in distressed areas banks with less than 5 billion in assets would not have to pay alternative minimum tax the measure also contains provisions focused on s ubchapter s corporations it would increase the s corporation shareholder limit from 100 to 150 and change the treatment of bad debt reserves for s corporations that convert from c corporations the measure would also allow s corporation banks to issue preferred class stoc k and exclude the banks qualifying directors shares from counting toward their shareholder limit while the independent community bankers of ameri ca has said that it supports this bill which they believe would provide regulatory relief for community banks and tax reform to small businesses individuals and community banks the scope of some of the bills tax provisions is however quite broad and extends beyond reducing the taxes of these banks 9 the repeal of the individual alternative minimum tax and the intere st provision could be particularly costly as mentioned above repealing the amt is estimated to cost 842 billion over fy2008fy2017 in addition the interest provision would provide powerful incentive to shift interestearning assets into cds eligible for preferential taxation in 2003 127 billion of interest was reported on tax returns in addition some receipts reported as dividends reflect interest earned through mutual funds the revenue loss resulting from large shift of this interest into eligible cds could be in the billions of dollars under the proposal the tax on many types of investments financed by debt would become negative ie subsidy rather than tax for example on agricultural loans the farmer could deduct the interest which offsets any tax on the return this filer pays leading to zero effective tax rate at the individual farmer level the deduction of interest is entirely appropriate in an income tax system however the tax is probably already negative at the farmer level because it is nominal interest that is deductible that is debt finance is somewhat subsidized due to inflation and because the owner has deducted some investment on farm when incurred overall the firm level tax on debt financed investment tends to be negative during inflationary periods and it is more negative for those businesses with significant tax benefits in addition however the bank 8 these are bonds that finance private development as opposed to bonds for government purposes such as schools see crs report rl31457 private activity bonds an introduction by steven

exclude the interest received but deduct any interest paid to depositors in the bank thus at the bank level ignoring any yield spread there is subsidy negative tax provided at the current tax rate allowing the bank to deduct interest payments is appropriate but only if the interest received is taxable finally the one level at which some tax might be collected is at the individual level but here the tax is deferred and the rate reduced the provisions with cliffs benefit allowed only for firms under certain size could create powerful disincentives for growth around the cliff the measure phases out most tax benefits aimed at small businesses as their size becomes larger g17g158g157g149g152g152g148g561 additional proponents of tax provisions may include certain communities farmers manufacturers investment bankers offering m unicipal bonds and recipients and issuers of deposit interest on cds additional supporters of banking relief proposals are likely to include federal and especially state supervisors of banks smaller than the cliff sizes of the measure plus industry trade associations whose membership includes banks of all sizes and holding companies owning them opponents may include cr edit unions which are not pleased with this measure because banks would get tax benefits while continuing to attack tax benefits of credit unions the department of the treasury may object to the measures bankrelated tax breaks since it has often opposed many tax relief proposals for bankers and their customers the measure would alter the tax climate for economic sectors beyond banking and could thus face additional objections from those not benefitted and thoseincluding the treasuryconcerned over nonbankrelated revenue losses similar legislation was introduced in the 109th congress and hearings were held by the house financial institutions subcommittee on may 19 and june 9 2005 and by the senate banking committee on june 21 2005 that explored
