are accounted for through the hi trust fund maintained by the department of the treasury the trust fund is an accounting mechanism there is actual transfer of money into and out of the fund income to the trust fund primarily payroll taxes is credited to the fund in the form of interestbearing government securities expenditures for services and administrative costs are recorded against the fund the securities represent obligations that the government has issued to itself as long as the trust fund has balance the treasury department is authorized to make payments for it from the us treasury

earnings the selfemployed pay 29 unlike social security there is upper limit on earnings subject to the tax1 additional income consists of 1 premiums paid by voluntary enrollees who are not automatically entitled to medicare part through their or their spouses work in covered employment 2 government credits and 3 interest on federal securities held by the trust fund since 1994 the hi fund has had an additional funding source the omnibus budget reconc iliation act of 1993 obra 93 increased the maximum amount of social security benefits subject to income tax from 50 to 85 and provided that the additional revenues would be credited to the hi trust fund payments are made from the trust fund for covered part benefits namely hospital services skilled nursing facility services some home health services and hospice care payments are also made for administrative costs associated with operating the program g4g152g138g155g141g561g152g143g561g22g155g158g156g157g142g142g156g561

insolvent in 2019 the same year as projected in the 2007 report but at an earlier point within the year this reflects projections of slightly lower payroll tax income and slightly higher benefit costs the 2008 report projects insolvency seven years earlier than did the 2003 report issued prior to the enactment of mma3 that law added to hi costs primarily through higher payments to rural hospitals and to private plans under the ma program beginning in 2004 tax income from payroll taxes and from the taxation of social security benefits began to be less than expenditures expenditures will exceed total income beginning in 20104 if income falls short of expenditures costs are met by drawing on hi fund assets through transfers from the general fund of the treasury until the fund is depleted

fails to meet the shortrange ie 10year 20082017 test of financial adequacy since total hi assets at the start of the year are estimated to decline to below 100 of expenditures during 2013 further substantial actuarial deficit exists over the full longrange projection period 2008 2082 for projections beyond 2017 the trustees do not use actual dollar figures due to the difficulty of comparing dollar values for different time periods instead they measure longrange financial soundness by comparing the funds income rate the ratio of tax income to taxable payroll with its cost rate the ratio of expenditures for insured persons to taxable payroll 5 under the 2008 intermediate assumptions the trustees state that cost rates are projected to exceed income rates by steadily and rapidly growing margin in 2008 the income rate is projected at 310 while the cost rate is projected at 324 negative gap of 014 percentage points compared to negative 002 percentage points in 2007 this gap is projected to widen to 051 in 2015 100 in 2020 and 787 in 2082 by 2082 tax income will cover less than onethird of projected expenditures summarized over the 75year period the actuarial deficit is 354 the 3 for history of projections see crs report rs20946 medicare history of part trust fund insolvency projections by jennifer osullivan 4 generally total income to the trust fund has ex ceeded expenditures however this trend was reversed from 1995 to 1997 in 1998 income again began exceeding expenditures in addition expenditures actually declined from the previous years levels for each of three fiscal years fy 1998 fy1999 and fy2000 and for two calendar years 1998 and 1999 5 the cost rate calculations exclude expenditures for the relatively small number of persons who buy into part

for projecting immigration in the absence of this change the hi actuarial deficit would have increased looked at another way the trustees estimate the present value of unfunded hi obligations through 2082 at 124 trillion the trustees state that substantial changes would be required to maintain financial soundness over the 75year projection period for example income could be increased by immediately increasing the payroll tax rate for employees and employer s combined from 290 to 644 alternatively expenditures could be reduced but this would require an immediate decrease in benefits of 51 these changes could be implemented more gradually through the period but they would ultimately have to be more stringent g18g155g152g147g142g140g157g146g152g151g561g8g138g140g157g152g155g156g561 the trustees projections of income and outgo reflect several demographic and economic variables these include the consumer price index fertility rate workforce size and wage increases and life expectancy they also include estimates specific to the hi program including the use and cost of inpatient hospital skilled nursing facility and home health services beginning in 2011 the program will also begin to experience the impact of major demographic changes first baby boomers persons born between 1946 and 1964 begin to turn age 65 and become eligible for medicare the baby boom population is likely to live longer than previous generations this will mean an increase in the number of old beneficiaries ie those 85 and over the combination of these factors is estimated to contribute to the increase in the size of the hi population from 438 million in 2007 to 475 million in 2011 and 784 million in 2030 accompanying this significant increase is sh ift in the number of covered workers supporting each hi enrollee in 2007 there were about 38 this number is predicted to decrease to 24 in 2030 and 21 by 2080 the combination of expenditure and demographic factors results in an increase in the size of the hi program relative to other sectors of the economy according to the 2008 report if changes are made in current medicare law the hi programs cost is expected to rise from 149 of gdp in 2007 to 267 in 2030 and 473 in 2080

focus of concern was the hi fund more recently attention has also turned to the rapid increase in smi costs which have been growing significantly faster than gdp for number of years the trustees have been emphasizing the importance of considering the program as whole and the fact that the projected increases are unsustainable over time to further emphasize this point in 2002 they began issuing single report covering the entire program the enactment of mma made the consideration of the future of the total program more critical the legislation increased spending under parts b and c in addition it added new prescription drug benefit under part d spending for this benefit is recorded as separate account in the smi trust fund the trustees note that these changes have important implications in 2005 total medicare expenditures represented 272 of gdp in 2006 the first year of the new drug benefit total expenditures were 308 of gdp the percentage is expected to increase to 700 by 2035 and to 1069 by 2080 the trustees note that over the past 50 years total federal tax receipts have averaged 11 of gdp they further note that projected medicare costs will exceed those for social security by 2028 and be 85 more than the cost of social security by 2082 there will also be shift in the sources of medicare income in 2007 hi payroll taxes accounted for 43 of total noninterest income to the program general revenues represented 41 and beneficiary premiums accounted for 12 by 2018 just prior to the projected exhaustion of the hi fund payroll tax income will account for smaller portion 37 while the portion paid for by general revenues will grow to 44 and the portion paid by premiums will grow to 13

measure comes from taxes paid by the under65 population in response mma section 801 required the trustees report to include an expanded analysis of medicare expenditures and revenues specifically determination must be made as to whether general revenue financing will exceed 45 of total medicare outlays within the next seven years general revenues financing is defined as total medicare outlays minus dedicated financing sources ie hi payroll taxes income from taxation of social security benefits state transfers for prescription drug benefits premiums paid under parts b and d and any gifts received by the trust funds the 2006 report projected that the 45 level would first be exceeded in fy2012 the 2007 report projected that it would first be exceeded in 2013 while the 2008 report projects the first year at 2014 the three findings were within the required sevenyear test period the reports therefore made determination of excess general revenue medicare funding cbo projects the 45 level will be reached in fy2013 mma sections 802804 requires that if an excess general revenue funding determination is made for two successive years the president is required to submit legislative proposal to respond to the warning 6 the president submitted proposal on february 15 20087 submission of legislative proposal will also be required in early 2009 the congress is required to consider the proposals on an expedited basis however passage of legislation within specific time frame is not required 6 see crs report rs22796 medicare trigger by hinda chaikind and christopher m davis 7 see

that the problems facing medicare are more urgent than those facing social security the issues confronting the program are unlikely to get any easier there are simple solutions to address the problems raised by the aging of the population the rapid rise in health care costs and the advances in health care delivery and medical technology trustees and many other observers continue to warn that the magnitude of the impending deficit and the expanding drain on the federal budget need to be addressed at the same time observers express concern about the impact of any solution on beneficiaries outofpocket costs it seems likely that in the short term congress will focus its attention on specific medicare issuesfor example physician payment updates it may also consider medicare spending reductions as part of legislation such as budget reconciliation signed to reduce overall federal spending below specified levels over specific time period
