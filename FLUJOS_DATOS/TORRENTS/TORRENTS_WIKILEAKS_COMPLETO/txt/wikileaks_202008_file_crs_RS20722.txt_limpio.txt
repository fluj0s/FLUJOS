continued crs6 committee organization the committee assignment process begins prior to the convening of new congress and mostly within the party groups the republican and democratic conferences the only action visible on the chamber floor is the adoption of resolutions assigning senators from each party to committees agreed upon by the respective party conference the adoption of both resolutions is routine and occurs without amendment because of the tacit understanding that each party has right to establish its own internal distribution of work without amendment from the other25 on the opening days of the 108th through 110th congresses there were committee assignment resolutions they were considered on other days on the opening day of the 107th congress the only committee assignment resolution taken up was one that designated committee chairs26 due to the senates equal division in that congress democrats chaired committees prior to january 20 2001 effective january 20 2001 with the inauguration of the republican president and vice president republican senators became committee chairmen27 this arrangement lapsed when democrats regained control of the senate for the balance of
