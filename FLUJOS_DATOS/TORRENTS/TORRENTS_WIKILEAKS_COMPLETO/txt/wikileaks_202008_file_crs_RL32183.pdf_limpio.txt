programs include environmental clea nup environmental compliance pollution prevention environmental technology and conservation in addition the department of energy doe is responsible for mana ging defense nuclear waste and cleaning up contaminated nuclear weapons sites some of the ongoing issues associated with these programs are the adequacy cost and pace of cleanup whether dod and doe adequately comply with environmental laws and regulations and the extent to which environmental requirements encr oach upon military readiness the national defense authorizati on act for fy2004 pl 108136 hr 1588 authorized 131 billion for cleanup at active military installa tions and formerly used defense sites fuds about 40 million more than requested fuds are former military facilities that were deco mmissioned prior to the rounds of base closings that began in 1988 an increase was authorized for speeding up the pace of cleanup at these sites the law also authorized 370 million for cleanup and other activities at base closure sites the same as requested as in past years the law includes lineitems for few other environmental activities but does not specify the authorization for all of dods other envir onmental programs rather their funding is authorized as part of several larger accounts for does cleanup of defense nuclear waste sites the w authorized 681 billion the sa as requested it also includes numerous environmental provisions that affect military activities among the most controversial are those that gr ant exemptions from certain requirements under the endangered species act and th marine mammal prot ection act which dod requested under its readiness and range preservation initiative rrpi in addition to the above authorization legislation congress has completed the three appropriations bills that fund th activities in fy2004 the department of defense appropriations act for fy2004 pl 10887 hr 2658 provided nearly 135 billion for cleanup at

programs focus on cleaning up past contamination and on complying w ith environmental ws and regulations that apply to ongoing operations three ot her programs have smaller budgets they focus on pollution prevention environmental technology and conservation of natural and cultural resources the administration requested total of 38 billion for these activities for fy2004 about 400 million less th an the fy2003 funding level of 42 billion the requested decrease was primar ily due to the completion of longterm environmental compliance projects fewer cleanup projects planned at base closure sites and the completion of numerous one time projects that received congressionally directed funds in fy2003 background information on each of dods environmental programs and an analysis of key implementation i ssues are discussed below refer to page 15 for discu ssion of authorized nd appropriated funding levels for fy2004 and provisions in authoriz ing legislation that provide exemptions from certain requirements under the ndangered species act and the marine mammal protection act environmental cleanup in 1975 dod established an installation re storation program to investigate and clean up sites on military lands where past waste management practices had led to environmental contamin ation few years later th comprehensive environmental response comp ensation and liability act of 1980 cercla created the superfund program to clean up hazardous wa ste sites that pose the greatest risk to public health and the environment in the united states and it created the national priorities list npl to track them3 the law also established formal framework for the identification investigation and cleanup of hazardous substances initially the extent to which dod had to comply with these requirements was unclear however the superfund amendm ents and reauthorization act of 1986 sara specified that dod and all other fe deral agencies are subject to cerclas requirements for identifying evaluating and cleaning up npl sites under their jurisdiction4 the resource conservation and recovery act rcra also requires dod and all other federal agencies to perform corrective actions to clean up contamination at sites with active haza rdous waste manageme nt or solid waste disposal facilities operating with permits issued under rcra5 in addition to specifying the

installations where past actions led to contamination6 as complement to this program dod tablished military munitions response program to fulfill requireme nts under sections 311 and 312 of the national defense authorization act for fy2002 pl 107107 to identify investigate and clean up unexploded ordnance uxo and other mun itions at nonoperational training ranges in the united states the following sections explain the role of epa and the states in conducting oversight of dods cleanup activ ities indicate cleanup status and costs explain appropriations account structure and di scuss cleanup efforts at overseas military installations oversight of cleanup activities while dod is responsible for funding and conducting cleanup actions at its sites epa and the states conduct oversight of these actions to determine whether dod co mplies with the law generally epa takes the lead in performing oversig ht of dod sites being cleaned up under cercla and epa delegates fe deral authority to the states for conducting oversight of corrective actions taken under rcra cleanup requirements under cercla and rcra apply only within the united states the cleanup of contamination at overseas military installations is subject to requirements specified in the status of forces agreement with each host nation these requirements are generally not as strict as cercla and rcra and their stringency varies widely from country to country unlike domestic cleanup actions epa does not have the author ity to conduct oversight at military installations abroad rather overseeing dods actions to ensure that the requirements of status of forces agreement are met is the responsibility of each host nation cleanup status and costs until fy1994 dod primarily concentrated its cleanup efforts on identifying and investiga ting contaminated site s to determine the level of remediation that would be necessary to protect human health and the environment as the majority of sites were identified and subsequent investigations were completed dod began to focus the bulk of its efforts on actual cleanup in fy1996 dod also developed specific cleanup go als to prioritize its sites based on threats of exposure as indicated in figure 2 dod had identified tota l of 29696 contaminated sites as of the end of fy20027 at that time dod had completed cleanup at 20491 of those sites 69 of tota l sites at cost of 202 b illion and reported that almost 302 billion would be necessary to finish cleanup at the remaining 9205 sites 31 of total sites from fy 2003 to site

installations in the united states as of september 30 2002 even though less than 13 of contaminated sites are still in need of cleanup the above estimates of future clea nup costs are substantially higher than has already been spent due to the severity of contamination at these remaining sites and the resources that likely will be necessary to addres s contamination by unexploded ordnance uxo dod expects that estimates of fundi ng needs will likely increase in future years as additional sites with uxo conta mination are identified and the extent of such contamination is determined funding needs for cleanup also may ri in future years as additional military bases are selected for clos ure the national defense authorization act for fy2002 pl 107107 authorized new round of military base closings in 2005 the amount of funding that would be necessary to accelerate cleanup at new base closure sites in order to transfer them to other uses would depend on the type and extent of contamination present at such installations appropriations account structure cleanup costs at domestic military sites are funded by several cen tralized accounts structured by category of installation funding for cleanup at current and former military installations is authorized under five defense environmental restoration ccounts in the annual authorization bill for national defense and is ppropriated to these accounts in the annual appropriations bill for the department of defense thr ee of these accounts reserve funding for the army navy and air force one devotes funding to more general category of defensewide sites and anot her is dedicated to cleaning up formerly used defensehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32183crs6 8 congress first appropriated funding to the defense environmental restoration account in fy1984 subsequently the national defens authorization act for fy1997 pl 104201 divided the account into four subaccounts army navy air force and defensewide since then congress also has specified the amount of funding reserved for cleaning up fuds sites and the national defense authorization act for fy2001 pl 106398 established fuds subaccount to c onform with this budgetary practice 9 department of defense defense environmental quality program annual report to congress for fy2001 september 2002 p 29sites fuds8 typically fuds are properties th at dod owned or leased in the past and are now devoted to civilian uses many of the fuds sites were used during the world war ii era and prior years cleanup at base closure sites is au thorized separately under the base realignment and closure brac account in the annual authorization bill for national defense appropria tions for base closure ac tivities are provided under the brac account in the annual appropriations bill for milita ry construction congress authorized four rounds of base closures in 1 988 1991 1993 and 1995 and established separate brac account for each round overseas military installations while there are several centralized accounts to fund cleanup activities at domes tic military installations there are lineitem accounts in the pres idents annual budget submi ssion or in annual defense authorization legislation or appropriations to conduc t cleanup actions at overseas military installations rather these pr ojects are funded on an installationby installation basis out of th general operational budget for each foreign base dod does not have the authority to transfer funding from the cleanup accounts for domestic installations to addr ess contamination abroad dod is not required to report to congre ss on the status of cleanup actions at overseas military installations as the agency is required to do for domestic facilities in its annual report on the defense envir onmental restoration program the only type of information that dod is require d to submit to congress regarding overseas cleanup is statement of the amounts expended and antic ipated to be expended as part of its annual report to congress on the defense envi ronmental quality program the most recent version of this report indicated that dod spent total of 196 million in fy2001 on overseas environmental cl eanup the report also indicated that 131 million was available from appropria tions in fy2002 and that in fy2003 182 million would be required for overseas cleanup obligations9httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32183crs7 10 42 usc 6961environmental compliance dod and all other federal agencies are re quired to comply with environmental laws and regulations to the same extent as any other entity typically environmental compliance projects at military installations include routine operations such as storing and disposing of solid and hazardous waste upgra ding and monitoring waste water treatment plants nd testing and replacing underground storage tanks the following sections provide information on environmental comp liance requirements under federal law examine funding tre nds for military compliance activities and indicate the amount of fines and penaltie s assessed against dod for environmental violations compliance requirement s under federal law the federal environmental statutes that most commonly apply to routine military operations include the clean air act clean water act resource conser vation and recovery act rcra and safe drinking water act the federal facility compliance act of 1992 amended rcra to clar ify in detail that dod and all other fede ral facilities are subject to penalties fines permit fees reviews of plans or studies and inspection and monitoring of facilities in connection with federal stat interstate or local solid or hazardous waste regulatory programs10 the act also authorized and directed epa to take enforcement actions under rcra against any federal agency to the same extent that it would against any other entity although the safe drinking water act includes similar language other federal environmental laws do not include the same clarification of compliance requirements funding trends dod did not begin to track the amount of funding spent on environmental complia nce activities until fy1990 there are centralized accounts for these activities in annual fense authorization legislation or appropriations bills as there are for nvironmental cleanup activities instead funding for compliance primarily comes from the accounts for operation and maintenance military construction and procurement dods budget for environmental compliance peaked at 223 billion in fy1996 but has since declined as dod reports that its pollution preventi on efforts have reduced the generation of waste lessening the need for treatment and disposal and other compliance actions fines for violations of environmental requirements although dod is required to comply with environmenta l laws and regulations and has dedicated budget for such activities the extent to which dod fulfills these responsibilities has been longstanding issue as explaine d above federal envir onmental laws require federal facilities to comply with all federal state interstate and local environmental requirements and such laws authorize ep the states and local governments to assess fines against dod for violations howe ver fine is not always paid in the same year that it is asse ssed and in some cases dod doe s not make cash payment to satisfy fine instead dod may agree to perform supplemental environmental project sep in lieu of cash payment under such an agreement dod not only corrects its actions to comply with the environmental requireme nt at hand but also performs an additional project that nhances environmental quality regulatoryhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32183crs8 11 pl 10665 section 322 12

prepared by the congressional research servic with data from the department of defense other environmental programs in addition to environmental cl eanup and compliance activities dod administers three other programs that focus on pollution prevention environmental technology and conservation the purpos of the pollution prevention program is to reduce or eliminate solid or hazardous waste from being generated as means to eliminate potential environmental problems before they occur the environmental technology program supports re search development tes ting and demonstration of more efficient and less costly methods to clean up and manage solid and hazardous waste the conservation prog ram aims to protect the natural historical and cultural resources of the 25 million acres of public land that dod administers including the protection of endangered species dod began tracking the budget for these programs in fy1993 although they are an integral part of dods environmenta l strategy their funding is significantly smaller than the programs for envir onmental cleanup and compliance like compliance there are centralized accounts for pollution prevention

accounts department of energy in the late 1980s the united states ceas ed its production of nuclear weapons due to military projections that the nucl ear weapons stockpile was sufficient to protect national security and respond to fu ture threats however environmental problems associated with storing radioac tive materials involved in the production of nuclear weapons continue to pose risk to human health and safety today since the beginning of the us atomic energy pr ogram doe and its predecessors have been responsible for managing defense nuclear w eapons and related wast in later years doe expanded its efforts to include the environmental restora tion of radioactive sites and those with other hazardous contamination to sure their safety for future uses in 1989 the bush administration tablished an envir onmental management program within doe to consolidate the agencys efforts in cleaning up contamination from defense nuclear waste as well as waste from civilian

transport nd dispose of radioactive and other hazardous waste resulting from the production of defense nuclear materials15 waste disposal typically involves cleanup actions such as the decontamination of buildings and structures and the removal of contaminated soil doe is also subject to requirements under various federal environmental laws in carrying out its responsibilities under the atomic

sites are relatively small and are among the leas t hazardous the sites where cleanup is underway contain some of the most severe ly contaminated areas doe estimates that cleanup at the remaining 39 sites may take 70 years to complete and that total cleanup costs may range from 220 billion to 300 billion if program reforms are not initiated substantially higher than the estimate of 147 billion made in 199818 the bush administrations cleanup reform initiative the current administration has been wo rking on cleanup reform initiative that would accelerate cleanup and lower costs doe estimates that its initiative could save between 50 billion and 100 billion in total cleanup costs over the long term and that the time frame for total site cleanup could be moved from 2070 to 2035 these goals would be accomplished by assessing the risk of exposure to determine which cleanup remedies are selected risk is currently one of many factors that doe uses to select cleanup remedi altering the current process to use risk as the primary factor could result in decisions to contain waste on site as means of preventing exposure rather than removi ng it while containment can often be accomplished more quickly and at less co st the possibility of future exposure remains if the method of containment fails over time states and localities have expressed concern over this approach the amount of time and money needed to clean up nuclear waste sites is major issue however questions have been ra ised as to how doe would use riskbased approach to accomplish its goals of faster and less costly cleanups without weakening environmental protection so have drawn atte ntion to the possibility that basing the selection of cleanup remedies on risk alone might result in more contamination being left on site rather being removed because of the substantial amount of time often required for radioactive decay to occur arguments have been raised that contamination left in place may migrate in unexpected ways over the long term and result in pathways of exposure that could not have been predicted when the remedy was originally selected others counter that comple tely removing radioactive contamination from all sites to permit unrestricted future land use and eliminate all future pathways of exposure would not be economically feasible and in some cases would be beyond the capabilities of current cleanup technologies doe is in the early stages of impleme nting its cleanup reform initiative the specific measures that would be taken to speed the pace of cleanup and reduce costs remain unclear thus far doe has comp leted performance management plans to accelerate cleanup at many of its sites these plans outline goals to reduce the amount of time required to co mplete individual projects and they propose riskbased initiatives to accomplish these goals however many of these in itiatives would entail cleanup actions that are different th an those specified in existing compliance agreements that doe has previously negotiated with epa and the states because these agreements are legally binding doe would be required to renegotiate them tohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32183crs12 19 under privatization contract private entity is responsible for financing the entire cost of cleanup project and is not paid by the fe deral government until the project is completed and performed according to contractually specified requirements this type of contract differs from the traditional approach of payi ng contractor fi xed amount up front and offering additional cash incentives to encourag the completion of project within certain time frame privatization contracts generally have the potential to provide the contractor with greater incentive to control costs and work more efficiently since payment is not rendered until performance is complete and the cleanup objective has been achievedthe satisfaction of the other parties prior to engaging in cleanup action that would differ from that agreed upon in the past if proposed riskbased action were to result in more waste being left on site epa or the states may be resistant to revising existing agreements that may be perceived as offering greater degree of environmental protection over the long term the successful renegotiation of the compliance agreement for each site will be critical factor in determining whether the administration is able to implement its proposed cleanup reforms if mutual agreement is reached funding for implementation would be subj ect to congressional approval appropriations account structure congress authorizes funding for does defense environmenta l restoration and waste management activities in the annual authorizati on bill for national defense and appropriates funding for them in the annual appropriations bill for energy and water development in recent years c ongress had provided this funding under three centralized accounts the defense environmental restoration and waste management account had funded cleanup and waste management activities at nuclear weapons sites where all respons actions are projected to

related to does environmental management program is the perceived need for longterm centralized repository for highl evel defense nuclear waste while the waste isolation pilot plant in new mexico serves as centralized repository for transuranic plutoniumcont aminated defense nuclear waste high level waste is currently stored at individual sites the nuclear waste policy act of 1982 as amended in 1987 required doe to study the suitability of yucca mountain in nevada for constructing centralized underground geological repository for high level defense nuclear waste as well as civilian radioactive waste generated by nuclear power plants the federal government and the nuclear power industry contribute funding to support the study and velopment of such repository the state of nevada has strongly oppos ed the selection of yucca mountain for an underground repository due to numerous sa fety concerns such as the possibility of seismological disturbances and underground flooding and the potential for groundwater contamination ove r time doe contends th at scientific evidence indicates that the conditions at yucca m ountain would likely be suitable for long term underground waste storage and that effo rts to study the site should continue environmental organizations have oppos ed the development of centralized repository due to concerns over the safety of transporting highlevel radioactive waste across many states to one location and the potential for terrorist threats along with environmental concerns about the site that are simila r to those of the state of nevada president bush selected yucca m ountain for the development of an underground nuclear waste repository in febr uary 2002 this action cleared the way for doe to proceed with its plans to prep are and submit license application to the nuclear regulatory commission for the construction of the facility doe plans to submit license application in 2004 and to begin receiving waste shipments in

imposed restrictions on combat training exercises key component of military readiness22 the initiative proposed targeted exemptions for military readiness activities from certain require ments under five federal nvironmental laws including the clean air act comprehensive envi ronmental response compensation and liability act cercla endangered species act marine mammal protection act and solid waste disposal act while dod provided some evidence of training restric tions at specific installations the department did not provide comprehensive data to indicate the extent to which environm ental requirements have limited training opportunities and compromised readiness capabilities overall dods request for additional exemption authority without providing that informa tion raised questions among some members of congress the states and environmenta l organizations who expressed concern that environmental protection might be compromised unnecessarily while most federal environmental laws

facilities on casebycase basis such exemptions may be granted if doing so would be either in the paramount interest of th united states or in the i nterest of national security most of these exemptions are limited to one year but can be renewed the safe drinking water act does not impose time limit on exemptions from compliance under the endangered species act special committee shall grant an exemption if the secretary of defense finds it necessary for national security this committee may place time limit on an exemption but it is not required to do so under the law dod argues that existing exemptions are too onerous and timeconsuming to obtain on casebycase basis due to the va st number of training exercises that it conducts on hundreds of military installations across the country dod also argues that the time limitations placed upon most exem ptions are not compatible with many training activities due to their ongoing or recurring nature instead dod favors modifications to numerous environmenta l statutes that would provide greater flexibility for conducting combat training and other readin ess activities without restriction or delay howe ver some states and envi ronmental organizations have opposed such modifications and argue that existing exemptions are sufficient to accommodate combat training needs the cumulative effect of environmental requirements on military readiness capabilities is difficult to determine due to the lack of system to comprehensively track individual cases in which training s been restricted or compromised in 2002 the general accounting office gao found that dods readiness reports do not indicate the extent to which environmenta l requirements restri ct combat training activities and that such reports indicate high level of readiness overall24 however gao noted individual instances of envir onmental restrictions at numerous military installations and in light of this fact recommended that dods reporting system be improved to more accurately identify problems for training that might be attributed to restrictions imposed by environmenta l requirements more recent gao report found that environmental restri ctions are only one of severa l factors including urban growth that affect dods ab ility to carry out training activities and that dod continues to be unable to measure th impact of

significant natural resources are present dod must prepare these plans in cooperation with the fish and wildlife service and state fish and wildlife agencies to reach mutual agreement on the conservation protection and mana gement of fish and wildlife resources however the law also requires these plans to be consistent with the use of the military installation to ensure the preparedness of the armed forces and as appropriate and applicable not to result in the net loss of the installations capability to support its missiondod originally submitted its rrpi to congress in 2002 requesting broad exemption from the migratory bird treaty act in addition to targeted exemptions from the five other federal environmental laws mentione d above congress provided an interim exemption from the migratory bird treaty act in the national defense authorization act for fy2003 pl 107314 but did not approve exemptions from the other statutes which dod had requested26 in enacting pl 108136 congress approved exemptions from certain require ments under the endangered species act and the marine mammal protection act after considerable debate these exemptions are similar to those dod proposed while the exemptions from the marine mammal protection act apply specifically to military readiness activities and to federal scientific research those that address the endangered species act apply to military lands in general and are not restricted in their applicability to training or other readiness activities while congress did not approve dods pr oposed changes to the clean air act cercla or solid waste disposal act it did require dod to submit report to identify the extent to which these three statutes have affected military readiness provisions in pl 108136 that amend th endangered species act and marine mammal protection act are discussed below27 interest in the issue of whether environmental requirements compromise military readiness will likely continue endangered species act section 318 of pl 108136 amends the endangered species act to allow military lands to be exempt from being designated as critical habitat if certa in conditions are met dod stated that it requested this exemption to clarify the statutory authority for the fish and wildlife services past practice of not designating critical habitat on military installations if an integrated natural resources management plan inrmp providing acceptable species protection is in place28 this practice which has been controversial was introduced administratively under the clinton administration to allow in rmps to serve as substitute for critical habitat designation when they were deemed to provide adequate protection these plans integrate the mission needs of military installation with the management of natural resources including the protection of endangered and threatened species buthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32183crs19 29 section 7a2 of the endangered specie s act 16 usc 1536a2 requires federal agencies including dod to consult with the secretary of the interior or secretary of commerce in order to ensure that agency activities would not likely jeopardize the continued existence of any endangered or thre atened species or result in the destruction or adverse modification of critical habitat 30 in january 2003 us district court in arizona struck down the fish and wildlife services interpretation of the endangered sp ecies act that had eliminated designations where other protections were provided th is ruling may have affected the analogous practice of excluding military lands from designation center for biological diversity v gale norton secretary of the department of the interior 240 f supp 2d 1090 daz 2003 31 section 9 16 usc 1538 prohibits the

other hand is designated after considering several factors which can include military readiness needs and requires consultation for any proposed fede ral action that might potentially harm species or its critical habitat29 the endangered species act contains minimum requirements federal action must meet to protect species and its critical habitat beyond which the federal agency has flexibility in choosing alternatives from the standpoint of military readine ss dod has argued that inrmps are more suitable for military installations than critical habitat designations because they provide greater flexibility to consider training needs when developing measures to protect species dod asked congress to provide explicit statutory authority to prevent legal challenges that could halt the fish and wildlife services acceptance of inrmps in lieu of critical habitat designation and possibly lead to greater restrictions on the use of certain military lands30 environmental organizations opposed the exemption arguing that suffici ent justification had not been provided to warrant it pointing out that dod had cite d few instances in which critical habitat requirements had restricted critical training exercises they also expressed concern that inrmps do not provide the same level of protection as critical habitat because these plans must subordinate the conser vation needs of species to the mission objectives of military installation the final language that congress pproved under section 318a grants the secretary of the interior the authority to exclude military lands from designation as critical habitat if the secretary deter mines in writing that the inrmp for such lands provides benefit to the species for which critical habitat is proposed for designation however dod tinues to be subject to ll other protections provided under the endangered species act sec tion 318a explicitly states that dod must continue to comply with consultation requirements and with prohibitions on the taking ie harassing harming pursu ing hunting shooting wounding killing trapping capturing collecting or attempting to do such activities of endangered and threatened species31 on the other hand by not desi gnating critical habitat dod may be exempt from consultati on requirements for actions destroying or adverselyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32183crs20 32 section 4b2 of the endangered species act 16 usc 1533b2 specifies the factors that are to be considered when designating critic habitat it also authorizes the exclusion of lands from designation if the benefits of ex clusion outweigh the bene fits of inclusion and if the exclusion of such lands would not result in the extinction of the species 33 for example in october 2002 the fish and wildlife service excluded military lands on fort hunter liggett located near king city california from designation of critical habitat for the purple amole based partly on the imp acts that designation would have had on access to certain lands for traini ng exercises 67 fr 65414 34 the navys low frequency active sonar system is designed to detect submarines over great distances with the use of low frequency sound em itted at very high decibels environmental organizations have opposed the use of this type of sonar because they argue that the generation of loud sounds traveling through expa nsive areas of the ocean could harm large populations of marine mammals and other aqua tic species the natural resources defense council and several other parties legally challenged the navys deployment of its low frequency sonar arguing that it violated the marine mammal protection act the endangered species act the national environmental policy act and the administrative procedure act us district court issued preliminary injunction in october 2002 nrdc v evans 232 fsupp 2d 1003 1055 nd cal 2002 ordering the navy not to deploy its sonar system until the parties reach an agreement on the areas in which it could be operated without harming marine life final injunction has not been issued to date because the plaintiffs case is based on violations of multiple federal laws it is unclear whether the exemption from the marine mammal protection act provided in pl 108136 will allow the navy to resume use of its low frequency sonar systemmodifying habitat that would otherwise be designated this may happen whether or not species is present possibly lowering the level of protection for habitat that in some cases may be essential for the recovery of species in the future lastly section 318b amends section 4 of the endangered species act to require the secretary of the interior or secretary of commerce to consider the impact on national security in add ition to economic and other impacts when designating critical habitat prior to this amendment section 4 already required the consideration of any ot her relevant impacts32 the fish and wildlife service has used this authority in the past to exempt military lands from designation as critical habitat based on the impact that design ation would have on an installations functions33 opponents questioned whether ame nding section 4 was necessary to require the consideration of the impacts on national security and consequently whether doing so would provide any added benefit to help pres erve dods readiness capabilities marine mammal protection act section 319 of p l 108136 makes three changes to the marine mammal protection act these changes include modified definition of harassment of marine mammals for certain activities broad exemption authority for actions that are n ecessary for national defense and specific direction that impacts on military readiness activities are to be considered in reviewing permits for the incidental taki ng of marine mammals dod argued that it needed these changes to prevent restrictions on critical training exercises and to ensure the deployment of the navy s lowfrequency active sonar system34 howeverhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32183crs21 35 federal environmental laws that include vironmental exemption authority for activities continuedthese changes were opposed by those wh argued that protections for marine mammals would be weakened first section 319a modifies the finition of harassment under section 318 of the marine mammal protection ac t as it would expressly apply to military readiness activities as well as to scien tific research activitie s conducted by or on behalf of the federal government harassment of marine mammals is prohibited under the marine mammal prot ection act and is among th key protections provided in that statute the new definition focuses on activities th at are thought to be more objectively assessable in terms of their biol ogical impact the new language defines harassment as any action that injures or has the significant potential to injure marine mammals rather than any action that has the potential to injure the new language also defi nes harassment as any action that disturbs or is likely to disturb marine mammal by cau sing disruption of natural behavioral patterns to the extent that such patte rns are abandoned or si gnificantly altered the existing definition under section 318 which would still be applicable to activities other than military readiness or federal scientific research includes actions that have the potential to disturb marine mammals by causing disruption of behavioral patterns howeve r it does not specify that the patterns must be natural or result in the behavior be ing abandoned or significantly altered to be considered harassment environmental organizati ons generally opposed the modified definition of harassment arguing that it would raise the burden of proof that military readiness activity would affect marine mammal making it more difficult to protect them dod countered that the new definiti on is needed to ensure that military readiness activities are restricted only when scientific evidence demonstrates that such protection is necessary second section 319b grants the secr etary of defense broad authority to exempt actions from compliance with any requirement of the marine mammal protection act for period of up to two ears if such actions are necessary for national defense the secretary of defense is required to confer with the secretary of commerce and the secretary of the inte rior prior to issuing an exemption and must notify the house and senate armed services committees within 30 days an exemption granted under this authority can be renewed for an additional two years and may be renewed every two years thereafter indefinitely however the secretary of defense must confer with the secretary of commerce and the secretary of the interior before approving each renewa l and must notify the congressional committees each time an exemption is renewed the conference report indicates that the exemption for national defense parallels similar exemptions in other environmental laws however other statutes provide exemptions for activities that are in the interest of national security or that are in the paramount intere st of the united states35 environmental organizationshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32183crs22 35 continued that are in the paramount interest of the united states include cl ean air act 42 usc 7418b clean water act 33 usc 1323a noise control act 42 usc 4903 resource conservation and recovery act 42 usc 6961a and safe drinking water act 42 usc 300j6 those that use the term national securityin relation to exemption authority include comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act 42 usc 9620j and endangered species act 16 usc 1536jcontended that these terms present hi gher threshold of proof to justify an exemption they argued that using the term national defens would in effect provide broader exemption authority than is present in other statutes if it were interpreted to mean routine military operations rather than specific activity critical to security or other national needs on numerous occasions dod has stated that it has not used existing environmental exemption authority because the threshold is too high to justify exemptions for most activities third section 319c modifies how military readiness and sting activities are to be considered during partment of the interior or department of commerce review of incidental take permits which dod may need to obtain for such activities the marine mammal protection act generally prohibits the taking ie harassing hunting capturing killing or attempting to engage in such activities of marine mammals however the statute does allow the secretary of the interior or the secretary of commerce to issue permits that allow the taking of marine mammals under certain circumstances if it is inciden tal to performing nother lawful action and would not adversely affect the species or stock when determining whether to issue permit the secretary of the interior or the secretary of commerce must consider the least practicable adverse impacts of incidental takings on marine mammals under the new re quirements the secretary of the interior or the secretary of commerce also must consider impacts on the effectiveness of the military readiness ac tivity in consultation with dod when deciding whether to issue permit the new permitting requirements also exempt dod from complying with current standards for evaluating impact based on specified geographical re gions or small numbers of marine mammals for its readiness

provision limits the cost of maintaining and repairing general and flag officer quarters to 35000 per unit annually unless congress is tified 30 days in advance that costs will exceed this amount however if the additional cost s are solely for environmental cleanup activities that could not be reasonably anticipated at th time of the budget submission the law authorizes dod to notif congress

their overall support for this initiative they indicated that funding was reduced below the request and the authorized amount due to concern that doe has not reached agreement with epa and the states on its plans to implement cleanup reforms at all of its sites the conference report also reiterated concerns expressed by the house and senate about inaccurate estima tes of cleanup costs and sche duling of certain projects particularly the hanford waste treatment and immobilization plant36 doe had recently understated the estimate d cost of this project by 33 the house and senate had expressed concerns that this sharp increase may be an indicator that cost estimates of cleanup acceleration projects at other sites also c ould be understated in response the conference agreement di rected doe to transfer 25 million of its environmental management funds to the departments office of management budget and evaluation for increased oversig ht of accelerated cl eanup projects the senate had

the actions and funding that will be necessary to ensure that its planned cleanup remedies continue to be effective in the future these planning assumptions are based on time frame of 150 years the house d raised questions about longterm stewardship needs and directed doe to consider these needs when implementinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32183crs26 37 further discussion of the proposed resc ission is provided in crs report rs21684 fy2004 consolidated appropriati ons act reference guide accelerated cleanup plans to ensure that longterm st ewardship is not used as substitute for complete nd effective site cleanup as discussed earlier some have ex pressed concern that does cleanup acceleration strategy may result in more waste being left on site than would be allowed under original cleanup agreements if more waste were permitted to remain rather than being removed the stewardship costs at such sites would likely rise as result of the need for additional measures to ensure that the waste continues to be safely contained in future years to prevent exposure in response to this issue the house report indicated that the performance management plan for each cleanup site should identify the resources that w ould be necessary for fulfilling does responsibilities to manage the legacy of co ntained waste that is left behind after cleanup response actions are complete in addition to cleanup at does defens sites the law provided 140 million for the formerly utilized sites remedial action program fusrap the same as requested and about the same as enacted for fy2003 this
