qatar classified by amb joseph lebaron for reason 14 b and d c summary 1 c during their july 2021 visit to qatar assistant secretary of defense asd for international security affairs ambassador alexander vershbow and state politicalmilitary pm assistant secretary andrew shapiro held meetings with qatars military chief of staff major general mg hamad alattiyah and the crown prince tamim bin hamad thani mg alattiyah and the crown prince tried to assure the assistant secretaries that qatar used the chief of staffs visit to press iran to respond to us offers of engagement and to dismiss as rubbish iranian efforts to blame the election crisis on us and uk special services the us affirmed displeasure with iranian behavior and said the us would not tolerate iranian pursuit of nuclear weapons asd vershbow suggested now was the time for qatar to distance itself from iran and its proxies and urge iran to end its destabilizing behavior 2 c mg attiyah and the crown prince repeated the qatari position that they felt the need to engage all their neighbors and that qatar could perhaps influence iranian behavior through its engagement mg alattiyah also expressed disappointment that the large aircraft infrared counter measure laircm system is not available to be installed on qatars recently purchased c17 aircraft asd vershbow said he would look into the issue further and that formal response from the secdef would be forthcoming the chief of staff also said decision had been made on fulfilling an earlier us request to provide funding for the refurbishment of jordanian tanks being provided to lebanon when asd vershbow requested that qatar use its good offices to help the us in yemen and induce change in hamass behavior the chief of staff expressed irritation that usqatar friendship did not extend to issues of importance to qatar such as laircm end summary usqatar relationship 3 c us assistant secretary of defense asd for international affairs vershbow and assistant secretary of state for politicalmilitary affairs shapiro joined by ambassador met july 2021 over dinner and in separate office call with chief of staff cos major general hamad alattiyah the us visitors thanked the cos for qatars continued hospitality and support and for hosting our presence at both camp as sayliyah cas and aludeid air base auab c17 purchase 4 c bg general almalki commander of the fighter wing and chairman of the transport committee informed asd vershbow that the first c17 was on schedule for delivery and would depart california on august 11 with an eta at auab oa august 15 in addition bg general almalki mentioned his disappointment at the delay of the pilot training program which will further delay the aircraft from becoming operational in response asd vershbow reassured him that usg would work to resolve the issue 5 c cos alattiyah expressed his concern to asd regarding the c17 laircm the cos stated that he was greatly disappointed over usg disapproval of qatars application for laircm almalki pointed out that other nations had acquired the system and that qatars exclusion added to his frustration the cos said he did not want to elevate the matter to qatars civilian leadership he believed that qatars leaders would question the benefits of the usqatari military relationship if the concern were to be raised 6 c asd vershbow responded that letter would be forthcoming from secdef explaining that qatar would be receiving the same aircraft as received by the united states air force usaf vershbow further clarified that the laircm was an additional addon for which transfer to qatar had been disapproved vershbow recommended that qatar pursue other options noting he was unaware that other nations had access to the laircm system for transport aircraft asd vershbow said he would look into the matter adjust the secdef letter as necessary and respond formally to the goq cos and almalki stressed qatars desire to use aircraft jointly with the us and coalition forces iran doha 00000502 002 of 003 7 c asd asked the cos to recount his visit to the islamic republic of iran cos briefed that his first visit to iran was short in duration the qatari delegation praised president obamas cairo speech while in iran and urged the iranians to take steps to avoid isolating themselves internationally further the qataris suggested that the iranians seek engagement and rapprochement asd vershbow said this was the right message and those who have contacts with iran should use every opportunity to persuade iranian leaders to end their destabilizing behavior 8 c asd vershbow reiterated the need for iran to take steps to convince the international community that it was not pursuing nuclear weapons capability and to end its support for hamas hizballah and other extremist groups he said we understand why qatar because of its close proximity and its economic and political ties to iran felt the need to engage with iran qatar should help the iranians to avoid conflict with the us and the international community remarking that friends do not let friends drive drunk 9 c cos alattiyah responded that while iran expresses desire privately to change its behavior these could be meaningless platitudes the cos reiterated that the goq opposes any iranian pursuit of military nuclear capability noting that it would destabilize the region cos further suggested that the usg continue its own dialogue with the islamic republic cos alattiyah closed the discussion by making clear that with respect to iran while were neighbors were not friends he summed up his recent visit to tehran as an overture to maintain open channels of communication with iran lebanon 10 c asd asked if the goq had response to an earlier request to the prime minister by secretary gates to help fund the transfer of 55 m1a1 tanks from jordan to lebanon cos said he was aware of the request but that decision had been made he added that he had discussed the issue during recent chod conference with jordanian and lebanese representatives hamas 11 c asd vershbow raised qatars ties with hamas and told the cos that hamas needs to be encouraged to rejoin the palestinian authority and the peace process he added that there should be blank checks checks at all for hamas asd suggested that qatar was in position to influence hamas if qatar helped bring about change in hamass behavior it could enhance the usqatar strategic relationship cos undertook to relay that message to the amir and crown prince while the cos underscored that qatar wants good relationship with the us he noted there were times when usg decisions sent different signal such as the usgs decision on laircm cos alattiyah rhetorically asked are we friends or not yemen 12 c asd vershbow asked if qatar or the gcc as whole would be renewing efforts to help solve the troubles in yemen citing qatars previous mediation efforts cos alattiyah responded that goq had engaged yemen in the past but noted that maintaining productive dialogue is difficult given yemens economic plight and decentralized tribal society the cos added that the goq was unsure how yemeni president saleh plans to curtail the violence there he also noted that there is little military cooperation between the qatar armed forces qaf and yemen but that he would make the goq leadership aware of the asds interest the cos said that the gcc had earlier presented unified package but its efforts in yemen had failed cos alattiyah recommended that this subject be addressed at the manama dialogue in december nss and cip 13 c asd commended the cos on the upcoming centcomgoqnaval war college effort to develop national security strategy qatar and others in the region need to place more emphasis on critical infrastructure protection added the asd cos alattiyah agreed and said he was looking forward to this effort note omc qatar will escort an interagency qatari delegation back to tampa august 1113 to doha 00000502 003 of 003 begin this process closing remarks 14 c cos ended the discussions by stating that he valued the usqatar relationship the goq was committed to the friendship forged between the two nations he said cos said he is looking forward to the p4 visit and expressed his desire to invite the p4 to his beach house as schedules permit comment 15 c qatar clearly registered its disappointment in not receiving laircm for its c17 we believe this could fester into an open wound in the vital usqatar security relationship the chief of staff is particularly sensitive about the issue since qatars senior leadership the amir and crown prince holds him responsible for maintaining close and productive usqatar military relationship however given the qatari leaderships perception of the chief of staffs inability so far to get laircm senior leadership may start to question the chief of staffs assurances about the strength of the usqatar military relationship end comment 16 u
