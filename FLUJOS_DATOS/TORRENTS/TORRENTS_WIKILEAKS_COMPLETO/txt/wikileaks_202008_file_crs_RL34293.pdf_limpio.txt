oftrepeated adage on capitol hill turf is power turf refers to the jurisdictional mandates of house committees as stated in house rule x and in other relevant matter precedents memoranda of understanding between or among committees and the like the rule x language is often specified in broad rather than programmatic terms such as national energy policy generally committees clash over their respective jurisdictional prerogatives in part because they are lawmakers legislative power base it is wonder that committee boundaries are hotly contested 1 various other equally important reasons account for disputes over committee boundaries for example one is the matter of issue overlap among committees any broad subject area homeland security transportation energy health and so on can involve the jurisdiction of several panels shared policy interests can sometimes spark intercommittee controversies as one house committee chairman stated nobody in this institution gives up jurisdiction they believe is rightfully theirs 2 another factor that can trigger turf wars is that committees overlap issues the energy and commerce committee has jurisdiction over foreign commerce generally foreign affairs is responsible for international economic policy and ways and means is in charge of reciprocal trade agreements the lack of bright lines separating substantive areas may also trigger disputes among committees for instance is the allocation of the radio spectrum to allow first responders to communicate with each other during an emergency matter for the homeland security committee or the energy and commerce committee which has jurisdiction under house rule x for the regulation of interstate communications 3 further as new policy topics come forward it is not always clear which of several panels might receive legislation dealing with these emerging or emergent issues given jurisdictionally ambiguous issues turf wars can be fomented by policy entrepreneurs staking claims for their committees4 to be sure committee staff are alert both to repel border poachers and to search for opportunities to expand their own panels substantive reach5 1 david c king turf wars

however there are many ways to minimize or resolve committee disputes this report identifies several common conflict resolving techniques that have been employed at several junctures of the lawmaking process specifically the drafting of measures the referral of legislation the committee stage and the rules committees issuance of special rules this is an illustrative and not an exhaustive list for example the speaker could name conferees from more than one committee to accommodate another panels jurisdictional interests or potential jurisdictional conflicts on the floor might be avoided by allowing two or more competing committees the opportunity to offer jointly created substitute amendment at each one of the aforementioned lawmaking stages the speaker and other top party leaders are strategically positioned to intervene and mediate jurisdictional disagreements between or among committees especially on partypreferred legislation the rules committee informally known as the speakers committee is similarly situated to be major jurisdictional mediator in two main ways 1 its mandate over the rules of the house and 2 its ability to structure the debate and amendment process on the floor at the outset it is important to underscore that none of these techniques are guaranteed to minimize or eliminate intercommittee jurisdictional disagreements it is simply not feasible to construct watertight jurisdictional compartments too many issues affect the interests and concerns of multiple panels other relevant poi nts are worth brief mention disputes between panels might reflect rivalries between chairs rather than true battles over turf in the judgment of one house committee chair it is not so much where the jurisdictional lines are drawn that either creates or resolves jurisdictional disputes what we really need are greater spirit of civility and cooperation between chairmen and their staffs 6 sometimes jurisdictional conflicts between or among subcommittees of the same standing committee might require the full committee chair to mediate an internal turf war7 lastly jurisdictional competition between and among committees if not carried to extremes can benefit policymaking as each relevant panel brings its expertise to bear in resolving complex issues8 continued jurisdictionthe authority to review the actions and ac tivities of nongovernmental entities and executive branch programs and agencies under their legislative purview oversight jurisdiction compared to legislative jurisdiction seldom gives rise to intercommittee conflicts there are simply more overlaps in the conduct of oversight in part because the rules of the house permit them to occur for example house rules grant wideranging oversight authority to the oversight and government reform committee as well as special oversight house rule x clause 3 responsibility to number of panels special oversight grants various committees the right to oversee specific laws programs or activities even if they are within another panels legislative responsibility 6 quoted in committee structure hearings before the joint committee on the organization of

lawmaking member and staff often devote considerable time crafting bill so it will be referred to preferred comm ittee one goal is to avoid having their measure sent to an unsympathetic panel or to two or more committees that might hold opposite views of the bill accordingly lawmakers and their staff may meet privately with the house parliamentarian who refers nearly all measures on behalf of the speaker to discuss various drafting issues for example will the bill be referred to only one committee if it is multiplyreferred see below which committee might receive primary referral and which would receive secondary referral on most measures it is plain where they will be referred military measures will be sent to the armed services panel or bills dealing with small businesses will go to the small business committee however with so many policy interdependencies the referral of measures might not be selfevident artful drafting not only can get bill sent to preferred committee but it might also minimize jurisdictional clashes for example lawmakers who prefer that telecommunications bill be sent to the judiciary committee could draft it as an amendment to the sherman antitrust act which is the exclusive jurisdiction of the judiciary committee conversely members who want an internet bill referred to the energy and commerce committee could draft it as an amendment to the telecommunications act of 1996 which is the purview of the commerce panel committees often prefer sole responsibility for measure because it allows them to control the measures fate through various lawmaking stages committee he arings and markups floor consideration and conference committee deliberations single referral may also enhance lawmakers opportunities to better serve their constituents and mediate and win the support of outside groups interested in the topic various bill drafting techniques and practices provide some leeway to the speaker or the parliamentarian acting on the speakers behalf in referring bills to one committee rather than to another for example the agriculture committee received measure dealing with eminent domainthe seizure of private property for public useeven though the issue is typically handled by the judiciary committee however the bill connected eminent domain with rural development as the house parliamentarian noted the bill involved the committee on agricultures jurisdiction because of the way it defined the term federal economic development program 9

two or more committees the origin of the multiple referral rule which has been modified over time emanated from the 19731974 bipartisan house select committee on committees chaired by rules member richard bolling of missouri the vice chair of the panel was david martin of nebraska also member of the rules committee10 one objective of multiple referrals is to accommodate the prerogatives of the various standing committees that share jurisdiction over subject matter thus the legitimate jurisdictional claims of committees can be recognized during the referral stage on measures that are multireferred upon initial reference the house parliamentarian includes the following language in each case of multiple committee reference for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned this language can assist committee chairs during markup sessions to rule out of order amendments that trespass on other committees turf multiple referrals encourage more interactions between and among committees with overlapping responsibilities for policy topics informal discussions or negotiations can promote cooperation among panels having competing claims on legisl ation one manifestation of the value of inter committee consultationscommonly undertaken by staff of the concerned committeesis the use of socalled waiver letters which are often published in the congressional record for example the foreign affairs committee reported bill the iran counterproliferation act of 2007 hr 1400 which was also referred to several other panels the head of one of the panels wrote to the foreign affairs chair and said in order to expedite floor consideration of hr 1400 i agree to forego further consideration by the committee on financial services i do so with the understanding that this decision will not prejudice this committee with respect to its jurisdictional prerogatives on this or similar legislation i request your support for the appointment of conferees from this committee should this bill be the subject of housesenate conference 11 to be sure multiple referrals may foment jurisdicti onal conflict as committees assert their right to review provisions in bills that are only tangentially related to their responsibilities yet the device gives committees the opportunity to negotiate away their differences if not the speaker has various ways to promote positive action such as imposing time limits on committee consideration or intervening personally to help forge an agre ement among clashing committees with multiple referrals committee members can longer be certain of maintaining exclusive authority over the legislation referred to their committee but they can be virtually certain of obtaining all the legislation to which they have claims12 of course short or lengthy deadline for committee consideration of multireferred measureswhich the speaker has the authority to imposecan influence whether panels have sufficient time to defend their jurisdictional prerogatives 10 the multiple referral rule has been changed number of times since its first adoption in 1995 for example the new republican majority abolished joint refe rrals retaining sequential and split refe rences and added to house rules the requirement that the speaker shall designate committee of primary jurisdiction upon the initial referral of measure to committee see congressional record vol 141 january 4 1995 p h36 eight years later at the start of the 108th congress house rules were amended to allow joint referrals without any designation of primary committee see congressional record vol 149 january 7 2003 p h11 11 congressional record vol 153 september 25 2007 p h10771 12 melissa p collie and joseph cooper multiple refe rral and the new

satisfactorily among the contending parties there is guarantee that it will be the case but the following eight methods are among the prac tices utilized either to resolve jurisdictional conflicts promote committee coordination or clarify committees policy focus these methods are memoranda of understanding select committees standing committee creation jurisdictional transfers task forces committee composition joint hearings and informal staff consultations g15g142g150g152g155g138g151g141g138g561g152g143g561g23g151g141g142g155g156g157g138g151g141g146g151g144g561 one approach for avoiding or muting jurisdictional disagreements over shared policy areas is for paired committees to prepare memorandum of understanding that clarifies how certain overlapping issues are to be referred these memoranda are negotiated by the relevant committees signed by the respective committee chairs often publicized in the congressional record and kept on file and observed by the parliamentarian in the reference of pertinent legislation for example on the opening day january 4 2007 of the 110 th congress jurisdictional memorandum of understanding between the chairs of the committees on transportation and infrastructure and homeland security was published in the congressional record it stated in part with regard to the federal emergency management agencys fema emergency preparedness and response programs the committee on homeland security has jurisdiction over the department of homeland securitys responsibilities with regard to emergency preparedness and collective response only as they relate to terrorism however in light of the federal emergency management reforms that were enacted as title vi of pl 109295 bill amending femas allhazards emergency preparedness

for various reasons including to coordinate consideration of issues that overlap the jurisdiction of several standing committees recent example occurred at the start of the 108th congress 20032005 when the house set up select committee on homeland security with both legislative and oversight jurisdiction scores of house standing committees then and t oday have jurisdiction over various aspects of homeland security for example agriculture has jurisdiction over animal and plant health energy and commerce over public health financial services over terrorist financing judiciary over the federal bureau of investigation fbi science over computer security transportation and infrastructure over the federal emergency management agency fema and ways and means over the customs service to strengthen supervision of the department of homeland securityformed in 2002 from the merger of 22 agencies with around 180000 employeesthe speaker and other lawmakers wanted single point of oversight for the massive new department 15 the select committee also had the responsibility under the terms of its authorizing resolution to recommend to the rules committee by september 30 2004 possible changes in committee jurisdiction with respect to homeland security their recommendation contributed to the next example

difficult to eliminate standing committee compelling reason that helps to explain both cases is that members and staff of the various committees and their allied outside groups and entities are reluctant to lose any of their jurisdictional responsibilities yet to create new standing committee inevitably means shifting some juri sdiction from existing committees to the proposed new permanent panel despite the many obstacles involved in reva mping committee jurisdictions these initiatives sometimes occur to promote policy and oversight coherency for subject area that is fragmented and divided among numerous standing committees the houses establishment in the 109th congress 20052007 of new standing committee on homeland securityas recommended by the aforementioned select homeland security committeeis recent illustration of this approach on january 4 2005 on the opening day of the new congress the house adopted package of rules changes that included formation of new standing committee on homeland security as the chair of the rules committee explained the house will do what the speaker and the 911 commission as well as the president has asked us to do consolidate jurisdiction of the house into one committee this committee will be dedicated to setting national homeland security policy and to effectively overseeing that the department of homeland security carries out its mission 16 14 house rules rule xii clause 2c also authorize the speaker to refer matter to special ad hoc committee appointed by the speaker with the approval of the house and including members of the committees of jurisdiction for the specific purpose of considering that matter and reporting to the house thereon resolutions creating such ad hoc panels need not be referred to the rules committee house precedents state that resolutions creating these select panels are privileged when offered from the floor at the speakers request 15 martin kady select homeland security

security while recognizing the other legitimate oversight roles of existing committees17 because homeland security overlaps many committees and involves scores of federal agencies the rules chair included in the congressional record legislative history detailing and clarifying the continuing jurisdictional authority of 10 other standing committees over parts of this policy area for example the committee on financial services shall retain its jurisdiction over the antimoney laundering terrorist financing and anticounterfeiting activities within the department of the treasury and the financial regulators 18 an objective of this jurisdictional arrangement said the rules chair is to assure the american people that lawmakers are working to prevent anything from falling through the cracks19 g12g158g155g146g156g141g146g140g157g146g152g151g138g149g561g22g155g138g151g156g143g142g155g156g561 sometimes specific jurisdictional changes will be made between or among committees both to minimize intercommittee disagreements and promote integrated policymaking these discrete changes may also be employed creatively to avoid intraparty clashes for example two influential gop lawmakers wanted to head the commerce committee under the sixyear term limit provision stated in house rules the chairmanship of that panel was vacant because the former chair had reached the sixyear limit to avoid potentially heated contest for the energy post that could produce hard feelings within the gop conference the speaker endorsed plan to rename commerce the energy and commerce committee abolish the banking committee and rename it the financial services committee and grant it jurisdiction over securities and insurance previously in the old commerce committee the ju risdictional shifts occurred according to the chairman of the rules committee to increase market confidence in the houses ability to comprehend the increasingly integrated nature of the financial services market 20 the speakers intervention prevented an intraparty battle and allowed each of the members to chair an important committee the house supported the changes when it adopted rules package on the opening day of the 107th congress the energy and financial services chairs soon disagreed over which panel had authority over certain financial issues involved in the jurisdictional transfer the speaker mediated this conflict over turf which ended with the two chairs signing memorandum of understanding to settle their differences over jurisdiction21 continued able to judge what committee should have jurisdiction over this department and its duties but we believe that congress does have the obligation to choose one in the house and one in the senate and that this committee should be permanent

have long been created by democratic or republican speakers they may be either partisan or bipartisan in composition with the membership commonly drawn from multiple committees task forces are established for various reasons including the drafting of legislation that cuts across committees jurisdictional lines former speaker newt gingrich ga formed number of party task forces in the early days of the 104th congress 19951997 so many that one newspaper article was titled government by task force the gingrich model22 he formed them in part because he determined their mandate and timetable appointed the chair and members and assigned them deadline for legislative action although some committee chairs questioned whether the proliferation of the ad hoc groups undermined their jurisdictional prerogatives gop leaders were not especially sympathetic at the time to the chairs point of view leaders of the majority party wanted to avoid committee gridlock and get their partypreferred legislation to the floor in timely fashion as deputy republican whip stated some committee chairmen think theirs should be the only venue but thats turf wars 23 party leaders may also establish informal working groups of members and staff to assist in coordinating the development of legislation that overlaps the jurisdiction of several standing committees g5g152g150g150g146g157g157g142g142g561g5g152g150g153g152g156g146g157g146g152g151g561 house members serve on average on about halfdozen committees and subcommittee the point is that members who serve on two committees with shared policy interests are sometimes able to smooth jurisdictional relations between the two it is unclear whether the party assignment panels consider the jurisdictional liaison role as criterion in placing their members on committees yet overlapping committee memberships may at times promote intercommittee cooperation over shared policy issues as senior staffer on the international relations committee now titled the foreign affairs committee said about having two longtime gop memberswho each also chaired another standing committeeserve on the panel the chairman of the judiciary committee is henry hyde ril hes one of the more senior members of our committee the chairman of the banking committee is jim leach ria whos one of the more senior members of our committee i think that one result of that is that we tend never to have problems with those committees because theyve all served together on this committee for almost two decades 24 there are also two committeesbudget and permanent select intelligencethat by house rules are required to have members drawn from other standing committees for example the permanent select intelligence committee is to have at least one member selected from four committees with pertinent intelligence jurisdiction the four panels are appropriations armed services foreign affairs and judiciary 22 deborah kalb

method that committees might use to accomm odate their mutual jurisdictional interests is to hold joint hearings these types of hearings occur often on capitol hill and might be employed to reduce or eliminate the potential for jurisdictional conflicts for example the house armed services and foreign affairs committees held joint hearing on two reports one issued by the government accountability office and the other by commission of military experts assessing political and military conditions in iraq25 plainly the reports addressed concerns in both panels and the joint hearing device protected the jurisdictional interests of the two committees and avoided battle over turf g11g151g143g152g155g150g138g149g561g21g157g138g143g143g561g5g152g151g156g158g149g157g138g157g146g152g151g561 it is common for the staff of committees with shared policy mandates to communicate with each other sometimes the discussion involves the staff aides of one panel informing their counterparts on other committees that they may have jurisdictional interest in pending legislation inter committee comity is promoted by this approach which can lead to an amicable resolution of turf issues on other occasions the staffs of two or more committees with overlapping jurisdiction may work together in crafting legislation in the case of an agriculture census bill for instance the chair of the government reform committee now called oversight and government reform observed that prior negotiations between the staffs of his panel and the agriculture committee helped draft the language of the bill permitting him to waive jurisdiction shortly after agriculture reported it 26 g22g145g142g561g20g158g149g142g156g561g5g152g150g150g146g157g157g142g142g561 the rules committee reports special rules procedu ral simple resolutions h res that grant privilege to measures that may lack rightofway to the floor the panel sets the conditions for debating legislation and determining whether amendments will be in order to various measures special rules come in various versions and they are called by different names one easyto understand typology is the following open germane amendments from the floor may be offered to the pending measure closed floor amendments are not in order modified or structured limited and specified number of floor amendments are in order and waivers points of order are set aside against all or specified parts of bill or against specific amendments waivers may be included in open closed or structured rules as well as in the array of other special rules granted by the panelfor example structured reconciling selfexecuting and bifurcated which are discussed below the rules committee may also refuse to grant special rules to committees bickering over jurisdictional issues unless and until they have resolved their differences like its rulegranting authority rules jurisdiction over the formal rules of the house enables it to play large role in mediating jurisdictional disputes the rules committee may also report changes to house rules that are designed to minimize jurisdictional controversy and protect panels policy prerogatives tax or

commonly waives wide range of house rules such as the threeday layover requirement for committee reports and conference reports these two house rules provide time to lawmakers to become familiar with committeereported legislation or the legislative compromise the conference report reached when the two chambers pass different versions of the same bill or rules might waive the germaneness requirement for certain amendments to smooth relationships among committees that have stake in the underlying bill waivers can sometimes be useful in limiting conflicts between authorizing committees agriculture financial services small business and so on and the appropriations committee authorizing committees report legislation creating or continuing programs and agencies while the appropriations committee recommends how much money called budget authority these programs or agencies should receive under house rules authorizations are expected to precede appropriations further appropriations measures are not to include legislation or policy provisions violations of these rules are subject to points of order parliamentary objections on the floor as might be expected these two sets of committees commonly have disagreements in part because it may not be possible for the members of the authorization committees to win enactment of bills to reauthorize programs or agencies bicameral clashes for example may prevent their timely enactment as result the appropriations committee may include reauthorizing language as well as new policy proposals in their bills these addons can arouse the ire of the authorizers to constrain the traditional rivalry between authorizers and appropriatorsand preserve their respective prerogativesthe rules committee may observe an informal protocol as one rules chairman stated under this protocol the committee on rules would provide the necessary waivers to enable the bill to come to the floor if the authorizing committee chairmen did not object to them if the authorizing chairmen objected to the waivers then under the leaderships protocol the committee on rules would leave the specific policy language in question exposed to point of order on the floor 27 minority member of the rules committee had earlier said we have generally been supportive of the majoritys stated intention to provide open unrestricted rules for as many of the appropriations bills as possible and for its policy of providing waivers of house rules only when the authorizing committees agree to those waivers28

conflicting r ecommendations to the same bill it falls to the rules committee to develop special rule that identifies the base text to be made in order for floor consideration and that also allows the house to choose between or among competing policy alternatives as two scholars wrote in drafting the rule for multiply referred bill the rules committee is more likely than in other cases to have plausible alternative arrangements from which to choose as it selects the text to be amended on the floor allocates control of the time for general debate arranges for votes on the committees recommendations and disposes of germaneness and other procedural problems that multiple referrals can provoke 30 relatedly as precondition for special rule the rules committee may urge several competing committees to agree on the vehicleone of the committees reported bills or consensus product for examplefor floor debate and amendment this practice can limit floor fights among rival committees and expedite floor decision making g21g142g149g143g556g7g161g142g140g158g157g146g151g144g561g20g158g149g142g156g561 this type of rule embodies twoforone procedur ethat is when the house adopts rule it also automatically agrees to dispose of separate matter which is specified in the rule itself self executing language in special rule often stat something like the following the amendment printed in section 2 of this resolution or in part 1 of the report of the committee on rules accompanying this resolution shall be considered as adopted in the house and in the committee of the whole thus selfexecuting rule may stipulate that discrete policy proposal is deemed to have passed the house and been incorporated in the bill to be taken up the effect is that neither in the house nor in the committee of the whole will lawmakers have an opportunity to amend or to vote separately on the selfexecuted provision for example policy recommended by one of two or more competing committees could automatically be incorporated in the text of the bill made in order for floor consideration thus avoiding the potential for intercommittee disputes on the floor members who oppose the selfexecuted provisions may vote either to amend or reject the rule 29 bruce i oppenheimer policy effects of us house reform decentralization and the capacity to resolve energy issues legislative

mobilize winning majorities for party priorities in part by joining the work product of different and sometimes competing committees into one legislative measure consultation and communication between the relevant panels is typically necessary to ensure that the combined measure achieves its political and policy purposes party leaders and rules committee members may be actively involved in facilitating substantive coordination between the pertinent committees g5g152g151g140g149g158g141g146g151g144g561g17g139g156g142g155g159g138g157g146g152g151g156g561 jurisdictional claims and counterclaims for legislation are commonplace among committees various factors account for this reality for example committees commonly share responsibility for overseeing and legislating for the same agencies and departments and their policy and oversight preferences may diverge one from the other committee jurisdictions too cannot keep pace with rapid social economic or technological developments one result is that scores of issues today involve the jurisdictional expertise of numerous committees when multiple committees bring their divergent perspectives to topic disagreements may emerge among them these disagreements it is worth noting may result more from serious policy differences than from battles over turf although committee cooperation is the norm on capitol hill disputes among committees occur quite often various conflictresolving techniques are utilized both to reduce committee conflicts and promote cooperative relationships in todays house one technique merits emphasis and specific mention the role of majority party leaders especially the speaker they are positioned to encourage cooperative behavior among committees because of their special resources and responsibilities as one congressional scholar recounted house leaders are well positioned to exert formal and informal pressure on committees at nearly every stage of the process from the referral of bills through the naming of conference committees the tools of the leadership have the effect of raising the costs of hostile action for example in the setting of time limits on referrals and limiting amendments with special rules they could also make accommodation more attractive such as by acting as guarantor for agreements between committees struck under the direct supervision of the majority leadership the speaker can implement the i ntercommittee agreements directly in new legislative language via his floor prerogatives and influence over the rules committee in this way turf wars are contingent on the patience of leaders and on the latitude they grant 31 in short party leaders often act to facilitate committee cooperation across numerous policy domains and they have various ways to ensure productive committee action on priority legislation it is reasonable to suggest that many other factors beside leadership involvement are important in promoting committee cooperation such as regular staff contacts between and among 31 baughman common ground committee politics in the us house of representatives p 174
