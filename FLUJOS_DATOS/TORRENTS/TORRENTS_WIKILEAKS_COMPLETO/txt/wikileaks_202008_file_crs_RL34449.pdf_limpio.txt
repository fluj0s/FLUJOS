emergency order was lifted on december 15 but independent analysts saw only mixed evidence that the lifting led to meaningful change given especially the continued existence of media curbs and stacked

sharif himself may eventually prove to be the greatest benefactor of pakistans political upheaval there is little doubt he would serve third time as prime minister if given the opportunity some analysts speculate that sharif is angling for early new elections in which his party might overtake the ppp nationally27 criminal convictions re lated to his overthrow by the army in 1999 stand in the way of his future candidacy with his past links to pakistans islamist parties his partys 1990 poll win came only through alliance with islamis ts and he later pressed for passage of shariat islamist law bill and his sometimes strident anti western rhetoric sharif is viewed warily by many in washington potential coalition discord never before in paki stans history have the countrys two leading political parties come together to share power while many observers praise the murree declaration as representing what could be new conciliatory style of party politics others note that the ppp and

judges as part of sixweeklong state of emergency launched by president mush arraf on november 3 2007 seven supreme court justices including the chief justice and scores of high court judges refused to take new oath of office and were mmarily dismissed the supreme court was then reconstituted with jus tices appointed by musharra f himself the question of whether and how to restore the chief justi ce and other deposed senior judges remains key divisive issue immediately upon taki ng office the new prime minister ordered all remaining detained judges to be released in declaring an intention to restore the prenovember 3 supreme court the new civilian dispensation appeared to set itself on collision course with musharraf reseating that court would almost certainly lead to musharrafs removal from office as the justices had appeared close to finding his october reelection unconstitutional pakistans recently retired attorney general and longtime musharraf ally malik qayyum rejected the new governments plan to reinstate the judges within 30 days saying their dismissal was constitutional and that efforts to reverse it through executive order or parliamentary resolution would be futile according to him only an amendment to the constitution can reverse president musharrafs earlier actions many legal experts cast doubt on qayyum s position however claiming that because musharrafs emergency imposition was inherently unconstitutional as ruled by the supreme court on november 3 2007 just befo re its reconstitution all actions taken under that authority are invalid31 some detractors of the new governments intentions call the effort farce rooted in desire for revenge and they seek establishment of an independent judiciar without bringing back what critics have termed group of biased politic ized and vengeful judges32 the lawyers movement that arose in response to musharrafs march 2007 dismissal of chief justice iftikhar chaudhr who was reseated in july was vital
