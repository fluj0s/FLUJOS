authorization act thus clearing the bill for the president who had vetoed the original version of the bill on d ecember 28 the president vetoed the initial version because of one section whic h would allow victims of terrorist actions perpetrated by saddam husseins regime to sue the current iraqi government for damages in us courts the president said this provision would allow plaintiffs to tie up in lawsuits billions of dollars worth of iraqi assets thus hamstringing that countrys efforts at economic recons truction and political reconciliation the revised defense bill which would allow the president to exempt iraq from the provision at issue would authoriz all but 215 million of the 6964 billion that was the presidents amended request for national defenserela ted funding in fy2008 the same amount as was authorized th vetoed bill the only other differences between hr 1585 and hr 4986 were provisi ons added to the later bill that would make retroactive to january 1 2008 35 pay raise for military personnel and the reauthorization of various bonuses incl uding enlistment and reenlistment bonuses according to press reports white house officials have said the president will sign the revised defense bill hr 4986 lawsuits against terrorist states the section of hr 1585 to which the president objected is section 1083 whic h would amend the foreign sovereign immunities act 28 usc 1602 the legisl ation that regulate s the conditions under which foreign countries or their instrumenta lities can be sued in us courts section 1083 is based on senate floor amendmen t to hr 1585 s ponsored by senators frank r lautenberg arlen specter nd 20 others among the sections many provisions were one that would allow mone tary claims against foreign state for damages including punitive damages one that would nullify certain legal defenses currently available to foreign governme nt being sued and one that would allow claimant to freeze assets under us jurisd iction of state being sued as soon as suit was filed the administration contended that these provisions could result in billions of dollars in iraqi funds being tied up by c ourt proceedings thus undermining efforts tohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33999crs2 1 white house office of the press secretar fact sheet national defense authorization act section 1083 danger to ir aqs progress december 28 2007rebuild iraq and train iraqi security forces1 for background on the issue see crs report rs22094 lawsuits against state supporters of terrorism by jennifer k elsea and crs report rl31258 suits against terrorist states by victims of terror by jennifer k elsea the revised version of the defense b ill hr 4986 retained section 1083 but added to it provision that would allow the president to waive its application to iraq provided the waiver is in the national security interest and will promote the reconstruction of the consolid ation of democracy in and the relations of the united state with iraq and provided that iraq c ontinues to be reliable ally in combating international terrorism such presidential waiver would expire 30 days after it is made unless the president gives congress written notice of the basis for the waiver the revised section 1083 also expresses th sense of congress that the us and iraqi governments should negotiate compen sation for meritorious claims based on terrorist acts by the saddam hussein regime against us citizens or members of the us armed forces if presidential waiver under this section bars lawsuits for this purpose veto impact on milit ary pay and bonuses because the president signed the fy2008 defense appropriations bill hr 3222 pl 110116 into law on december 26 the budget authority thus provi ded has been available for most ongoing pentagon operations notwithstanding the absence of companion authorization bill however because legal authority for more than 20 enlistment and reenlistment bonuses expired on january 1 2008 the arme d services have temporarily halted payments of those bonuses pending actment of author izing legislation new bonus agreements signed by the army navy and air force on or after january 1 2008 include an addendum which provides that while the contracting service member will receive the bonus if nd when it is legislatively authorized payment is not guaranteed the marine corps has suspended its use of bonuses altogether pending enactment of authorizing legislation directing units to temporarily extend the current enlistments of marines who intend to reenlist and who would be eligible for reenlistment bonus also as result of the delay in enacting defense authorization bill the basic pay of military personnel increased by 3 on january 1 rather than 35 as was approved in the conference report on hr 1585 and as has taken effect for civilian federal employees the revised authorization bill hr 4986 would authorize the 35 pay raise and the various bonuses retroactive to january 1

president on december 28 administration official s announced that the president would not sign the bill and that since the house had adjourned the bill thus would die as the result of socalled pocket veto howeve r democratic congressional leaders contended that congress was not adjourned and therefore that the president could not invoke that procedur under the circumstances the constitution provides that once bill is passed by congress and sent to the president if he neither signs the measure nor b vetoes it and returns it to congress within 10 days not counting s undays then the bill will become law without his signature unless the congress by their adjournment prevent its return in which case it shall not be law article i section 7 clause 2 this last contingency was first referred to in 1812 as pocket veto the practical significance of the issue is that while congress can try to override regular veto with twothirds majority in each chamber thus enacting the vetoed legislation over the presidents objection it has recourse in the case of pocket veto except to pass new bill for decades constitutional debate s been underway over whether the president can exercise the pocket veto after an adjournment between the two sessions of congress or only after the adjournm ent at the end of twoyear congress3 congress has adopted various pr ocedures to designate agen ts to whom the president could return vetoed bill during an intersession adjournment thus appearing to provide an opportunity for congress to try to override the veto however several recent presidents including george w bush and william j clinton have argued that none of those devices block the use of pocket veto during an adjournment within twoyear congress4 in the case of hr 1585 white house spokesman told reporters december 31 that the administration regarded congress as being in state of adjournment and thus that the defense authorization bill would die by pocket veto at midnight that

with congresss insistence that it be given time to subject that funding to the regular oversight and legislative process nevertheless since the administration has requested that these funds be design

concurrent resolution for fiscal year 2008 srept 11086 june 18 2007 fy2008 defense budget request and outyear plans questions of affordability and balance several aspects of the departments fy2008 budget request and its projected budgets through fy2013 raise questions about the affordability of dods plan as whole and about the balance of spending among major elements of the defense budget 1 dods funding plan for fy2008fy2013 excluding the cost of military operations in iraq and afghanistan projects that the departments base budget will increase in real purchasing power fter adjusting for inflation by 80 between fy2007 and fy2008 and by another 35 in fy2009 before declining slightly over each of the following four years but the tightening fiscal squeeze on the federal government may put strong downward pre ssure on the defense budget and the unbudgeted funds needed for ongoing military operations abroad may compound the problem the office of management and b udget omb the congressional budget office cbo and the government account ability office gao agree that the current mix of federal programs is fiscally unsustainable for the long term8 the nations aging population combined with risi ng health costs are driving an increase in spending for federal entitlement programs which in turn will fuel rising deficits compounded by steadily increasing interest on the national debt the upshot is thathttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33999crs14 9 baker spring defense fy2008 budget an alysis four percent for freedom the heritage foundation backgrounder 2012 march 5 2007if total federal outlays c ontinue to account for about 20 of the gdp and federal revenues remain at about thei r current level total fede ral spending on discretionary programs in terms of real purchasing pow er would have to be sharply reduced to meet the goal of balanced federal budget by 2012 and then to cover the rising costs of medicare medicaid and social security resulting partly from the retirement of baby boomers to protect dod from this fiscal vise so have recommended that the defense budget excluding the cost of ongoing operations in iraq and afghanistan be sustained at 4 of gdp share of th national wealth that dod last claimed in fy19949 but that proposal would have to ove rcome the thus far intractable political challenges of increasing federal reve nues reducing discre tionary nondefense spending andor restraining the growth of entitlement costs 2 although the administration has submitted budget proposal to cover the cost of ongoing operations in iraq and af ghanistan in fy2008 that is separate from its base budget request for the year it may be difficult as pr actical matter for congress to subject the request for costo fwar appropriations to the same oversight it applies to regular annual defense spending requests if the congressional defense committees mark up the fy2008 defense fundi ng bills on their usual schedules as the house and senate armed services committees are doing with respect to the annual defense authorization b ill they will have had to review in less than four months both the presidents 482 billion re quest for the base dod budget and the additional 142 billion requested for operations in iraq and afghanistan the burden may be compounded by the fact that th congressional defense committees may not have timetested analytical tools with which to scrutinize the request for ongoing combat operations as they do for reviewin g the base budget moreover for most of that four month period members of c ongress and the defense funding committees in particular have been deeply preoccupi ed with debate over the administrations fy2007 emergency supplemental appropriati ons bill hr 1591 to pay for combat operations in iraq and afghanistan legisl ation that has become the vehicle for congressional efforts to reduce the i nvolvement of us troops in iraq in addition since dod does not include th forecast cost of ongoing operations in its projections of defens budget requests in future years except for 50 billion placeholder for fy2009 included in the fy2008 request congress has not been given clear sense of how severely the fe deral governments overall fiscal squeeze may constrain future defense budgets 3 dod projects that its total budget w ill remain approximately constant in real terms from fy2009 through fy2013 but for years most of the major components of the defense budget have shown steady cost growth in excess of the cost of inflation thus the relatively flat defe nse budgets planned would have to accommodate other types of costs that also seem to be escalating almost uncontrollably notably including 1 the risi ng cost of health care for personnel still on active service retirees and their depende nts 2 operations and maintenance costshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33999crs15 10 in review of 64 major weapons programs the gao found that their total cost had grown by more than 49 annually in real terms the total estimated cost of the 64 programs in fy2007 was 165 billion more in fy2007 dollars than had been projected in fy2004 see gao07406sp defense acquisitions assessments of selected weapons programs march 2007 p 8 according to the gao analysis major reason for that unbudgeted cost increase was that many programs depend on technologies that promise transformative combat effectiveness but which have not been adequately developed before they are incorporated into the design of new weapon ibid p 9 11 although most defense department shipbu ilding is funded in the shipbuilding and conversion navy scn appropriation certain types of noncombatant vessels are funded in other appropriation accounts particularly the national defense sealift fund which is under revolving and management fundsthat have been increasing si nce the korean war at an average of 25 per year above the cost of inflation and 3 new weapons th at are expected to dramatically enhance the effectiveness of us forces but which carry high price tags to begin with and then all too often substantially overrun their initial costestimates10 4 one of the most powerful drivers of dods internal cost squeeze the steady increase in the cost of military personne l would be compounded by the presidents recommendation in line with congressional proposals to increase activeduty army and marine corps endstrength between fy1999 and fy2005 the cost of activeduty military personnel measured perservicemember grew by 33 above inflation largely because of congressional initiatives to increase pay and benefits large fraction of the increased cost is due to increases in retired pay and greatly expanded medical benefits for military retirees this year the administration has pr oposed and the congressional defense committees have urged for years an increase in activeduty endstrength that would add 92000 soldiers and marines to the rolls thus increasing the rvices fixed costs by at least 12 billion annually once the startup costs of the policy have been absorbed at the same time the navy and air force are cutting personnel levels to safeguard funds for weapons programs the air force is cutting about 40000 full time equivalent positions nd the navy about 30000 one issue is whether these cuts will be used directly or indirectly not to pay for air force and navy weapons programs but for army and marine corps endstrength increases 5 the navys ability to sustain fleet of the current size within realistically foreseeable budgets may especially problematic after years of criticism from members of congress who contended that the navy was buying too few ships to replace vessels being retired the service released in february longrange shipbuilding plan that would fall just short of the navys current goal of maintaining fleet of 313 ships but the plan assu mes that the defens department which bought seven ships in fy2007 and is reque sting the same number in fy2008 would buy between 11 and 13 ships in each of the following five years the plan assumes that amount appropriated for new ship construction would rise from requested 125 billion in fy2008 to 175 billion in fy2013 in currentyear dollars11 considering the fiscal demands likel to put downward pressure on future defense budgets funding the navys plan ma be challenging but even if the navyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33999crs16 12 government accountability office tactical aircraft dod needs joint and integrated investment strategy gao07415 april 2007 p 13got the annual shipbuilding budgets it plans to request it might not be able to buy all the ships it plans as quickly as it plans to do so because of escalating costs and delays in some of the new types of ships slated to comprise the future fleet in the past navy cost and schedule forecasts ter proven to be overl optimistic have led to longrange shipbuilding plans that promised increases in shipbuilding budgets in the outyears that have not been realized unachievable shipbuilding plans may discourage the navy and congress from weig hing potential tradeoffs between on the one hand construction of pr omising new designs and on the other hand building additional ships of types already in service and upgrading existing vessels 6 the services plans to modernize their tactical air forces suffer from the type of excessive budgetary and technological optimism that also afflicts the shipbuilding plan roughly midway through 40year 400 million effort to replace the post vietnam generation of air force navy and marine corps fighter planes with versions of the air forces f22a the na vys fa18ef and the triservice f35 or joint strike fighter the services pl ans have been buffeted by escalating costs slipping schedules and external budget pr essures in the case of the f22a this produced current budget plan that will buy only 183 planes rather than the 381 the air force says it needs similarly the navy and marine corps have reduced the total number of f35s they plan to buy from 1089 to 680 adjustments like this are easier to make with aircraft budgets that fund dozens of units annually costing tens of millions of dollars apiece than it is with shipbuilding budgets that fund handful of units each ear many of which cost upwards of billion dollars apiece but while it may be easier for the services to deal with the consequences of optimistic tactical aircraft recapitalization plans than it is for the navy to manage the shipbuilding program there is similar underlying problem if the services longrange plans assume budget s costs technical breakthroughs and production schedules that will not be realized servi ce may delay and ultimately increase the cost of upgrades to planes already in service that will have to be kept combatready until the new craft are fielded the military services accord new systems higher funding priority and the legacy systems tend to get whatever funding is remaining after the new systems budget needs are met if new aircraft consume more of the investment dollars than planned the buying power and budgets for legacy systems are further reduced to remain within dod budget limits however as quantities of new systems have been cut and deliveries to the warfighter delayed more legacy aircraft are required to stay in the inventory and for longer periods of time than planned requiring more dollars to modernize and maintain aging aircraft12httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33999crs17 13 prepared by amy belasco specia list in the us defense budget 14 section

categorize war funding differently the house and senate bills adopt different approaches to war funding the house accepts dods designation of funds requested for gwot and provides the full 1417 billion requested while the senate bill approves the full amount but transfers some 134 billion of the gwotrequested funds to dod s baseline program thus the senate reported version currently on hold after several days of floor consideration in july provides 1283 billion for gwot ostensibly cut of some 134 billion to the gwot request in fact however almo st all of the programs in dods gwot request are included in the baseline program the sasc report recommends the transfer from gwot to the baseline program on the grounds that funds provided for milita ry personnel procurement and military construction that are dedicated to growi ng the force and funds for weapon system upgrades that predate the afghan and iraq conflicts should both be considered part of dods baseline or regular program rather than valid warrelated requirements according to its report the sasc tran sfers are intended to identify the full amount of funding for the expansion of the army and marine corps that was originally justified by the administration as way to meet the need for more military personnel for the conflicts in iraq and afgh anistan originally rationalized as way to lengthen periods between deployments it is now being proposed as permanent longterm expansion of the army and marine corps the fy2008 gwot request includes 41 billion for military personnel 689 million in operating and maintenance costs and 169 million for military construction to pay equip and house an increase of 92000 army and marine corps troops by 201219 if the united states significantly decreases the number of troops in iraq it is not clear that the army and mari ne corps would need to be larger unless additional largescale deployments are anticipated for the future the weapon system upgrades transferre d by the senate authorizers for example 515 million for upgrades to ch 47 army helicopters 14 billion for bradley fighting vehicles and 13 billion for abrams tanks are programs that were underway before 911 and could be considered part of the armys ongoing modernization efforts dod also includes funds for these programs in its baseline request dod has argued that much of its warrelated procurem ent request is for reconstitution or reset the replacement of equipment that is expected to wear out sooner because of the stress of combat action these replacements are typically upgraded versions rather than strictly replacements and hence contribute to modernization at the same time as the sasc transfer s gwot funds to the baseline program the committee expresses some concern that

subcommittees that together meet the total for discretionary spending set by the 302a levels set in the budget resolutionthe actions by senate aut horizers and house appropria tors underline one of the dilemmas in war funding that has continued for several years how to distinguish between programs that are necessary because of war requirements and those that are dedicated to enhancing capabilities that dod considers necessary to meet longer term requirements including potential futu re counterinsurgency struggles one sign of this concern is the requirement by the hac for dod report that outlines the assumptions underlying reset re quirements to repair and repl ace warworn equipment and explains how recapitalization and upgra requirements are related to war needs rather than ongoing modernization26 both the senate authorizers and the hac appropriators show concern about potential overlaps between war and base line requirements with the senate authorizers concerned that dods definition of war costs is too broad and the house appropriators suggesting that dod define d war requirements too narrowly the hac cut 20 billion from dods baseline request argu ing these items

procure urgently needed items this 20 billion that the hac proposes to transfer from dods baseline request to gwot effectively frees up fundi ng for other programs desired by the appropriators and

congress would need to appropriate funds for equipment replacement for two years after forces are withdrawn40 in both fy2007 and fy2008 the services request includes replacement for various aircraft and helicopt ers both battle losses and an ticipated replacements for stressed aircraft unde r dods standard budget guidan ce the services are only to request new major weapon systems for combat losses that have already been experienced unless they get specific appr oval for an exception which appears to be the case for both the fy2007 and the fy 2008 requests where the services have requested replacements for stressed aircraft rather than combat losses in the case of the fy2008 request particularly dod w ould not have information about combat losses in response to congressional doubts the administration withdrew its request for six new ea18 electronic warfare airc raft and two jsf aircraft in the fy2007 supplemental another issue is whether replacing older aircraft longer in

within the next five years nuclear power for warships congress may use the fy2008 bills to continue pressing the navy to resume the constr uction of nuclear powered surface warships all u s subs commissioned since 1959 have had nuclearpowerplants because they give subs the extremely useful ability to remain submerged and thus hard to detect for weeks at time all aircraft carriers commissioned since 1967 also have been nuclearpowered ships but because nuclearpowered surface ships cost significantly more to build and operate than oil powered ships of comparable size the navy has built nuclear powered surface vessels since 1980 and has had none in commission since 1999 proponents of nuclear power long have contended that this focus on construction costs has unwisely discounted the operational advantag of surface combatants that could steam at high speed for l ong distances without having to worry about fuel consumption in r ecent years they have cited rising oil prices to argue that nuclearpowered ships may not be much more expensive to operate than oilfu eled vessels in 2006 navy study mandated by the fy2006 defense authorization bill pl 109163 section 130 concluded that nu

disputed by some analyses c17 production and c5 upgrades there appears to be strong support in congress for fielding larger fleet of longrange cargo jets big enough to heavy army combat gear than

national defense budget to continue deve lopment of socalled reliable replacement warhead rrw which is intended to replace warheads that were built in the 1970s and 1980s and have been kept in service longer than initially planned that total includes 89 million for the national nuclear security administration of the department of energy and 30 million for the navy the new warhead is intended to be easier to maintain than aging types now in service and to be deployable w ithout breaking the moratorium on nuclear test explosions the us government has observed since 1992 supporters argue that rrw is needed because of concerns that maintenance of currently deployed warheads may prove increasingly difficult in the long term on the other hand critics of the rrw program contend that fielding new warheads of an untested type might build political pressure to resume testing eventually moreover they contend that the program to extend the service life of existing warheads without tes ting has proven successful for more than decade and should become even more reliable because of advances in understanding of the physics of current weapons since the funds requested in fy2008 w ould allow the rrw program to cross critical threshold from design and cost analysis to the start of detailed development work memb ers who want to rein in the program have strong incentive to use the fy2008 funding

last year64 missile defense budget if only because it is the largest acquisition program in the budget the 89 billion requested in fy2008 for the missile defense agency would draw close scrutiny because of the stringent budget limits within which the defense committees are working but there also may be some efforts to cut that request that are rooted in the longrunning bate that continues over how soon missile defense would be needed and over the relative effectiveness of the many antimissile system s under development efforts are likely to reduce funding for some of the more technologically challenging programs such as the airborne laser abl which has encountered several delays and for which the administration has requested 549 million in fy200865 another possible target

of the hundreds of changes the house made to the presidents fy 2008 defense request in hr 1585 reflect broader themes some of which the house has struck in its action on earlier defense budget requests the bill would fund the proposed expansi on of the activeduty army and marine corps and would compensate the troops more generously after years of rejecting recommendations by many members to increase the number of ground troops the administration has launched plan to incr ease the permanent endstrength of the army and marine corps by total of 92000 troops by 2012 hr 1585 would authorize the two services to accelerate the buildup but would not require them to do so in addition to funding that endstrength increase the bill would increase military pay by 35 instead of the 30 in crease requested and would bar for the second year in row proposed increas in medical care fees for retirees it would mandate several actions intende d to improve the quality of military medical care particularly for service members in outpatient status the bill incorporates the text of hr 1538 the wounded warrior assistance act of 2007 passed by the house march 28 2007 among the provisions of which are 1 requirements for more proactive manageme nt of outpatient service members 2 requirements for regular inspections of housing facilities occupied by recovering service members and reports on other aspects of military medical care and 3 one year ban on the privatization of jobs at any military medical facility the bill would shore up current combat capabilities in part with funds diverted from the budget request for technologi cally advanced weapons programs that promise increased military capability in the future it would add funds to the requests for antimissile systems designed to protect forces in the field from the sort of shortrange and mediumra nge missiles deployed or nearly deployed by potential adversaries such as north korea and ira n at the same time it would slice funding from the amounts requested for the airbor ne laser and for development of space based antimissile weapons more innovative weapons intended for use against long range missiles that those

committee bill the version of the fy2008 defense author ization bill reported june 5 by the senate armed services co mmittee s 1547 would trim 4819 m illion from the presidents budget authorizing 6483 b illion unlike its house counterpart however the senate committee shifted billions of dollars between those parts of the bill funding the pentagons base budget its routine peacetime expenses and those parts funding current combat operations in iraq and afghanistan namely titles xv and xxixhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33999crs54 saying it wanted to clearly identify the cost of the war the committee transferred from the costofwar sections of the bill to the base budget sections total of 16 billion most of those funds are to cover procuremen t and military personnel activities associate with the planned expansion and modernization of the army and marine corps over the next several years on the other hand the committee shifted from the base budget to title xv nearly 47 billion to cover expenses it said should be attributed to the cost of war that amount included 4 billion to accelerat production of mrap vehicles intended to better protect troops against roadside bombs and 500 million in addition to the 4 billion requested for the joint ied defeat organization jieddo the senate committees bill also would make 25 b illion in cuts which the panel said would have adverse impact on pentagon ope rations these reductions included the following 16 billion based on the assumpti on that lowerthananticipated inflation would result in lowerthan budgeted costs 682 million which the committee said agencies could offset with funds drawn from unobligated funds left over from prior appropriations and 208 million intended to reduce the cas h balances carried by the revolving funds that are used to operate several maintenance and other support activities operations in iraq and afghanistan although the bill includes provisions calling for the withdrawal of us forces from iraq it would require reports on several aspects of the us in volvement in that region one provision would expand the scope of provision of the john warner national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2007 that requires the pentagon to report to congress the estimated cost of resetting army units that have been deployed in iraq of afghanistan the new provision would re quire that report to include the cost of resetting the additional units deployed in r ecent months as part of the troop surge another provision of s 1547 would require that the effect of the troop surge be factored into another report that was ma ndated by the fy2007 authorization bill an analysis by the gao of the impact of the ployments to iraq and afghanistan on the ability of the army and marine corps to provide the forces needed to carry out the plans of regional commanders for other contingencies s 1547 would require that dod report to congress every six months on the strategy for achieving us goals in afghan istan it also would require reports on us strategy for encouraging pakistan to eliminate safe havens for violent islamist extremists near its border with afghanista n and b dods efforts to ensure that the governments of iraq and neighboring states will protect iraqi refugees as well as dods plans to promote protection of such refugees after drawdown of us troops in addition the bill would require the secretaries of state and defense in coordination with the director of nationa l intelligence to report on the threat posedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33999crs55 to the united states by ungoverned areas as well as on the intelligence capabilities and skills needed to manage that threat and what needs to be done to improve the two departments capabilities for that purpose force expansion and pay raise like hr 1585 the senate committees bill supports the administrations proposal to expand the active duty army and marine corps by total of 92000 active duty personnel compared with their pre 911 endstrength by 2012 the senate committee bill also would authorize 123 billion in the dod base budget requested to pay train and equip the additional troops brought into the services by the end of fy2008 but the senate armed services committee also expressed concern that the planned increase might be completed too late to ease the burden imposed on us forces by deployments to iraq and that by the time the additional combat units were ready to deploy they might longer be required on the other hand the committee warned planned manpower reduc tions in the navy and air force might go too far and too fast with those services sacrific ing needed personnel to free up funds for new weapons like the house bill s 1547 would comp ensate the troops more generously than the budget recommended authorizing military pay raise of 35 rather than the 3 raise the administration proposed at an dditional cost of 302 million in its formal statement of administration position on hr 1585 the office of management and budget omb cited the house bills aut horization of 35 pay raise as one of many features of that bill to which it objected tricare and other health issues the senate committee bill also rejected the administrations proposal to increas tricare medical in surance fees and copayments and pharmacy fees for military retirees it would add 19 billion to the budget for the dod health care system to compensate for the loss of revenue from higher fees which the budget had assu med the committee said the proposed fee hikes were premature pending the repor t of dod task force on the future of military health care and gao audit of dod health care costs and proposed cost saving measures both of which were ma ndated by the fy2007 defense authorization bill the committee included in the bill provision requiring that drugs sold through the tricare retail pharmacy system be pr iced at federally discounted prices the committee also directed the secretary of defense to reevaluate the navys plan to reduce its corps of medical prof essionals by more than 900 billets in 2008 2012 in light of the planned addition of 26000 activeduty personnel to the marine corps the committee expressed concern over the results of an army study of the mental health of soldiers and marines ployed in iraq which found that soldiers deployed more than once experienced hi gher levels of stress that lengthy deployments were associated with higher rates of mental illness and marital problems that the suicide rate among sold iers who had been deployed to iraq in 200306 was nearly half again as high as the armywide suicide rate and that approximately 10 of soldiers and ma rines interviewed re ported mistreating non combatants in iraq or damaging their property needlesslyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33999crs56 in its report on s 1547 the panel direct ed dod to report what it was doing to address the army studys findings the committee also instructed the secretary of defense to assess the effectiveness of assigning mental health professionals to combat battalions in hopes of reducing the stigma associated with seeking mental health services in the military on june 14 after it had reported the au thorization bill the senate armed services committee reported the dignified treatment of wounde d warriors act s 1606 intended to correct shortcomings in dods medical care for outpatients which had been spotlighted by news reports of problems at walter reed army medical center on july 12 the senate adopted by vote of 940 an amendment to the defense authorization bill that consisted of modified ve rsion of the text of s 1606 in its report on s 1547 the senate armed services co mmittee also directed the joint improvised explosive device def eat office jieddo to spend at least 50 million in fy2008 to fund research on the diag nosis and treatment of blast injuries ballistic missile defense like the house bill s 1547 would reduce overall funding for ballistic missile fense and would reduce funds for more technologically advanced defenses agai nst prospective longrange threats while adding funds for defenses against shor trange and mediumrange missiles currently deployed by some hostile countries and capab of striking us forces and allies overseas within total of 101 billion authorized for antimissile defense reduction of 231 million from the request the b ill would add total of 315 million to the amounts requested for systems several defe nses against current missile threats including the armys patriot pac3 nd thaad and the navys aegis standard missile3 the largest of several reductions that bill would make to the amounts requested for more technologically ch allenging systems was cut of 200 million from the 5488 million requested for the airbor ne laser the bill also would deny 10 million requested as an initial step to ward developing sp acebased antimissile interceptors the bill also would deny the 85 million of the 310 million requested to begin deployment of antimissile interceptors in poland and an associated radar in the czech republic calling the proposed ployment premature the committee included in the bill provision requiring federally funded research and development center ffrdc to assess the options for ssile defense on europe for summary of actions taken on funding levels for principal miss ile defense programs see table a4 in appendix another provision would bar deployment in alaska of more antimissile interceptors than the 40 already authorized until the secretary of defense certifies to congress that the antimissile system has demonstrated in realistic flight tests that it has high probability of being operationally effective other provisions would require that the pentagons director of op erational test and ev aluation have the same access to test data for miss ile defenses as for other weapons and that the gao continue to report to cong ress annually on the missile defense systems progress toward meeting its cost pe rformance and schedule goalshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33999crs57 fcs and other ground combat systems in contrast to hr 1585 which would cut 867 million from the 37 billion requested for the armys future combat systems program s 1547 not only approved the request for fcs but added to it 115 million most of the increase was earmarked to resume work on armed and cargocarrying robot vehicles that the army had dropped from the project change the senate armed services co mmittee criticized as being budgetdriven fcs currently envisioned as set of 14 types of manne d and robotic ground vehicles unmanned aircraft and sensors knit into an integrated fighting unit by dense web of data links embodies the thru st of the armys plan to modernize its combat force the wide divergence between the house and senate bills over the fcs funding level for fy2008 apparently is rooted in profound disagreement between the house and senate armed services committees over the programs future in its report on hr 1585 the house panel said that the army might not be able to afford fcs given the cost of enlarging the force resetting combat units that have been fighting in iraq and paying for ot her improvements launche d in the context of the post911 world large costs that were not foreseen when the army launched fcs in 1999 on the other hand the nate committee in its report on s 1547 hailed fcs as the answer to the armys need for lethal combat units that could quickly be transported to distant troubl spots and warned against relying on marginal modernization of the current force the senate committees bill also would authorize the 14 billion requested to upgrade existing bradley troop carriers and the 13 billion requested to upgrade m1 tanks it would add 775 million to the 14 billion requested to buy new strykers large wheeled fighting vehicles more lightly armored than bradleys in addition the bill would cut 100 million from the 288 million requested to continue development of the marine co rps expeditionary fighting vehicle an amphibious troop carrier the house b ill cut 200 million from the request for the program which dod has suspended for review nuclear weapons and longrange strike the senate committee cut from the budget request some of the f unds requested to develop the reliable replacement warhead rrw program to develop family of nuclear warheads intended to be easier to maintain than those currently in service the first version would equip the trident ii submarinela unched missile in addition to the 888 million in the energy department budget specifically assigned to rrw the committee said that funding in other part s of the energy budget for rrwassociated activities brought the tota l requested to support the program to 2381 million in addition the navys budget request incl uded 30 million to begin modifying trident missiles and submarines to carry the new warhead the senate committee bill authorized total of 195 million in ergy department funds and 15 million in navy funds to continue work on rrw but the committee emphasized that this did not mark commitment to acquire the new warhead and that the funds were to be used only for preliminary design work and cost estimation decision whether to proceed with the new warhead the committee said should await fundamental

the next presidential administration to conduct nuclear posture review which w ould be the first one since 2001 it also would express the sense of congress that th united states should take several steps to assert its commitment to nonproliferation including ra tifying the comprehensive test ban treaty which the nate rejected on october 13 1999 s 1547 denied total of 208 million request ed for two efforts to develop long range nonnuclear weapons intended to qui ckly strike targets anywhere around the globe one of the projects was an effort to develop nonnuclear warhead for the trident submarinelaunched missile and the other was to develop common aero vehicle rocketlaunched unmanned ma neuverable space craft intended to carry halfton payload thousands of miles in 30 minutes launch of either of those weapons might easily be confused with th launch of nucleararmed missile the committee said as an alternative th committee added to the budget the same amount it had cut from the two progra ms 208 million for new program prompt global strike to explore wide range of nonnuclear options for carrying out that mission but the committee insisted that any such weapon be distinctively different from existing us nuclear weapons acquisition reform the bill includes several provisions intended to reduce the risk of weapons acquisition programs running over budget or behind schedule for example one provision could potentially limit the use of multiyear contracts for weapons programs many pe ntagon managers and defens industry officials argue that multiyear contract yields lower itprice because the cont ractor can plan for stable production run over veral years but critics sa they are hard to oversee and make it difficult for dod to put pressu re on poorly performing contractors s 1547 would allow multiyear acquisition cont ract only if it resulted in savings of 10 in most cases compared to the anticipated cost of purchasing the same number of items in series of annual contracts another provision would require the ma nager of major acquisition program to notify senior dod officials of any change s in the program that call into question the rationale for those officials prior certification that the program had reached milestone b in the pentagons acquisition process milestone b certification is in effect the point at which dod leaders authorize devel opment

management reviews of contracts signed by the armed services that put single cont ractor in the position of managing large service contracts practice the conferees said was analogous to the use of private contractors as lsis in major acquisition contracts in their report the conferees expressed concern that the trend toward large single service contracts might undermine competition by giving the managi ng contractor an unfair advantage in anticipating prospective government requirements amendments to the insurrection act the bill repeals provision of the fy2007 national defense authoriz ation act pl 109364 that had substantially amended chapte r 15 of title 10 us code known as the insurrection act in its original form these provisions of law allowed the president to use the armed forces including units of the national guard to s uppress rebellion an insurrection or domestic violence if state authorities are unable to do so the 2006 amendments to the insurrection act prompted by the experience of hurricane katrina gave the president authority to use armed forces including the national guard in response to natural di sasters terrorist attacks or health emergencies if state and local agencies cannot ensure order78 the house and senate versions of hr 1585 included similar pr ovisions repealing the 2006 amendments defense appropriations highlights of the house bill the fy2008 defense appropriations bill pa ssed august 5 by the house would provide total of 4596 billion for the dod base budget excluding funds for military construction re duction of 355 billion from the corresponding portion of the presidents budget request th at total includes 109 billion in mandatory funding to cover the anticipated future co st of providing post retirement medical care for current service members unde r the tricareforlife program although the appropriations committee pproved smaller total amount than the president requested it was able to include within its total several major initiatives because it made cuts from th request totaling more than 9 billion which the committee said would not adversely affect pentagon operations the funds excluded from the bill include 2 billion worth of requests the house appropriations committee put off for consideration as part of separate bill to fund warfighting costs to be marked up in ptember among the items deferred which the committee said were more appropriately part of dods fy2008 war request are requests for night vision equipment mmunition trucks and equipment to protect cargo planes from antiaircraft missiles special pay for language proficiency and hardship duty and 500 million requested for global train and equip program to train the security forces of foreign c ountries other than iraq and afghanistanhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33999crs74 the committee also made cuts in the presidents request totaling nearly 7 billion which it described either as reflecting facts of life or as an incentive for the pentagon to manage service contracts more aggressively to reduce costs among the major reductions included in this total are 16 billion cut from the armys 289 billion request for operations and maintenance on grounds that th service managed its budget for fy2007 in ways that according to the committee inflated its fy2008 budget request by that am ount without providing congress any justification for the increase 12 billion 5 reduction in the amount requested for service contracts savings the committee said could be achieved by more alert pentagon oversight 630 million in the navy and air force training budgets for units that had been deployed in iraq and afghanistan 510 million to reflect pentagon civ ilian payroll that was smaller than the budget assumed 551 million trimmed from various budget accounts that had track record of unspent funds at the end of fiscal year 300 million in the marine corps procurement budget that the committee described as excess to requirements 420 million to reduce the cash balance carried by the armys revolving fund that is used to operate various maintenance and support activities force expansion the committee approved funds requested for the fy2008 portion of dods plan to add 92000 active duty personnel to the army and marine corps by fy2012 the bill includes 1 billion to pay for adding to the force 7000 soldiers 5000 marines and 1300 na tional guard personnel in fy2008 it also would provide 63 billion requested to buy equipment for the additional units that are being formed however the committee warned the services to include in future budget requests only enough add itional equipment for the additional troops funded in that years budget tricare fee hikes rejected the bill provides 221 billion for operating costs of the defense health program in cluding 19 billion that the administration wanted to cover by increased fees and copayments charged to military retirees participating in the tricare medical insura nce program although the administration requested approval of the proposed higher f ees its budget request for health program operations 220 billion did not assume that revenue would be forthcoming so the action of the house in appr opriating funds to cover the entire cost of the program rather than assuming that 19 billion of the costs would be covered by higher fees does not constitute congressional addition to the presidents requesthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33999crs75 79 the budget request includes 137 billion in the navys shipbuilding account but it also includes 456 in separate fund to buy supply and cargo ships and 210 million in the armys budget to buy small highspeed troop transport vesselother quality of life initiatives the committees reductions to the presidents request made room within an overall spending total lower than the request for several initiatives to improve the qua lity of life of the troops to provide military pay raise of 35 rather than the 3 in the budget request the bill would provide 22 b illion which is 310 million more than requested it also would add 558 million to the amount requested for military family support programs providing total of 29 billion the committees increase includes 439 million for family advocacy progra ms that assist service members and their families in the prevention and treatment of domestic violence and assists the families of severely wounded service members th increase also includes 82 million in addition to the 525 million request ed to increase the capacity of dods network of childcare centers and to extend their ope rating hours and an additional 38 million in addition to the 16 billion re quested for dods network of schools for service members dependents the committee said that in the course of cutting its personnel budget to pay for new weapons the air force had made too rge reduction in the budget for routine personnel transfers thus risking decline in the quality of life and the availability of professional developm ent opportunities for career service members accordingly the committee added 364 million to the air fo rces socalled permanent change of station pcs account offsetting the cost by cutting the same amount from the 744 million requested to continue velopment of the f22 fighter facilities improvements the bill would add 125 billion to the armys budget request for maintenance and upgra of facilities and the improvement of community services at dozens of bases in the united states and overseas the committee said the additional work was requi red to support the armys wideranging program to reorganize its combat its and to reposition some of them the bill also would add 142 million to the 126 million requested to improve perimeter security at dod facilities shipbuilding increase the committee added 36 billion to the total of 144 billion requested for ships79 that net increase included 17 billion for an lpd17class amphibious landing transport in addition to the one ship of that class in the budget the increase also included 14 billion to buy three supply and ammunition ships designed to replenis h navy warships in

requested to continue building the first two of ne w class of destroyers designated ddg1000 the committees additions to the shipbuild ing budget request were partly offset by funding only one of the three request ed littoral combat ships reduction of 571 million and by providing 76 million of the 210 million requested in the armys budget for small highspeed troop transport vessel selected other major w eapons program changes the committee added to the budget request 11 billion to equi p an eighth army brigade with stryker armored vehicles that addition was par tly offset by cut of 228 million from the amount requested to buy stryker version equipped with 105 mm cannon the committee said development and testing of that vehicle had been delayed see table a5 the committee also added 705 million to the 34 billion requested to continue development of the f35 joint st rike fighter the addition included 480 million to continue development of alternative engine for the plane the bill also would provide the 24 billion requested to buy 12 f35s see table a7 below the bill would add to the budget re quest 925 milli on for equipment for national guard and reserve units among the significant reductions to the presidents request made by the committee are the following 406 million cut from the 36 billion requested to continue work on the future combat system the armys plan to renovate its combat units with 14 types of digitally linked sensors and manned and unmanned vehicles 468 million for production of ne w armed scout helicopter 175 million requested to develop

to develop nonnuclear warhead for the trident submarinela unched ballistic miss ile and 50 million for the socalled falcon program being managed by the defe nse advanced research projects agency the committee said the conventional trid ent project had the disadvantage that the launch of conventionally armed missile might be taken by an adversary as nuclear attack instead the committee added to

the amount requested to equip trident missiles with the first of family of new nuclear warheads that are intended to be easier to maintain than those currently in service this is consistent with action taken by the senate armed services committee in its version of the fy2008 defense authorization bill reduction that the committee said was intended to slow the controversial program to develop socalled reliable replacement warhead81 shipbuilding costs and the littoral combat ship the senate committee bill would cut 451 million from the 143 billion requested for ships in the fy2008 budget82 by contrast the housepasse d version of hr 3222 added nearly 3 billion and four ships to the request see table a6 the senate committee endorsed the navys goal of maintaining fleet of 313 ships but it decried the chronic cost growth and delays in navy shipbuilding programs blaming those problems on poor ma nagement by the service whereas the house appropriations committee tried to eas the shipbuilding crunch by adding to the bill funds for four more ships than the president requeste d the senate committee contended that any it would not be possibl to build any more ships than currently were scheduled the senate committee singled out for special criticism the navys management of its program to build littoral combat ships lcs relatively small vessels that could be equipped for various missions us ing modular weapons systems of four lcss funded in previous budgets dod has cancelled one the fy2008 budget request includes 910 million for three additi onal ships but while endorsing the potential military value of the ships the senate committee said the navy would have to fundamentally change its acquisition strategy to addre ss problems of cost increases delays and performance shortfa lls in addition to denying the requested 910 million the committee included in its bill provision that would rescind 300 million appropriated in fy2007 for one of the three lcss still under construction thus cancelling second of the four ships already funded on the other hand the committee added to the request 81 million to complete construction of the two remaining ships of the four previously funded and an additional 75 million to buy components for use in an another lcs for which funding would be included in the fy2009 budget in effect the committee endorsed the construction of

the 191 million requested for the program in fy2008 and would re scind 40 million ppropriated for the project in fy2007 noting that the air forces f22 fighter is just entering service and appears to far outstrip any othe r countrys fighters the committee said air force plans to develop upgrades for the plane were premature the committee cut 132 million from the 744 million requested for additional development work on the f22 the committee approved the request for 24 billion to buy 12 f35 joint strike fighters six apiece for the navy and air force it also added to the 35 billion

falling within the scope of the bill however among the thousands of specific increases and decreases the bill would make to the presidents request are handful of large reductions totaling 35 billion which the conferees maintai n would have adverse impact on dod operations these large reductions include 135 billion to take account of change s in the economic assumptions on which the fy2008 re quest was based when it was being drafted during fy2006 507 million to compel the department to reduce its travel costs and persuade its contractors to operate more efficiently 540 million rescinded

werehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33999crs84 84 the proposed increase in activeduty endstrength often is referred to growing the forcemoving toward conference on hr 3222 h ouse democratic lead ers had taken the position that the costofwar appropriations bill would not be considered until early in 2008 from the start of combat operations in afghanistan in 2001 through fy2007 the administration had relied on supplemen tal appropriations re quests to fund war costs congress had added to the regular defense appropriations bills for fy2006 and fy2007 socalled bridge funds to cover the cost of combat operations in the first several months of the fiscal year elimin ating any risk that shortage of funds pending action on the supplemental funding b ill might impede the combat effectiveness of troops in the field the president and some republican congressional leaders said the decision by democratic leaders to defer action on the funding request for fy2008 warfighting costs created risk of causing just such debilitating gap in funding for units in the field but despite republican objections the conference report on hr 3222 included bridge fund to sustain operati ons pending congressional action on war cost appropriations bill early next year personnel costs and medical care the house and senate versions of hr 3222 both approved the requested fy2008 increment of mu ltiyear plan to increase the activeduty strength of the ar my and marine corps by total of 63000 soldiers and 29000 marines84 both versions also had funded 35t military pay raise to take effect january 1 2008 rather than the 30 increase requested the conference report adds to the president s request 309 million to pay for the larger pay hike however the companion defense authorization bill that would authorize pay raise has not yet been enacted in the absence of legislation authorizing the higher raise either as provision of th traditional defense authorization measure or as rider on some other bill under current law smaller pay raise would go into effect on january 1 2008 as requested the confer ence report includes 109 b illion to cover the future postretirement medical care of current service members under the tricareforlife program in addition the conference report would add to the presidents request for the pentagons health care program 19 billi on to cover costs of tricare service to current retirees that the administration had planned to cover by increasing the fees and copayments charged participants in the program it also would add to the request 379 million that the administration had ducted from the cost of the armed services health care programs as an effi ciency wedge to encourage the services to reduce their medical costs finally the conference agreement woul d add to the budget request 70 million to fund projects authorized under the wounde d warriors legislation that has been passed by both the senate and the house to improve the care of troops wounded in iraq and afghanistan including particul arly those suffering from posttraumatic stress disorder and traumatic brain injuryhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33999crs85 shipbuilding the conference report provided total of 146 billion for ship construction 242 million more than the president had requested in add ition to 136 billion provided for the navys shi pbuilding and modification account this total includes 756 million for s upply ships designed to replenish combat vessels underway on the high seas funded in th national defense s ealift fund and 210 million for small highspeed troop transport being purchased by the army see table a6 in the reports accompanying their resp ective versions of the fy2008 defense appropriations bill the appropriations committees of both the house and senate warned that the navy may not be able to r each its goal of having 313 ships in service because several types of ships currently under construction are significantly over budget and behind schedule one reason for these chronic shortcomings the conferees said was the navys practice of beginning construction of the lead ship of new class before the types design is completed they directed the secretary of the navy to certify to the house and sena armed services and appropriations committees before the first ship of any class is built in any shipyard that the requisite design nd development work has been completed although the house version of hr 3222 had added to the bill 31 billion for four ships the administration had not reque sted transport for amphibious landing forces and three supply ships the conf erees added to the budget request only 350 million for longleadtime components that c ould be used in those four vessels both versions of the bill as well as the conference report also added funds to buy nuclear power plant and other com ponents for virginiaclass submarine items that could be used either to quip second submarine in fy2009 in addition to the one currently slated for funding or to remain available as spares the conferees singled out as classic example of poor navy management the littoral combat ship lcs program intended to produce 55 relatively small but versatile warships that would comprise about 20 of the navys hopedfor 313ship fleet although congress has ppropriated funds for six of the ships only two are to be built with those funds because of cost increases and technical problems although the navys fy2008 budget requested 911 million for three additional lcss the conference report would provi 340 million for one ship ground combat vehicles the conference report would provide nearly 34 billion 206 million less than was requested to continue velopment of the future combat systems fcs program digitallynetworked fleet of manned and robotic ground and air vehicles slated to be the armys next generation of combat equipment the conferees also endorsed th armys plan to spin out of fcs some new technologies that could enhance the performance of existing combat equipment the conference report would provide the 100 million requested to begin that process see table a5 the house bill had added to the budget request 11 billion to buy enough stryker armored combat vehicles to equip an eighth brigade in addition to the seven planned the conferees agreed that the army needs additional stryker vehicles forhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33999crs86 many purposes but recommended that the stion of additional purchases be dealt with in the fy2008 warcost ppropriations bill slated fo r consideration next year to continue development of the ma rine corpss expeditionary fighting vehicle an amphibious armored troop ca rrier the conference report provides 2532 million reduction of 35 million from the reque st which the conferees attributed to delays in the program longrange strike and nuclear weapons the conference report would cut from the request 175 million intended to equip trident ii submarinelaunched longrange missiles with nonnuclear warhead s that could quickly strike targets at great distances since trident missiles heretofore have only carried nuclear warheads critics had warned that in crisis adversaries might interpret the launch of such missile as nuclear attack also dr opped was 50 million requested for project called falcon that also wa s intended to develop l ongrange nonnuclear strike capability to replace these two programs the conference report created 100 million fund to develop longrange precise lytargetable nonnuclear weapons the conference report also reshuffled the funding requested to upgrade an existing longrange strike weapon the b2a stealth bomber the bombers main targetfinding radar must be replaced because it operates at frequency slated for commercial use because deve lopment of the new radar is running behind schedule however the conferees reduced the amount requested to buy the new system by 100 million while adding 38 million to the radar rd effort the conference report also added to th budget request 10 million to adapt the b2a to carry newly developed c onventional bomb weighing 30000 pounds which is intended for attacks on command posts and other targets buried deep underground it also added 58 million to adapt the bom ber to carry new satelliteguided bomb so small that b2a could carry upwards of 200 of the weapons see table a7 the conference report also eliminates 15 million that was requested to adapt trident ii missiles to carry proposed new type of nuclear weapon called the reliable replacement warhead ballistic missile defense for all missile defenserelated rd and procurement the conference report pr ovides 99 billion reduction of 368 million from the request see table a8 two of the projects for which the conferees cut the funding request are controversial because critic s say they could elicit undesirable responses from potential adversaries the conference report cut 85 million from the 310 million requested to deploy in europe an antimissile battery similar to those deployed in alaska and californi the russian government has protested this plan to position 10 interceptor missiles in poland and radar in the czech republic despite the insistence of the ushttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33999crs87 government that the system is in tended to guard against longrange missiles that might be launched from iran it also denies the 10 million requested for the space test bed precursor to developing spacebased antimissile interceptor missiles other issues the conference report also included the following actions relating to the presidents fy2008 dod budget request it adds to the budget 480 million to continue developing jet engine developed by general elect ric and rolls royce as possible alternative to the pratt whitney engine that currently powers the f35 joint strike fighter it provides none of the 500 million requested for the global train and equip program under which dod assists the military forces of foreign governments in developi ng counterterrorist capabilities it provides 120 million of the 500 million requested for the joint improvised explosive device feat organization jieddo charged with countering the roadside bombs that are the chief source of us casualties in iraq it adds to the budget 247 million for operation jump start the program under which national gu ard personnel are assigned to secure us borders the conference report also directed the pentagon to exercise more vigorous oversight of private contractors hired to provide services and added to the budget request 48 million to increase the number of dod employees managing service contractors it also directed the secretary of defense to develop within 90 days of the bills enactment
