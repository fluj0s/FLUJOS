currently in place to address these issues the third and final report in the series is crs report rl32841 border and transportation security possible new directions and policy options border security is an important co mponent of the overall homeland security effort this effort can be seen as series of concentric circles or screens with the outer screen being that of preventative efforts launched outside the countryfor example interdicting or arresting terrorists and their weapons abroad before they reach the united states the next screen is interdiction in the border security system this series of screens then moves throug h progressively smalle r circles ending with emergency preparedness and response congressional concern over homeland security began with broadly defined effort s to learn more about the nature of the terrorist threat and then moved to much more specific actions following the attacks on september 11 2001 congressi onal interest continues however in broader more strategic approaches the search for enhanced border secur ity is complex task for example internationally shipped cargoes travel in various conveyances on variety of infrastructures through number of places are held in the custody of numerous people and organizations and can involve up to 40 separate doc uments to complete the journey from the source zone to the dist ribution zone this report suggests that if the border can be envisioned not merely as physical boundary but rather as flexible concept that allows for the possibility that the border begins at the point where goods or people commence their u sbound journey significantly wider array of options for border manageme nt policies becomes available what follows are series of graphical presentations intended to assist policy makers in visualizing the flow of peopl and goods across the borders that when combined with discussion of current bor der policies discussed in the second report in this series may be useful in seeking new directions for more effective border management policies discussed in the third and final report in the series this report will not be updatedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32839contents

coauthored by william h robinson lisa m seghetti and jennifer lake the updated versions of the report focus solely on border security and will henceforth be updated and maintained by jennifer lake analyst in domestic security domestic social policy divisionborder security the complexity of the challenge introduction there is consensus that border security is pivotal function in protecting the american people from terrorists and their in struments of destruction the adequate provision of border security is an extrem ely complex endeavor given the scope of us borders and the volume of traffic flowing across them as described by admiral james loy former deputy secretary of the department of homeland security dhs we must secure nearly 7500 miles of land border with canada and mexico across which more than 500 million people 130 million motor vehicles and 25 million rail cars pass every year we also patrol almost 95000 miles of shoreline and navigable waters and 361 ports that see 8000 foreign flag vessels 9 million containers of cargo and nearly 200 m illion cruise and ferry passengers every year we have some 422 primary airports and another 124 commercial service airports that see 30000 flights and 18 m illion passengers every day there are approximately 110000 miles of highway and 220000 miles of rail track that cut across our nation and 590000 bridges do tting americas biggest cities and smallest towns that is just thumbna il of the vast infrastructure that supports the largest and most efficient economy in the world with more than 11 trillion in gross domestic product1 this report utilizes severa l graphical presentations to better understand the points of vulnerability in the border security system before discussing one integrated approach it should be noted that the appr oach in this report is but one of number of possible approaches to this issue this report is the first in threepart series of crs reports that make use of analyti cal frameworks to better understand complex problems in border security and cast them in terms that facilitate the consideration of alternative policies and practices2 crs report rl32840 border and transportation security selected programs and policies the second report in the series discusses selected programs and po licies currently in place to address these issues the third and final report in the series addresses possible approaches and policy options that might be explored by congress in searching for higher levels ofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32839crs2 border security and is entitled crs report rl32841 border and transportation security possible new di rections and policy options definition of border security and the scope of the report in this report and the other two reports in the series border security is taken to mean all efforts by the us government and other actors to interdict terrorists and their weapons of destruction at the us border in itially it starts with direct intervention to prevent threats and interd ict dangerous people and goods at the us border itself in terms of ports of entry at land sea or air terminals protection efforts at the border are extended to encompass both such extra border activities as targeting and preinspecti on of people and cargo in originating ports around the world crossborder efforts between ports of entry by the border patrol as well as intra us efforts to intercept people and goods as they are shipped inland from their original port of arrival or from internal us sites the latter involves using the internal enforcement tools of the federal bureau of investigation fbi immigration and customs enforcement ice and other law enforcement agents this report does not address domestic intelligence or law enforcement efforts directed at terrorists inside the country in depth although the second report in the series does discuss aspects of intelligence and enforcement related to immigration and border policy finally this report focuses almost exclusively on what comes in via the border and not so much on what goes out except the effort to prevent terrorists and their activities from being transshipped to our allies abroad the report employs several polic frameworks for arraying complex phenomena to help in both understanding and analyzing the my riad activities that are embraced in the search for greater border security functions of conceptual framework conceptual frameworks can be important aids to achieving greater understanding of underlying problems as well as framing more effective solutions criteria for good policy framework include does it help the analyst or policymaker understand and provide structure to complex phenomenon does it help focus on important dimensions of policy design does it help generate additiona l hypotheses for possible future action does it offer guidance for prioritizing actions with these criteria in mind we now turn to discussion how border security fits into the larger concept of homeland securityhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32839crs3 the role of border security in homeland security the homeland security effort can be seen as series of concentric circles or screens with the outer screen being that of preventive efforts launched outside the country the continuum of activities to provide homeland security then moves through progressively smaller circles starting from more distant efforts to closer and more localized measures thus the process starts with prevention abroad and progresses through the other stages as needed 1 discovery and interdiction of terrorist action emanating from abroad the earlier that terrorists andor their weapons are known and interdicted even before coming to the united states the lower the danger to the country and its people with so many targets of opportun ity in such large and open society it is virtually impossible to protect them ll hence the importance of enhanced intelligence to learn the identities of terrorist groups and individuals as well as their motives planned actions targets weapons and timing this effort and any follow on interdiction abroad could be further enha nced with the use of effective diplomacy in marshaling the s upport and c ooperati on of other countries even to the point of using joint police andor military force to contain the danger abroad before terrorist missions are launched on us soil this is stage one the first screen in terms of reach and importance for success in the rest of the mission to prevent attacks and damage to people and property it incl udes related policy efforts to prevent the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction in an atte mpt to deny terrorist access to the most devastating weapons if this first stage is overlooked the screening at the border could lack focus and be overwhe lmed by the sheer volume of dangerous travelers and materials 2 interdiction at the border if terrorists and weapons of mass destruction cannot be quarantined abroad then it is up to the second screen of border secu rity efforts to inte rdict bad people andor bad things at the border once again given the inherent vulnerability of nearly 300 million people living in free and open society and millions of physical targets of opportunity in the nations infrastructure it is paramount that this interception phase be as effective as possible the lions sh are of dhs resources is indeed focused on this target with approxima tely 61 of the budget and over 85 of the departments manpower committed to this goal key acto rs in this effort are the bureau of customs and border protection cbp incl uding the border patrol bp and the coast guard cg 3 defending against catastrophic terrorism inside the united states this stage has many dimensions in part it is designed as reminder to policy analysts that border security efforts exte nd beyond actions at the border there arehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32839crs4 3 see crs report rl33729 federal emergency management policy changes after hurricane katrina summary of statutory provisions coordinated by keith bea specialist in american national govern ment government nd finance divisiondomestic inte lligence and law enfor cement capabilities that can be exploited if terrorists get past the border and outside the reach of other transportation security efforts these include dom estic intelligence components of the fbi ice cbp the bureau of alcohol tobacco firearms and explosives atf as well as the law enforcement capabilities of these agencies and their state and local counterparts which are combined in roughly 100 localiz ed joint terrorist tracking task forces jttfs 4 protection of critical infrastructure and populations if the three previous screens were penetrated there would be little standing in the way of attack on vulnerable populations or infrastructures it is possible to harden these targets to some extent but there are so many targets and terrorists are so opportunistic that this phase of the scr een can offer little more than tight control at critical sites and very thin net over the rest special targeted measures can be taken to protect clear targets such as nuclear power and chemical plants as well as other power plants oil refineries etc the government can encourage the development of sensors and ot her warning devices to aler t and provide some measure of protection to the population against cer tain forms of chemical or biological weapons finally citizens can be informed and advised about pr otective actions they might take 5 emergency preparedness and response if all else fails we must be prepared to 1 minimize the damage and loss of life from an attack 2 alleviate the effects of injury and destructi on and 3 continue to operate effectively as society in rebuilding efforts while this phase would occur at the end of the process it is receiving increased policy attention because the other forms of protection can never be perfect or complete this phase also receives increased policy attention because of the na ture of particularly response activities that are deployed not just to respond to terrorist attacks but also to natural disasters and other scenarios for example the re sponse to hurricane katrina has resulted in significant analysis and policy action3 thus while funding is greatest for border security and for the military in its operations related to terrorism the preparedness and response stage of protection cannot be overlooked because of the irreducible level of vulnerability that will always remain in an atmosphere of risk and uncertainty prudent investors will seek to diversify their portfolios in this case to build overlapping layers of protection with this framework as context the report narrows its focus to border securityhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32839crs5 4 this single comprehensive framework is but one possible framework that could be formulated other studies have offered other ty pologies for example regarding cargo and supply chain security see henry h willis and david s ortiz evaluating the security of the global containe rized supply chain rand corporation 2004the goals of border security reconceptualizing the border this section of the report aims to pr ovide an understanding of border security redefined later in this report as g ood border management to further this understanding this section offe rs several graphical presen tations of border security at the end of the report we synthesize these concepts into single more comprehensive framework4 trends in thinking about the concept of borders border research has become multidisciplinary in focus political scientists geographers sociologists economists and variety of others ve contributed much to research and have offered variety of constructs and avenues of approach to the notion of borders prior to the septem ber 11 2001 terrorist attacks in the united states the thinking often focused on several trends that challenged the prevailing concept of borders strictly defined by the boundaries of th nationstate including 1 geopolitical watersheds such as the end of the cold war or the launch of the schengen treaty in europe 2 increas ing economic integration in the global economy 3 increasing integration of bor der towns and soca lled border regions and 4 the developing boundaryless virt ual societal space created through the internet these challenges all seemed to be leading towards world where borders became evermore permeable to all sorts of things people goods ideas identities inexorably tied to the changing place of the nationstate and perhaps becoming increasingly irrelevant in the aftermat h of september 11 2001 these ideas are being reevaluated particularly in the united states where as seen above border security or good border management forms an integr part of the national strategy for providing homeland security in broad terms good borde r management seeks to balance the competing but not necessarily conflicting goals of 1 facilitating and even expediting access for people and goods that are both needed and desired with 2 in terdicting and stopping bad people and bad things from entering the country the key to success in this endeavor is the ability to accurately and fficiently identify highrisk passengers and cargo target them for inspection and pr event the entry of dangerous goods and people without impeding the flow of legitimate crossborder traffic the task for the policy maker is to identify and promote those policies which will enhance the efficacy of the tools employed for these tasks more specifically the border enforcement agent or inspector is ultimately engaged in an identification and verification process it is an effort to determine the identity of the people or cargo requesting entry and to verify the legitimacy of the request for entry there are many debate s about how best to do this the currenthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32839crs6 5 the concepts of primary and secondary in spection can further complicate the discussion as would be expected primary inspection cons ists of some set of standard examination protocols that are applied to every shipment of cargo or person seeking entry into the country it follows then that the secondary in spection is further set of protocols applied to those shipments or people which for va riety of possible reasons were unable to be satisfactorily processed during the primary inspection 6 pl 109347 sec 2entry processing procedures for both pe ople and cargo are complex and involve numerous steps each of which presents bot h an opportunity for interference or for interception identifying the first step in this process is cha llenging endeavor for reasons that will become ever clearer throug hout the course of this series of reports in the case of cargo is the first step when the goods first leave the factory where they were produced or is the first step wh the goods are placed on the conveyance ship aircraft traincar truck that will ultimately deliver them to the united states in the case of people is the first step wh the individual applies for passport from their own country or is the first step when they apply for visa to enter the united states the last step in this process is easier to pinpoint as it is the inspection at the port of entry one of the vexing questions confronting policy makers is what actually constitutes an inspection does review of entry documents alone constitute an inspection or does something physical have to occur for example taking fingerprints or taking an xray of cont ainer does the inspection mean that the inspector must physically open up and look inside every container to verify its contents compounding the problem is th seeming interchangeability of the terms inspection and screening typically the term inspection is used to denote some level of examination of person or g ood and as noted above can entail number of different actions5 the term screening genera lly is used when referring to applying filter or screen to information or characteristics of cargo and people seeking entry the screen is typically signed to match either certain known criteria with information about the entering cargo or person or to flag certain patterns characteristics or indicators as high risk attached to the entering cargo or person the security and accountability fo r every safe port act pl 109347 contained definitions for the terms examination inspection scan screening and search with regard to maritime container inspections referred to in the bill6 another important debate concerns the level of in spection to be applied in particular to usbound mar itime containers some obs ervers contend that the current layered approach to targeting containers for inspection is insufficient at identifying highrisk containers andor sh ipments and calls for increasing levels of inspection or even for inspecting in some manne r 100 of usbound cargo containers the level of inspection or screening in whatever context these terms are used is likely to remain significant part of the border security debate for the foreseeable futurehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32839crs7 7 remarks of customs and border protec tion commissioner robert bonner sept 12

specialist knowledge services groupin sum what does good border manageme nt look like recent experience has illustrated with remarkable clarity what it should not look like in the immediate aftermath of september 11 2001 the borders of the united states were essentially shut down all air traffic into the united states was either cancelled or diverted including both commercial pa ssengers and cargo the us customs service went to its highest state of alert on the land border this meant that every vehicle entering the united states from canada and mexico was searched causing delays of up to 12 hours at some border crossings in michigan and new york7 these delays resulted in significant economic losses in particular to those industries such as the auto industry that rely on justintime shipping to keep their production lines running by september 13 daimlerchrysle r reportedly announced the closure of one of its manufacturing plants on the following day and on september 14 ford announced that it would have to close five plants during the ensuing week8 what follows are series of conceptualizations to assist the policy maker in developing redefined unde rstanding of the border that includes good border management developing possible typology for the policy maker border management is an extremely comp lex task as the second report in the part series will illustrate9 even the current us border management regime with its bevy of institutions policies and programs can seem overwhelmingly complex and difficult to approach in systematic way seemingly simple notions such as what is the border where is it and when should we be concerned about it are not as straight forward as they appear on the surface the first two questions the what and the where of the border are related and somewhat interdependent for example if the what of the border is simply the physical geographic boundary and limited to us ports of entry then the where and the when are self explanatory people or g oods enter the united states when they have physically crosse d the territorial boundary10 and they need not be addressed until they reach the border this approach to border control might work in situation where the flow of crossborder traffic was small and the resources available to process this traffic were plentiful howe ver the current environment for securinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32839crs8 figure 1 geographic zonesus borders is far more complicated as noted above in the introduction with the statement of admiral james loy former deputy secretary of the dhs if the border is envisioned not merely as physical boundary but rather as flexible concept that allows for the possibility that the border begins at the point where goods or people commence their u sbound journey significantly wider array of options for border management policies becomes available what follows are series of conceptualiz ations intended to assist in answering the above questions and when combined with discussion of current border policies may be useful in seeking new directions for more effective border management policies it is important to note that this series of conceptualizations is cumulative in the sense that each one builds off of the concepts illustrated in the previous section geographic this approach illustrates the path that g oods or people travel to enter the united states the path is divided into zones source zone country of origin departure zone foreign port of entryexit fpoe th transit zone between country of origin and the destination country the arrival or approach zone domestic port of entry dpoe and the destination zone interior of the destination country figure 1 should be viewed left to right and illust rates the zones that people or goods travel through from country of origin to country of destination figure 1 is designed to accommodate variety of travel situations in the case shown travelers and cargo proceed through another country or countries route to the united states including the case where travelers and cargo stop in intermediate countries or ports through which cargo is transhipped however direct travel from source country to destination can also be visualized by mentally eliminating the transit zones and port from the figure source congressional research service crs note fpoe foreign

directorate for science technology and industry july 2003 pp 2328with landbased modes of transportation there is transit zone between the country of origin nd destination country movement of goods and cross border movement of people three principal flows another way of envisioning the border is offered by the organization for economic c ooperation and development oecd the oecd presented conceptualization specifically dealing with the shipment of vesselborne containers which may prove useful the oecds appr oach identifies three principal flows in the international m ovement of goods the movement of goods from place to place logistics chain the movement of custody from person to person and the movement of information or documents11 the principal point to take away from these illustrations is that in order to secure cargo shipments from terrorists or criminals for that matter it is necessary to secure wide range of potential targets incl uding people places conveyances and pieces of information internationally shipped car goes travel in various conveyances on variety of infrastructures through number of places are held in the custody of numerous people and organizations and can involve up to 40 sepa rate documents to complete the journey from the source zone to the distribution zone figures 24 and the accompanying text illustrate this complex process movement of goods from place to place places in the logistics chain on its journey from the country of origin to the destination country cargo moves through the hands of numerous actors in variety of places figure 2 illustrates the case of cargo being transported betw een countries in maritime containers cargo begins its journey in th source zone at the factory from the factory the cargo may travel by truck rail or air to reach the fpoe departure zone in the country of origin during this g of the journey the cargo may be warehoused for export at later date it may stop at consolidation center where it may be combined with other cargoes to comprise fullcontainers tru ckloads railcars worth of shipments and it may be transf erred from one mode of transportation to another from rail to truck for example before reaching the port of exit once at the port departure zone the cargo is transfe rred to the oceangoing vessel that will take it across the transit zone the cargo may pass through another port in the transit zone before reaching the final port of entry in the destination country from the port of entry in the destination country dpoe rrival zone the cargo may travel to the distribution zone by truck or by rail to be 1 warehoused for distribution at later date or 2 deconsolidated and perhaps re consolidated for transport to the buyer variety of actors are involved in each of these places in the logistics chain possessing custody of the cargo on its journeyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32839crs10 12 crs site visit detroitwindsor dec 2003 13 for more information on drayage see crs report rl31738 north american free trade agreement nafta implementation the future of commercial trucking across the continuedsource crs analysis of oecd figures in security in maritime transport note fpoe foreign port of exit and dpoe domestic port of entry however the movement of maritime containers is likely the most complex case air cargo shipments move in similar manner though the time it takes for shipment to travel from the source to the destination zone is typically measured in hours rather than the days and even w eeks for maritime shipments air cargo shipments can move by more than one mode of transportation to consolidator or directly to an airport shipments may be consolidated with others into air cargo containers which are smaller than sea containers and configured to maximize storage space in the cargo holds of aircraft cargo may pass through transit airport on its way to the destination airport once at the destination airport the air cargo may be transported offsite to consolidated freig ht station and decons olidated transferred to truck or rail car and m oved to the final destination in contrast to shipments moving by sea or by air the time it takes landborder shipments to travel from the source to des tination zone can be measured in hours if not minutes one facet of the land border environment has been the advent of highly integrated justintime jit shipping jit is particularly prominent in the automotive industry where for example on th northern border seats for general motors gm cars arrive at the gm plant in detroit less than an hour after being assembled and sent across the peace bridge in windsor ontario canada12 in other cases where smaller or less frequent shipments are required they travel from the factory to consolidator who consolidates lessthantruckload ltl shipments into complete container and transports them across the border another unique facet of truck transport prevalent along the southern border is the process of drayage where shorthaul trucks ferry cargo back and forth across the border13 this addsfigure 2 cargo movement of goods from place to placehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32839crs11 13 continued mexican border by robert s kirk and john f frittellianother transfer phase to the process where drayage is used as an extra carrier is involved for shipments crossing the border by rail the flow is also similar in that the factory shipments may be placed directly into railcars as is the case with some auto plants for example or they may transpor ted by truck to consolidator or to an intermodal rail facility where shipments c omplete or consolid ated are placed in railcars for shipment across the border movement of custody from person to person actors in the logistics chain each cargo shipment begins with buyer and an originating shipper typically the manufacturer intermediaries such as buying agents and freight forwarders are the most frequently utilized intermediaries between the originating shipper and the ocean carrier freight forwarders can provide multiple services needed to transport cargo from factory to port transport warehousing consolidation etc howeve r other actors can provide th services individually as well these include customs brokers tr uck and rail carriers warehouse agents consolidators etc thus cargo shipments can be held by number of different actors on the journey to the port of exit in the case of figure 3 the fpoe once at the port the cargoes pass through the control of the customs authority and are transferred to the port operator who then transfers them to the maritime carrier for transport through the transit zone upon arrival at th port of entry in the destination country the process is reversed the cargo passe s through the custody of the port operator the customs authority and possibly to cu stomshouse brokers or deconsolidators to the transport operator nd finally to the buyer it is important to note that there are in reality two sets of act ors involved those who hold what could be termed as documentary custody the people in the offices at each of the places outlined in figure 3 who handle the paperwork side of the transaction and those actors who have physical custody or are in physical proximity to the cargo itself the warehouse and dock workers longshoremen and truck drivers etc each of these groups of people present different risk s to the flow of cargo and require different policies to address these riskshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32839crs12 14 the secretary of homeland security in consu ltation with the

admission under the grounds for inadmissibility spelled out in the immigration and nationality act ina goods just as with people who seek to enter the united states goods entering the country are also accompanied by set of documents as noted above there are many stages and actors through which cargo can pass before arriving in the united states the oecd notes that so imports can require as many as 40 separate documents in order to complete the journey from the point of origin in the source zone to the destination each time shipment changes hands from personto person or placetoplace as illustrated by figures 2 and 3 it requires documentation the required documentation generally includes two primary sets commercial documents that move cargo from each private sector actor carrier broker freight forwarder consolidator driver etc and customs entry documents which contain information that can be used both for security and commercial compliance screenings generally goods cannot lega lly enter the commerce of the united states until cbp has released them importers or thei r agents eg customs brokers are required to file entry documentation with cbp for each importation regardless of whether or not duty must be paid on th merchandise to expedite clearance of their goods importers often file documents electronically and pay the bonds before the merchandise arrives at

embassy abroad through the fpoe perh aps to transit port and finally to the dpoe it shows all of the different people places and zones through which cargo or individuals can pass route to th united states from foreign country in addition to the points of vulnerability discussed above the oecd highlighted series of related risk considerations relative to oceanborne cargo shipping15 these factors include risks that arise from the cargo itself the vessels carrying the cargo the people associated with the cargo nd the vessels and the money involved in shipping activities this set of risk factors is also adaptable to other modes of transportation including planes trucks rail cars etc cargo shipments present risk in that they can be used to smuggle w eapons conventional ch emical biological radiological or nuclear weapons other types of contraband or people as in immigrant smuggling in vessel containers potential terrorists etc this risk is possible not only for vesselborne containers but also for containers transported by plane truck containers or even rail cars the vessel or conveyance itself presents several risks in that it could 1 be target itself 2 be used to launch an attack or 3 be used as weapon as in the case of the 911 attacks people present risk factor in that terrorists c ould attempt to gain access to conveyance by for example joining vessel crew working at dock or t or by traveling as passenger the money risk factor lies outside the scope of this reporthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32839crs15 border patrolborder patrolfigure 5 movement of goods and people it is important to note that border ma nagement is not necessarily zerosum game policies designed to increase the security of crossborder traffic need not result in delays and inefficiencies at the border border processes and policies are usually judged for their efficacy in advanc ing the twin goals of expediting legitimate traffic and impeding illegitimate traffic source crs and crs analysis of oecd figures in security in maritime transport note fpoe foreign port of exit and dpoe domestic port of entry legitimate and illegitimate crossborder traffic primarily this report has built one possible typology based upon legitimate flows of people and cargo across the borde r though running as an undercurrent throughout the report it is important to explicitly acknowledge the illegitimate flows of people and contraband that enter the c ountry smuggling takes many forms and involves many types of commodities from ci garettes to drugs to weapons to peoplehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32839crs16 issues of concern to federal law enforcement include the potential interchangeability of smuggling networks and their possible nexus with terrorist networks the same groups that smuggle cigarettes across the border today may smuggle drugs or weapons across tomorro w the same group providing fraudulent documentation to illegal immigrants today might be doing business with terrorists tomorrow the concern is that these gr oups are becoming more sophisticated more flexible and increasingly willing to specialize for example one could envision transportation network with real ties to the exporting or importing criminal group this transportation network might be contracted on shipmentby shipment basis to transport smuggle goods or people into the country criminals and terrorists can and do manipulate and interfere with legitimate cargo to smuggle people and contraband into the country th ey also bypass the legitimate processes and ports altogether bringing their goods across between ports of entry the illegal flows of cargo could have very different pattern than the ones discussed in this report on the other nd they could deviate at certain points and become parallel again at others this report has provided series of graphical representations to assist in developing general understa nding of the flow of goods and people across the border as it applies to both legal and illegal crossings conclusion achieving adequate border security is an extremely complex task the conceptual frameworks outlined in this report are meant to assist the policy maker in understanding the legitimate flows of people and goods entering the country as acknowledged earlier in the report legitima flows are but part of the picture criminals and terrorists can and do manipulate and interfere with legitimate cargo to smuggle people and contraband into the c ountry they also bypass the legitimate processes and ports altogeth er bringing their goods across between ports of entry understanding the flow of people and goods into the united states is first step to assessing current efforts and deve loping new options and next steps as noted earlier this report is the first in series of three reports addressing the issue of border security the second report in the series crs report rl32840 border and transportation security selected programs and policies discusses selected current policies and programs in operation to improve at least some aspect of border security these policies are gr ouped in framework that suggests types of possible policy actions pushing the border outwards to in tercept unwanted people or goods before they reach the united states hardening the border through the us of technology and the presence of more agents at the border making the border more accessible for legitimate trade and travel strengthening the border through more effective use of intelligence and multiplying effectiveness through the engagement of other actors inthe enforcement effort including engaging canada mexico state and local law enforcement resources and the private sectorhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32839crs17 security of people and cargo destined for the united states requires complex set of policies that engage actors from each of the geographic zones foreign governments private sector actors and ot her us government agencies these relationships and policies mu st also take into consid eration requirements unique to the different modes of trans portation air vessel truck and rail policies could for example encompass the entire journey from the source zone to the destination zone or policies could focus distinctly on partic ular zoneplaceactor in the journey or layered approach may be employed that involves nearly ll of the constructs identified in figure 5 viz people conveyances cargo pl aces routes etc the transit zone in the maritime environment poses unique challenge for cargo security this is because there is single govern ing body responsible for regulating the zone organizations like the world customs or ganization wco and the international maritime organization imo have adopted measures and are working towards developing strategies to harmonize customs procedures and increase maritime security but the standards and conventions developed by these institutions must be adopted by individual governments for them to have any real authority the third report in the series crs report rl32841 border and transportation security possible new di rections and policy options builds on the first two reports and offers possible new directions and polic options that spring directly from the analytical frameworks contai ned within those reports
