inspector general did likewise and congressional h earings were held more to the point various legislativ proposals surfaced to encourage holders of the 19981999 leases to renegotiate the terms of their leases so as to include price thresholds for future production of oil and ga s this report looks at the legal issues that may be raised by such proposals focusing on proposal which on january 18 2007 passed the h ouse of representatives as section 204 of hr 6 the house energy bill3 hr 6 is now being c onsidered in the senate section 204 prohibits the secretary of th interior from issuing any new oil and gas lease in the gulf of mexico to hol ders of the thresholdless 19981999 leases or associated persons4 unless the leaseholder satisfi either of two conditions acceptance of price thresholds or payme nt of conservation of resources fees more fully explained the first condition that the lessee can meet is to renegotiatehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33974crs2 each covered lease ie 1998 1999 lease to which it is party to include price thresholds greater than those explicitly stated in the dwrra analysis of these provisions require s some background at present the dwrras explicit price thresholds appl under dwrra section 302 only to new production from leases in existence as of the dwrras enactment in 1995 the dwrra provision for the 19981999 leases at issue here section 304 also authorizes the department of the interior to impose price thresholds but in contrast with section 302 it states explicit thres holds thus the matter was left in 1995 to the departments discretion under that discretionary authority the department included price thresholds matching those required for pre1995 leases in the section 304 leases for the years 1995 1996 and 1997 for reasons beyond the scope of this report the wording of the 1998 and 1999 leases was changed in manner that effectively price thresholds thus the re negotiation condition in hr 6 is an effort to have the holders of 19981999 leases accept price thresholds higher than those to which the section 302 leasehol ders have long been subject the second alternative condition that thresholdless leaseholder can meet is to pay conservation of resources fee established by the secretary of the interior the amount of the fees is spelled out in section 204 of hr 6 for producing leases it is 9 per barrel for oil and 125 per million btus for gas payable only in year when the average price for light sweet crude exceeds 3473 per barrel for oil and 434 per million btu for gas in 2005 dollars for nonproducing leases the amount is 375 per acre per year in 2005 dollars in both cases the fees apply on and after october 1 2006 for producing leases howev er the fee is restricted to the thresholdless 19981999 leases fees for nonpr oducing leases apply to all federal oil and gas leases in the gulf of mexico th amount of the fees was likely an attempt to approximate the royalties that w ould have been recovered from the 19981999 leases if the price threshold provision had been in place based on oil and gas prices at the time of the initial drafting of the provision as strictly legal matter therefore section 204 gives the thresholdless 19981999 leaseholder choice accept either pr ice thresholds or payment of fees of roughly similar amount or refuse price thres holds and fees and instead be ineligible for future gulf of mexico leases nothing in section 204 legally compels the leaseholder to give up his freedom from having to pay royalties at any market price for oil and gas though of course the bill presents him with strong economic incentive to do so this report analyzes various legal theories that have been mentioned in the debate over congress options for dealing with the thresholdless leases in the context of the elective sche of section 204 of hr 6 more particularly does section 204 1 work taking under the takings clause of the fifth amendment 2 offend the doctrine of unconstitutional c onditions 3 violate either the substantive due process or equal protec tion guarantees applied by the fifth amendment or 4 effect breach of contract finally the report deals with whether an action against the leaseholders in stion might be possible under the contract theories of unilateral or mutual mistake httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33974crs3 5 see eg united states trust co v new je rsey 431 us

lamborn 153 cong rec h70405 daily ed jan 18 2007 statement of rep gohmerti the takings clause the takings clause of the fifth ame ndment demands that just compensation be paid property owner when hisher p roperty is taken by government action thus the initial task in any takings analysis is to identify cognizable property interest with regard to section 204 of h r 6 one taking argument might be that it interferes with some property right to receive such new leases searching the outer continental shelf lands act and its implementing regulations however we find legal support for property right to receive new ocs leases whether or not one is an existing dwrra leaseholder it is also important to look at existin g dwrra leases to determine whether they provide for right to receive future ocs l eases since existing leases are in the nature of contracts and contract rights are ge nerally deemed to be property in takings clause jurisprudence5 based on informal conversati ons with ocs leasing experts crs asssumes in this report that dwrra leases including the 19981999 leases contain explicit right to bid on new oc s leases though we have surveyed only representative individual leases the principal argument that section 204 ffects taking would seem to be that since the holder of one of the leases in question must choose between paying new fee or becoming ineligible for future l eases section 204 effectively forces such leaseholders to renegotiate valuable lease term their exemption from having to pay any royalty on certain production regardless of how high the market price of oil or gas rises6 this lease term is seen as property right at the outset nothing in section 204 directly or indirectly alte rs terms in existing dwrra leases section 204 does not mandate renegotiation of lease terms but only creates an incentive to renegotiate this situation gives the united states an argument that there is taking from this perspective the decision of leaseholder to renegotiate is voluntary and loss re sulting from voluntary action cannot be the basis of takings claim the case w supports the doctrine that losses due to voluntary action cannot provide grounds for takings claim regardless of whether dwrra leaseholders bring regulatory or physical takings challenge to sectionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33974crs4 7 in the regulatory taking

ruckelshaus 11 id at 10072047 courts have held that an act wa s voluntary notwithstanding significant economic pressure on the claimant to submit to the alleged property deprivation8 however it is worth nothing that dwrra leaseholder could potentially exist for which ineligibility to receive new leases in the gulf of mexico imposes such hardship as to prompt court to reject voluntariness defense our research has not revealed any taki ngs decisions in which the statutory or regulatory approach alleged to have caused the taking is identical to the approach of section 204 often contractua l takings claims involve outright abrogation of express contract terms by the united states this differs from the incentive approach of section 2049 perhaps the most closely analogous case is ruckelshaus v monsanto 10 takings challenge to the federal pesticide statute this statute prohibited the sale or use of any pesticide except in accordan ce with its epa registration to obtain registration the pesticide ma nufacturer had to submit data supporting the pesticides safety and effectiveness da ta that often included trade secrets the statute had promised protection from disclosure prio r to 1978 but statutor amendments adopted in 1978 limited those protections plaintiff claimed that the data registration and limited data disclosure provisions of the statute effected taking of property right namely their trade secrets the court reco gnized that the plaintiffs trade secrets were legitimate property interest but held that the voluntary submission of trade secrets post1978 in exchange for the econom ic advantages of registration can hardly be called taking11 the court reasoned that during this period monsanto had voluntarily submitted its trade secret data with full knowledge of the legal possibility that epa would use the data in ways that diminished their trade secret value and thus could not complain when the agency actually did so the ruckelshaus holding that voluntary compromise of property right in exchange for an economic benefit is not taking suggests that court might reach the same conclusion with respect to taking s challenge to section 204 as with the statute at issue in ruckelshaus section 204 would not require any action but wouldhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33974crs5 12 contrary decision was reached in philip morris inc v reilly 312 f3d 24 1st cir 2002 by split decision this case involved massachusetts statute requiring cigarette manufacturing companies selling cigarettes in the st ate to submit trade secret data as to the chemical additives used in their cigarettes for possible public disclosure or they could elect not to do business in the state two j udges found taking of the trade secrets on different rationales one found taking 13 364 us 40 49 1960 14 as stated by representative simpson during fl oor debate on previous legislative attempt to address the absence of royalty price threshold in the 19981999 leases the department of the interiors inspector genera l has appropriately launched an investigation into the lack of price thresholds in the ffected leases as has the resources committee 152 cong rec h2830

appeals from the court of federal claims in the federal circuit 16 the seminal decision is sun oil co v united states 572 f2d 786 1978 which by coincidence involved federal ocs leases the c ourt stated that takings theory has limited application to the relative rights of party litig ants when those rights have been voluntarily created by contract in such instances inte rference with such contractual rights generally gives rise to breach claim not taking claim accord hughes communications galaxy continuedinstead offer choice compromise pr operty right exemption from payment of royalties in exchange for possible econo mic benefit receipt of new ocs leases12 another argument that courts would be unlikely to discern taking in section 204 draws on the underlying purpose of the ta kings clause as the court stated in armstrong v united states the takings clause was designed to bar government from forcing some people alone to bear public burdens which in all fairness and justice should be borne by the public as whole13 as this invocation suggests courts have generally been less likely to find taking where property owners have not been treated unequally in this regard it should be noted that it remains unclear whether the 19981999 dwrrra leases price threshold provisions were omitted by mistake14 resulting in leaseholders receiving better deal than the government thought it was providing if it is somehow confirmed that the omission was in fact mistake it may lessen the probability that court would find taking in section 204 because the section could be viewed as congressional effort to correct governmental error that plaintiffs we re exploiting however we do not know whether the upfront bonus payments made by the affected leaseholders were calculated to reflect the fact that the royalty exemption was not linked to market prices if so leaseholders could argue th at error or not they paid for the economic advantage of having price threshold there are other factors which suggest that challenge to section 204 as an unlawful taking might not succeed first the court of federal claims and its appellate court the us court of appeals for the federal circuit are the courts that would adjudicate takings challenge to section 20415 these courts have long voiced preference for adjudicating cases involving written contr acts with the united states on breach of contract theory rather than under takings law16 second anyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33974crs6 16 continued inc v united states 271 f3d 1060 1070 fed cir 2001 takings claims rarely arise under

unconstitutional conditions state power and the limits of consent 102 harv l rev 4 1988 kathleen m sullivan unconstituti onal conditions 102 harv l rev 1413 1989regulatory taking claim may be parried by the governments argument that government contracting is heavily regulated field so that affected leaseholders cannot claim to be surprised especially gi ven the level of current oil prices that congress sought to impose section 204 with regard to the bid ineligibility section 204 imposes the united states has broad di scretion in setting th qualifications of those with whom it contracts17 thus it may be argued that section 204 does not defeat any reasonable investmentbacked expectations of affected leaseholders while our analysis suggests that sec tion 204 may not constitute constitutional taking it should be noted that if the court agrees to do takings analysis at all the outcome can be difficult to predict this is in part because factbased analysis is often used to resolve takings claim this could be the case with takings challenge to section 204 of hr 6 which could c onceivably turn on whether particular plaintiff is able to demonstrate that the loss of the ability to bid on future leases is such an onerous burden that section 204s options of renegotiati on or payment of fee are not voluntary ii doctrine of unconstitutional conditions though first stated by the supreme c ourt over century ago the doctrine of unconstitutional conditions still lacks consiste nt formulation and is invoked by the court unpredictably18 in blackletter terms the doctrine states that the government ordinarily may not grant benefit on the condition that the beneficiary surrender constitutional right even if the governme nt may withhold that benefit altogether the

the unconstitutional conditions doctrine in th exactions realm provides that the government may not require person to give up constitutional right here the right to receive just compensation when property is taken for public use in exchange for discretionary benefit conferred by the government where the continuedemploy strict scrutiny in analyzing the challenged condition19 the doctrine is intended to prevent the government from indirectly achieving result that it could not command directly challenge to section 204 based on th doctrine of uncons titutional conditions would likely assert that the section impermissibly seeks abandonment of the constitutional right to compensation for lessees property right in valuable contract term in return for the government benefit of eligibility for new ocs leases this argument would assume and this memorandum will assume that congress could not directly eliminate the leaseholde rs royaltyfree status without triggering compensable taking it does not appear likely that sec tion 204 would violate the doctrine of unconstitutional conditions lthough given the limited and inconsistent case law on the doctrine it is difficult to reach conclusion with any certainty in ruckelshaus v monsanto case that as noted above offe rs rough analogy to section 204 the court rejected not only taking ar gument but one based in the doctrine of unconstitutional conditions as well mons anto argued that the pesticide acts requirement that the registration applicant give up its property interest in the trade secrets constituted placing an unconstituti onal condition on the right to valuable government benefit the court re jected this argument stating that monsanto has not challenged the ability of the federal government to regulate the marketing and use of pesticides nor could monsanto successfully make such challenge for such restrictions are the burdens we all must bear in exchange for the advantage of living and doing business in civilized community this is particularly true in an area such as pesticide sale and use that has long been the source of public concern and the subject of government regulation20 it should be noted that subsequent to ruckelshaus the court did make the doctrine of unconstitutional conditions the foundation of its test as to whether taking is effected by landuse exacti on land dedication conditions imposed by government agencies upon their pproval of proposed development21 however it might be difficult to argue on this basis that ruckelshaus is longer good law the area of land exactions is highly specialized also the variant of the unconstitutional conditions sta ndard applied by the court in the land exaction decisions would likely be satisfied by section

likewiseiii substantive due process and equal protection substantive due process the due process clause of the fifth amendment is stated in purely procedural terms directing that pers on be deprived of life liber ty or property without due process notwithstanding the court has long discerned in the clause prohibition on certain types of legislation interfering with such interests regardless of the process used this implicit prohibition is known as substantive due process the precise content of substantive due process analysis varies considerably depending on the category of legislation for present purposes what is most important is that socalle d economic legislation of which section 204 is almost certainly an example is tested under the most deferential of substantive due process standards asking only whether one can conceive of rational basis for congress action it is by now well established that legislative acts adjusting the benefits and burdens of economic life come to the court with presumption of constitutionality and that the burden is on one complaining of due process violation to establish that the legislatur has acted in an arbitrary and irrational way23 courts rarely find violation of this defe rential threshold in particular it would seem that section 204s effect on contr actual property rights is well on the constitutional side of the threshold24 in section 204 congress may be expressing judgment that royaltyfree dwrra leases are not in the public interest and would be creating means to discourage their continuance that the means ineligibility for new leases is rationally related to this legitimate government objective seems difficult to question to be sure section 204 would achieve its legitimate purpose by imposing burden on existing

and procedure 182 3d ed 1999 30 see rotunda and nowak treatise 183 supra note 29retroactivity aspect of section 204 does not appreciably alter the substantive due process analysis as the court has stated our cases are clear that legislation readjusting rights and burdens is not unlawful solely because it upsets otherwise settled expectations this is true even though the effect of the legislation is to impose new duty or liability based on past acts25 the retroactivity aspect of legislation is subject to separate substantive due process scrutiny but under the same ferential rationalba sis standard t hat burden is met simply by showing that the retroactive application of the legislation is itself justified by rational legislative purpose26 the retroactivity feat ure of section 204 certainly meets this minimal standard given that the dwrra leases that congress wishes to have renegotiated are already in existence it had little choice but to apply section 204s newlease eligibility restriction to existing leases equal protection as preliminary matter the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment27 which by its terms applies only to the states has been held applicable to the federal government as well through the due process clause of the fifth amendment 1995 supreme court decisi on notes that the court has for decades treated the equal protection obligati ons imposed by the fifth and fourteenth amendments as indistinguishable28 equal protection analysis seeks to assu re that similar ent ities will be treated similarly by the government it has been said that equal protection does not reject the governments ability to classify persons or draw lines in the creation and application of laws but it does guarantee that those classifications will not be based upon impermissible criteria or arbitrarily us ed to burden group of individuals29 depending on the nature of the classificati on the standard of review used by courts varies greatly when the laws classifi cation involves funda mental constitutional right eg interstate travel marriage or voting suspect cla ssification eg race or country of origin or characteristics ch as sex or legitimacy higher level of scrutiny either strict or intermediate is used30 by contrast when the challenged law is deemed economic legisl ation not involving fundamental rights and suspect classifications the level of scrutiny applied by the court is at minimum that is at its most deferential to the legislative judgment httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33974crs10 31 fcc v beach communications inc 508 us 307 313 1993 emphasis added 32 in continuing to establish legislative history for section 204 or similar measures congress might wish to avoid any suggestion that its motives are punitivesection 204 would appear not to involve any of the suprem courtrecognized triggers for anything greater than th minimal level of scrutiny under equal protection analysis at leas t for purposes of equal protec tion analysis contract rights such as those held by ocs lessees and pr operty rights in general have not been judicially designated as fundamental constitutional righ ts rather section 204s approach likely would be viewed by cour ts as economic legislation as such it would be subject to the minimal standard of judicial review the court has stated that whether embodied in the fourteenth amendment or inferred from the fifth equal protection is not license for courts to judge the wisdom fairness or logic of legislative choices in areas of social and economic policy statutory classification that neither proceeds along suspect lines nor infringes fundamental constitutional rights must be upheld against equal protection challenge if there is any reasonably conceivable state of fa cts that could provide rational basis for the classification this standard of review is paradigm of judicial restraint31 thus if court can holds that there is rational basis for achieving legitimate government objective in connection with s ection 204s different treatment of ocs leases without price thresholds and those with price thres holds it will reject an equal protection challenge to section 204 it w ould seem that such rational basis for achieving legitimate government objective can be imagined congress in enacting section 204 might have thought that less ees without price th resholds are earning greater than reasonable profits from the pub lic lands given the much higher price of oil and natural gas today than when the l eases were entered into and given the open ended royalty relief as such congress might reasonabl have concluded that such lessees should be ineligible to bid on ne w ocs leases under which they would earn further though not to say unreasona ble profits from public property32 congress might also have determined that entities that were not required to pay royalties under the 19981999 leases might as result have b een in better financial position to bear the burden of fee aimed at conservation of resources it would also seem rationally related to legitimate gove rnment objective that congress in enacting section 204 thought that such an approach would encourage renegotiation of the noprice threshold leases especially should it be determined that the omission of price thresholds was truly an administrative take and might also provide funds for protection of resources in sum it seems likely that section 204 would survive equal protection challengehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33974crs11 33 see eg mobil oil exploration and

at 176iv breach of contract in addition to potential challenges to section 204 based on constitutional violations as described supra it is possible that adversely affected parties might seek redress based on an alleged breach of cont ract namely that the united states has effectively breached its agreement in the 19981999 leases by enacting section 204 the supreme court has repeatedly declared that when the united states enters into contract relations its rights and duties therein are governed generally by the law applicable to contracts be tween private individuals33 this includes the law governing breach of contract under the tucker act the united states has waived sovereign immunity for breach of contract claims against it34 the fact that section 204 renders certain dwrra leaseholders ineligible for new ocs leases probably would not constitu breach of contract by the united states if as discussed in the fifth amendment takings section existing dwrra leases contain promise that the leaseholders will be eligible to bid on new ocs leases that is based on this assump tion section 204 appears not to deny any performance owed by the united states to such lessees as to existing leaseholders giving up their valuable exemption to gain eligibility for new leases our research reveals cas where voluntary surrender of contract right was held to constitute breach thoug h the united states has indeed been held liable for breach the court decisions involve government abrogation by fiat not by offers of choice35 however as with our takings analysis it should be noted that there may be factual issue regarding whether in handful of cases renegotiation has been effectively compelled because th loss of eligibility for new leases for certain entities is so damaging that real option exists finally leaseholders who accept the implicit invitation in section 204 to renegotiate might be tempted to argue that renegotiated contracts are voidable because entered into under duress under th restatement second of contracts if one enters into contract because of an improper threat by the other party that leaves the victim reasonable alternative the contract is voidable36 as stated however the threat must be improper and the restatement definition of this term37 does not appear to fit the circumstances of section 204 thus an effort by holders of renegotiated leases to void them base d on section 204induced duress likely would failhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33974crs12 38 see eg richard lord williston on contracts 701 4th ed 2003 hereinafter williston 39 restatement second of contracts 153v unilateral and mutual mistake the previous sections of this report examined possible legal challenges to congressional action aimed at recovery of amounts not currently recoverable under the 19981999 leases due to the absence of price threshold provision with focus on the provisions of section 204 of hr 6 however it is also prudent to examine the possibility of litigation under the common law contract doctrin of mistake that could effectively alter the 1998 and 1999 leas so as to include royalty price thresholds without necessita ting congressional action becau leases are type of contract it is possible that party could sue the lessees andor united states under the contract law doctrines of unilateral or mutual mistake asking the court to impose reformation of the leases or to void them the argument would be premised on the possibility that either the minerals management service mms of the department of the interior alone or both the mms nd the lessees made mistake as to the effect of the 19981999 lease language thus we will assume for purposes of our analysis that mms or mms and the lessees mistakenly thought the references to 30 cfr part 260 in the 19981999 leases had the effect of imposing price thresholds as an initial proposition we note that an rroneous belief as to the effect of an agreement provision just as an erroneous be lief as to nonlegal facts constitutes mistake for purposes of the unilateral and mutual mistake doctrines38 unilateral mistake in this section we assume that only the mms not the oil company lessees believed at the time the 19981999 leases were signed that price thresholds had been incorporated that is the mistake on mms part was unilateral and the lessees were aware of the lack of price threshol d in the leases section 153 of the restatement second of contracts hereinafter the restatement states where mistake of one party at the time contract was made as to basic assumption on which he made the contract has material effect on the agreed exchange of performances that is adverse to him the contract is voidable by him if he does not bear the risk of the stake under the rule stated in 154 and the effect of the mistake is such that enforcement of the contract would be unconscionable or b the other party had reason to know of the mistake or his fault caused the mistake39 section 154 of the restatement referred to in the above quoted language suggests that the mms likely did not b ear the risk of the supposed mistake in question here because the risk was not contractually allocated to mms nor was mms aware of any limited knowledge with respect to the facts pertaining to the royalty thresholdhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33974crs13 40 id at 154 41 id at ch

eliminates the first barrier to the courts award of redress under the theory of unilateral mistake thus voiding the lease might be available as remedy if either the effect of mms mistake allowing the lessees to avoid paying royalties with oilgas prices above the threshold is deemed unconscionable or b the lessees h ad reason to know of the mistake winning unilateral mistake case is an uphill climb the law of contracts says the restatement supports the finality of tran sactions lest justifiable expectations be disappointed41 voiding or reformation of contract terms is the exceptional situation42 especially is this so when the mistake was made solely by one party finally establishing unconscionability is said to be substantial burden43 though as section 153 indicates th rough use of the disjunctive or showing unconscionability may be bypassed by pursuing clause b also the fact that the mistake could have been averted by the exercise of reasonable care by the mistaken party does not preclude remedy44 contract reformation would not seem to be available as remedy for unilateral mistake according to section 155 of the restatement where contract fails to express an agreement because of mistake by both parties as to the effect of the writing the court may at the request of party reform the writing but if one party here mms sends to the ot her the lessees an offer which because of mistake does not reflect the offero rs intention the rule stated in this section does not apply because only one pa rty is mistaken and because there was prior agreement the mistaken partys remedy if any in that case is not reformation but avoidance under the rule stated in 15345 diverging slightly from the restatement view leading treatise asserts that unilateral mistake accompanie d by inequitable conduct by the other party who knew of the mistake and failed to point it out may be regarded as mutual mistake and remedied by reformation46 mutual mistake in this section we assume that both the mms and the lessees believed at the time the 19981999 leases were signed that price thresholds had been incorporated by the leases reference to 30 cfr part 260 that is the mistake was mutual

cfr part 495 prescrib ing the principal contract termination clauses the actual text of the clauses is set out at federal acquisition regulation 48 cfr 522491 et seqwhere writing that evidences or embodies an agreement fails to express the agreement because of mistake of both partie s as to the contents or effect of the writing the court may at the request of party reform the writing to express the agreement except to the extent that the rights of third parties such as good faith purchasers for value will be unfairly affected47 especially pertinent to the dwrra leases the restatement is explicit that if the parties are mistaken with respect to the legal effect of the language that they have used the writing may be reformed to reflect the intended effect48 as with unilateral mistake the remedy here reformation i s not precluded by the mere fact that the party who seeks it failed to exercise reasonable care in reading the writing 49 in order for section 155 to be invoked however there must have been some agreement between the parties prior to the writing50 perhaps letter exchange between mms and the lessees expressing belief that the leases included price thresholds treatise indicates that the key factor in the defectivewriting mutual mistake cases is proof of the actual agreement of the parties51 to the best of our knowledge document that demonstrates an agreement between mms and the lessees to include royalty price thresholds ex ists this lack of proof of an agreement between the parties on the issue could make it difficult to establish mutual mistake comments indulging in speculation it seems likel that the 19981999 leases involved at most unilateral mistake by mms rather than mutual mistake or at least that mutual mistake would be harder to prove the law of unilateral mistake in connection with contract mistakes by the government is undeveloped however in leading treatise on us government procurement contracts different but more common type of government contract than leases the doctrine of unilateral mistake is discussed at length with numerous c ourt and administrative decisions cited52 but apparently every one of these decisions i nvolves mistakes by the contractor not the united states this lopsided ratio may be the result of two clauses commonly found in government procurement c ontracts that obviate the gove rnments having to argue mistake one such clause is the ter mination for convenience clause which is standard in every governme nt procurement contract53 the other is clause to thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33974crs15 54 see federal acquisition regulation 48 cfr subpart 432 noting that generally government contracts contain changes clause that permits the contracting officer to make unilateral changes in designated areas within the general scope of the contract the actual text of the clauses is set out at federal acquisition regulation 48 cfr 522431 et seq 55 letter from c stephen allred assistant cretary for land and minerals management us department of the interior to hon ed ward j markey dated dec 6 2006 while the actions from 1998 and 1999 are regrettable the federal government must be reliable business partner and must honor its contractual obligations even when in retrospect the terms of those contracts appear unfavorable 56 daimlerchrysler corp v cuno 126 s ct 1854 2006 the decision makes clear that rejection of taxpayer standing applies equally to government expenditures and more pertinent to the odrra leases to government actions that reduce amounts available to the treasury id at 1862effect that the government has the right unilaterally to issue contract change orders subject to renegotiation of the contract price54 whatever the cause of the paucity of governmentmistake cases we are left with situation in which there is little appli cable precedent for assessing whether the unilateral mistake doctrine applies to the circumstances here certainly the fact that the mms arguably was acting within its dwrra section 304 authority in not imposing price thresholds adds complicating element to the analysis it should also be noted that it is not cl ear who would be proper party to bring challenge to the 19981999 leases based on unilateral or mutu mistake the united states would be the most natural party to sue since it is the directly aggrieved party but the department of the inte rior has communicated views to congress suggesting that it would not be willing to do so55 plainly the lessees have little incentive to sue and plaintiff suing based solely on hisher status as taxpayer would not succeed in an article iii court the supreme court has r ecently reaffirmed its rejection of federal taxpayer standing based on the constitutions case or controversy requirement56 thus who might be able to bring challenge to the 19981999 leases is not clear vi conclusion efforts to rectify what appears to be an oversight in the leases issued by mms in 1998 and 1999 that do not contain royalty price threshold provisions raise number of legal questions these include potential claims of infringement on certain constitutional rights including the takings clause of the fifth amendment the due process clause of the fifth amendment and the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment related concer n is an allegation of the doctrine of unconstitutional conditions which forbids the government from granting benefit on the condition that the beneficiary surrender constitutional right even if the government may withhold that benefit altogether alt hough our analysis does not conclude that current effort s to rectify the oversight in the 199899 leases including the provisions of hr 6 would constitute clear violations of these constitutional rights they should be kept in mind in any analysis of proposed fix to the leaseshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33974crs16 in addition any efforts to correct for th absence of royalty price thresholds in the 19981999 leases could be perceived as breach of contract because leases are considered contractual by nature and for the most part the federal government is treated the same as any other contracting pa rty by the courts although hr 6 offers lessees the option to renegotiate their leases and does not force them to do so the final analysis of whether the legislation or similar legislation effectively breaches the lease may be factual an alysis dependent upon the resu lting hardship to individual lessees and thus it is difficult to predict how court might rule on this issue finally it should be noted that there is potential nonlegislative fix for the missing royalty price thresholds in the 19981999 leases the leases could be challenged based on theory of unilateral mistake or of mutual mistake for such claim to succeed resulting in reformation or voiding of the leases the party challenging the lease provisions would have to demonstrate among other things that one or both parties thought it was including the royalty price thresholds when the leases were signed furthermore an interested party would have to be willing to litigate the matter thus far party has initiated litigation to amend or void the leases
