under clause 2 of rule xix one motion is in order to recommit bill or joint resolution after the house has ordered the previous question on the measure and before the vote on passing it the speaker gives preference in recognition for this purpose to member of the minority party who opposes the bill member of the committee that reported the bill is likely to be recognized before noncommittee member and any member of the minority party would be recognized before member of the majority party house resolutions and concurrent resolutions are not subject to recommittal motions this motion to recommit can take two different forms simple or straight motion only proposes to recommit or send back the bill or joint resolution to the committee that reported it this motion is not debatable and if adopted can have the effect of killing the measure committee is less likely to bring up bill that the house has already effectively rejected the house does not often adopt motion to recommit in this form more common is the motion to recommit with instructions in this form recommittal motion proposes to return the measure to committee with certain instructions regarding actions the committee as an agent of the house should take for example the motion may instruct the committee to hold additional hearings most frequently members move to recommit measures to committee with amendatory instructions such motion typically proposes to recommit bill or joint resolution to the committee that had reported it with instructions th at the committee report the measure back to the house forthwith with certain amendment the text of which is included in the recommittal motion if the house adopts such motion the committee to which the measure has been recommitted is given time in which to act and discretion about how to act as result the recommitted measure never actually leaves the house floor instead the committee chair immediately rises and on behalf of the committee and pursuant to the houses instruction reports the bill back to the house with the amendment contained in the recommittal motion the measure then is back before the house with that amendment pending the house votes on agreeing to the amendment and then on final passage of the bill as amended if amended if the house adopts motion with instructions th at do not explicitly call for the measure to be reported back to the house forthwith but instead use any other term such as promptly the bill or joint resolution is longer before th house and would return to the specified committee for further action in effect therefore motion to recommit with amendatory instructions provides one last opportunity for member almost always from the minority party to offer an amendment to the

therefore the recommittal motion that contains it must meet the same requirements as any other amendment the amendment must be germane for example and it may not propose only to amend portion of the measure that already has been amended if point of order is sustained against the amendments contained in the motion to recommit member would be allowed to offer another valid motion to recommit so long as it was in order under the rules motion to recommit measure with instructions is debatable for 10 minutes unless the majority floor manager of the measure asks that the time for debate be extended to an hour in either case the time is equally divided between the member making the motion and member opposing it amendments may be offered to the motion to recommit if the previous question is not ordered or if the previous question fails the rules committee is prohibited by rule xiii clause 6c from reporting special rule that precludes recommittal motion with amendatory instructions if the minority leader or his designee seeks recognition to make the motion except when the house considers senate bill only for the purpose of arranging conference with the senate for more on the motion

member may move to recommit the report to conference if the house is the first chamber to act on it if the senate has already approved the report the effect of that vote is to discharge the senates conferees so there longer is conference committee to which the house might recommit the report the same holds true in reverse if the house acts first on the conference report then the senate may not offer motion to recommit that measure to conference as with initial consideration one valid motion to recommit is in order that motion may propose simply to return the report to the conference committee almost always however the motion recommits the report with instructions to the conferees to present new report that meets whatever criteria are contained in the instruc tions for example to insist on certain house position or to reach different compromise with the senate that satisfies certain conditions however the instructions contained in the recommittal motion may not include argument or instruct the houses conferees to reach some agre ement that exceeds their authority as conferees point of order lies against any conference repor t for failing to comply with instructions that the house had voted to give its conferees in this form also making the motion to recommit remains the prerogative of the minority party unless minority party member seeks recognition to offer the motion the motion to recommit conference report is amendable if the house does not vote to order the previous question on the motion
