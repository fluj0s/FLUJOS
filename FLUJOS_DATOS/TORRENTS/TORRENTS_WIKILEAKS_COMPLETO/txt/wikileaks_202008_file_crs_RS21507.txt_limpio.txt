23 2008 project bioshield purposes and authorities frank gottron specialist in science and technology policy resources science and industry division summary many potential chemical biological radiological and nuclear cbrn terrorism agents lack available countermeasures in 2003 president bush proposed project httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21507 bioshield to address this need the 108th congress passed the project bioshield act of 2004 s 15 and president bush signed it into law on july 21 2004 pl 108276 the main provisions of this law include 1 relaxing procedures for some cbrn terrorismrelated spending including hiring and awarding research grants 2 guaranteeing federal government market for new medical countermeasures and 3 permitting emergency use of unapproved countermeasures project bioshield countermeasure procurement funding comes from the department of homeland security appropriations act 2004 pl 10890 which appropriated 5593 billion for fy2004 to fy2013 congress considered several additional measures to further encourage countermeasure development and passed the pandemic and allhazard preparedness act pl 109417 this law created the biomedical advanced research and development authority barda in the department of health and human services questions remain regarding the impact barda will have on countermeasure development the continuing implementation of project bioshield and whether additional legislation would further encourage countermeasure development introduction following the terrorist attacks of 2001 the federal government determined that it would need additional medical countermeasures eg diagnostic tests drugs vaccines and other treatments to respond to an attack using chemical biological radiological or nuclear cbrn agents1 the paucity of cbrn agent countermeasures is attributed to the lack of significant commercial market2 because these diseases and conditions occur 1 for additional information and analysis of the procurement provisions of project bioshield see crs report rl33907 project bioshield appropriations acquisitions and policy implementation issues for congress by frank gottron 2 alan pemberton pharmaceutical research and manufacturers of america testimony before continued crs2 infrequently little economic incentive exists to invest the millions of dollars required to bring treatments to market project bioshield to encourage the development of new cbrn countermeasures president bush proposed project bioshield in his 2003 state of the union address the 108th congress considered this proposal and passed the project bioshield act of 2004 pl 108276 signed into law july 21 20043 this act has three main provisions it provides the department of health and human services hhs expedited procedures for cbrn terrorismrelated spending including procuring products hiring experts and awarding research grants the act creates governmentmarket guarantee by allowing the hhs secretary to obligate funds to purchase countermeasures while they still have several more years of development however companies only receive payment when development is complete and the product is delivered the act also authorizes the hhs secretary to temporarily allow the emergency use of countermeasures that lack food and drug administration fda approval httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21507 expedited procedures the act relaxes procedures under the federal acquisition regulation for procuring property or services used in performing administering or supporting cbrn countermeasure research and development rd this decreases both the amount of paperwork required for these expenditures and the potential for oversight the act increases the maximum from 100000 to 25 million for contracts awarded under simplified acquisition procedures it also allows these purchases using other than full and open competition another provision increases the micropurchase maximum from 2500 to 15000 these increases are similar to but greater than changes granted to the department of homeland security dhs and other departments and agencies in the homeland security act pl 107296 and the national defense authorization act 2004 pl 108136 the act authorizes the hhs secretary to use an expedited award process rather than the normal peer review process for grants contracts and cooperative agreements related to cbrn countermeasure rd activity if the secretary deems there is pressing need for an expedited award this power is limited to awards of 15 million or less some scientists have expressed concerns that an expedited peer review process will reduce the research quality4 the normal peer review process is designed to provide proposals with greater scientific merit higher probability of receiving funding congress allowed hhs to establish the details of this new alternative expedited award process market guarantee the act is designed to guarantee companies that the government will buy new successfully developed cbrn countermeasures for the 2 continued the us house of representatives select committee on homeland security may 15 2003 3 for detailed comparison of the legislative proposals see crs report rl32549 project bioshield legislative history and sidebyside comparison of hr 2122 s 15 and s 1504 by frank gottron and eric fischer 4 john miller interview with richard ebright the scientist vol 17 7 april 7 2003 p 52 crs3 strategic national stockpile sns5 the act allows the hhs secretary with the concurrence of the dhs secretary and upon the approval of the president to promise to buy product up to eight years before it is reasonably expected to be delivered company is paid only on the delivery of substantial portion of the countermeasure therefore this guarantee reduces the market risk for the company but does not affect its exposure to development risk ie the risk that the countermeasure will fail during testing and be undeliverable the pandemic and allhazard preparedness act pl 109417 modified the project bioshield act to allow for milestonebased payments of up to half of the total award before delivery the project bioshield act allows the purchase of unapproved and unlicenced countermeasures it requires the hhs secretary to determine that sufficient and satisfactory clinical experience or research data supports reasonable conclusion that the product will qualify for approval or licensing within eight years6 the approval and licensing processes are designed to preclude the marketing of ineffective or dangerous treatments because most drugs that begin this process fail to become approved treatments critics of this provision suggest that the government will end up purchasing countermeasures that may never be approved to reduce the governments financial risk httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21507 associated with this provision the act allows contracts to be written so that unapproved products may be purchased at lower cost than approved products emergency use of unapproved products the act also allows the hhs secretary to authorize the emergency use of medical products that are not approved by the fda or hhs to exercise this authority the hhs secretary must conclude 1 the agent for which the countermeasure is designed can cause serious or lifethreatening disease 2 the product may reasonably be believed to be effective in detecting diagnosing treating or preventing the disease 3 the known and potential benefits of the product outweigh its known and potential risks 4 adequate alternative to the product is approved and available and 5 any other criteria prescribed in regulation are met although this provision would permit the secretary to circumvent the normal approval process its use appears to be intended to be limited to dire circumstances reporting requirements the project bioshield act of 2004 requires annual reports from the hhs secretary about the exercise of the authorities granted in this bill7 this act also requires the government accountability office gao to produce report four years after enactment to assess actions taken under authorities granted by the act to determine the effectiveness of the act and to recommend additional measures to address deficiencies this report is due in 2008 appropriations this act did not appropriate any money instead it authorized the appropriation of up to total of 5593 billion for fy2004 to fy2013 for 5 the sns contains pharmaceuticals vaccines medical supplies and medical equipment to respond to terrorist attacks and other emergencies 6 118 stat 844 7 hhs has completed one such report see hhs project bioshield annual report to congress july 2004 july 2006 january 2007 available online at httpwwwhhsgovasprbarda bioshieldannualreport crs4 countermeasures procurement the department of homeland security appropriations act 2004 pl 10890 appropriated this amount with explicit windows in which the money could be obligated the act specified that 3418 billion is available for obligation for fy2004 to fy2008 of that amount more than 890 million was available for obligation in fy2004 the balance of the advance appropriation plus any of the available funds for fy2004 to fy2008 remaining unobligated will be available for fy2009 to fy2013 this money is only for the procurement of countermeasures using the project bioshield authorities not for grants to support countermeasure development although congress advanceappropriated the 10year program it retains the power to annually increase or decrease the amount available for project bioshield congress removed 25475 million from this account through rescissions in the consolidated appropriations act 2004 pl 108199 and the consolidated appropriations act 2005 pl 108447 contract awards the first project bioshield contract was announced november 4 20048 vaxgen httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21507 inc would have received 878 million to deliver 75 million doses of new type of anthrax vaccine within three years on december 17 2006 hhs terminated this contract because vaxgen failed to meet contract milestone9 other contracts include 691 million for 29 million doses of the currently approved anthrax vaccine emergent biosolutions 165 million for 20 thousand doses of abthrax treatment for anthrax human genome sciences 144 million for 10 thousand doses of anthrax immune globulin treatment

chemical biological radiological and nuclear threats 72 fed reg 20122 april 23 2007 crs5 only maintain stockpile of at least 10 million doses through 201111 the gao suggested an inventorysharing agreement between hhs and the department of defense dod to allow dod to use the hhs vaccines in its active troop vaccination program before expiration12 dod would reimburse hhs for the vaccine allowing hhs to replenish the stockpile vaccine however this solution would not address the expiration problems of countermeasures lacking other highvolume users such countermeasures may require additional periodic purchases to replenish the stockpile to maintain consistent readiness level congress may consider whether such purchases should be funded through the advanceappropriated project bioshield account or through annual sns budget authorities broad spectrum countermeasures many experts believe that broad spectrum countermeasures those that address multiple cbrn agents would be the most valuable additions to the sns such nonspecific countermeasures might be the best defense against currently unknown threats such as emerging diseases or genetically engineered pathogens furthermore such countermeasures are more likely to have other nonbiodefenserelated applications pl 108276 does not exclude procuring such countermeasures however it does require that the presence of another commercial market httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21507 be factored into the hhs secretarys decision to purchase the countermeasure hhs has stated its interest in using project bioshield to acquire new broad spectrum countermeasures13 however all the project bioshield contracts to date have been specifically targeted at individual threat agents strategy commonly described as one bug one drug congress may decide that hhs needs further guidance or authorities to encourage the development and acquisition of new broad spectrum countermeasures increasing basic research following the anthrax attacks congress increased the national institutes of health budget for cbrn countermeasure research to approximately 15 billion per year it is difficult to determine the optimal funding level for basic research but eventually the law of diminishing returns will apply some scientists have suggested that this has already occurred and inevitably leads to funding unworthy projects14 additionally some scientists argue that the increases in bioterrorism research have come at the expense of other important infectious disease research15 although others dispute this assertion16 11 hhs news release

biodefense strategy practice and science vol 54 2007 pp 353357 crs6 the biomedical advanced research and development authority since the passage of the project bioshield act congress has scrutinized its implementation and effectiveness such evaluation is likely to continue through the 110th congress and beyond as part of the pandemic and allhazards preparedness act pl 109417 congress created the biodefense advanced research and development authority barda in hhs to increase the effectiveness of the governments ability to acquire cbrn countermeasures some experts suggested that project bioshield would more effectively encourage countermeasure development if modeled after the defense advanced research projects agency darpa darpa funds many projects with potential high risk of failure these contracts often last few years and can be renewed if specified milestones are met companies are allowed to make defined profit during the development phase although the direct funding of risky development projects implies that the government will fund many products that never make it to market the government might also structure the contracts so that this assumption of development risk translates into lower procurement costs the pandemic and allhazards preparedness act pl 109417 allows hhs to use similar contracting mechanisms through barda these transactions are not funded httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21507 through project bioshield appropriations but rather through separate account the biodefense medical countermeasure development fund another area that some experts thought required improvement was how the government helped transition promising leads from basic research to the product development stage this period in development is often referred to as the valley of death for pharmaceuticals since some seemingly promising drugs are not developed past this point due to lack of funding several federal programs exist to encourage research development and commercialization of new products such programs include cooperative research and development agreements cradas between government laboratories and universities or industry the central intelligence agencyfunded nonprofit venture capital corporation inqtel the small business technology transfer program and the small business innovation research program in contrast to project bioshields market guarantee at the end of potentially long and risky development process each of these programs offers direct help during the development process and provides incentives for commercialization of the results in barda congress created dedicated infrastructure to manage and fund advanced development and commercialization of cbrn countermeasures in theory barda funding will take those promising drugs from the basic research through the advanced development stage which may include clinical trials critics of such programs suggest that because of the high product failure rate in advanced development the government will inevitably fund unusable products in addition to removing the development risks traditionally borne by industry it inserts government decision makers into the countermeasure development process role critics argue is better suited to industry experts and entrepreneurs17 some critics would prefer to have the government set product requirements and have industry determine how best to meet them it will likely take several years to determine the effect barda has on us civilian biodefense preparedness 17 see crs report rl33528 industrial competitiveness and technological
