control of the government and the cuban communist party pcc to his brother raúl on july 31 2006 because of poor health while initially many observers forecast raúls assumption of power as temporary it soon became clear that pe rmanent succession of political power had occurred fidels health improved in 2007 but his condition rema ined weak and most observers believed that he woul d not resume his role as h ead of the cuban government that proved true when on february 19 2008 fidel announced that he would not accept the position of president of the council of st ate when cubas legislature the national assembly of peoples power was scheduled to meet on february 24 2008 to select from among its ranks the members of the 31member council many observers expected raúl to be selected by the

confronting fidels legacy in cuba the washington quarterly summer 2007 p 55even before fidel provisionally st epped down from power in july 2006 communist successor government under raúl was viewed as the most likely political scenario as first vice president of the counc il of state raúl had been the officially designated successor pursuant to article 94 of the cuban constitution and in the past fidel publicly endorsed raúl as his successor as head of the pcc moreover raúls position as head of the revolutionary arme d forces far which essentially controls cubas security apparatus made him the most likely candidate to succeed fidel so while it was not surprise to observers for raúl to succeed his brother officially on february 24 2008 what was surprising was the selection of josé ramón machado ventura as the council of states first vice pr esident physician by training machado is 77 years old and is part of the older generation of socalled históricos of the 1959 cuban revolution he has been described as hardline co mmunist party ideologue and reportedly has been close friend and confident of raúls for many years1 machados position is significant because it makes him the official successor to raúl according to the cuban constitution many observers had exp ected that carlos lage one of five other vice presidents on the council of state would have been chosen as first vice president he was responsible for cubas economic re forms in the 1990s and at 56 years of age represents younger generation of cuban l eaders while not rising to first vice president lage neverthele ss retained his position as vice president on the council of state and also will continue to serve as the councils secretary several key military officers and confidants of raúl also became members of the council increasing the role of the military in the government general julio casas regueiro 72 years of age who already was on the council became one of its five vice presidents most significantly casas who had been first vice minister in the far was selected by raúl as the countrys new minist er of the far officially replacing raúl in that position casas also is chairman of gaesa grupo administracion empresarial sa the cuban militarys holding company for its extensive businesses two other military appoin tments to the council were gen alvaro lópez miera the armys chief of staff and gen leopoldo cintra frías who commande d the western army one of cubas three military regions2 what is notable about cubas political ccession from fidel to raúl is that it has been characterized by political stability there has been apparent evidence of rivalry or schisms within the ruling lite that have posed threat to raúls new position in the aftermath of fidel initially st epping down in 2006 raúl mobiliz ed thousands of reservists and military troops to quell potential us invasion he also reportedly dispatched undercover security to likely trouble spots in th capital to deal with any unrest but the streets remained calm with sense of normalcy in daytoday cuba3httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22742crs3 4 james c mckinley jr cubas revolu tion lurches forward under two masters new york times

as head of government number of obser vers predicted that he w ould be more open to economic reform than fidel pointing to his past s upport for opening up farmers markets in cuba and the role of the cuban military in successf ully operating economic enterprises many have speculated that cuba under raúl might follow chin or vietnamese economic model to date however there have not been any significant economic changes to indicate that cuba is moving in the direction of chinese model nevertheless with veral minor economic policy changes undertaken by raúl there are some signs that more substantial econo mic changes could be coming under raúl the cuban government has paid off its debts to small farmers and raised prices that the state pays producers for milk and meat customs regulations have been relaxed to allow the importation of home appliances dvd players vcrs game consoles auto parts and televisions and private taxis have been allowed to operate without police interference4 in speech on cubas july 26 2007 revolutiona ry anniversary raúl acknowledged that cuban salaries were insufficient to satisfy basic needs and maintained that structural and conceptual changes were necessary in orde r to increase efficiency and production he also called for increased foreign investment for some raúls call fo r structural changes was significant and could fo reshadow future economic reforms such as allowing more private enterprise and shift away from state ownership in some sectors5 in his first speech as president in february 2008 raúl pro mised to make the government smaller and more efficient to review the potential reevaluation of the cuban peso and to eliminate excessive bans and regulati ons that curb productivity6 cuban public expectations for economic refo rm have increased in the aftermath of raúls july 2007 speech t housands of officiallysanctioned meetings were held in workplaces and local communist party bran ches around the country where cubans were encouraged to air their views and discuss th future direction of the country complaints focused on low salaries and housing and tran sportation problems nd some participants advocated legalization of more private businesses7 raised expectations for economic change in cuba could increase the chance that government actually will adopt some policy changes doing nothing would run th risk of increased public frustration and potential for social unrest increased public frustration was evident in clandestine video widely circulated on the internet in early february of meeting between ricardo alarcón the head of cubas legislature and univers ity students in which student was questioning why cuban wages are so low and why cubans are prohibited from visiting tourist hotels or traveling abroad the video demonstrates the disillusionment of many cuban youth with the dismal economic situati on and repressive environment httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22742crs4 several factors however c ould restrain the magnitude of economic policy change in cuba number of observers believe that as long as fidel castro is around it will be difficult for the government to move forward with any major initiatives that are viewed as deviating from fidels orthodox policies other observers point to the significant oil subsidies and investment that cuba now r eceives from venezuela that have helped spur cubas high economic growth vels over the past several years and maintain that such support lessens the governments impetus fo r economic reforms another factor that bodes against rapid economic policy reform is the fear that it could spur the momentum for political change given that one of the highest priorities for cubas government has been maintaining social and political stab ility any economic policy changes are likely to be smaller changes introduced over time that do not threaten the states control while some degree of economic change unde r raúl castro is likely over the next year few expect there will be any change to the governments tight control over the political system which is backed up by strong security apparatus some observers point to the reduced number of political prisoners from 283 at the end of 2006 to 230 as of midfebruary 2008 as evidence of lessening of repression but dissi dents maintain that the overall situation has not improved for ex ample the government arbitrarily detained more than 300 people for short periods in 2007 of the 75 activists imprisoned in march 2003 55 remain jailed f our were released on february 16 2008 but sent into forced exile to spain some observers contend that as the new government of raúl castro becomes more confident of ensuring social stability and does not feel threatened it could move to soften its hard repression but for now the g overnment is continui ng its harsh treatment of the opposition the selection of josé ra món machado as first vice president also appears to be clear indication that the c uban government has in tention of easing tight control over the political system us policy implications cubas peaceful political succession from one communist leader to another raises questions about the future direction of us policy current us policy can be described as dualtrack policy of isolating cuba through comprehensiv economic sanctions including restrictions on trad and financial transactions while providing support to the cuban people through such measures as fundi ng for democracy and human rights projects and usgovernment sponsored broadcas ting to cuba the cuban liberty and democratic solidarity act of 1996 pl 104114 sets forth number of conditions for the suspension of the embargo including th at transition cuban government does not include fidel or raúl castro has legalized all political activity has released all political prisoners and is making pr ogress in establishing an independent judiciary and in respecting internationally recognized human rights the actual termination of the embargo would require additional conditions including that an elected civilian government is in power the dilemma for us policy is that the legislative conditions could keep the united states from having any leverage or influence as events unfold in postfidel cuba and as cuba moves toward postraúl cuba the bush administration has made substantial efforts to prepare for political transition in cuba in 2004 and 2006 the administrations commission for assistance to free cuba prepared two reports detailin g how the united states could provide support to cuban transition government to help it respond to humanitarian needs conduct free and fair elections and move toward marketbased economy criticism of the reportshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22742crs5 8 enemy can defeat us

possibility of reform or economic change under communist government on the basis of these reports critics maintain that the united states may be unprepared to deal with altern ative scenarios of cubas political transition over the past several year s congress has often debated policy towa rd cuba with one or both houses at times approvi ng legislative provisions that would ease us sanctions on cuba president bush has regularly threatened to veto various appropriations bills if they contained provisions weakening the embargo and ultimately these provisions have been stripped out of final acted measures in 2007 the l ack of any significant policy changes in cuba under raúl appeared to d iminish the impetus in congress for any major change in policy toward cuba although raúls official installation as president could alter that raúls overtures since assuming power raúl castro has made several public offers to engage in dialogue with the ited states that have been rebuffed by us officials who maintain that change in cuba must precede change in us policy in an august 2006 interview raúl asserted that c uba has always been disposed to normalize relations on an equal plane but at the same time he expre ssed strong opposition to current us policy toward cuba which he described as arrogant and interventionist8 in response assistant secretary of st ate for western hemisphere affairs thomas shannon reiterated us offer to cuba first articulated by president bush in may 2002 that the administration was willing to work with congress to lift us economic sanctions if cuba were to begin political opening and transition to democracy according to shannon the bush administration remains prep ared to work with congress for ways to lift the embargo if cuba is prepared to fr ee political prisoners respect human rights permit the creation of independent organizations and create mechanism and pathway toward free and fair elections9 raúl castro reiterated an offer to negotiate with the united states in december 2006 speech he said that we are willing to resolve at the negotiating table the longstanding dispute between the united st ates and cuba of course provided they accept as we have previously said our c ondition as country that will not tolerate any blemishes on its independence and as long as said resolution is based on the principles of equality reciprocity noninte rference and mutual respect10 more recently in his july 26 2007 speech raúl reiterate d for the third time an offer to engage in dialogue with the united states and strongly criticized u s economic sanctions on cuba this time raúl pointed to the future of relations with the next us administration and stated that the new administration will have to decide whether it will keep the absurd illegal and failed policies against cuba or accept the olive branch that we extended he asserted that if the new us authorities put aside arrogance and decide to talk in civilized manner they will be welcome if not we are willing to deal with their hostile policieshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22742crs6 11 raúl castro presides over rebellion day ce remony open source center cubavisión july 26 2007 12

head of government us officials maintained there would be change in us policy us policy approaches in the context of raúl castros succession there are two broad policy approaches to contend with political change in cuba stay the course or statusquo approach that would maintain the policy of isolating the cuban government with economic sanctions and an approach aimed at influe ncing cuban government and society through an easing of sanctions and increased contact and engagement advocates of continued sanctions argu that the cuban government under raúl castro has not demonstrated any willingness to ease repression or initiate any political or economic openings secretary of commerce carlos gutierrez asserts that the succession from fidel to raúl is preservation of dictat orship and that the regime needs to have dialogue with the cuban people befo re it has one with the united states13 other supporters of current policy ma intain that easing economic sanctions would prolong the communist regime by increasing money flowing into its statecontrolled enterprises while continued sanctions would keep up the pre ssure to enact deeper economic reforms14 those advocating an easing of sanctions argue that the united states needs to take advantage of cubas political succession to aba ndon its longstanding sanctionsbased policy that they maintain has had practical effect in changing the policies of the cuban government they argue that continuing the status quo would only serve to guarantee many more years of hostility between cuba and the united states and reduce the chances for positive change in cuba by slowing the pace of liberalization and reform15 others argue that the united states should work to ward engaging and negotiating with cuba in order to bring incremental change because even the smallest reforms can help spur popular expectations for additional change16
