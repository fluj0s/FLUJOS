paperwork reduction both the house and senate committee reports25 accompanying their respective bills note that reducing paperwork is an important aim of the gislation in its concluding remarks on the bill the house report states that the bill centers on the committees principles for reform which among ot her things includes reducing paperwork26 the senate report notes that one of the ways s 1248 would imp rove idea is to reduce bureaucratic paperwork for teachers27 more specifically both reports point to provisions in their respective bills aimed at reducing paperwork and administrative burden the following are some ex amples cited in the reports both bills would require the genera l account office gao to study and report on special education paperw ork hr 1350 section 104 and s 1248 section 609 both bills change the general eligibility provision for states sec 612aand local educational agencies leas sec 613a to re quire states andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21226crs5 28 current law requires that states demonstrate to the satisfaction of the secretary of education and that leas demonstrate to the satisfaction of the state that policies and procedures are in effect with respect to the proposed change in the state requirement the house report notes that the change is intended to ensure that th secretary is focused on ensuring overall compliance with the act and not forcing stat to change individual words or phrases within their laws policies or regulations unless there is clear contradiction of substantive portions of the act for example this provision would allow states to include in its application sic cites to specific policies or procedures however it would longer require state sic to send boxes upon boxes of copies of each policy or procedure for the department to review p 94 29 the spence paperwork study found that special education teachers with poor access to computer technology were 5 times as likely as t hose with excellent access to have insufficient time to complete administrative duties and paperwork p13 in addition the study found that case management on average took up onehalf hour per week of special education teachers time who are involved in case management 30 according to the senate report s 1248 eliminates the authority in current section 613g for schoolbased improvement plan because this provision has not been effective schools can undertake school improvement activities and realize improved educational and transitional results for children with di sabilities without incurring the additional administrative and paperwork burdens required under this authority p 23 31 according to the senate report while benchmarks and shortterm objectives are thought by some to help track the childs progress their inclusion in ieps contributes greatly to the paperwork burden on educators and parents and often bears relationship to the nonlinear reality of childs development the committee expects that eliminating the requirements for benchmarks and shortterm objectives will reduce unproductive paperwork and allow greater attention to be focused on the childs annual iep goals and on the methods of measuring progress and reporting that progress to parents in meaningful way pp 2829leas to reasonably demonstrate house bill or provide assurances senate bill that required policies and procedures are in effect28 both bills would

billshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21226crs6 32 according to the house report such limitati on allows local educational agencies to limit unnecessary paperwork designed to protect them from protracted longterm litigation p 116 33 several members of the education and the wo rkforce committee in the minority views in the house report maintain that some paperwork is crucial to ensure ideas requirements are met p 380 and voice conc erns about this provision the paperwork reduction pilot program in hr 1350 has absolutely restrictions on what paperwork could be waived under this program as it is currently written state could propose to waive ieps or due proce ss notices as way of reducing paperwork such broad discretion will only harm efforts to improve services for children with disabilities p 381 34 reports of time spent on paperwork to vary by region of the country from about 5 hours per week in the south to 3 hours per week in the northeast spence paperwork study p 7both
