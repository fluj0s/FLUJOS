todd b tatelman american law division june 17 2005 abstract the commerce clause of the united states constitution provides that the congress shall have the power to regulate interstate and foreign commerce the plain meaning of this language might indicate limited power to regulate commercial trade between persons in one state and persons outside of that state however the commerce clause has never been construed quite so narrowly rather the clause along with the economy of the united states has grown and become more complex in addition when congress began to address national social problems the commerce clause was often cited as the constitutional basis for such legislation as result the commerce clause has become the constitutional basis for signiﬁcant portion of the laws passed by the congress over the last ﬁfty years and it currently represents one of the broadest bases for the exercise of congressional powers an examination of the united states code shows that over 700 statutory provisions covering range of issues explicitly refer to either interstate or foreign commerce over the last decade however the supreme court in united states v lopez and united states v morrison has brought into question the breadth of the commerce clause while these cases have resulted in the overturning of few federal laws their overall eﬀect has so far been relatively modest in scope case currently be fore the supreme court however ashcroft v raich could portend more signiﬁcant eﬀect on current federal lawhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32844g5g20g21g561g20g142g153g152g155g157g561g143g152g155g561g5g152g151g144g155g142g156g156 prepared for members and committees of congress g561

meaning today as it did in 1789 an interchange of goods or commodities between different countries or between areas of the same country or in other words trade38 however commentators have argued that secondary meaning of commerce which was understood at the time of the drafting of the constitution includes all productive activity which relates to commerce such as manufacturing and agriculture39 further question is then raised whether congresss power to regulate commerce is significantly limited by the phrase with foreign nations and among the several states and with the indian tribes for instance the phrase among the several states could either be interpreted as between people of different states or more broadly as between people who live in the various states some have argued that the broader definition which would cover commerce between people of the same state would render the phrase among the several states superfluous40 this question generally characterized as whether the power to regulate interstate commerce extends to intrastate commerce has been mostly settled by case law and most intrastate commercial transactions are vulnerable to some form of federal regulation41

constitutional convention of 178742 it appears however that the parameters of the commerce clause were not of particular concern to the framers of the constitution43 the commentary contemporary to the constitution on the power did not concern itself with the federalism implications of managing interstate economic transactions but rather focused on the issue of foreign trade44 the primary purpose of the clause appears to have been raising federal revenue by the nationalization of the states power to impose import tariffs45 while secondary purpose was 38 grant nelson and robert pushaw jr

and restrict foreign commerce to advance american interests46 the argument has been made that while regulating free and fair trade between states was the principal motivation for adopting various other provisions of the constitution47 it may not have been strong motivation for the drafting of the commerce clause this is because state restrictions on trade between states were already prohibited under the articles of confederation and the states generally complied with these restrictions 48 consequently commentary contemporary to the ratification of the constitu tion indicating that the commerce clause was intended to limit state restrictions on interstate commerce was minimal g5g138g156g142g561g14g138g160g561g6g142g159g142g149g152g153g150g142g151g157g561 in gibbons v ogden the supreme court in an opinion by chief justice marshall considered challenge to monopoly on the operation of steampropelled vessels in new york waters this monopoly was challenged by gibbons who transp orted passengers from new jersey to new york under an act of congress the chief justice in striking down the monopoly wrote that the power over commerce is vested in congress as absolutely as it would be in single government and that the influence which their constituents possess at elections are the sole restraints on this power49 the chief justice went on to write that the counsel for the appellee would limit the term commerce to traffic to buying and selling or the interchange of commod ities and do not admit that it comprehends navigation this would restrict general term applicable to many objects to one of its significations commerce undoubtedly is traffic but it is something moreit is intercourse which the court found easily included the issue of navigation marshall did qualify the word intercourse with the word commercial thus retaining the element of monetary transactions the court did not soon revisit this expansive view of the commerce clause instead over the next several decades the court considered the boundaries of the dormant commerce clause doctrine the implied limitation of the commerce clause on states ability to regulate commerce 50 this combined with the relatively cautious exercise of the power by the early continued blocked by new york id at 1112 granting the congress the power to ra ise revenue in this manner was seen as an important way to pay off revolutionary war debts id at 811 46 for instance the prospect of excluding british ships from american waters while never realized was contemplated as retaliation for the exclusion of

did not have occasion to consider the limits of the congresss power under this doctrine for almost sixty years when the court again revisited congresss power under the clause it generally approved of statutes regulating the interstate movement of goods or persons such as lottery tickets51 adulterated food52 or prostitutes53 but during the early 1900s the supreme court was confronted with statutes which went beyond regulation of trade and addressed other related economic activities consequently the court struck down series of federal statutes which attempted to extend commerce regulation to activities such as production manufacturing 54 or mining55 starting in 1937 however with the decision in nlrb v jones laughlin steel corporation 56 the supreme court held that congress has the abil ity to protect interstate commerce from burdens and obstructions which affect commercial transactions in the nlrb case the court upheld the national labor relations act finding that by controlling industrial labor strife congress was preventing burdens from being placed on interstate commerce57 thus the court rejected previous distinctions between the economic activities such as manufacturing which led up to interstate economic transactions and the interstate transactions themselves by allowing congress to regulate activities which were in the stream of commerce the court also set the stage for the regulation of variety of other activities which affect commerce subsequent court decisions found that congress had considerable discretion in regulating activities which affect interstate commerce as long as the legislation was reasonably related to achieving its goals of regulating interstate commerce58 thus the court found that in some cases events of purely local commerce such as local working conditions might because of market forces negatively affect interstate commerce and thus would be susceptible to regulation 59 the court has also held that an activity which in itself does not affect interstate commerce could be regulated if all such activities taken together in the aggregate did affect interstate commerce60 under the reasoning of these cases the court has upheld many diverse laws including laws regulating production of wheat on farms61 racial discrimination by businesses62 and loansharking63 51 champion v ames the lottery case 188 us 321 1903 52

lopez64 however the supreme court brought into question the extent to which the congress can rely on the commerce clause as basis for federal jurisdiction under the gunfree school zone act of 1990 congress made it federal offense for any individual knowingly to possess firearm at place that the individual knows or has reasonable cause to believe is school zone65 in lopez the court held that because the act neither regulated commercial activity nor contained requirement that the possession was connected to interstate commerce the act exceeded the authority of congress under the commerce clause although the court did not explic itly overrule any previous rulings upholding federal statutes passed under the authority of th commerce clause the decision would appear to suggest new limits to congresss legislative authority the lopez case was significant in that it was the first time since 1937 that the supreme court struck down federal statute purely based on findi ng that the congress had exceeded it powers under the commerce clause 66 in doing so the court revisited its prior cases sorted the commerce power into three categories and assert ed that congress could not go beyond these three categories 1 regulation of channels of commerce 2 regulation of instrumentalities of commerce and 3 regulation of economic activities which affect commerce67 within the third category of activities which affect commerce the court determined that the power to regulate commerce applies to intrastate activities only when they substantially affect commerce 68 still the court in lopez spoke approvingly of earlier cases upholding laws which regulated intrastate credit transactions restaurants utilizing interstate supplies and hotels catering to interstate guests the court also recognized that while some intrastate activities may by themselves have trivial effect on commerce regulation of these activities may be constitutional if their regulation is an essential part of larger economic regulatory scheme thus the court even approved what has been perceived as one of its most expansive rulings wickard v filburn which allowed the regulation of the production of wheat for home consumption 69 the court in lopez found however that the gun free school zones act fell into none of the three categories set out above it held that it was not regulation of channels of commerce nor did it protect an instrumentality of commerce finally its effect on interstate commerce was found to be too removed to be substantial the court noted that the activity regulated the possession of gun in school zone neither by itself nor in the aggregate affected commercial transactions 70 further the statute contained requirement that interstate commerce be affected 64 514 us 549 1995 65 18 usc 922q1a 66 herman schwartz court tries to patrol political line legal times 25 may 8 1995 67 the court failed to note that to some extent the three categories are intertwined for instance the first category the regulation of streams or channels of commerce allows regulation of the creation movement sale and consumption of merchandise or services but the initial extension of the streams of commerce analysis by the court to intrastate trade was justified by the effect of these other activities on commerce see nlrb v jones laughlin 301 us 1 31 1936 similarly the second category which allows the regulation of such instrumentalities of commerce as planes trains or trucks is also based on the th eory that threat to these instrumentalitie s affects commerce even if the effect is local in nature southern railway company v united stat 222 us 21 2627 1911re gulation of in trastate rail traffic has substantial effect on interstate rail traffic t hus the final category

transported in interstate commerce71 nor was the criminalization of possession of gun near school part of larger regulatory scheme which did regulate commerce72 finally the court indicated that criminal law enforcement is an area of law traditionally reserved to the states73 consequently the court found that congress did not have the authority to pass the gun free school zone act the court also discussed the absence of legislative findings with respect to the statutes effect on interstate commerce74 while noting that congress is not formally required to make such findings the court nevertheless held that to the extent that congressional findings would enable us to evaluate the legislative judgment that the activity in question substantially affected interstate commerce even though such substantial effect was visible to the naked eye they are lacking here75 although the supreme court has confirmed the dictates of lopez in the case of united states v morrison 76 discussed infra both of these decisions dealt primarily with the issue of substantial impact on commerce however as noted the court has identified two other categories of power that congress has under the commerce clause regulation of channels of commerce and regulation of instrumentalities of commerce that have been interpreted almost as broadly thus an evaluation of the impact of these cases requires an examination of all three categories of power g22g145g142g561g22g145g155g142g142g561g5g138g157g142g144g152g155g146g142g156g561g152g143g561g5g152g150g150g142g155g140g142g561g5g149g138g158g156g142g561

represent broad power to regulate to begin with this category is the basis for variety of statutes that directly regulate the movement of persons or goods across state lines for instance the united states code contains extensive references to mailing or shipping materi in interstate commerce including regulations or bans on shipping biological agents77 counterfeit documents78 explosives79 or threatening communications80 of more significance is that the court has not required that any nexus exist between the time that person crosses state border and the time they engage in prohibited

addressed the application of 301k of the federal food drug and cosmetic act to local pharmacist the section prohibits the doing of any act with respect to drug if such act is done while such article is held for sale after shipment in interstate commerce and results in such article being misbranded the pharmacist was charged with misbranding sulfathiazole by not providing sufficient information regarding dosage and usage the court in sullivan relied on previous precedent finding that congress has not only the power regulate commerce among the states but also the power to keep the channels of such commerce free from the transportation of illicit or harmful articles82 the fact that the defendant here had bought the item after it had passed over state lines was not found to be of constitutional significance83 thus the court appears to require only that the criminal activity in question has some relation to the crossing of state lines consistent with this line of reasoning there are laws such as criminal prohibitions on mail fraud84 where the material is regulated not because it is by nature harmful but rather because it relates to other behavior which is criminal or there are laws prohibiting crimes based on person crossing the state line with the intent to commit the sexual abuse of minors where it is the activity engaged in after the line is crossed that is criminal85 finally there are laws that regulate activities which utilize materials after they have been shipped in interstate commerce even if the materials were perfectly legal when they were transported 86 ultimately based on cases such as sullivan it would appear that statutes that would otherwise be in violation of the limitations of lopez could be approved by courts because of the presence of the jurisdictional element that an item related to the crime had crossed state line under this reasoning the gun possession law struck down in lopez which has since been amended to require that the gun had previously been shipped in interstate commerce87 would be upheld88 thus an expansive reading of the channels of commerce doctrine would appear to stand in the way of limited interpretation of the commerce clause g11g151g156g157g155g158g150g142g151g157g138g149g146g157g146g142g156g561g152g143g561g11g151g157g142g155g156g157g138g157g142g561g5g152g150g150g142g155g140g142g561

recreational trails the icc argued that turning the rightof ways into recreation trails was preserving the rail corridors for future railroad use despite arguments that the preservation argument was pretext the court held that it must defer to congressional finding that regulated activity affects interstate commerce if there is any rational basis for such finding90 the instrumentalities of commerce category represents yet another significant basis for expansive congressional authority as noted previously federal mail and wire fraud statutes make it crime to engage in fraud while using the telephone or the mails by analogy congress could reach many other activities that utilize these networks or similar networks such as railroads interstate highways and even the internet while this category has not been fully occupied by congress it would appear that significant amount of federal power could be exercised in this manner regardless of whether the matter regulated involved noneconomic activity 91 the court has not yet indicated whether the lopez requirement that regulated activities have some connection to commercial activity would be applicable in this category

or effect on interstate commerce to fully understand the scope and reach of this power it is important to begin with an examination of the courts 1942 decision in wickard v filburn 92 which led to the expansive view of the commerce clause that congress operated under until 1995 in wickard the court was asked to determine whether under the commerce clause amendments to the agricultural adjustment act of 1938 implementing quota system to restrict the amount of wheat that could be harvested and sold applied to individuals who produced and consumed homegrown bushels of wheat 93 in upholding the statute as constitutional the court held that economic activities regardless of their nature could be regulated by congress if the activity asserts substantial impact on interstate commerce 94 the court reasoned that the growing of wheat even if only for familys personal consumption provided an alternative to the marketplace that was both viable and competitive95 although the court admitted that one familys production alone would likely have negligible impact on the overall price of wheat if combined with other personal producers the effect would be substantial enough to make the activity subject to congressional regulation96 the rationale of combining individual effects to find substantial impacts on interstate commerce 90 494 us at 17 citing hodel v virginia surface mining

g561 after wickard the court consistently held that rational basis existed for congress to enact laws under the theory that the regulated behavior substantially affected interstate commerce98 despite the consistency of these decisions it was not always clear whether the activity in question met the substantially affects test then in 1995 when the court decided the lopez case as discussed previously it explored the limits of the substantially affects test subsequently in united states v morrison 99 the court invalidated portion of the violence against women act which specifically created private right of action against anyone who committed such crime allowing an injured party to obtain damages and other compensatory relief100 applying its holding in lopez the court concluded that the activity regulated by the act could not be classified as economic activity and therefore the aggregation principle established by wickard did not apply the court however stopped short of establishing rule that all non economic activity cannot be aggregated101 in addition the court concluded that the act contained jurisdictional element connecting the creation of federal cause of action for gendermotivated violence to congresss power to regulate interstate commerce102 further while in morrison unlike in lopez there were numerous congressional findings the court stressed that although findings by the legislative branch can serve to illuminate the relationship between the regulation and interstate commerce constitutionality ultimately turns on the legal aspects of the substantial effects doctrin and therefore is for the court to decide103 in this case the court found that the legislative findings detailing the effects on interstate commerce by gender motivated violence were based in large part on the costs of crime which was nearly identical to the reasoning expressly rejected by the court in lopez 104 finally the court considered the level of attenuation between the regulated activity and its effect on interstate commerce in this case the court concluded that the regulation of gendermotivated 97 see united states v lopez 514 us 549 560 1995 98 see eg

instrumentalit ies channels or goods involved in interstate commerce and was therefore beyond the scope of congresss authority105 in sum after lopez and morrison the test to determine whether regulation has substantial effect on interstate commerce requires reviewing courts to consider the following four factors 1 whether the regulated activity is commercial or economic in nature 2 whether an express jurisdictional element is provided in the statut to limit its reach 3 whether congress made express findings about the effects of the proscribed activity on interstate commerce and 4 whether the link between the prohibited activity and the effect on interstate commerce is attenuated106 g9g152g151g163g138g149g142g156g561g159g495g561g20g138g146g140g145g561 after the decision in lopez and morrison the question arose as to whether these cases were harbinger of future restrictions on congresss power to legislate arguably the court had intended lopez and morrison to have limited effect as the court specifically reaffirmed much of its previous commerce clause case law further the statutory provisions challenged in lopez criminal penalties for gun possession in or near schools and morrison civil suits for gender motivated crime were relatively unusual for statutes based on the commerce clause in that they did not contain specific requirement that the activities be related to commerce in addition while broad economic regulation may have noneconomic elements eg recordkeeping requirements the provisions in question were activities were not associated with such larger schemes accordingly when provisions contained in broader regulatory schemes were challenged after lopez and morrison the lower courts generally upheld these under broader scheme doctrine 107 this doctrine is largely derived from language in lopez that arguably permits congressional regulation of noneconomic activity if the regulation is an essential part of larger regulatory scheme in which the regulatory scheme would be undercut unless the intrastate activity was regulated108 nonetheless it was suggested by some commentators that certain noneconomic provisions of larger regulatory schemes might also be successfully challenged these challenges were generally characterized as as applied challenges generally court reviewing the constitutionality of federal statute may declare the statute unconstitutional either as invalid on its face 109 or as 105 id at 618 holding that the regulation and punishment of intrastate violence that is not directed at the instrumentalities channels

circumstances110 utilizing an as applied standard various lower courts struck down particular applications of broader statutory schemes111 when presented with an as applied challenge these courts initially attempted to define the relevant class of activity presented by the facts of the specific case for instance in the ninth circuit case of ashcroft v raich the court considered challenge to the controlled substances act the challenging parties were seriouslyill california residents who had obtained marijuana consistent with californias compassionate use act 112 but in violation of the federal controlled substances act csa113 the ninth circuit found the class of activity to be the intrastate noncommercial cultivation possession and use of marijuana for personal medical purposes on the advice of physician and in accordance with state law114 having defined the relevant class of activity the court proceeded to apply the four factor morrison test continued to mount ccessfully since the challenger must establish that set of circumstances exists under which the act would be valid united states v salerno 481 us 739 745 1987 holding that the bail reform act of 1984 is not facially invalid emphasis added 110 an as applied challenge is less difficult to sustain than facial challenge because the challenger has to establish only that the statute is invalid when applied to the specific set of factual circumstances presented thus some scholars had posited that since lopez and morrison were decided as applied challenges to federal statutes for violation of the commerce clause would be more successful than have facial challenges see brannon p denning glenn h reynolds rulings and resistance the new commerce clause jurisprudence encounters the lower courts 55 rk l rev 1253

whether or not the activity is commercial or economic in nature the court concluded that the narrow class of activity in this case could not be considered commercial or economic in nature115 the court next considered whether the csa contains an express jurisdictional element that would limit its reach to those cases that substantially affect interstate commerce with stated analysis and apparently persuaded by the reasoning of district court opinion the court concluded that such jurisdictional hook exists in the relevant portions of the csa 116 with respect to whether the legislative history contains congressional findings regarding the effects on interstate commerce the court was able to cite findings relating to the effect that intrastate drug trafficking activity would have on interstate commerce117 while admitting that the legislative history lends support to the constitutionality of the statute under the commerce clause the court proceeded to diminish the importance of these findings by arguing that they were not specific to either marijuana or the medicinal use of marijuana but rather related to the general effects of drug trafficking on interstate commerce 118 in addition the court referred to language in morrison discussing the limited role of congressional findings119 moreover the court referenced ninth circuit precedent concluding that the first and fourth prongs of the morrison test whether the statute regulates an economic enterprise and whether the link is attenuated are the most significant factors to the analysis120 finally with respect to whether the link between the regulated activity and substantial effect on interstate commerce is attenuated the court expressed doubt that the interstate effect of homegrown medical marijuana is substantial citing authority questioning the validity of the federal governments claim of an effect on interstate commerce121 the court concluded that this factor favors finding that the csa cannot constitutionally be applied to the class of activities at issue in this case 122 the united states supreme court granted certiorari specifically on the question of whether the power vested in congress by both the necessary and proper clause and the commerce clause of article i includes the power to prohibit the local growth possession and use of marijuana permissible as result of californias law123

purely cal activities that are part of an economic class of activities that have substantial effect on interstate commerce124 in reaching its conclusions the court relied heavily on its 1942 decision in wickard v filburn which held that the agricultural adjustment act s federal quota system applied to bushels of wheat that were homegrown and personally consumed wickard stands for the proposition that congress can rationally combine the effects that individual producers have on commercial market to find substantial impacts on interstate commerce 125 the court pointed to numerous similarities between the facts presented in raich and those in wickard initially the court noted that because the commodities being cultivated in both cases are fungible and that wellestablished interstate markets exist both markets are susceptible to fluctuations in supply and demand based on production intended for homeconsumption being introduced into the national market126 according to the court just as there was di fference between the wheat mr wickard produced for personal consumption and the wheat cultivated for sale on the open market there is discernable difference between personal homegrown medicinal marijuana and marijuana grown for the express purpose of being sold in the interstate market127 thus the court concluded that congress had rational basis for concluding that leaving homeconsumed marijuana outside federal control would similarly affect price and market conditions128 respondents argued that wickard was distinguishable because in the case of wheat the activity involved was purely commercial and the evidence clearly established that the aggregate production of wheat had significant effect on the interstate market conversely respondents claimed that the activity at issue in raich is noncommercial the respondents had never attempted to sell their marijuana and congress had made finding that the personal cultivation and use of medicinal marijuana has substantial effect on the interstate marijuana market129 the court however noted that the standard for as sessing the scope of congresss power under the commerce clause is not whether the activity at issue when aggregated substantially affects interstate commerce but rather whether there exists rational basis for congress to have concluded as such130 the court applying this deferential standard concluded that congress had 124 id at 2205 citing perez v united states 402 us 146 151 1970 the final outcome was 63 with justice stevens writing for himself and justices souter kennedy brey er and

failure to regulate the intrastate manufacture and possession of marijuana would leave gaping hole in the csa131 moreover the court affirmed that congress was acting well within its authority to make all laws which shall be necessary and proper to regulate commerce among the several states132 despite having concluded that under the rational basis test congress had acted within its constitutional authority when it enacted the csa and applied it to intrastate possession of marijuana the court nevertheless had to distinguish lopez and morrison the courts more recent commerce clause decisions the court concluded that the csa unlike the statutes in either lopez gun free school zones act or morrison violence against women act regulated activity that is quintessentially economic therefore neither lopez or morrison cast any doubts on the constitutionality of the statute 133 the court specifically rejected the reasoning used by the ninth circuit concluding that congress acted rationally in determining that none of the characteristics making up the purported class whether viewed individually or in the aggregate compelled an exemption from the csa rather the subdivided class of activities defined by the court of appeals was an essential part of the larger regulatory scheme134 in supporting its conclusions the court noted that by characterizing marijuana as schedule i narcotic congress was implicitly finding that it had medicinal value at all in addition the court returned to the fact that medicinal marijuana was fungible good thus making it indistinguishable from the recreational versions that congress had clearly intended to regulate according to the court to carve out medicinal use as distinct class of activity as the ninth circuit had done would effectively make any federal regulation including quality prescription or quantity controls of any locally cultivated and possessed controlled substance for any purpose beyond the outer limits of congresss commerce clause authority 135 moreover the court held that californias state law permitting the use of marijuana for medicinal purposes cannot be the basis for placing the respondents class of activity beyond the reach of the federal government due to the supremacy clause which requires that in the event of conflict between state and federal law the federal law shall prevail136 finally the court responded to the respondents argument that its activities are not an essential part of larger regulatory scheme because they are both isolated and policed by the state of california and they are completely separate and distinct from the interstate market137 the court held that not only could congress have rationally rejected this argument but also that it seemed obvious that doctors patients and caregivers will increase the supply and demand for the substance on the open market138 in sum the court concluded that the case for exemption can be distilled down to an argument that locally grown product used domestically is immune from 131 see raich 125 sct at 2209 132 id 133 id at 220910 134 id at 2211 135 id at 2212 emphasis in original 136 id 137 id at 2213 138 id 221314 stating that
