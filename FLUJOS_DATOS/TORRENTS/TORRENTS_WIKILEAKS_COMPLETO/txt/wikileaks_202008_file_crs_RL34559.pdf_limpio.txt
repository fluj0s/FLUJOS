potentially be protected through design patents trade dre ss and copyright in addition the vessel hull design protection act tablished specialized or sui generis intellectual property right for the protection of boat hull designs some experts argue that the present intellectual property regime does not adequately protect industrial designers the 110th congress has engaged in number of activities with respect to industrial designs legislation that w ould amend the vessel hu ll design protection act passed the senate some experts believe that th is statute has been underused because it allows competitors to copy pr otected boat hull design so long as they introduce changes to the design of the deck the vessel hull design protection act amendments of 2007 s 1640 would specify th at protection is available for designs of hulls and decks either i ndividually or in combination bills that would provide proprietary rights in fashion designs have also been introduced before the house and senate hr 2033 and s 1957 would amend the vessel hull design protection act to allow for the protection of fashion designs the term of protection would be three years based upon registration with the us copyright office another bill hr 5638 would establish repair exemption within the patent act although potentially of broad application this legisl ation appears to have been motivated by the enforcement of design patents that are said to restrict competition in the secondary market for automobile replacement parts the senate has also recently provided its consent to ratify the geneva act to the hague agreement concerning the interna tional registration of industrial designs an international agreement that would allow us designers more readily to obtain intellectual property protecti on overseas accession to this international agreement would require changes to the design patent statute including expansion of the term of design patents from 14 to 15 years some legal experts have expressed concern that recent judicial developments concerning infringement standards for design patents have reduced their effectiveness in promoting innovation the court of ppeals for the federal circuit which possesses national jurisdiction over design patent appeals has recently agreed to reconsider these issues supporters of sui generis regimes assert that they allow for protection of subject matter like industrial designs that at times fall outside tr aditional intellectual property paradigms proponents believe that these systems can prevent levels of free riding that ultimately discourage i nnovation however some observers are concerned that the proliferation of such systems may limit the ability of others to compete ultimately diminishing consumer

article sha ll be considered pictorial graphic or sculptural work only if and only to the extent that such design incorporates pictorial graphic or scul ptural features that can be identified separately from and are capable of existing independently of the utilitarian aspects of the article27 the court of appeals for the ninth circuit has explained that this limitation is in keeping with the notion that functional items are not eligible for the relatively long term protections of copyright as opposed to the more temporary rights provided by the patent act28 because industrial designs are co mmonly integrated into useful article29 such as automobiles handheld elect ronic devices or clothing they are often not eligible for copyright30 trade dress protection for industrial signs may also occur under the trademark law in the form of trade dress protec tion the term trade dress refers to the overall visual image that product presents to consumers including its design31 to be

addition design must be primarily ornamental to be awarded design patent protection44 similar to the doctrine of functionality in trademark law if the design is instead dictated by the performance of the article then it is judged to be functional and ineligible for design patent protection45 in such circumstances the designer should pursue utility patent which protects the functiona l and utilitarian aspects of products and processes46 issued design patents confer the right to exclude others from the unauthorized manufacture use or sale of the artic embodying the patented design or any colorable imitation thereof47 the scope of protection of design patent is provided by drawings within the design patent instrument48 to establish infringement the design patent proprietor must prove that in the eye of an ordinary observer giving such attention as purchaser usually gi ves the patented and accused designs are substantially the same if the resemblance is such as to deceive such an observer inducing him to purchase one supposing it is the other49 the courts also require that matter how similar two items look the accused vice must appropriate the novelty in the patented device that distinguishes it from earlier designs50 the term of design patent is 14 years from th date the uspto issues the patent51 intellectual property attorneys rich ard sybert and lindsay hulley have explained that the best protection for product design is likely design patent in the united states 52 design patents have been described as less expensive to prepare than utility patents and unlike

design patent hol der need show neither the existence of consumer confusion nor the designs acqui sition of secondary meaning in order to prove infringement55 the design patent regime has nonetheless been subject to criticism by industry representatives lawyers and academics alik some commentators have expressed concerns that the standards of novelty and nonobviousness which the design patent law essentially adapted from the law of utility patents do not provide apt or fair evaluating criteria for industrial designs as gerard magliocca member of the faculty of the indiana university sc hool of law indianapolis explains to see this point more clearly think of these two elements as part of broader test to determine whether an improvement represents an advance over the state of the art in given field viewed in these terms one commentator has observed that whereas it may often be possible to recognize technological innovation as an advance because of its efficiency in promoting economies or in achieving previously unattainable utilitarian ends there exist comparable criteria of advance for artistic creations indeed most designs simply involve rearranging basic artistic elements eg colors shapes and materials into new pattern the result of this reshuffling process can almost always be considered obvious and hence unpatentable be cause any designer could have come up with the combination at issue put another way the nonobviousness and novelty requirements often end up restri cting design protection to those rare instances when an improvement establishes an entirely new style this leaves most designers out of luck and is at odds with the reality that commercial art is generally incremental in nature56 other observers believe that acquiring design patents rema ins an overly costly and timeconsuming procedure these factors may reduce the attractiveness of such protection for products like clothing that remain popular for only short periods of time57

hull design to make directcast mold for their ow n unauthorized manufacturing use59 in response the state legislature of florida enacted legislation that prohibited certain uses of the plug molding process60 however the 1989 supreme court ruling in bonito boats inc v thunder craft boats inc held that this legislation was preempted by the federal patent statute and therefore invalid61 following the bonito boats decision congress enacted the vessel hull design protection act62 this 1998 statute currently codi fied in title 13 of the copyright act allows for the registration of an original design that has actually been incorporated into fabricated vessel hull63 although this system is administered by the register of copyrights the protec tion afforded by the vessel hull design protection act is not copyright but rather sui generis right64 in order to enjoy protection the desi gn owner must affix notice of the registration upon vessel hulls that embody the design65 the protected design affords its owner the exclusive right to make have made import for sale or for use in trade any useful article embodying that design and sell or distribute for sale or for use in trade any useful article embodying that design66 the statute does not extend protection to designs that are staple or commonplace or dictated solely by utilitarian functi on67 in addition an accused

not of general applicability and its extent is limited to uses of the design that create substantial likelihood of consumer confusion94 finally the prohibition against obtaining copyright for u seful articles means that clothing most often does not secure protection95 due to the limited nature of existing intellectual property rights for fashion many designers assert that their successful designs are knocked off in matter of weeks or even days96 this trend may pa rticularly impact young designers who have yet to establish reputations in the marketplace and in fact may be unable to do so when

laws suggesting that this intellectual property right may prove of limited effectiveness102 amendments to the boat hull act some experts believe that in the decade since its enactment the vessel hull design protection act has b een underutilized doubt in part due to the difficulty in proving infringement based on the way in which hull was originally defined103 in particular the act currently defines the term hull as the frame or body of vessel including the deck of vessel 104 this definition requires that courts consider the features incorporated into vessels deck when considering what subject matter is protected105 as result the act has been sa id to have created legal loop hole for knockoff artists to freely copy protected boat hull design as long as they are clever enough to modify one or more protectable elements of the deck106 s 1640 the vessel hull design pr otection act amendments of 2007 apparently responds to these concerns this legislation would amend the 1998 legislation by clarifying the dis tinction between hull and deck107 s 1640 would also specify that protection is available for designs of hulls and decks either individually or in combination108 the

as to restore its original appearance123 it should be appreciated that this exem ption appears to extend beyond automobile spare parts and design patent s rather proposed 271j of the patent act would apparently apply to all industries with re spect to any patent124 observers vary as to the merits of this proposal supporters of the legislation assert that design patents on automobile replacement parts increase repair bills block competition and threaten the safety of consumers who may forego necessary repairs because of their high cost125 however not all c oncerned parties agree design patent

designs of others will beat path to congress door claiming that their knockoff products increase competition and reduce prices for consumers126 judicial developments concerning design patents some legal experts have drawn attention to recent judicial opinions with respect to design patents with some expressi ng concern that their impact has been to diminish the effectiveness of desi gn patents

designs are substantially the same if the resemblance is such as to deceive such an observer inducing him to purchase one supposing it is the other129 the supreme court has held that ordinary observers should not be viewed as experts versed in the designs used within particular industry but rather those who buy and use the product that bears the particular design130 in the arminak decision the court of appeals fo r the federal circuit federal circuit held that under the facts of th at case an industrial purchaser was the appropriate ordinary observe r for assessing infringement the design patent in arminak depicted the top portion of trigger sprayer which is commonly termed shroud both the patent proprietor and the accused infringer sold trigger sprayers to producers of liquid household products the federal circuit concluded that ordinary consumers who do not purchas shrouds by themselves but rather household cleaning products with trigger sprayers could not be judged the ordinary observer rather the purchaser of the patented and accused designs in this case is the purchaser of one of retail produc ts component parts that is thereafter assembled with other parts to make the retail product131 the federal circuit therefore affirmed the district courts findi ng of noninfringement the ruling in arminak has been criticized due its potential impact upon design patent holders as industr ial purchasers are considerably more sophisticated than ordinary consumers concerning the nuances of particular produc t designs finding of infringement is much less likely when the standard of the ordinary observer is raised beyond the level of the lay public although the arminak holding may potentially be justified under its particular facts desi gn patent attorney perry

mining the scope of patent protection137 however others have asserted that this verbalization of the claimed design overly limits the scope of design patents and does not adequately allow for the

that distinguishes it from earlier designs in order to prove infringement140 the federal circuit has explained that the patent proprietor must set fo rth either single novel desi gn element or combination of known elements that collectively pres ent nontrivial advance over the prior art141 if the design element or elements asserted by the patent proprietor do not meet this standard then the court w ill reach judgment of noninfringement in the egyptian goddess case the patent proprieto rs asserted point of novelty was the combination of four of the cla imed designs elements 1 an open and hollow body 2 square crosssection 3 raised rectangular pads and 4 exposed corners the court determined that an earlier design patent directed towards nail buffer disclosed all of these elements with the exception that it was triangular rather than square in crosssection observing th at number of other references illustrated nail buffers with square cro sssections the court reject ed the asserted point of novelty and rendered judg ment of noninfringement142 as it has come to be applied by the federal circuit the point of novelty standard has been criticized on numbe r of grounds some commentators believe that this approach confuses validity and in fringement standards for design patents and also results in narrow scope of design patent protection143 however other observers explain that design patents contain general illustrations that do not specify the distinctions between the patented design and the state of the art they favor rule that ensures that there will be finding of infringement when the accused design has the same overall appearance of both the design patent and earlier designs particularly because they both use f eatures found in wellknown predecessors144 perhaps in response to critiques of the cu rrent state of design patent law the federal circuit recently decided to rehear the egyptian goddess appeal in so doing the court of appeals specifically requested briefing with respect to claim construction and the appropriate point of novelty standard145 because the federal circuit possesses national jurisdicti on over appeals in patent cases146 its

protection of industrial desi gns provides one mechanism for sustaining competitive domestic designbased industries as ttorney regan keebaugh explains if economic reality means the united states can longer compete in the production side of manufacturing then one way to maintain jobs in the manufacturing industry is through developing strong design i ndustry to ensure that products made overseas are designed in the united states147 intellectual property laws are said to promote innovative industries by establishing exclusive rights in new i nventions industrial designs and other creations absent such rights free riders could easily duplicate and exploit the innovative developments of others furthe r because they incurred design and development costs copyists could likel undersell the origin innovator the resulting inability of innovators to capitaliz on their creations would lead to an environment where too little research and development occurs148 intellectual property rights may also encourage ot hers to design around these proprietary interests pointing the way to new produc ts markets economies of production and even entire industries149 although the established intellectual property paradigms of copyrights trademarks and patents provi protection for traditional works of authorship brand names and inventions they also limit or deny protection for other sorts of subject matter as this report has ex plained copyright trade dre ss and design patent law to varying degrees deny protection to industr ial designs with functional component150 sui generis protection systems may potentially fill gaps that may not have been anticipated by the framers of the traditional intellectual property regimes151 sui generis protection regimes also offer potential

generis regimes have tended to be based upon one of the tablished intell ectual property paradigms for example the rights established under the semiconductor chip protection act of 1984154 are similar to copyright155 on the other hand both the design and plant patent systems were incorporated into the existing utility patent laws and therefore follow patentlike model156 some observers be lieve that copyright or trademarklike protection represents the most appropriate sche of protection for industrial designs because neith er regime requires courts or government officials to analyze the merits of creativ expression applied to goods157 on the other hand other experts believe that the design patent law which does entail an analysis of whether an industrial design would ve been obvious to skilled artisan158 has historically served as the best op tion for protecting industrial designs159 although the establishment of sui generis regimes may reduce harmful free riding that results in reduced investment in innovation experts have also expressed concerns about the expansion of intellectua l property rights they observe that the primary mechanism through which intellectual property rights create incentives to innovate is to limit the ability of others to participate in the marketplace160 from the perspective of the government such systems are inexpensive when compared to prizes or

and limit the products available to the public at least in the short term162 in this regard it should be appreciated that the traditional intellectual property regimes often did not leave certain subject matter outside the sc ope of protection by accident rather this circumstance resulted from purposeful legislative choice163 for example the patent stat ute stipulates that designs that would have been obvious to skilled artisan should not be awarded proprietary rights164 the supreme court recently explained this rule as resulting fro m the judgment that were it otherwise patents might stifle rather than pr omote the progress of useful arts165 to the extent that proposed sui generis regimes lower this threshold and award proprietary rights in subpatentable innovations they may diminish the public domain and hamper both future innovation and competition166 finally congressional award of proprietary rights to some industries may inspire additional lobbying efforts by others
