engine reasons should be easier to read now update leelanau talk sent letter to charter communications asking them to investigate the incident the letter is attached while ago mr patrick begg soon to be president of the leelanau school sent this letter to winston over at the lup during the walkout i brought this up with mr jarvis and he claimed i was making an unfounded accusation heres the original letter i have added bold and italics for emphasis so that this stuff is easier to sift through dear mr pornographer i assume you are pornographer as you are trying to help minors endrun around our content filter here at leelanau which is in place to protect the students from psychologically damaging material your style of pornography is even worse than exploitive picturesit is blatant hate i wonder if you have violated the federal internet child protection acts as it relates to schools we are going to find out anyways sincerely patrick begg technology manager as i said earlier the school said this email was never sent but right here i have the evidence that mr begg did in fact send this and other letters to the lup whenever an email is sent from one server to another record of its travel is attached to it most email programs dont show this by default but they all have some type of way to view it its too big to include it all in this post but you can download it here what i can show you is the part that shows it was actually from patrick begg in bold from pbeggleelanauorg mon 5 mar 2007 103226 0500 received from rimonsafemailnet 1921681368 by tapuzsafemailnet with smlocal smtas 12 mon 5 mar 2007 103301 0500 domainkeystatus notsigned failedgetpolicy xsmtests g00nmpcilb0ar00 received from 711368126staticaldlmichartercom 711368126 helomailleelanauorg in response winston as usual sent thought out and welldocumented response dear mr begg this is the last email we will send you until you agree to enter rational discussion with the leelanau underground press and the student body we are not pornographers and the email you sent us is simple libel the leelanau underground press does not distribute hate pornography or any other content that could be legally deemed harmful to minors we havent violated the laws you stated in case you havent read them we have produced small summary for you 1 schools must filter internet access and block content harmful to minors if they want to receive erate funding harmful to minors is legally defined as 1 the average person applying contemporary community standards would find taken as whole and with respect to minors appeals to prurient interest in nudity sex or excretion and 2 the average person applying contemporary community standards would find depicts describes or represents in patently offensive way with respect to what is suitable for minors ultimate sexual acts normal or perverted actual or simulated sadomasochistic sexual acts or abuse or lewd exhibitions of the genitals pubic area buttocks or postpubertal female breast and 3 reasonable person would find taken as whole lacks serious literary artistic political or scientific value for minors therefore the cipa does not apply to the leelanau underground press in addition the school has chosen to apply for taxbreaks and funding instead of making the ethical choice to abstain from using blocking software similar acts to cipa such as copa have been ruled unconstitutional blockingfiltering software is inherently flawed as numerous reports from it professionals and congressional testimony have shown because 1 blocking software is restriction on free speech and access to it 2 blocking software cant block access to such speech if proxies are used 3 blacklisting is not the solution because new sites will always be on the internet before they are blacklisted 4 blocking software has been shown multiple times to blacklist thousands of legitimate sites since you have taken this opportunity to attack our credibility we will do the same for you the difference between your letter and ours is that ours is backed up by fact and logic whereas yours is not you do not properly administer the school networks website filtering is inconsistent between dorms and areas of the school it took you week to fix the daylight savings bug on the wireless networks and you make false statements about how networks function during quiet period you responded to student complaints about internet speed by saying they were using too much bandwidth and they should lay off the youtube in addition you said blocking sites would be counterproductive so at least you got that right as network administrator you should know how networks function but you obviously dont because of the incompetency you demonstrate in administering the networks and the false statements you make about them in 80211bg wireless ethernet network like the ones at school each users requests are given the same priority for example lets say we have 500kbs of bandwidth if one user requests youtube video and one user requests their email then 250kbs of bandwidth will be given to each user we can take this example and apply it to somewhere like the netgear routers you have situated throughout the school and show that bunch of people downloading videos wont stop internet access to users who are not the issue here is that when an entire dorm is on the internet each users receives about 2kbs of bandwidth on the leelanau website and informational pamphlets the school advertises high speed however this is obviously not the case as users are receiving speeds below the speed of 288k or 56k modem so perhaps you instead of us are violating the laws see false advertising laws perhaps you should consider your words carefully before sending them to us next time and use logic instead of primitive emotional responses to attack us we are willing to engage you and the leelanau school in logical open and rational forum about this issue however you have not given us the opportunity which is why we had to start the lup in the first place sincerely winston smith senior editor soon after the lup sent an email out to staff at the leelanau school as follows dear recipients this is winston smith of the leelanau underground press despite continuing threats pressure and false statements directed at and about us the leelanau underground press is back and fighting you probably want to read it so check out our site at leelanauundergroundorg our comrades have been oppressed for too long and we all know major change is coming are you ready to cope with it or will you ride this bike until the wheels fall off im sure you have plenty of work to do in order to combat this problem so i wont keep you for much longer perhaps you should consider opening rational open and democratic discussion with our constituents so we can stop all this monkey business the revolution is near i can taste it can you fear it winston smith leelanau underground press and despite his horrible defeat earlier mr begg decided to try and counter the lup again like his previous message the same inciminating headers were attached dear leelanau underground i write you not as an employee of the leelanau school but as recipient of your poison email and we all know who you are given the happenings in virginia tech this week i take you seriously as such i feel you have made physical threat against personally i grew up in the inner city and i still remember how we dealt with bastards like you at home and i am acting accordingly you cowardly prick most sincerely patrick begg winston fired back almost immediately with one of his classic logicfilled responses dear patrick begg we said we wouldnt engage you in discussion until you provided the students an ample and righteous platform to speak and we still hold true to that promise however you did respond with leelanau address and your letters seem to represent the opinions of other administrators on our work we find it sickening that you would try and use the tragedy at virginia tech for your own political gain we are an organization that operates legally and find killing innocent civilians to be morally reprehensible despite what you seem to be telling people we have not made any direct or indirect threats against you if you can find some specific statements from the lup or its members we would gladly dispel any misconceptions you have about them please stop the name calling and libelous comments its unprofessional as you have probably noticed copy of this message has been sent to mr odell so that he can deal appropriately with your libelous comments and actions sincerely winston smith senior editor leelanau underground press leelanauundergroundorg mr begg the hypocrite that he is responded with his own threat after criticising the lup for sending one bold added for emphasis dear leelanau underground i write you not as an employee of the leelanau school but as recipient of your poison email and we all know who you are given the happenings in virginia tech this week i take you seriously as such i feel you have made physical threat against personally i grew up in the inner city and i still remember how we dealt with bastards like you at home and i am acting accordingly you cowardly prick most sincerely patrick begg whoah did you see that mr begg threatened to deal with the lup like they used to deal with kids in the inner city perhaps he has some innocent idea here maybe they used to deal with them using nerf guns but to the average person the inner city brings up images of guns violence and curbstomping thank you winston and especially mr begg for giving us all good laugh on serious note the school should really consider whether they want somebody like mr begg to be speaking on their behalf i mean he did break the law by making threats we wont pursue it and winston because of his apparent need for anonymity probably wont either but the school should wink wink mr mcnutt wink the school could also have their internet service terminated for sending mail like this as it is violation of charters terms of service i have attached the original emails with full headers thanks winston for forwarding these on to threats against journalists just another thing to add to leelanaus list of crimes adb ps boarding schools in michigan
