authorizing the deployment of us forces to turkey to open northern front in war against iraq the rejection resulted from strains within the ruling justice and development party akp an inexperienced leadership competing influences and the overwhelming opposition of turkish public opinion more over the powerful turkish military had not actively supported the governments pos ition before the vote and the president had suggested that the resolution would be unconstitutional for long time turkey had serious cerns about the prospect of second gulf war and these affected the vote in parliament and the negotiations with the united states for the troop deployment c oncerns included fear that war would lead to an independent iraqi kurdish state and inspire the revival of turkish kurdish separatism worries over the fate of iraqi turkomans who are ethnic kin of the turks potential economic losses potential refug ee crisis on the turkeyiraq border and possible detrimental effects on regional stability the bush administration engaged in intensive diplomacy to gain turkeys support the negotiations reportedly produ ced several tentative agreements the parliamentary resolution that was rejected would have enabled us deployment of troops planes and helicopters to turkey the united states would have provided turkey with 6 billion assistance package some of which could have been used to support 24 billion loan guarantees til the funds were available the administration would have pr ovided bridge loan of 85 billion it also would have provided enhanced trade benefits to turkish businesses memorandum of understanding was said to have dealt with turkish troops in northern iraq and their coordination with us forces but the agr eements were never c oncluded after the war began the administration only wanted access to turkeys airspace which was granted on march 21 2003 and to prevent turkish forces from interfering in northern iraq turkey agreed to provide food fuel and other nonlethal supplies for us troops in northern iraq the united states will give turkey 1 billion in aid with which it can leverage 85 billion in loans the turkish parliaments failure to authorize the troop deployment has significant implications to govern effectively the akp needs to mend strains and rebuild its political standing moreover despite turkeys increasing democratization the akp cannot ignore the militarys great in fluence the prolonged negotiations and the legislative defeat strained bilateral usturkish relations both sides developed hard feelings which may take time to overcome turkey may be deprived of some influence concerning postwar iraq the iraqi kurds and the iraqi turkomans it also lost the substantial aid package that had been tied to acceptance of the us

authorizing the united states to deploy troops to turkish territory to open northern front in war against iraq th vote surprised the us government and its turkish counterpart both governme nts may have greatly overestimated their understanding of the turkish political situati on that contributed to the defeat of the resolution this report focuses on that politi cal scene turkish c oncerns about

to turkish airspace and attendant issues this report also reviews the implications of parliaments actions for the bilateral us turkish relationship regional relations turkeys domestic politics its economy and broader issues turkish political scene the akp government in the november 3 2002 national election in turkey single party scored victory for the first time in over d ecade by winning 363 out of 550 seats in parliament on november 28 2002 the ju stice and developmen t party akp took power in unusual way party leader recep tayyip erdogan had not been allowed to run for seat in parliament having been banned from politics because of 1996 speech that had islamist overtones and did not become prime minister deputy party leader abdullah gul became prime nister instead on december 27 2002 parliament changed the constitution to lift the ban on erdogan and allow him to contest seat in parliament he ran in byelection in the southeast town of siirt on march 9 2003 and won the gul governme nt then resigned and on march 14 erdogan finally became prime minister between november and march despite their close collaboration each man had acted as if he were in charge producing lack of leadership clarity akp had been established by reformers rebelling against necmettin erbakan the longterm authoritarian leader of turkeys islamists to achieve its electoral victory akp had brought together centris ts nationalists islamists and kurds and captured the votes of turkeys anato lian heartland the underlying islamist orientation of some akp deputies undoubtedly motivated their votes against the resolution authorizing the us troop deployment analysts note that the akpshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31794crs2 1 turkish rebuff to us shows regional strains wall street

turkish industrialists and businessmens association tusiad on february 21 2003grassroots workers core constituency nd many members of pa rliament view the world through the prism of religion or islamism they believe that the united states is determined to wage war against muslims1 nationalism is another strong force among akp supporters and the partys nati onalists suspected that the united states had imperialist intentions of occupying their country by seeking to impose large ground force on turkey they also may not have wanted to be outflanked by the extreme nationalistic stance of the oppos ition republican peoples party chp turkey had waged long struggle against its domestic kurdish separatists and many in the akp feared that the united st ates would use the war to support the establishment of an independent iraqi ku rdish state the akp also has kurdish members and they repor tedly were concerned bout possible turkish military operations against their iraqi kurdish ethni c kin under the umbrella of us military action in northern iraq all of the above concerns were at play when on march 1 533 out of 550 members of parliament were present to vote on the resolution authorizing the us deployment of 62000 troops to turkey and the foreign deployment of an unspecified number of turkish troops to an unspecified place iraq the opposition chp ideologically nationalist as well as opportunistically negative exercised party discipline and voted as bloc to reject the resolution the akp allowed its members free vote without party disc ipline an absolute majority of those present or 267 votes was required to pass the resolution but it got only 264 votes failing by three ninetynine members of the akp voted agai nst the measure 19 abstained although the cabinet had unanimously referred the matter to parliament three ministers voted against the resolution in the party cau cus prior to the vote approximately 30 deputies reportedly d advised the leadership that they would oppose the measure and 15 had declared that they would abstain therefore the vote revealed what many observers saw as an astonishing breakdow n in akp internal communications many believed that it also showed the inexperience of the partys legislators and its leaders and the latters inability to read the former communication appears to be major problem for the akp since taking office the party has spoken with many voices which sometimes lacked harmony analysts view erdogan as pragmatist2 and he declared that it was in the national interest to respond favorably to the us request to deploy troops to turkey however while he determined this was an issue of national importance he failed to explain that importance assertively pre ss members of his pa rtys parliamentary delegation strongly or enfor ce party discipline on the vote after the defeat erdogan explained that the outcome was demonstration of intraparty democracy meanwhile gul who had served for years at the islamic development bank in saudi arabia had worked to form consensus with middle eastern states to exhaust all opportunities for peace and only very reluctan tly agreed to take steps to support war his government had reestablished ambassadorial level diplomatic relations with iraq and sent minister with delegation of more than 300 to baghdad to discusshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31794crs3 3 turkish

softspoken gul was par ticularly reticent in his advocacy of the resolution erdogan and gul had publicly urged baghdad to comply with resolutions demanding disarmament but di d not publicly support us use of force to disarm iraq regime change or any stat ed us policy during the crisis moreover speaker of parliament bulent arinc who cherishes the akps formative islamist agenda encouraged opponents of the resoluti on in what may have been power play against the partys pragmatists3 none of the three main akp leaders analysts maintain really championed the resolution or earnestly attempted to influence deputies and the grassr oots on its behalf another political player worked to undermine the akp leaders effort in parliament former prime minister necmettin erbakan leader of several successive islamist parties and the godfather of turkish islamist politics had been banned from politics in 19 98 the ban was lifted in february 2003 and erbakan is staging political comeback in

immediate representation in parliament with akp defectors erbakan reportedly warned deputies that they would pay for it in the afterlifeif they did not defeat the resolution4 akp leaders came to the issue of iraq belatedly in midjanuary much us diplomacy since summer 2002 had focuse d on the prior government although undersecretary of defense paul wolfowitz and undersecretary of state marc grossman visited ankara to consult in early december 2002 less than week after the akp took power akp leaders had ot her imperative concerns the akps highest priority was strengthening the c ountrys domestic economic recovery after the worst recession 50 years the government proposed an urgent action plan and set out to reassure internationa l investors and the internati onal monetary fund it also had to deal with december 12 2002 eu ropean union summit in copenhagen and an end game in diplomacy to achieve settlement for the 29year division of the island of cyprus the us troop reque st stood behind these issues in the foreign policy queue the role of turkeys president president ahmet necdet sezer is former chief judge of the turkish constitutional court and an advocate for the rule

turkish civilian continuedlift the ban on erdogan but the presiden t took action when parliament passed them again probably because referendum w ould have been costly way to achieve the same predictable result erdogan would undoubtedly have won referendum with regard to the us deployment of forces to turkey sezer argued that the parliamentary resolution would be unconstitutional without international legitimacy to authorize the deployment of foreign forces in turkey as required by article 92 of the constituti on he said that new resolution specifically authorizing the use of force in iraq in addition to security council resolution 1441 november 8 2002 would convey that legitimacy the turkish press gave sezers opinion wide coverage5 after the war began sezer retained his legalistic perspective maintaining the united nations secu rity council process on iraq should have been allowed to finish i do not find it right that the us behaved unilaterally before that process ended6 the role of the military the powerful turkish military has identified islamism and separatism as the greatest threats to turkey it had not considered saddam hussein to be threat commanders have indicated that they view the akp and its predecessors as part of the islamist threat while the kurdistan workers party pkk guerrillas are threat to the countrys territorial integrity the chief of sta ff general hilmi ozkok recognized the akp election victory as an expression of the will of the people but he and other military leaders remained suspicious of the partys islamist intentions and indicated that they would remain vig ilant the national security council nsc where nine civilian leaders and five military commanders get together to decide national policy met on febr uary 28 2003 akp wanted the respected and popular military to s upport its very unpopular position on the us deployment but the commanders demurred seeming to want the akp leaders alone to be responsible for the resolution if the measure pa ssed over popular opposition akps popularity might decline if it failed the akp would be weakened either way some observers pointed out akps image might be tarnished and the military would be pleased another interpretation suggested that the commanders may have simply miscalculated having concluded that party with control of twothirds of parliament would be able to pass its own resolution without their support on march 4 2003 after the ramifications of the defeat of the resolution became clearer and its effect on the akp had been felt and after antiturk demonstrations by iraqi kurds general ozkok issued statement explaining the turkish armed forces position he said that national s ecurity council was not charged to advise parliament and pre ssuring parliament would not have been democratic7 ozkokhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31794crs5 7 continued leaders to exercise greater control over the military and the military has heard these admonitions the nsc decides by

able to prevent the war on its own our choice is between bad and worse if turkey did not participate in the war ozkok said it would still sustain the same damages but without compensation however if turkey assisted in waging the war part of its damages might be compensated and the war would be shorter with less pain and suffering so ozkok said that the governments parliamentary motion to aut horize us forces had been in harmony with the armed forces reasoning in othe r words he supported the resolution after its defeat he also laid foundation for passage of similar resolution if and when it were resubmitted immedi ately thereafter politicians praised ozkoks statement and some members of parliament said that they would change their votes if the resolution was introduced again their rapi d about face and remark s testified to the continuing strong influence of the military in turkish politics however akp leaders decided on course of damage control and not to resubmit the resolution public opinion and the media at about the time the us administrati on was preparing its requests for the new government in ankara november 2002 survey of turkish opinion by the pew research center was published it indicat ed that turks opposed letting us forces use bases in turkey for military action in iraq by margin of 83 to 13 the survey further showed that proamerican perceptions in turkey had dropped from 52 in 19992000 to 30 in summer 2002 moreover 58 of turks opposed the us war on terrorism8 some viewed it as war against muslims by the time the turkish government submitted the authorization resolution to parliament opposition to the war d grown to 95 of the public according to turkeys ambassador to the united states mass protests are uncommon in turkey yet on the day of the vote more th an 50000 antiwar demonstrators gathered outside parliament these velopments posed challenge to the government which had focused almost exclusively on preventin g war and then on negotiating with the united states it had not focused on prep aring the public for the kind of support that it was willing to give to the united states some commentators argue that the publics

67 turkish industrialists and businessmens association washington office selected news on turkey april 16 2003for turkeys strategic importance it is uncertain if such suppor t which ankara has taken for granted would be given in the future the unpopularity of the united states in turkey grew during the negotiations for the deployment turks felt that the u s press had portrayed the negotiations as bazaar and had negatively described the size of the us offer as buying coalition of the billing64 the turkish press repeated these reports as outrages us officials were openly impatient65 and the turkish media portrayed them as arrogant peremptory and as humiliating the turks with whom they dealt the turks felt that money was only one issue out of many impor tant ones that were dealt with in the negotiations and wa s overemphasized the turkish military has long been the ma jor supporter of the bilateral alliance yet chief of staff general ozkok himself expressed frustration with what he seemed to consider lack of us sympathy for turkeys concerns he said i have difficulty understanding those who claim ther is threat to them across the ocean and when turkey says the same threat exis ts on the other side of its border this is found to be unbelievable66 in sum the crisis over the us deployment deeply strained bilateral relations efforts at recovery have begun prime minister erdogan reached out to american audiences with opinion pieces in us newspapers saluting bilateral relations and the alliance however he has yet to make similar comprehensive argument to domestic audience secretary of state powell visited turkey on april 2 and met with presiden t sezer prime minister er dogan foreign minister gul and chief of staff general ozkok the s ecretary expressed appreciation for the support turkey was giving in the war and promised to be sensitive to turkeys concerns about northern iraq his turk ish interlocutors described the visit as extremely beneficial president sezer unders cored that there will not be any change in turkeys attitude of attributing great importance to its strategic partnership with the united states67 president bush called erdogan on april 23 to reaffirm strong bilateral relations and to thank him for the role that turkey was playing in resupplying us troops in iraq congress has contributed to the recovery by approving the emergency wartime

longhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31794crs25 term bilateral relati onship won out over those seeking to punish turkey for its recent failure given the striking deterioration in hi storic ties continuous work by both sides may be needed regional situation without an agreement on troop deployment the united states may be less likely to consult closely with the turkish governme nt about the future of iraq the type of government to be established or the rights of the turkomans as yet there has been noticeable turkish presence at any of the postwar meetings to discuss the future us troops initially were not present in numbers large enough to prevent the kurds from entering kirkuk prompting transitory fears that turkish forces might enter northern iraq in large numbers with unforeseeable long term consequences the lack of sizeable us presence ppeared to allow the kurds to assume dominant role perhaps foreshadowing thei r enhanced autonomy in the region if iraqs territorial integrity is questioned ethnic groups in other countries might pose similar challenges to nearby regimes domestic politics the akp and its leaders have been weakened by the defeat in parliament the delay in submitting the motion authorizing us access to turkish airspace may have reflected their wariness on march 1 th akp leadership had allowed members to vote their conscience and llowed the measure to come to vote without certainty that it would pass the defectors embarrassed their leaders the lack of political leadership and control on an issue of paramount national in terest and national security was damaging to the partys credibility it remains to be seen if akp will splinter and if akps future attempts to govern strongly and pragmatically will be affected moreover the militarys abstention on the issue of deployment may be seen as warning to the akp although the product of an unprecedented popular electoral victory the akp still needs to cultivate the military commanders its effort to democratize the country has to take into account unique cultural and historical context in which military role remains significant some analysts have suggested that the vote in parliament signals the growth of turkeys democracy because parliament d been responsive to public opinion yet others see the failure of the ruling part in turkey to have parliament pass an important measure as indicative of the inexperience and immaturity of turkeys democracy and its proponents strong lead ership and bloc voting are characteristic of most parliament ary democracies economy the us offer of economic aid military aid and loan guarantees was intended to compensate turkey for the cost of th us deployment and was contingent upon ankaras acceptance of the troops without the deployment us officials made clear after the vote the larger aid package would not be forthcoming the united states still would support turkey in inte rnational financial institutions turkeyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31794crs26 would still suffer serious warrelated nd mostly uncompensat ed economic losses moreover it has large debt payments due throughout 2003 which the us loan guarantees would have eased considerab ly during the months of government indecision and immediately after the war began interest rates on domestic debt rose 15 to above 70 the government alr eady submitted budget that requires cuts in spending and tax increases and promis ed strict adherence to the imf program interest rates fell only after president bush requested 1 billion in aid for turkey thus turkeys economic fortunes appear to be tied more than ever to the perception of the status of its relations with the united states wider implications some observers have suggested that turkeys stand emboldened the smaller countries which are nonpermanent undecided members of the security council to withstand us pressure for resolution that would give iraq short deadline to disarm in other words authorize the use of force to disarm iraq this analysis suggests that if such close long time dependable and dependent ally of the united states could thwart the will of great pow er other countries could be encouraged to do so as
