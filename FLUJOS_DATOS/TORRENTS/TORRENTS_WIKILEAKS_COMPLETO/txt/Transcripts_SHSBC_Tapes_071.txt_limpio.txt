shsbc 71 problems intensive procedures lecture given on 17 october 1961 how are you audience okay fine okay this is the 17th of october 1961 and boy are you in for it i hate that sadistic look actually one life i whole life i spent as pirate ive resented ever since and i take it out on bad auditing bad auditing restimulates this life of piracy because thats what it is its just butchery and theres just sense in it theres sense in bad auditing to show you how bad it can get when saint hillers go back for the first time into an area the few who have left here theyve given demonstrations and theyve found interesting things like this the whole crowd they demonstrated to all professional auditors saw for the first time null needle on an emeter its kind of bitter criticism isnt it and the statement uniformly is made by somebody leaving here and going back to some area well scientology has just never been done all right you can dream up all sorts of fancy processes and you can find out whats wrong with the mind and you can search deeper into it and turn it all upside down but if this never gets applied by the most elementary basics what have you got left you got wogs thats all you got because nothing good wonderful process good and excellent analysis diagnosis expert textbook seventeen libraries of tapes and all the rest of it are not going to make anybody well if scientology is not applied nothing is going to do it unless an auditor is going to do it and there you have it and an auditor has to do certain basic definite things and he has to know these things very very well first and foremost of these things hes got to get his trs down particularly tr 0 and then hes got to know what an emeter is all about and then hes got to know what model session is all about and then hes got to know how to security check well if hes gotten that far if hes gotten that far hes going to get results and if he hasnt gotten that far he isnt going to get any results so this is the exact distance were trying to pull up every auditor in the world just now were just trying to pull him up that exact distance and that is cornerstone on which we can build that any results at all have been gotten around the world attest to my hopeful essays in ability certainty understanding affinity and the other basics oh thats bitter statement isnt it thats invalidative but ive never invalidated before to this magnitude but i keep getting these reports back from people who have left here now i havent really straight up visavis trained anybody for very long time and now that ive started doing it again just here at saint hill in spite of the fact that i dont sit there and hold your hand every session im to marked degree looking over your shoulder and mary sue is looking down your throat now to be able to do good assessment on routine 3 and so forth is like asking most of the auditors of the world to build the fifteenth floor of building before they have any cornerstone in the place at all lets build the fifteenth floor and lets have it float on what foundation the foundation on which it floats is tremendously accurate ability to do the trs an excellent command of emeter and emeter phenomenon an excellent command of model session and horrendous ability to security check now if youve got those things then then well have something on which to build but without those things we have nothing on which to build i know now why characters like mathison could go on and sell 18dial 14gauge shortcircuitthroughthepc emeters they were just window dressing nobody thought they worked and nobody thought they did anything so of course you could sell anything an emeter is very precision instrument and when you can make an emeter talk you can make pc talk but you have to know how to make an emeter talk first now there are other methods that have been used in the past to make pcs talk such as my career as space pirate i recall one incident vividly i was part of another unit i wasnt being pirate that life i play hooky every once in while and go out and get active im great believer in activity i go between being very active and being very scholarly and im afraid the there are burn spots on most planets wheere ive sacked towns while being active or have prevented people from sacking towns same final result you see and alongside of that sort of staggered things to confound students in the libraries yes ive been perfect example of the aristotelian pendulum dont ever go in for any halfway measures either be very active or very scholarly middle ground middle grounds and in this particular incident space pirate came aboard this merchant ship and in order to make them talk to find out the destination and where the gold was going to be picked up took crowbar and pried the spine out of one of the crew members it sounds like rather exaggerated activity doesnt it i thought it was exaggerated myself as we told him the inquisition the inquisition used to warm peoples toes at the stake and pack their chest and mouth area in ice so that they wouldnt burn and die too quickly well that was after the fact they couldnt make them talk dont you see and if youll find out most torture comes and most punishment comes after all media to persuade communication to exist has failed brutality is after the fact of communication brutality follows failed communication overts are always to be found in the wake of communication for instance theres ruddy alleged british viceconsul sitting in town in spain just now who is sitting on couple of suitcases of ours and what are we going to do about these suitcases well he refuses to answer any communication of any kind whatsoever we shamed him into giving us one letter by taking some pesetas we had and pinning them to selfaddressed airmail envelope and sending it down to him and he wrote back some entheta you know it was some bad news hed had from some other quarter but didnt mention these suitcases see all hes got to do is call up steamship company tell them to come over and get the suitcases and take them on the next boat you see very simple but he wont communicate now what frame of mind do you think people get into after while on something like that im just showing you tiny little present time piece of nonsense you see well the immediate idea is to get the british consul at vigo to go up and give him good swift kick where it will do lot of good you see or write the foreign office and tell the fellow hes in league with the russians you know of course he probably isnt too honest or he would dare say something but he evidently doesnt dare talk failed communication always carries in its wake punishment its why you get mad at pc theres something the pc wont say and you cant seem to find the means to make him say it hes sitting on some type of withhold or noncommunication or something of the sort and he just wont conununicate the pc says well my mother beat and she used to lock in the closet every day and then she wouldnt give any dinner she never bought any clothes and very often threw down the coal chute every time we went for ride on streetcar she threw under the wheels and i was killed along about this time you suspect there is some sort of withhold about mother and youre tired of this violin solo because its not by stravinsky and so you ask this fellow if he has withhold from his mother or withhold about his mother and you get response of any kind whatsoever i was good to her i was always good as gold and i always smiled every time she threw under the streetcar and killed you say depending upon your immediate antecedents word of few letters the auditors arc breaks down at this point now if all of this is true that its after communication fails that brutality begins then any of an auditors overts against pc or any of his impatiences against pc must perforce arise by the auditors own failure to make the pc sing must so result doesnt that look fairly obvious to you bad auditing follows failed auditing you very often pick up somebody in coaudit you sit him down have him just chatter repetitively some sort of phrase at pc and the pc gets wonderful results and everybody is happy of course the instructor had to be there and everybody had to be there and somebody had to fix up the place and somebody had to put him in the chair and somebody had to hold the pc still well beside that there wasnt any failure involved and theres brutality involved and youll find this quote auditor unquote loves the pc like brother and everything is going to happen for the best in this best of all possible worlds and then we put him on the academy course and we fail to teach him how to run an emeter and we fail to teach him how to run model session and we fail to teach him any of the trs and we fail to show him how you can make pc talk and he runs into his first pc or two and they dont talk so weve eventually got an auditor who is going chop chop chop chop and there is love thy neighbor there anymore why the auditor did not learn the tools of his trade so he instinctively falls back on tools of former trades now even the inquisitor as he walked in in his bloodencrusted robe and said to the prisoner all is up bud in spanish german french or hog latin he would still say now if you will just confess and say that i dont know what god were they worshipping molech baal thats thats im off the trail there some other planet anyway whoever they happened to have dreamed up at the moment if youll just confess that he is trio consisting of mama papa baby or something like that if you will just say this if youll just say this and give your soul and into the hands of i dont know the chief goat or something like this why well let you off well let you off and that will be it well just execute you quietly or well let you go to prison or something like this we wont do anything very vicious to you and thats all youve got to say of course the reason im gagging that up is because of course the same gag has happened over and over religion after religion planet after planet trillennia after trillennia it just happens to be in your history books that theres the father and the holy ghost well this is just modern parlance and youll notice its gone up scale to condition see it used to probably be the rock the tree and the plow or something you know probably more solid now lets look that over he still is trying to make somebody talk and when that fellow fails to do so he takes him out puts him in red robe or yellow robe it was puts heretic or something on his chest in chinese characters and puts him out there and ties him up to the stake and puts some dry ice on his chest if thats available from the local space opera club and burns him but he wont say it he just wont say it that isnt response of some cruel monster the inquisitor is not monster hes just failed thetan hes just living being hes got mixed up in some effort to make everything come out right in the social dynamics he thinks hes trying to do job and the net result is that he does brutal job because he has methodology to get any information or to get anything figured out he has methodology so therefore an auditor who is not trained in the basics of scientology is somebody who has methodology and you can absolutely count on the fact that as the decades march along scientology would go exactly the same route of the spanish inquisition and any central organization or group of scientologists anywhere in the world will move directly and immediately over into the same frame of mind with regard to pcs and the society and their job and everything else if they themselves do not know that they have basic tools that make people talk it is so simple you do not pull an overt when you badly process pc that is not much of an overt yes it makes you knucklehead and hes unhappy with it and all that sort of thing but you have not killed all of his chances his chances are not all up the spout maybe next year maybe next life hell get processed you see maybe somebody will open the gates yet the overt is bad dissemination because if you disseminate badly you head scientology toward brutality and you make it impossible for this fellow next year or next life to have somebody open the gates bad dissemination slams them shut and locks them forevermore now the gates are well open at this particular stage but they will not stay open unless the technologies of the application of scientology are well practiced and well understood that you can count on now i didnt mean that to turn into much of sermon but im dead in earnest about it now new students coming in here have tendency to go on living at their same rate of speed and we have introduced new and shocking state of affairs person can audit obviously to the degree that he can command his tools certainly thats true the more i know about the mind the more i know about my tools the better i can audit myself so why shouldnt it follow true elsewhere there are about seventyeight items on student checksheet here seventyeight items if you passed one examination on one of those items every week it would take you seventyeight weeks oh you arent here that long but if you passed one examination day one examination day you could probably make it so thats what i want you to do one examination passed passed not taken passed per day oh you say its impossible well youre in good company scientology is impossible nobody could have dreamed up scientology thats the impossibility so if the impossibility is also nobody could learn it at that rate of speed all right so its merely impossible one exam per day one bulletin per day one tape per day whatever that checksheet item is one per day and youll find your auditing skill will rise but it is fundamental that you have to get out of the road your trs your model session thats very fundamental your emeter very fundamental and how to security check because listen if you cant security check you will never be able to make pc talk it isnt that security checking is looking for all the evils of his life but how could you even find out if he has an arc break if you cant security check after all isnt it security check situation youre asking this fellow who doesnt want to talk why are you not wanting to talk and find out whether he wants to or not want to because hes liable to sit there in some kind of social chatter with you and maybe you could look in your crystal ball or between his ears or be three feet back of his head and ascertain his exact state of vibration at this particular aura maybe you can do this but it seems just little bit odd that we should have to since i point out to you that people have also been able to do this for the last couple of hundred trillion years and we didnt have scientology and we didnt have well people so dont buck against the emeter and its ability to pick up information because your inability to get information from the pc is what drives you down first into not asking for any information from the pc and then drives you into vicious frame of mind about pcs and then will drive you eventually into not wanting to audit any pcs at all now its an oddity that the auditor who has withholds will not ask for withholds so if an auditor has withholds and then on top of that cant get information from the pc and doesnt know how to go about getting information from the pc and doesnt know how to sort this out and cant make any sense out of what he is doing he of course will wind up eventually not auditing wont he and any auditor who at this instant is not auditing is not auditing because he didnt know his business or at the time he was auditing the business was not well enough understood and he is not capable of using direct tools he has lost confidence that he can obtain the information necessary to resolve the case hes lost his confidence in this now im looking at couple of students right now that came down here because there is scientologist sick someplace and they want to get the newest and best and go back and do something for this fellow oh yeah but this fellow has had lot of processing by this auditor and that auditor around about the place why hasnt he suddenly recovered because i tell you theres nothing wrong with him at all but hes got an area of withhold and thats everything that is wrong with him i could find it and knock it out in minutes but so could any trained auditor who knows his tools there is reason under the sun reason at all why scientology should fail in anybodys hands at this stage at this precise instant on its developmental track except if he doesnt know his business now he could fail if he didnt know his business but you have just had placed in your hands problems intensive oh surely the form will be rewritten and will probably be rewritten again it will probably be in the process of rewrite ten years from now but its useful form just as it exists right now and it will simply be rewritten and rewritten only to the degree that auditors goof with it and the only reason itll be rewritten is to add another line or something saying do not ever assess section you know assess you know something like that im shaking this problems intensive form down im shaking the form down we know exactly exactly at this instant what the stackup is in current lifetime that puts pc out of action one can go in on this with such accuracy as to practically stand anyones hair on end and new person dragged off the street and given problems intensive her hair will stand on end because we not only have the tools of how to get information but we also have this other thing we know exactly what information to get because the anatomy of the current lifetimes confusions failures and upsets is clearly laid out before us it is one of these idiotic maps once it is drawn of how to get to the house next door i mean its that simple map there is nothing very complicated about this map exactly how you follow the map depends once more upon these basic tools which i have enumerated there are tools secondary to these tools which you will find it very useful to have around such as the auditors code recently central organization got ahold of somebody who was an epileptic person didnt say they were an epileptic nobody spotted they were an epileptic nobody spotted the fact the person had been on drugs and had knocked it off the day before processing you know after year or so on drugs you all of sudden dont take drugs all of these goofs you see but if they had followed the auditors code they still would not have come to grief we have never had anybody go spinny oh this person is all bailed out and is all straight or will be but weve never had anybody go spinny under processing unless theyve had usually change of auditors or they werent eating or they werent getting any sleep those are part of the auditors code i havent actually seen good example of this for years because people follow it very very well usually and sure enough this pc because she was off of sedation was getting sleep and having been on sedation was not hungry and wasnt eating i dont know how the change of auditors set up but it probably was all awry too and the person spun so its good thing to know the secondary tools of ones trade such as the auditors code it is secondary but it is tool of the trade and you can spin people if you dont know it there are lot of people around for instance that invalidate like mad while saying never invalidate pcs data you know they invalidate and then you say well all right youre invalidating and they say oh im not and you say what is invalidation they misinterpreted what invalidation is they dont know what invalidation is they dont know what evaluation is so they disobeyed points of the auditors code so the next step comes up its good thing to understand the tools of the trade in addition to being able to use them and understanding of those tools is quite valuable what is evaluation what is invalidation i had an oldtime auditor suddenly blink one day and say by george i do evaluate had never realized it before it was on questions and this auditor was asking questions something on the order of do you still beat your wife they were unanswerable questions the question could not of course be answered by the pc so it was accusative it accused the pc of beating his wife that was of course evaluative invalidative all in one fell swoop i explained the pc had to have an out the pc had to have an out that is to say you cant say do you still beat your wife you have to say have you ever beaten your wife and he can still say dont you see so you can actually write up security questions that are completely off base how long have you been dope addict you ask the pc out of the blue just out of the blue you see hes just sitting there youre running down the list and you say how long have you been dope addict theres out he cant say ive never been dope addict without going out of agreement with the auditor and so forth and that is both invalidative and evaluative both things in one the auditor is saying in essence youre dope addict you see and hes also invalidating the pc to the degree of saying you mustnt answer this but its more of an evaluation than otherwise so in writing up security questions and so forth you have to know about such things as invalidation and evaluation and more importantly know what they are what is invalidation what is evaluation what are these shuns that you must shun but these are basically elementary tools all right now we front up to another one of these elementary tools when we front up to the form of problems intensive this form is one of the oldest forms of scientology oddly enough this form was first dreamed up in elizabeth new jersey in 1950 found out that auditors knew nothing about pcs that they were auditing so therefore it was an awfully good idea to find out something about the pc so this basic form was written up and that was it and this is almost the form the early form was very close to it i think that earliest form was used to make up this form now where you have an early form that comes through it must have had some usefulness there must have been some use all the way through right something that lasts this long well so therefore knowing something about your pc is valuable knowing something about your pc is valuable you can get into all sorts of messes knowing nothing about pc well its just like central organization they never bothered to ask the pc miss have you ever been sick you know have you ever been well have you ever been sick have you ever been and went ahead and audited the pc without ever finding out any information about the pc adventurous activity fortunately it only happens once in long while but there it is now that was what this form originally set up to cure just that more and we found it of value to know where the secondaries on the case lay thats why you have mothers death and fathers death and other deaths thats why those deaths are there because they tell you the most fruitful source of secondaries frankly if you run any one of those points as an engram if the pc is capable of running an engram if you know how to run an engram if that is the engram to run on the case all of those things providing youll spill considerable grief charge and you open up lot of track very often around death like that you just get total close in all right we go into these various things these various sections they are simply an effort to find out something about your pc now of course pc will always answer questions of that character and if those sections ive already covered with you in another lecture an individual going on down the line will run into some of these things and rather be unwilling to give you the dope and after that will be out of session on you and you will be in perilous state of nowhere with the pc great many pcs have secret illnesses great many pcs have had mental treatment of some kind or another great many pcs have compulsions and fears that they dont want you to find out about as long as you have social mores built around one must be social in some fashion there are actually thousands of such mores as long as you have those things people will violate them and when they violate them they go out of communication with the group and when they go out of communication with the group then theyre out of communication with groups and an auditor pc relationship is group so therefore youve got to raise their group consciousness before you get an auditor pc relationship auditor and pc form group so therefore some of these sections are pulled with an eye on the needle you put your eye on the needle and you get all there is to know on that particular thing not operations who cares who cares how many operations theyve had you say how many operations have you had in your life well the fellow says i had tonsillectomy and i had tooth operation once and i had uh uh had uh uh hernia and so forth lets see if there are any more i say good fine thank you now what is your present physical condition his operation denotes nothing you dont know who made up whose mind that who had to have an operation you see that is not the type of change or anything that you care to have much to do with at this particular angle because you can throw him into the incident you can throw him right down into the incident so it wouldnt do any good to plunge him into series of engrams would it so there isnt any point in plunging him into engrams you take accidents operations dust it off lightly just very lightly skip it i know if youre from iowa or something like that youll have to restrain yourself because thats the sole source of social conversation but dust it off lightly and then we get into this thing physical condition whats wrong with the pc what is wrong with the pc oh well the pc has couple of social diseases oh and if this is withhold it becomes circuit hohoooo and the pc will never answer an auditing command as long as you audit him the auditing command is always addressed to something or other which is addressed to something or other which is scheduled to cure this thing he hasnt told you about all societies set themselves up to be ill society is any exception to that because as soon as you get together huge mores of thoushaltnots you of course get the two phenomena of withhold and make guilty and people will use them to make other people guilty and people will withhold them and make other people withhold them and it throws the people out of communication with the people and therefore you get asising of those conditions and so all civilizations grow ill and die whether they are egyptian or greek or roman or british or american they all become ill from their own mores because they bring with them the attendant phenomena of withholds and makeguilties whenever you have mores as the sole method of being civilized you will have decay and death now scientology is the first track area that has ever been which could form mores which did not result in destruction but it can only do this if scientologists know their business it would inevitably sicken and die the moment that nobody could make anybody talk then they could only make people guilty you see if you cant asis and if you cant wipe away then you can only repress however you look at it that is the only way civilizations have had of handling thou shalt not kill thou shalt not butter thy brothers wife didnt matter how idiotic or stupid or odd it was the thoushaltnots were their method of holding it all in line and they never noticed that to the degree that the thoushaltnots were enforced the society sickened the more punishment was administered to criminals the more crime eventually took place direct ratio punishing criminals just making people guilty of after some criminal has been punished of course everybody else who was guilty of the crime is supposed to be restrained from committing it again because of the punishment well its shortterm activity its very shortterm and it does have workability very crude workability but it does have workability now someone could debate alongside of on this subject some character back along the track or something like that who was fond of oratory could debate along this line and could prove to you absolutely and conclusively that civilization any civilization owed its becoming civilization totally to the mechanism of making people guilty and making people withhold their crimes and sins he could prove this conclusively as long as he was arguing from the basis that man is evil if he was arguing from that basis he could prove it conclusively but remember to examine his premise and his premise is man is evil now you have to process somebody and find out that they are nicer people before you suddenly realize that man is basically evil is not proper premise on which to base an argument but man has uniformly used this premise and therefore has not thought any other method of civilization was possible obviously if man is basically evil what you have to do is punish man thats the only thing that you could do with man if man was evil you have to punish him there couldnt be any other mechanism because if you freed him hed become more evil you will find that in trying to disseminate scientology you will find people horrified you mean actually erase this mans sexual repressions well what is he going to do now about his sexual morality oh i think most sexual morality is based upon not getting any fun out of sex immorality is based on an anxiety to get fun out of sex or an anxiety to create new generation theres worry mixed up in all of these sexual abnormalities somebody who can experience sex or doesnt have to of course would not then be immoral but you get into all kinds of debates and you can get into many philosophic debates about civilization punishment make guilty evil all of these things you can get into lot of these debates but you have to watch this one point the premise on which the person is arguing is that demonstrated is the premise proven and of course you can knock all such arguments apart merely by pulling the rug out from underneath the premise theres nothing sillier than premise sitting on its blank on bare floor now if you look over argumentation youll find you can always win the argument by pulling somebodys premises out from underneath him but youve got lots of examples you have demonstration which is quite interesting person is spreading entheta chopping up nattering raising hell leaving leading very unhappy life and is actually committing sins which are recognizable sins of one character or another through life all right you process this person this person stops doing it and becomes more effective all right when youve watched that yourself and when you yourself have seen this with your own two eyes then you will be able to conclude from your own experience that when you free man from his inhibitions he becomes better that you could prove positively and then you could surmise then from that that basically if you let mans nature be demonstrated and if you see his nature demonstrated and find it good then you have to make up your mind that man is basically good not basically evil this flies in the teeth of almost every christian premise there is by the way you can get into some very very nasty arguments on this subject because the concept of the original is the whole basis of christianity but im not leading you out into debates im just showing you where this is and where it sits oh its quite interesting preclear of whom you have some information quentin hes very very little fellow pintsize pc he had five weeks of auditing at about thirtyfive minutes day five days week now add it up whatever it is hes seven years old found his goal found his terminal and ran his levels and did child security check that was what was done during that period of time needle is so loose now that the tone arm wobbles he is very close to clear the next sprint of processing he will get which is two or three months up the line he will undoubtedly go clear because hes proceeding that rapidly but it is quite amazing to have polite little boy who is very active this is one of the oddest combinations i have ever seen you see hes extremely polite and very active hes now able to run about twice as fast as he could before and he can yell twice as loud and hes about five times as polite its kind of fantastic you wouldnt realize this when you saw him running around shouting particularly but if you had conversation with him even you i think youd find that he was very polite well you see thats just happened he wasnt very polite before all right now theres an example theres an example now what happened there exactly what precisely happened actually he became freer he longer has an odd feeling of being pushed around and being enturbulated he described it to his mother shaking his shoulders as one of the results of his processing that he longer felt just shook his shoulders and that back and forth and grimaced you see hee had word to describe it but that was evidently the way he had felt before now theres what we mean by freedom of course you wouldnt think in seven years that man could accumulate much crime well its very interesting the tininesses of the crimes you know hit his sister you know little things made big difference when you see that you will see then the workability of this the freeing of the person brings about goodness the person becomes more pleasant to others and so forth its quite interesting so that you can see to that degree group restoring itself and you can see vitality you can see greater motion greater action and where an individual has drawn out of earlier groups they then become accordingly difficult to process in the group called auditor pc and similarly hard to get along with in the group called scientology thats about all there is to it if theyve withdrawn you see to too great an extent from some recent group to which they have belonged youll get withholds and so forth you try to make psychologist into scientologist and i mean real honest to god dyedinthewool satinclassforsixyearsandlearnednothing psychologist i beg your pardon they did learn something they learned the parts of the brain i dont know what that had anything to do with it im talking about real honest to goodness supertrained psychologist all right he comes over you put him in the academy oh man wow we had one in washington and i think it took her three or four weeks to get through comm course and she was really trying she was really trying and everything it took normal student week or two to get over she was taking five or six weeks to get through her rate of study was something on the order of about four times the amount of time consumed for the same absorbed datum slow she was not stupid she simply was renegade from group and nobody had run out the renegadity see because the person was now failed group member they didnt make good group member you see and that mostly applies not to past groups but it applies to more recent groups that is to say its most forceful right here in this lifetime youll find it showing up in former lives and affecting the pc of course that is the basis of it but you will find out that you cant even get him insession if hes messed up with groups in this lifetime so if you get too much withdrawal from groups and so forth so therefore processing against the mores of groups is quite interesting it well it rather forecasts security check for college student security check for highschool student security check for basic student in earlier forms family security check so on if you were to just take security check for each group that the person had been part of and then gradually patched them up so that they actually could again be member of that group youd all of sudden find them going into session bang you see they go into session very easily their rudiments would go out very slightly and some day youll be picking up psychologists after all they had the goal of healing people before they got mixed up in black magic and the psychiatrist similarly the medical doctor and so forth just remember that this fellow when he moves over into scientology is renegade and as renegade of course he has overts and withholds from the group he has just renegaded so you had better you better pay attention to that it isnt what has he done to scientology that is bothering him its what he has just done to medicine thats what would get him in you see matter how idiotic this group sounds to you it is worth investigating on the basis of security check in order to get somebody insession you know it could have been the girl scouts or it could have been anything you know subahoobahooba well they probably believed in it while they were doing it didnt get them anyplace thats why they left it but theyre still person who has been part of mores see and certain things were guilty and certain things were makeguilty and certain things should had to be withheld and so forth and frankly you have to be quite clever to do some of these because you have to figure out what is the mores of the group they have departed from for instance whats the mores of medical doctor i dont think it has very much to do with social mores but it certainly is mores that is mores never give the patient an even break i dont know if thats part of it never sit down to dinner with your fellow doctors without discussing the gruesome points of the last operation so as to condition them have you ever failed to try to condition one of your fellow doctors so that he would be able to better practice his profession youd get knock on it yeah well the fellow went to dinner one time and didnt bring up single bloody operation you know it might be breach of mores you know well what the mores of the group is is what the mores of the group is and when you realize that there is crime on the face of the earth there is crime on the face of the earth that isnt somewhere else on the face of earth virtue youll realize that theres differences there are pretty wild differences from group to group now when you start coming down this line you will be able to spot groups that the person has been part of present physical condition well he said i was in the army and we dont care what else he says he was in the army ooooh now as you go through processing this case youve got lot of processing bait here it says army army right there under present physical condition well of course we picked up army someplace else probably but we might not have too well his present physical condition when he was in the army he got pretty tired and actually was hospitalized for while but is better now thats interesting thats interesting all by itself now youre going to get it later over here on but as you go down the line later on when you run this thing and when youve run two or three times and found the areas that you ought to get off the case you would be very clever to go back over the whole form and find out if there are any more possible changes in there that he gave you on the rest of the form that you are now beautifully missing on and add them to and just include them in your next assessments well his physical condition is much better now than when it was in the army what army what is the mores of an army later on you are going to have to realize that when youre cooking up security check hes going to mention sergeant well i dont know what is proper mores for private soldiers about sergeants it hasnt anything to do with obey the sergeant be nice to the sergeant it has nothing to do with that he almost lost out in the whole military field as matter of fact out at target practice he never really used to be able to go up on the firing line with any degree of confidence why well he had withhold from his other privates hed laughed at sergeants joke its all right to laugh at captains joke but not sergeants theres various types of mores lord knows and then its of importance what army he was in zulu army would conduct itself quite differently and in addition to that youd find out i think that the algerian rebel army conducts itself quite differently i know the chinese armies conducted themselves very differently withhold from chinese general would be something like he did engage in battle once that showed he was very decayed and hes never told any other anybody else about it or he thought of actually joining battle he thought of doing this of course chinese generals never do what you do is maneuver they used to in the old days they used to maneuver until the enemy was at disadvantage and then the general who had the other fellow at the disadvantage then made bids for his rifles for the mens rifles and bought them at something on the order of ten maces per rifle or something like this and that was the way the war ended in 1914 18 i think you would have found the soldiery involved in 1914 18 i think you would have found them very very pleasantly disposed toward that particular idea because the prevailing idea then was to take the generals of both sides put them in an arena with clubs and let them fight it out and you know i dont know that at 14 18 it wouldnt have settled just as much i dont know that it wouldnt have settled it much better you look back on wars you know after youve been in there pitching and trying to prevent this or save the world for rooseveltism or something like this you know you look back on these things and you begin to you know say well i dont know this is the way it is now and we dont seem to have saved anything you know usually can be depended on to give you lose but mores depend on groups and the more data you get such as interests and hobbies his criminal record group of prison compulsions repressions fears these might tell you all sorts of groups of various kinds youre getting future bait for putting together security check so you want to shake those things down with an emeter furthermore they could operate as withhold from you and in view of that fact they could knock you out as group you see now as previous scientology processing you usually require four five six eight ten pages if you had it one by one and so forth so were not terribly interested in long dissertations on it all we want is an estimate because were not trying to run an arc break here were not trying to patch up former processing we just want to get some idea on how long this character has been around and more or less where has he been processed and how much just vaguely youre going to get all of that in the arc break process anyhow you see now his present processing goes we couldnt care less about that but his lifeturning points and so forth oh and now heres where i get into frame of mind where i speak to you the way i have spoken to you early in this lecture sadly urgently disappointedly look nobody nobody could do this form wrong it isnt possible you have to try so lets go over the points which we have caught and these points are simply these list briefly what is the word briefly how do we list briefly what does the word briefly means well briefly translated through ancient anglosaxon means two words more now youll find the pc assesses better if you move his time track around so you get the change and then you move over in front of the change and put the date in front of it and if you will make that change you will find out your assessment has less trouble write the date and then write the incident the change briefly 1955 left boeing totally adequate statement 1947 tobacco its all shorthand it means something to him he either gave it up or took it up or something of the sort but it means something to him but if you said 1947 tobacco you see this gets proper registry it doesnt mix it up with 1934 tobacco when he smoked his first cigarette get the idea youll find out your assessment goes more rapidly if the date is first ive been studying what youve been doing and ive come up to these conclusions that you had better be doing it this way and this answers some of your problems its not an extraordinary solution your next forms that are issued on these things will be written up so that you cant do it any other way than this you got that now all right date then item date item now what is change what is change what change are we interested in and dont let catch you after this exact hour and minute on this particular time track ever listing again in the section graduated from high school dont dont ever write it down why not because it is not selfdetermined change the fates called the school board decreed it years before that in 19yumpfdeyumpf he was going to be graduated from high school and it gives you forerunning change it does not assess it does not mean anything at all in 1950 he certainly was going to graduate from high school in 1954 right when he went to the university he certainly graduated from the university so graduating from the university from high school anything else it is not selfdetermined change left the university in the third year oh well now now now weve got something here you see thats selfdetermined change you say how come you left well i just wasnt getting along well and i decided and i talked to my father and we decided and got it thats selfdetermined change understand demobilized from army do not ever let catch you soiling the end of ball point with that one why men are demobilized from the army quite without any consultation that is not selfdetermined change of any kind whatsoever the war is over or the enlistment is up or time that is predestined and predetermined has now expired or the individual was foolish enough to stand up and bare his breast to the winds of the gunpowder and they couldnt use him anymore well what are you doing what are you doing if you write that one down oh well youre just setting it up to assess the times the pc has been victim and it will give you totally different result and im rather horrified to realize that i have to explain this because i will tell you this that this whole thing can be thrown and its whole effectiveness can be knocked out and all of problems intensive can be knocked in the head by listing otherdetermined changes if you list otherdetermined changes what do you get all you do is actually list sections to n all over again and look you already listed them these are occurrences is different kind of occurrence and i should make this completely clear if youre ever going to make any is different kind of occurrence it is selfdetermined occurrence he up and made up his mind he did for reasons best known to him and god that he was going to do something else with his life thats what and thats what is is not had an operation was in an automobile accident and that made big change in my life yes yes well theres the automobile accident and you had better put that down and then one day i was standing on the curb and bus came by and the conductor hit over the head and that put in the hospital yeah that was big change that was big change in my life and then i graduated from school and i didnt know what to do with myself and that was big change in life that is for sure big change in life now you get these things one after the other and you assess being run over by bus being operated on being graduated from school and what do you have you have picture of pawn being moved on the chessboard of life and there it moves and there it moves and there it was taken by the knight oh how sad my career as victim is what youre liable to get under if you dont know the facts of life and the facts of life are these what you are looking for what you are looking for in the times when he made up his mind to change why youre only looking for the solutions to problems youre not looking for changes in life he changed in life as the solution to problem he didnt know he had and youre never going to find the problems and youre never going to find the prior confusions if you go ahead and list otherdetermined changes well how will you never do it well of course an operation will rock on the emeter you give complete list of operations try it someday have somebody say well lets have somebody that was really been hanging around the medicos you know theres only one part of one fingernail left of the original body and here we are you see and you list this persons operations and you say did these make any changes in your life oh yes made big change in my life changed from the house to the hospital and then changed over to the rest sanitarium and then i got home yeah that made big change and then from the house to the hospital and the rest sanitarium and the house to the hospital to the rest sanatorium to the house to the hospital to the rest sanitarium and you assess this you assess this 1956 had right foot amputated 1957 had ear operated on for earisipulus 1958 had torso annexed 1959 had head amputated 1960 toenails trimmed and you know what youre going to do youre going to get some reactions on the needle there will therell be reactions on the needle because you are listing list of engrams you dont want engrams you want times when he was walking straight up apparently his own boss and he said school thou shalt not anymore house my sacred portals and so he went he did why he was going on ship from pernambuco to liverpool and it stopped in bermuda and although his ticket was paid he got off why you get the idea the kind of change he decided to go he decided to do something and behind each one of these things you will find major problem in the hidden confusion and that is the plot you are trying to solve so why list anything else but the selfdetermined change have i made that abundantly clear all right now in your problem this is where you had quite little bit of stumble we are running routine 3 routine 3 selects out the terminal of the case now some tests made recently indicate conclusively and this changes something because its very rare actually i change anything in scientology but this changes something as long as you werent running up against goals terminal and you werent pushing the person toward goals terminal or anything like this you could get away with running terminals of course but if youve got persons goals terminal you better not run any other terminal except with withholds and overts ow can be run on other terminals you can security check mama and all that sort of thing but you sit down to long grind of what about that problem with your mother what is unknown about that problem with father its this sort of thing its father father father father grind grind grind grind repetitive process repetitive process repetitive process and it toughens up the bank makes present time problem too hard to solve im giving you new datum but when you you can run terminals and we used to do it and its quite well to do it but when you have the goals terminal of the pc it doesnt do him any good to run repetitive processes on any other terminal than the goals terminal you can security check other terminals you can talk about other terminals you can move other terminals around you can find them as parts of prior confusions but you cannot run repetitive processes on them with any profit so you just ups and takes whatever the pc gives you as the problem and you fit unknown into it in the simplest possible fashion and you run it and you find itll do damage whatsoever as matter of fact it is better to do it that way than to run it with terminal sounds strange sounds like voltevis but im giving you the latest stuff now rudiments dont ever assess for terminal while doing your rudiments person says i have problem well what what problem do you have well ive got present time problem you finally isolate this present time problem and im having dizzy spells obviously the process is what is unknown about dizzy spells as easy as that you know and the only mistakes youre going to make is get too complicated theres one other rule goes along with it you dont avoid terminals dont get that idea its just well i just what was my problem then well i just thought i would go gee you know how to keep from going mad living with my mother another day well what is the problem there is it how to keep from going mad the problem living with your mother and so forth and it finally works out to be living with my mother well what is unknown about going mad living with your mother yeah all right but it is the most elementary statement you can make of the problem using the most of the pcs phrasing you know run the process he gave you now dont go over into terminals run under the line of running problem what is unknown about mother you see ahahaha youre not running the problem that is not what we want out of life at this stage of the game we want this problem flattened now in view of the fact that youre not going to work on it for the next seventyfive hours its perfectly all right to run significance oh yeah itll run the pcs havingness down but itll only run it down to the degree that youve got the rudiments out pcs havingness goes down to the degree the rudiments are out thats stable datum for you by the way if you find yourself having to remedy very much havingness for pc you know your rudiments are way out all right now is there anything else to be known about this problem yes yes one more thing that is quite interesting about problems never run stop avoid stills avoid stills ill give you problem that actually came up how to stop fighting came up on pcs report here how to stop fighting what is the first consideration there you say what is unknown about stopping fighting the better process is what is unknown about fighting you know avoid those stills try to keep the still out of your out of your terminals your levels and so forth get away from the still the prehav scale is doingness scale and you notice motion has now come out of it so avoid the stills dont avoid them in life particularly but youll find out that in processing oddly enough is what it takes to make the thing move well how to stop smoking what is unknown about smoking is your problem phrase i was worried stiff about staying home and i thought i would have to stay home the rest of my life and there i would be and that is it and that is the pcs problem well as the auditor thats your problem too how are you going to word this thing so that it is not still do something what is unknown about home assess it out on the emeter find out what you get bang on you see what is unknown about not being able to leave see thats right around on the back door see not being able to leave home try to avoid the idea that hes stuck in the house what is unknown about being stuck in the house well boy youre going to be stuck on that process from here on out see but sticking in the house wont blow remember that even while youre running the problem the theory of the prior confusion still operates and unless youve got movement in the auditing phrases you see why the thing is just going to stick and youre going to get onto an awful grind and if you find yourself grinding sometime on problem and you keep running what is unknown blank blank blank on this problem and you go on and on and on and on and nothings happening nothing is happening at all and it just doesnt seem to be flattening and there seems to be some tone arm motion but the thing just doesnt seem to be flattening and what are we going to do what are we going to do i think youd better go back and look at the phrasing of the problem that you have phrased for the pc because its probably got stick in it and its probably doing exactly what it says and youve probably phrased it something on the order what is unknown about mother not moving see thats great thatd run practically forever and get nowhere and wouldnt blow you see that its just the thing to do if you find yourself running too long on the problem process or running too long on rudiments problem process which comes up all the time not just in this problems intensive and you find this thing isnt flattening well look over the thing to see if youve inadvertently included motion in the auditing command what is unknown about your being stopped in life oh boy thatd be great you know thatd just jam the bank and itd just keep going and going and going oh there is expert instant way unless youve got the pc right in front of you to transpose it over into motion command you get the pc to state it couple of times and hell generally give you motion version of his problem take it quick before he changes his mind how to keep from being stopped in life dont you see is not motion see it still implies action see hes still preventing himself from being stopped well the preventing himself from being stopped at least implies action and that will barely run youre right on the dividing line there you see right on the dividing line how to keep from being stopped in life well its questionable you know but itll run what is unknown about being stopped in life oh that wont run what is unknown about keeping from being stopped in life oh thats very clumsy and you can get pc however phrasing it and well you know how to keep going in life thats what im saying you see hell explain to you how to keep going in life you say good well then the auditing command then will be what is unknown about keeping going in life thats good here we go and youll find out itll work out to the same process see everything goes on the stop and the motion so in putting these problems together dont do an assessment and make sure that you keep it in motion category and make sure that its as close to the pcs problem as you can possibly get the best way if it doesnt include the total stuck in it is just to use the pcs statement of the problem or use the action verb of the pcs statement of the problem or the noun of the pcs problem well how to get over being in france life after lifetime you see maybe this is the problem you know well you can avoid that very easily what is unknown about france see that gets around the stick you got the idea hes got lot of significance about this thing but there must be something unknown about it and you just use the subject matter of the thing and throw it in youll find these problems will run it requires great anything but you do have to know those two points dont assess and keep sticks out of the phrasing all right now as youre running your assessment on the p form list persons present in the confusion youre going to be doing security check on the assessed person in other words youre going to list all the people present and then youre going to do security check on the person who falls the most the most reaction rather see everybody present in the confusion what was the confusion immediately before that and he oh well soandso and soandso well who was present in that well there was mama and there was grandpa and there was aunt bessie and there was sister kate and uh oh yes and there was my father yes thats it you write all these things down and thats it now you assess this thing out and you find that you get quite bang on mother all right so you get the withholds from mother at that time and you pull these out in any security check fashion and you get him security checked on the subject of mama you know what had he done to her what is he withholding for about that thing and in that period what had he done and all that sort of thing and you finish up mother and you come back again and you say all right now with regard to that confusion was there anybody else present and you nearly will always get the hidden person that is the source of the whole thing in the hidden area you see you got the change that was the only tag showing and then you got the problem and you ran that and now you assess the person in the confusion which immediately preceded the problem and just as the confusion was hidden and just as the problem was hidden so there is person hidden in that confusion ordinarily that person has gone so the only thing i want to tell you is add to line 6 or section 6 of p add to it after youve done one security check on it lets find out who else was there in that confusion lets find out who else was present and youre going to get some jimdandies dropping out of hamper they will appear suddenly and mysteriously and the pc has not thought of them for years all right now one more thing theres need to read the meter while listing changes why would you read meter on the list that youre going to assess anyway so you just skip the meter while youre listing changes for just skip it now dont do section to in model session it is simply done you do not get any model session until you get to p and you do model 5 p in model session complete but model session in to and you dont remedy pcs havingness and you dont do anything with the pc except pat him on the back and cheer him on okay your model session starts with section p those are the basic things that have shaken out of the hamper those are the basic things which so far have shaken out of the hamper that auditors are having difficulty with doing this problems intensive its not possible to have difficulties with but some people manage it all right now the results coming through on this problems intensive are very very very very very good theyre excellent theyre hitting right on the button and its very nice so if youre not hitting on any button when you do problems intensive you better call for mama quick in hurry what you have done wrong you have probably made list of occurrences have assessed the problem for some terminal that isnt the goals terminal of the pc and are running something else and it doesnt have anything to do with the case or its been misassessment of some kind or another theres wild misassessment can keep you from getting result with this problems intensive you can do the assessment pretty bad but i have seen couple that were completely off and boy you talk about there was problem there was prior confusion there was nothing so misassessment you say is never preceded by problem oh heres the other test the person i did have test for it the person sits in present time and surmises what his problem must have been at that time if you have done the wrong assessment they do that every time they sit in present time and guess what their problem must have been during that period if you have done an actual prompt and proper assessment if you have the actual changes and youve done an exact assessment and youre dead right you ask them what the problem is they could not fail to tell you it just leaps out of their mouths so test of whether or not youre on the right run is to say to the person just flatly you just say to the personn well is this are you trying to figure out what your problem might have been during that period and the person says yes i was trying to figure that out are you trying to figure out what the problems of college boy would have been ahhahhah well thats what im doing and so you say well lets go back and assess this thing again see its that abrupt an action as youd take on it skip it because if youve got the right change and the right zone in his lifetime you ask what is the problem you say pointedly you see and he tells you boom see its an oh my god almost what do you know reaction if youve got it right on the button you see and its well i guess my problems during that period lets see what would have been the problems of young boy at that period i guess getting dressed and going to bed in the evening and so forth and so forth and you say well im going to assess again now were going to i actually go further than that id look over the list if id done the assessment id know it was fairly right and id know that he just hadnt mentioned lot of changes in his lifetime id do another section if i was getting something that crazy if it works it works and if it doesnt work you havent done proper list of changes or an assessment thats all once more just go back and do the whole thing again i mean go back to the beginning of section ask if there are any more changes in his lifetime that he himself determined find out if you havent maybe added lot of otherdetermined points in it correct the thing up as ive been giving you gen about in this thing get it going again and that time youll hit it boom hell feel like hes been run into with sledgehammer if you do it exactly right person couldnt have lifetime without having one of these or he wouldnt be in bad shape do you get the idea so the person either has one of these or hes clear if you dont find it you havent done it right okay its one of these selfproving mechanisms if there isnt black cat in the middle of the room there is black cat in the middle of the room its very simple very elementary and if youve done it right theres the damnedest biggest black cat in the middle of the room that youve ever heard of okay well ive chewed you out good bit and you realize now that there is one slight thing i will have to let you in on that every day you dont pass one of the checksheet points on your checksheet you owe an hours auditing some of you would drown at that rate so lets get going thank you okay
