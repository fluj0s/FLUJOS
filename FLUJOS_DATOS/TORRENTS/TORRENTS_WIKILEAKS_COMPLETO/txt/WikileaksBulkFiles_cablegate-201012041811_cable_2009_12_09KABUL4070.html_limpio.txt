best classified by ambassador ricciardone reasons 14 b and d 1 c summary president karzai sent most of the cabinet list to the parliament on december 19 with the notable exception of national directorate for security nds chief saleh although we judge many of the ministers are acceptable and qualified this list represents only modest upgrade in karzais cabinet talent it appears karzai chose ministers based on compromises between the wishes of the international community and the traditional powerbrokers to whom he is beholden to including dostum mohaqqeq ismail khan fahim khan khalili and sayyaf despite the promises to former president and abdullah backer rabbani karzai gave him positions increasing the possibility of more powerful opposition end summary 2 u first vice president fahim khan announced the following list at the parliament on december 19 remaining defense abdul rahim wardak interior mohammad hanif atmar finance mohammad omer zakhiwal communication engineer amirzai

thirdcountry influence if any or party affiliation remaining defense gen abdul rahim wardak pashtun he was mujahadeen commander during the soviet occupation and later spent over two decades in the washington dc area he has political connections to pir sayed ahmad gailani although some say his family has profited from defense contracts he is considered competent and cooperative with us interests interior mohammad hanif atmar pashtun he earned his masters degree in international relations and postwar development from york university in the uk he is allegedly british citizen and may renounce his citizenship if pressed by the parliament he was loyalist to the soviet unionbacked government and his leg was severely injured in an antigovernment mujahadeen attack many karzaisupporters do not trust him particularly the former northern alliance he maintains some political connections with former interior minister jalali and ashraf ghani karzai told us in early december that atmar was hanging on by thread because many powerful former mujahadeen like sayyaf and ismail khan did not trust him the british joined us in supporting him he is one of the intellectual stars of the cabinet finance mohammad omer zakhiwal pashtun he has canadian citizenship and most think he is willing to renounce his citizenship if the afghan parliament insists he is associated with hezbeislami although not the kabul 00004070 002 of 005 arghandewal branch he is close to president karzai and raised funds for him during the campaign at times using methods that are not illegal here but not in concert

president khalili we have found him approachable competent and relatively dedicated to rule of law and human rights education ghulam farooq wardak pashtun we consider him an effective minister however the press reported widely that he misused his public office and power over schools to support karzai in the 2009 presidential elections he is beholden to the hezbeislami afghanistan party led by arghandewal although he claims he longer is affiliated he is close to the president and has been an insightful interlocutor on politics water and energy alhaj mohammad ismail khan tajik this former warlord is known for his corruption and ineffectiveness at the energy ministry the worst of karzais choices presidential chief of staff omer daudzai told us december 17 that strong deputy minister would be appointed and he gave us the cv of westerntrained candidate who will manage the ministry he said some of the water responsibilities could be transferred to agriculture as another work around the establishment of national power company had already taken away some responsibilities from this position our repeated interventions directly with karzai and his supporters including lastminute intervention via mojaddedi did not overcome karzais deeply personal bonds with khan others think khan is signal to the former jihadis that karzai still stands by them despite international pressure womens affairs hosun bano ghazanfar uzbek she was supported by the primarily uzbek junbesh political party although they admitted that they did not think she should count against their promised four positions her performance has disappointed us and female political leaders her wealthy and influential family lends her political strength they own the ghazanfar bank import oil from russia uzbekistan and iran and reportedly gave large contributions to karzais campaign she may have been supported by dostum public health dr sayed m amin fatimie pashtun he is former doctor and enjoys the support of upper house speaker mojaddedi and the families associated with zahir shah we consider him one of the most competent and effective ministers he is medical doctor and studied in germany pakistan and the us he was doctor and professor in various mujahedeen and international organizations during the 80s and 90s agriculture asif rahimi tajik we find him articulate and competent but that he does not

close to zakhilwal parliamentary affairs mohammad anwar jekdalek pashtun he obtained this position due to his close personal relationship with president karzai and has proven valuable embassy contact

by leaping into locker in the hotels gym he is associated with fahim khan counternarcotics gen khodaidad hazara will remain for now although presidential chief of staff omer daudzai told deputy

and was not one of mohaqqeqs original choices his choices were ruled out because they were not qualified mines wahidullah shahrani uzbek he is the former minister of commerce and his family is from

about his advisors his chief of staff the foreign affairs minister nds the oaa the independent directorate for local governance idlg the national security advisor and the minister for urban development presidential chief of staff omer daudzai told deputy ambassador ricciardone on december 17 that fm spanta would stay on until after the january 28 london conference he implied that the current nsa rassoul will likely take his place spanta would have difficult time obtaining parliamentary approval due to his dual german citizenship his name on the list of corrupt officials given to the parliament by the deputy attorney general on december 16 and because spanta received vote of confidence in the parliament in the past nsa and idlg were not announced today because those positions do not require parliaments approval daudzai said the idlg ministry would remain with jelani popal pashtun who is considered to be technocrat 5 c it was unusual that nds saleh was not announced with the others as both karzai and his chief of staff have told us on numerous occasions that he would stay on at one point sayyaf was reportedly applying significant pressure on karzai to give the job to the previous border and tribal affairs minister assadullah khalid who is exceptionally corrupt and incompetent karzai told ambassador eikenberry that new construction ministry taking functions from urban development and public works would be created and given to the current governor of nangarhar gul aqa sherzai sherzai has indicated separately to us that he plans to stay on as governor which may be why the urban development minister was left off the list daudzai told us yusuf pashtun former urban development minister will become the next minister of urban development 6 c the parliament debated extensively whether or not president karzai had the right to divide add or change ministries without their approval lower house speaker yunus qanooni and former presidential candidate bashardost noted in the plenary on december 19 that the approval of onethird of the parliament was required to reorganize ministerial functions according to the constitution although after he received call from the presidential palace during the plenary qanooni said splitting ministries was acceptable taj ali saber karzais nomination for the new ministry of martyrs and disabled was not allowed to be presented to the parliament for this reason this used to be part of the labor and social affairs ministry analysis political debts and balance 7 c of the selections announced to date 13 of the 24 are holdovers former president rabbani was engaged in intensive negotiations with karzai for weeks but got none of his supporters ministry which may lead to stronger opposition if he rejoins abdullahs movement one unama analyst noted that rabbanis faction had tried hardest for the two security ministries defense and interior but that karzai had shown strength in keeping the two ministers in place karzai did not feel himself bound to coalition or powersharing arrangement with rabbani who clearly overshot in his postelection negotiations 8 c the biggest initial winners include first vice president fahim who delivered significant numbers of tajik voters and according to our estimates received five seats for his supporters dostum whose uzbek supporters pushed karzais victory comes in second with three positions other winners include mohaqqeq karzai split the hazara vote with bashardost with two the prestigious gailani family 25 ahadi hamed gailanis brother in law is half gailani
