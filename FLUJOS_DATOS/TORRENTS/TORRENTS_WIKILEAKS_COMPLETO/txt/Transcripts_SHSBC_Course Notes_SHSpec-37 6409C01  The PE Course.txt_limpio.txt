6409c01 shspec37 the pe course here is some data from the field of study that relates to the pe course new people hear incomprehensible words and dont return thats it that is the reason why you have fifteen people on monday who dwindle to two people on friday what has been discovered here is the act that exists prior to the overt and which illumines the overtmotivator and ow sequences before there is an overt there is noncomprehend so the overtmotivator sequence goes 1 misunderstood word 2 noncomprehend 3 belief that it is ok to commit an overt 4 the commission of the overt 5 the withhold of the overt 6 blow an attack or withdrawal this can be big or small see also hcob 8sep64 levels ii to iv overts what lies behind them critical thought is justifier lessener of the overt and therefore symptom of an overt if you ask the pc for an overt and he gives critical thought of course you dont leave it there you ask for the done having gotten that you could ask for the noncomprehend and behind that for the misunderstood word get the nattery student to find on his own before the next coursetime all of his misunderstoods in previous courses or studies and get them cleaned up someone who cant do anything about anything is reasonable about it all this is disease that civilized person gets into being reasonable doesnt solve anything you cant do anything about it so you get reasonable about it being reasonable is what someone does who cant make his goals anymore if you really find out what the score is you dont have to be reasonable you can do something about it if guy is having trouble understanding and is nattering about scientology before he has had time to find anything to natter about there is word or words in prior related subject that was misunderstood someone who has misunderstood words in field that is allied to scientology will be unable to learn scientology this is why someone who is psychologist has trouble learning scientology he could do some clay table processing to handle it or you could assign him selfaudit looking up the words in psychology that he didnt understand this takes care of the natterer in the pe course as very precise action if you get someone in the pe course who is trying to get it but cant ask him for the word that you have used that he didnt understand if the guy is simply trying and failing to grasp word he just has an incontext misunderstood word find it and he will brighten up then there is the perfect pe student who sits and nods but hasnt clue this is handled by having people give written examples of the point that you have made taken from real life this permits return flow and lets you spot the fellow who is utterly glib and cant apply the fellow who hasnt connected get him to give you list of words that he hasnt understood since starting the course take up those words and clean them up probably some other people on the course havent got them either suppose that you were offered course to teach you all about automobiles and you had never seen one but you had sort of vaguely heard about them you had heard that they travel over the ground at tremendous speeds this sow ded rather neat and intriguing so you decided to take the course then suppose you got hit with three nights in row of how neat cars are and how fast you can go in them and how intriguing they are and you never got word one about what an automobile is what makes it work or what its parts are so when you teach scientology teach it an overt against scientology is justification for not having understood some word or concept in scientology keep it simple and keep it defined as much as possible keep it familiar people like the familiar people dont like things that are totally new the public likes the old with maybe little bit of improvement not new subjects so you had better represent scientology as what it is which is the only conservative study in the field of the mind it follows the traditional patterns of philosophy religion and the mind your own interest in it may have come from your recognition in it of the philosophy of greece and rome and of faculty psychology people justify not having understood subject so they commit the overt that shows that the subject is good presentday psychologists think of man as machine psychology has stable datum perception depends on association and sensation according to the psychologist there is perception in the absence of sensation and association that is machine in the absence of someone tickling its gears and certain things making other things happen is incapable of noticing anything that is happening this notion puts conditions upon being able to perceive anything and it is not true it would be true of machine with nobody in charge but it is not true of being being does not require sensation with association in order to perceive only if person were piece of meat would this be true before i can look at field of id have to have received sensation from it and to have associated it with my childhood robot would have to do that it would have to have associative memory etc psychologists believe that man is robot when you say that perception is engaged upon by the being himself as means of communication with the universe around him and other beings you would have been welcomed by the sixteenth century faculty psychologists but you are damned by the moderns you have introduced volition volitional and nonvolitional acts you have set up the individual as seeing what he wants to see and not seeing what he doesnt want to see you have set up the whole mechanism of power of choice and you have set up the dignity of the individual and that they want nothing to do with because they in not understanding man have gone the route of the overt see earlier part of this tape pp 6612 above thats why psychiatry cuts out brains theyve got to make nothing out of man because they havent understood him and the misunderstood word that it goes back to is psychology every psychiatrist is in the frame of mind of man they are arc broken with their own subject they know it doesnt work this is where their contempt for man comes from they dominate thought in universities they teach that man is good he is just machine such philosophy became necessary when leaders entered wars that killed off thirty million people at crack this philosophy justifies the overt you have to have philosophy that man is good in order to go on committing overts so mans mental subjects first didnt bother to understand anything about man and so then began to commit overts and then employment was found for these blokes by fellows who had to have their overts justified the hitlers and the stalins man is not more degraded than he was it is just that mans mental sciences have departed from the traditional which had to do with the dignity of man wundt made his big mistake at leipzig in 1879 and pavlov and psychiatry came riding in scientology is in the great tradition of the dignity of man the ideas that we are moving along with are the traditional ideas these ideas have to do with attention perception power of choice and motivation of behavior we do not go on the basis of how wicked everyone is we just ask what these things are the idea that men are animals was always there to be bought but it wasnt until 1879 that it got taken up so modern psychology is the upstart subject modern psychology and psychiatry came from the russian and the german two groups of people who have enviable reputation for humanitarianism if the germans had just stopped with music and cameras we would be fine but every once in awhile they got careless with guns psychiatry came from germany and modern psychology came from the russians psychology is really substudy of scientology and as such it is our property after all psychologists cant even define psychology it should have its spelling changed to psycheology study of the soul so as to reflect its true and traditional meaning it is the psychiatrists and psychologists who are the radicals scientologists and the traditionalists we are the conservatives psychiatry psychology philosophy and religion and all subsumed in scientology the radical approaches have had their chance and have failed to produce results they should stand aside in favor of the more traditional approach psychology as psycheology should be seen as being part of scientology the eyes can see by putting something there to be perceived as well as by perceiving what is there learning nomenclature is equivalent to learning what is there treat the pe course as an area where people can learn the language and find out what is there to be named and students will come up smiling if they dont understand the words they blow natter and commit overts thus we build our own opposition
